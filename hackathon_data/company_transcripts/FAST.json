First off, Happy New Year and welcome to 2018. Before I touch on the quarter, I\u2019d just like to share a couple of stories. One is the conversation I had with Bob Kierlin, our Founder of Fastenal, about a week ago. Being in just finishing my second year in this role it\u2019s nice to having Bob around to share thoughts with periodically, and I shared with him my President\u2019s letter for the annual report we will be filing here in early February. And he stopped back and after reading through and he said, yes, I liked your letter. I do have a question for you though on the right hand column of the first page, I really think you should change it. And I am like okay and he said it feels like you are on an apology tour because you are frustrated with Q4. And he said, you know, what are you doing right now? Your -- Fastenal is working to evolve the business. Where we\u2019ve been ramping up our business activity, we\u2019ve been ramping up our development activity, that\u2019s relates to our district manager and our branch managers. We\u2019ve been ramping up the business to support vending at a higher level and you are ramping up to turn on Onsites and all these things require people and energy and a lot of it. And we are doing it quickly and he said you know we\u2019ve tripled the number of Onsites we have in a couple of years and we have a whole bunch to turn on, and again that takes energy to do, explain that, don\u2019t apologize for it, explain that. And that was helpful. I did modify my President\u2019s letter as a result and hopefully explaining it better. One thing you will notice when you read the President\u2019s letter, I touched a lot on the what we are trying to accomplish as well as I explained a lot about the year from the standpoint of the pretax because if you get into after tax, it starts to get little noisy, we\u2019ll touch on that later in the comments. ","The other aspect of the story is a conversation is with our RVPs this morning, our Regional Vice Presidents. In that call, 7 O\u2019clock Central this morning I thanked them for 2017, wished them all very good luck in 2018, shared with them my thoughts on the health and capabilities of our business and how much that\u2019s improved in the current year. And the excitement there is when we have financial success, career success, our customers have a good year. But I challenged them on a few points and the first one centered on gross margin. And in the last call I really felt our gross margin in fourth quarter would come in at 49 and we are about 20 basis points below where I thought we would be and if you think about our gross margin it was really - we talk about end customer mix and end market mix. I oftentimes think about it in the simple context of there is really three components, if you ignore customer mix for a second, as fasteners, non-fasteners and freight. When you move in relatively inexpensive product per pound around a large continent, freight is a big deal as well. ","In the case of non-fasteners, our largest group of products, it\u2019s about two thirds of business, a lot of noise in the summer and fall about what was going in that marketplace, lot of ecommerce change really impacting that marketplace, a lot of noise in the market, some competitors lowering - adjusting their prices and what that might mean for Fastenal. Right now non-fasteners and our non-fasteners about 25% of that goes through vending platform. So we go to market in a very different channel than our competitors. ","Our non-fastener business is growing as strong as it\u2019s ever grown, Holden would touch on that later in the call. Our gross margin in non-fastener was 10 basis points higher in the fourth quarter than it was in the third and it dead on even where it was a year ago and I feel really good about that. All the noise that\u2019s going on, all the stuff that\u2019s going on in the marketplace our team is reacting very well. And I shared that with our team this morning. In the case of fasteners, we\u2019ve seen our gross margin slip from the both year ago and from the third quarter. And really two things that\u2019s driving it. One, a disproportionate amount of growth is coming from large customers, lot of OEM fasteners, that\u2019s -- and it\u2019s going to hurt margin and I get that but part of the slippage is occurring because the fasteners are seeing inflation right now and we are little rusty on addressing that, perhaps I am not pushing the group fast enough, perhaps group isn\u2019t a moving fast enough, or maybe it\u2019s a little bit of both. We are little rusty on that. We lost some gross margin in the quarter but that\u2019s not what was frustrating me because I believe and I believe that\u2019s fixable. And I believe the things we have in motion will fix that. What frustrates me was on the freight side. And in uncustomary fashion we were sloppy on the freight in the fourth quarter. And it\u2019s a not a revenue problem, it\u2019s an expense problem. And we were careless and sloppy and it involved our distribution centers, it involved our branch network and it involved everybody that supports those two. So it involved 20,000 people and we were careless in the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s where our 20 basis points were lost. We\u2019ve always deleveraged little bit in the fourth quarter because our sales are dropping off but we did more than normal and that was frustrating me. And Bob also pointed out, yes, and some of that is because you are adding capacity to handle the volume you see in the near New Year and to support those Onsites that are turning on never lose sight of that. And but if you are being sloppy, just fix it, don\u2019t apologize for it, just fix it, so that was my conversation with our RVPs that\u2019s related to gross margin. ","Our second conversation talked about, we spoke about rent and I am talking about dollar spent on rent throughout our network. A year ago I really challenged the group and said, we need to look at dollars we spend on our buildings. And from Q1, 2017 to Q4, 2017 it can\u2019t grow, in our 50 year history that\u2019s never happened. But this year it can\u2019t because as we are migrating to the Onsite platform, as we are continuing to leverage and lean-up our income statement to be more nimble in the marketplace, that can\u2019t grow. I am pleased to say between the first quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017, the rent dollar we spent dropped $360,000. Now on the context of $4.5 billion Company that might be not mean a lot, it was huge in our business because we\u2019ve never done it before. And I challenged them to do it again in the next 12 months between Q4, 2017 and Q4, 2018, let\u2019s repeat that feat. Some of it\u2019s occurring because we are consolidating some of the businesses as we are moving some of our business in the Onsite as our growth is driving in Onsite. We are rationalizing everything we do and we are consolidating some branches. But everything we are doing we are doing to grow faster. It isn\u2019t about saving expense dollars but I did want to see if could harvest some of that because I\u2019d rather deploy those dollars elsewhere, which brings us to the quarter.","The -- our pretax earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 and for 2017 grew double digits. I can\u2019t think about a better way to celebrate 50 years in business. Our earnings per share for the year came in at just over $2.01, that\u2019s a bit noisy of a number given that we had some tax legislation passed late in the year and that impacted our income statement. As you all know, most of our revenue and most of our profits are generated in United States of America. And I think it\u2019s still just over 85%, 88% to be exact. And we\u2019ve historically paid a tremendous penalty for being a US based business in our global market place and our tax rate has been dropping over years as our internationals got to be bigger. So it creates some noise but if you look at ignoring that tax change, our earnings -- our pretax earnings -- earnings would have grown about 12 -- just over 12% in the quarter and just over 11% in year. Again, an excellent way to finish the year. ","Daily sales growth is strong in the fourth quarter, we grew almost 15%. That was lifted little bit our Mansco acquisition early in the year, without it, it would have been just over 13%. And for the year, our daily sales grew 11%. As mentioned, we are aggressively investing to spurt our Onsite initiative, our vending initiative, and our ecommerce initiatives. But we obtained good operating leveraging in the fourth quarter and for the year. I believe we can stay in this momentum as we go into 2018.","There was a little window dressing going with some customers late in the year and our cash payments just abruptly halted between Christmas and New Year and cash came in like crazy the first week of January. So a little window dressing to hurt our cash flow late in the year. I am pleased with the fact that after making a sizable investment in what we call CSP16 our inventory in 2016, we were able to lower our days on hand of inventory nominally in the 2017 and we work to do that again in 2018. That was the third item I covered with the -- our VP group this morning. ","Our share price has had a nice run in recent months, really in 2017 in general, little choppy along the way but had nice run and because of that and our desire to maintain a meaningful dividend for our shareholders, we raised our dividend as we announced last night.","I am going to page 2 of the flip book if you are following along but our Onsite initiative used to be a regional thing. It was something we were doing aggressively -- we were doing aggressively in some of our older regions especially in the upper Midwest. We were doing it aggressively in Mexico and seeking incredible growth in recent years because of it. What I am really proud of is we\u2019ve turned Onsite a regional thing into company thing. Two years ago when we really started to move the Onsites signing up, we moved the needle because instead of signing a handful 8, 10, 12 Onsites in the year, we signed just over 75 because 25% of district managers went out and signed an Onsite.","Our business is -- our success stems a lot from that group about 240 some people scattered around the planet mostly North America. In 2016, we dramatically increased our Onsite signings add about 100 to it because 52% of our district managers signed an Onsite that year. Comes into this year we have a big goal to expand that another 100. We came in at 270 Onsites because 73% of our district managers signed an Onsite this year. It\u2019s not a regional thing anymore, it\u2019s a company thing and it\u2019s moving the needle on our business, its moving needle on our growth. We have a big goal for next year. Let say another 100. Don\u2019t know who had that goal, but our stated goal right now is 360 to 385, even in some of internal meetings you might even hear us say, hey, let\u2019s go for 400 but our stated goal is 360 to 385. We have the expansion of our Onsite; we have almost 3,000 in market locations across the planet today again most in North America versus just over 2,900 a year ago. ","We signed 19,355 vending devices in 2017, up nicely from last year. The one positive as we rapidly expanded our footprint, we\u2019ve grown in a basically a decade from literally no vending machine to just over 70,000. When you do some very quickly you make some mistakes, you get along the way, and you are aggressive along the way. And we removed a number of licenses, we didn\u2019t install 10, we need really -- we installed 5 where really need 4 that kind of stuffs. Thanks we\u2019ve installed one; maybe we shouldn\u2019t install that one. And so one thing that\u2019s very uplifting when I look at 2017 is the percentage of devices what we are removing every year it started to improve. And we saw that in the final three quarters of 2017. So said another way, you can feel and think a lot faster if you turn on the faucet and you plug the drain. And we plugged up drain a bit. ","Our goal is to sign 21,000 to 23,000 devices this year. National Accounts, the group is executing at an unbelievable level. They are busy. They are creating a lot of work at branch network and they are creating the need for us to invest heavily. Our National Accounts grew 14.5% for the year, 18.5% in the fourth quarter. My compliments to the group and to everybody else in the company who supports that business. ","Finally, and it\u2019s not a bullet on the chart, our construction has gained momentum as we\u2019ve gone through 2017 and that\u2019s a really pleasing thing because in the last decade, we became an ever better company in the industrial market, we doubled in size. But our construction business in that same decade grew about 35%, that\u2019s cumulative number, not an annual number, cumulative number. We really struggled to gain footing in growth. We started to get taste as year went on. Our goal was to grow 5% I think for the year we grew around 6%, but we exit the year growing double digit. So I feel really good about what that means for 2018. ","With that, I\u2019ve overstayed my welcome. I\u2019ll let Holden talk.","Holden Lewis","Thank you, Dan. Good morning. I am going to begin with a quick recap for our 2017 results. Before moving on to discuss on the quarterly performance. In 2017, Fastenal generated $4.4 billion in sales, which is up 10.8% from 2016. We had one fewer selling day in the year so on day\u2019s basis we are up 11.3%. We did get the economic tailwind that began in late first quarter, strengthens throughout the year, however, we also believe our growth drivers have allowed us to outgrow the marketplace and I want to provide a little bit more color on those. ","For vending, excluding units in all these locker program, we finished 2017 with over 71,000 in installed machines, up 8,600 units or 14% over 2016. Signings were below our full year goal but up 7%, but at the highest level since 2013. We also saw higher revenue per machine of 2% to 3% and removables were down 4% and because of that revenue through our machines rose more than 15% in 2017. In 2018, we are targeting signings of 21,000 to 23,000. We signed 270 new Onsite agreements in 2017, shy of our goal of 275 to 300 but well above last year\u2019s 176 signings. Growth of sales through Onsite excluding branch transfers accelerated through 2018 and was up 22% for the year. We are targeting 360 to 385 signings in 2018. Lastly, National Accounts pace the overall business with daily sales growth of 14.5% in 2017. Sales for our largest customers accelerated through the year with December up 19.7% to a greater extent than last year this is achieved both through a combination of new accounts and by penetrating existing accounts. Margins in 2017 stabilized. Our gross margin finished at 49.3 which were down 30 basis points. This was largely due to products margin which was mostly impacted by a combination of product and customer mix and the inclusion of Mansco since acquiring it on March 31. ","Operating margin finished 2017 at 20.1%, flat with last year. Operating expense leverage offset the gross margin decline which was most significantly attributable to occupancy as we shut 120 net public branches in 2017. This was probably offset by the absence of vendor freight credits received in 2016 related to CSP16, increased amortization and higher legal settlement activity. At the gross margin line, mix will likely remain headwind in 2018. We\u2019ve recently taken actions to offset product inflation and the degree to which this variable affects gross margin 2018 will depend on the effectiveness of these actions. ","At the operating expense line, we think there is room to leverage occupancy further. Everybody expects some leverage over employee related expenses as growth and incentive compensations moderates. Our interest expense was up 40% in 2017 owing to higher rates of debt assumed in the Mansco acquisition. Our tax rate fell for 36.8% in 2016 to 33.7% in 2017 due largely to the discrete items related to the recently passed tax reform which I\u2019ll discuss in the quarterly recap. Excluding this, our tax rate would have been 36.5% in 2017, it all blended to a full year 2017 EPS figure of $2.01, up 16.2% from 2016. If I exclude the discrete tax items, our EPS would have been $1.92, up 11.3% from 2016. ","Now shifting to the fourth quarter and looking Slide 5 of the deck. As Dan stated, total and daily sales were up 14.8% in the fourth quarter which represents acceleration from 13.6% daily sales growth in the third quarter. Mansco contributed 140 basis points to this growth. The fourth quarter finished well with December daily sales growth coming in at up 14.7% or up 13.3% excluding Mansco. ","In terms of market tone, conditions remain healthy. Macro data remain favorable with a PMI averaging 58.9 in the fourth quarter. Industrial production growth accelerated is now rising at a low to mid single digit rate. Manufacturing end markets continue to lead with strength in heavy and general manufacturing, transportation and energy. The positive inflection in the quarter was in construction as Dan mentioned which was up 9.6% in the fourth quarter and was 11.9% in December. Feedback from the field, our construction began to improve late in the first quarter. The uptick in November and December seems to reflect activity levels catching up with that sentiment. From our product standpoint, we experienced acceleration in both fastener and non-fastener lines. From a customer standpoint, National Accounts accelerated again growing 18.4% in the quarter with our 72% of top 100 accounts growing. Growths to smaller customers are steady and nearly 65% of our branches grew into the fourth quarter, up from 64% in the third quarter or 62% in the second. We have no reason to believe that the demand we experienced in the fourth quarter has to continue into the first quarter. That said, beware that storms in the Eastern and Southern regions of the US have had a significant impact on business activity in the first half of January.","Now on the Slide 6. Year-over-year, our gross margin was 48.8% in the fourth quarter, down 100 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. We had a particular difficult comparison with the fourth quarter of 2016 gross margin having been unseasonably strong on the back of vendor credit received as a result of CSP16. We experienced a downtick in our products margin as a result of mix, inclusion of Mansco and to a lesser degree product inflation in fasteners. Freight was a significant drag in the period owing to higher payments of third party shippers, and incremental investments in drivers and equipments. On a sequential basis, our gross margin was down 30 basis points. While it\u2019s not unusual for our gross margin decline sequentially, we did expect slightly better. And I think two things are notable. First, the freight variables cited in the annual comparison fell heavily into the fourth quarter relative to the third. Second, the fourth quarter did see price cost pressure on our fastener line. This is modest in the period; however, given continued inflationary condition in the marketplace, we did initiate actions in the fourth quarter including pricing to defend our profitability. We would expect these actions to provide stability to our margins in 2018.","Our operating margin was 18.7% in the fourth quarter, down 60 basis points year-over-year. The 100 basis points decline in gross margin was partially offset by 40 basis points of operating expense leverage. Looking at the components to that, occupancy related expenses were down 1%, the largest element being the continued deduction of public branches in the quarter and to the year. Selling transportation related expenses were up 7.4%, the most significant element of that was a 17% rise in fuel primarily from higher prices for unleaded. This leverage was partly offset by the cumulative effect of small items such as lower vendor credits given the absence of a major CSP initiative in 2017, higher legal cost and higher amortization. Employee related cost were up 15.5%, 120 basis points of which relate to Mansco\u2019s headcount and incremental expenses related to implementation of last year\u2019s DOL rules. The latter of which will fully anniversary in the first quarter of 2018. The remaining increase is a function of the reset of incentive comp throughout the organization given our return to strong growth in 2017 and an increase in overall staffing. Total headcount growth was up 4.8%, or up 7.7% on an FTE basis. It all blended to fourth quarter EPS figure of $0.53, up 33.5% from fourth quarter of 2016. The quarter included two discrete tax items, a gain related to deferred taxes on fixed assets and a charge related to transition tax on foreign cash and earnings. This added up to one time tax benefit of $24.4 million excluding the discrete items, our tax rate would have been 36.2 and our EPS would have $0.45, up 12.2%. We are still refining our understanding of various elements of tax reforms but expect our full year rate to settle at a range of 24% to 26% excluding any additional discrete item that may arise during the year.","Turning to Slide 7, we generated $129 million in operating cash in the fourth quarter which was 85% of net income. We believe this is a function of the timing of receivable which I\u2019ll cover in a moment. For the full year of 2017, we generated a record $585 million which represent 101% of net income. These improvements are primarily a function of better earnings. Net capital spending in 2017 was $113 million, down 39% largely from the absence of spending on vending machines related to lease lockers. This is below our target for 2017 of 127 which cannot be attributed to a single item but just slightly lower capital spending in a number of places in the company.","For 2018, we are anticipating capital spending of $149 million with the increased being largely attributable to spending and upgrading hub capacity and property purchases for potential future expansion. We finished the year with debt comprising 16.5% of total capital consistent with last year and a level that provides ample liquidity to invest in our business and pay our dividend. Given our expectation for earnings and cash flow in 2018 and our desire to maintain an attractive dividend yield, we have increased our quarterly dividend from $0.32 to $0.37 in the first quarter.","In terms of working capital, we are pleased with inventories excluding Mansco; our inventories were up 8%, trailing sales growth due to the ability to leverage the heavy investment branch inventory in 2016 and more energy enterprise wide on this line. Overall, days on hand fell by 7. Receivable growth excluding Mansco was up 20% in the fourth quarter 2017. Accelerating growth generally and relative growth from national accounts played a role as has all year. In the fourth quarter however this was compounded by the end-of-week timing of holidays in December which caused a significant volume of receivables to fall into 2018. Payables excluding Mansco were up 34%. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter was unusually low in the wake of high CSP16 related purchases. ","That\u2019s all for our formal presentation. So with that, operator, we\u2019ll turn it over for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And our first question will come from the line of David Manthey with Baird. Your line is now open.","David Manthey","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Happy New Year. Just quick two part question here. One mechanical and one soft side. First, could you level set everyone on your FIFO accounting and how the price increases flow through P&L? I am just interested in this price increase that you recently put through if you can talk about maybe magnitude and timing of the effect on both the top line and the gross margin as it flows through, that\u2019s one. And then second, what is the main message that you as a leadership team are sending out to the field this year? And I know you mentioned a few things. I am wondering about aggression on new business and focus on value and Onsite and price increases but Dan when you had that conversation with your RVPs what is the number one most important message you would have those guys and gals take out to their team and their customers today? ","Dan Florness","I am going to start with the second part then I\u2019ll go to the first. And Cheryl [ph] or Holden feel free to chime in if you feel my answer is somewhat lacking. As far as the main message, last year talked about growing - a simple message, grow sales and grow earnings. We\u2019ve struggled for few years. Obviously amplified by the oil and gas slowdown and how it hit our business. The message this year just had one more thing to it. Grow sales and grow earnings, let\u2019s grow it double digit and then the concept of think big. And think big is about one thing we did in 2017 as we worked with all of our district leaders, all of our district managers came in for two day workshop, a day and half workshop. And it was about developing a business plan, a five year business plan for their business. And think big that\u2019s basically this, have a plan. Incorporate our growth drivers Onsite, vending, construction, CSP16, national accounts, international, incorporate that into your plan and vet your plan. Share with your peers, share with a regional -- whether it\u2019s your region or not, share with somebody else and then share with every member of your team because if you get great people pursuing a common goal, you can accomplish great things. And you can get the most out of great people and be more successful move faster. So our biggest message is have a plan and grow your business and think big about it. ","In regards to -- we are on FIFO accounting, and so our part of inventory increase for the year is inflation. I am not going to get too deep into the magnitude because I just don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves Dave but it\u2019s really a third of our business is fasteners and we are getting some squeezing there. And in some cases we have mechanisms in place that\u2019s tethered to indices as far as on a six months basis, there is ability to raise prices in an inflationary period and lower prices in a deflationary period. But we just need to be really crystal with that and I think part of the issue, so I am getting a little beyond your question, part of the issue has been we have been -- we are so wired to grow, grow, grow. And even Holden and I have conversation this morning. We are so wired to grow, grow, grow that sometimes when you are having a conversation with a customer about turning on five or seven additional facilities, you want to balance that with the pricing aspect, but our customers do value the service and what we bring, whether that\u2019s in our traditional branch model or Onsite model and\/or our vending model. And it\u2019s really impressing upon the way for us to provide that service as we need to price the product fairly. And we are doing a great job with that on our vending business and our non-fastener business in general. We are just not moving fast enough on our fastener business. So I am going to shy away from quantifying the impact but Holden, you want to talk about it.","Holden Lewis","Yes. I might just chip in Dave as well. If you recall we actually had a modest increase in prices we put in the second quarter in response to what we are seeing inflation in the channel. That really was intended to go after a sliver of the business. And at the end of the day, the amount of which price moved our revenue line this year was fairly immaterial. And we felt that it achieved a goal but it was fairly immaterial overall. This iteration now the demand has gotten stronger and cost inflation has gotten stronger, is intended to address a large slice than we had done in the past. And it\u2019s really intended to do address the same thing is to address the inflation that we see in what\u2019s relatively long supply chain in the fastener business. So we would expect that the -- without giving the details of our quantity, we expect it would be more significant this time around than it was certainly with the smaller on in the second quarter. ","David Manthey","And Holden we could see some of that impact as early as first quarter, correct. ","Holden Lewis","Yes. We would expect that we would be able to speak about in concrete terms by that point. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Ryan Cieslak with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.","Ryan Cieslak","Hi, good morning, guys. And my first question is really quick follow up on the gross margin and\/or pricing side of things. Holden or Dan, the way I think about the pricing implementation, is it give you the opportunity to once again get ahead of the COGS inflation on the fastener side or should we be thinking about this more as a catch up to what maybe you saw in the fourth quarter with regard to that headwind? ","Holden Lewis","Yes. I would characterize it as a bit of a catch up in this regard. I mean as Dan had indicated and I talked about in the script was, we did see the fastener gross margin in the fourth quarter tick down as a result of product inflation. So the group has done a great job staying ahead of it in the non-fastener side, we\u2019ve gone little bit behind on the fastener side and so this is intended as much anything else to begin to cover up some of that lag. ","Ryan Cieslak","Okay, okay, fair enough. And then Dan when you think about the opportunity here in 2018, obviously 2017 was a really good year for you guys in terms of top line. I am not looking for specific guidance but what maybe are some of puts and takes on the top line in the context that comps do get more difficult and what are maybe some of the incremental drivers and how do we sort of maybe frame up what the opportunity could be? Can you actually grow again double digits or should we be maybe tempering our expectations just given the comps gets more difficult? Thanks. ","Dan Florness","As far as the opportunity drivers for 2018, here are the things that come to mind for me, we have great momentum in our business. As I mentioned earlier, our National Accounts team is executing about as well as I think we\u2019ve ever executed in our history. We have built in lift from the \u2013 if you think about the vending machines that we\u2019ve signed that we\u2019ve been deploying late in the year or throughout the year but they have been strong throughout the year. The fact that we are removing fewer and I feel better about installed base and how we are going to grow that in the next 12 months. Our Onsites, we have record number of Onsites that we signed. I feel we have great momentum come into the year because again Onsite now is a company thing. It\u2019s not touching a small chunk of our business, it\u2019s touching the business. So I feel very good about our growth right and the couple of years momentum we have built into them and we are finishing the year strong. And I feel really good about the tax bill signed late in the year. And it\u2019s ability to list -- to lift the industrial marketplace in the United States. Industrial marketplace and I don\u2019t want to get too deep into the discussion here but let\u2019s be honest. The industrial marketplace in United States has been the highest taxed population on the planet. And we are unleashing some of that potential with the tax change. I mean I look at our business for example, I believe the S&P 500 has an effective rate of about 27% before the tax act. Our effective tax rate in recent years has been about 10 points higher than that, 36.5%-37%. And we are indicative of that example. And I believe for a lot of our customers it unleashes their potential to think bigger about their business and to grow faster and we are going to participate in that growth because we are going to help support their business. And I feel really good about that coming in 2018. And I think it has some legs to it. ","Holden Lewis","And Ryan just wants to chip in one thing from the earlier question just to make sure everyone understands it. Although product inflation was a factor in fourth quarter, it was well behind product mix, the impact of Mansco and the issues around freight in the quarter in terms of an impact. So when we say that we are sort of catching up, if you will, I don\u2019t want to leave the impression that we fall in particularly far behind. It was a fairly minor factor in the fourth quarter. We are acting because we needed to make sure that it doesn\u2019t expand as an issue in 2018. ","Dan Florness","Fourth quarter was above guidance. ","Ryan Cieslak","Got it. Just really quick on freight, Dan. Just really quick if I can. Is the freight component more of an internal or company specific element or are you actually seeing some pressure from the marketplace as well as it relates to maybe drivers? You mentioned few, how much of it is more company specific and execution versus maybe some market headwinds that you guys are seeing right now? Thanks.","Dan Florness","It\u2019s us. It\u2019s company specific. A piece of it is seasonal but that was true last year too. But when I look at the impact of fourth quarter versus third quarter a year ago, and the impact of fourth quarter versus third quarter in 2017, it\u2019s us. Because what were -- the relativeness of what we are charging for freight, relativeness of how much we are doing internal versus external, we moved most of the freight on our own trucks which is a huge competitive advantage. We still manage it well. And I am going to cut you off with that question. And we will go on for the next one. We are running a little tight on time. ","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question will come from the line of Christ Dankert from Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Christ Dankert","Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just trying to take a bigger picture here. How would we think about the pathway to profit kind of in the context of Onsite being such a key driver now? And kind of how that looks versus traditional stores? ","Holden Lewis","Okay. I\u2019ll take that one. Pathway to profit historically was about growing our average branch size and as that would happen the operating expenses drop dramatically. A branch doing $50,000 to $80,000 a month has operating expenses well into 30s. A branch doing $150,000 to $250,000 a month has operating expenses that are well down into the mid if not low 20s but mid 20s anyway and so that\u2019s really what the pathway to profit was about, was letting the inherent profitability shine through. Onsite creates challenge for pathway to profit in that your revenue growth is coming from our growth drivers, vending help our branch revenue grow. CSP helps our branch revenue grew. Onsite actually help, cause the brands revenue to either trade or maybe go back slightly. So if I have $20,000 month account in a $150,000 branch and I move that to an Onsite to turn into $100,000 customer, the branch close on $150,000 to $130,000 and so we have negative leverage going on there which hurts the pathway to profit concept. Our job is can all those other things get us back to 150. The more thing we\u2019ve been talking about in our business where we\u2019ve been closing some branches, so if we move out enough customers and a handful of branches maybe we go from 10 branches in that market to 9 which lets us claw back a little bit to pathway to profit because you got a 9 have a higher average. And so it\u2019s really about on the branch side, the pathway to profit is as healthy as ever. The Onsite creates real challenge for it but I\u2019ll take that challenge because it allows us to grow an Onsite in attractiveness business from the standpoint of our ability to grow with it, and our ability to generate return. ","Dan Florness","And one thing I\u2019ll contribute to that is if you do look at the Onsite that predate this becoming a growth driver; the operating margins are above where the newer Onsites are. And so there is a pathway to profit element that\u2019s getting lost only because we are opening so many. The intermediate term measure of success is the degree to which we use the pathway to profit to expand maturing Onsite base and to begin to refill what we took out of the branch and then they sort of go down that pathway to profit, second time if you will. ","Christ Dankert","And I guess if I could just flip through the timing a bit more I guess. Is there a way to breakout the Onsites by age then? Maybe we can back into year where you started the year where you finished the year but as far as trying to think about profitability and size, the net impact for 2018 and beyond. I mean is there any way that we kind of look at profitability by our size and then sub divisions at all? ","Holden Lewis","So we do. We have not necessarily gone down the path of sharing that year by year with investment community but we do track that internally. I mean what I would tell you is that from the point that you start an Onsite probably between call it six quarters later you are sort of where the Onsite should be in sort of steady state and then from there you begin doing the things you need to do to improve the margin you go down that pathway to profit, looking for product substitution opportunity, looking for additional volume opportunities. So that path down the pathway is probably begin in earnest between four and eight quarters after sort of the signing and that progress begins and then ultimately you get there but with these new ones since it\u2019s becoming growth driver, I am not sure we necessarily figure out the exact date that you get to a corporate margin on the Onsite business from the time you start. ","Dan Florness","We are going to take more one call. I see we are at 43 minutes past the hour, one more question I should say.","Operator","Absolutely. Our last question will come from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Robert Barry","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning and Happy New Year. I did actually one who follow-up on a comment holding during the prepared remarks about stability, expecting stability in gross margin in 2018. But that\u2019s just a price cost comment and then maybe we should layer on what has become this kind of normal 20 to 30 bp hit from next from the growth drivers. So like to [Multiple Speakers]","Holden Lewis","So thank you for clarifying. That\u2019s right. It was intended to be comment about what we were doing at pricing and it was really twofold. One to just let you know that we are taking sort of part and places seriously and taking steps to do it. But the second is we are not necessarily looking at this is an opportunity to boost our margin, if you will, right. We are trying to defend our margin from product inflation that everybody in the marketplace knows that\u2019s there. And so I think that you are right to think about in terms of -- it\u2019s intended to offset product inflation and then the other variables that are always there on gross margin are still there. ","Robert Barry","Right. So thinking about just kind of level setting a base case for 2018 it seems like prices offsetting cost inflation and then you\u2019ve got 20 to 30 basis points impact from the growth driver and so maybe that\u2019s kind of what we see. Would that be kind of good expectations?","Holden Lewis","Yes. I think it\u2019s a good place to start and then we\u2019ll try to do everything we can freight and other element but I think a good place to start is what we said before, which is every year we kind of start off in the whole 20 to 30 basis points on gross margin because of product and customer mix and when you see how faster our National Accounts are growing, international growing, the Onsites are growing, there is no reason to think that that\u2019s any different 2018 than it was 2017.","Robert Barry","Got it. And if that happens do you think operating leverage [Multiple Speakers] ","Dan Florness","We try to religiously keep this till 45 minutes because we realized its earnings season and everybody business and have other call to hop on. Thank you everybody for participating on our call today. As our last question touched on, it forces us to focus very, very intently on the operating expenses within our business. Invest wisely to support growth, invest wisely to grow faster and but manage our expenses prudently. Thanks everybody. Have a good day.

Go ahead, Mr. Oberton.","Will D. Oberton","Thank you, [Jen] (ph). I'd also like to let you know that Lee Hein, our President, is also with us this morning. I'd like to start off by thanking everybody for joining us on the call today and I'm happy to report that we had a good first quarter of 2014.","Our sales growth of 8.7% for the quarter was moving in the right direction sequentially. We had a very strong March at 11.6%, so we're very encouraged by that and believe we're moving in the right direction with adding our more selling energy in the stores.","Very sequential improvement -- excuse me -- very good sequential improvement overall in the business, but what we're really excited or especially excited about is the improvement in our older stores.","If you look at the March number of almost 10%, that's very strong. And historically, this has been a very positive indicator for both future growth and profitability. So, that's one number that gave us great encouragement.","On the earnings side, the story really is year-over-year margin. It's very difficult, if not impossible, to grow our earnings relative to sales, when our sales are in the single-digit, and our margin was down almost 100 basis points. With that being said, our margin is moving in the right direction and we're very focused on improving that.","So, directionally, we feel good about the margin. It's just at a lower point than it was last year and it made the earnings growth very difficult.","The thing on the earnings, from an expense control, everyone did a very good job. I'm really proud of the Fastenal team. The extreme weather that we had caused expenses to go up in more areas than you can imagine.","Simple things like snow plowing, you know, the fuel, all of those things, heating expenses, but overall, it's very challenging with the hard weather, but the team held tough, and we did a nice job in expense control in difficult times. And that's -- just, again, very proud of the team.","Switching to the vending area, although our signings were down, the most important number and the one we're very focused on, growth of the vending customers and growth of the number of customers using it and growth with that group of customers both moved up and so we're very excited about the program. So, overall I feel good about the current state of our -- and our future prospects for vending.","I have spent a lot of time in this past quarter visiting customers and in most cases, they are larger customers that have installed vending systems and in every case, the customers have been very excited about the systems.","They have talked about the savings and in most cases, they are actually in the process of adding more machines to the customers I saw. So, very positive. We're going to continue to move forward with the vending program and feel that it holds a great future for us.","Moving forward talking about pathway to profit, here at Fastenal, we have an old saying and the saying is that sometimes you have to take a step back to get two steps ahead. We've been saying that for about 30 years in our business and I think that really frames up our pathway to profit.","We did take a step back in the first quarter because we added a lot of selling energy in the store and we moved -- we went backwards slightly. But, we're very focused on the 23% pretax growth and the overall concept of pathway to profit.","Larger stores, average stores becoming larger and the profitability improving per store. So, we haven't lost any focus on that, although we took a step back with the energy we put in. We're still very excited about the future prospects of the profitability of the business by doing -- by having larger stores.","Looking at the -- one of our very important initiatives, the headcount, we're on track. We're up about just over 15%. We're going to stay on that track, continue to add labor at 15%, but understand it doesn't translate into 15% more labor dollars.","We're adding very heavily on the part-time side and the goal there is to bring more part-time labor to do the backroom tasks, answering the phone, loading the trucks, stocking the shelves, making the deliveries, which will free up time for our managers and our sales people to be out aggressively calling on our customers and growing our business.","The other thing that it does by focusing on the part-time help, it allows us to bring in a lot of strong people for the future. So, not only does it allow us to manage our expenses very well, it allows us to build for the future. So, two very positive things and we're very confident we're making the right moves in that area.","So, overall -- my comments are short today, but overall, I feel very good about the quarter. Not so much about the results, but more about the direction that we're going. We're moving things in the right direction. We feel very good about that.","And I believe one of the reasons that we're doing -- the direction is going as well as it is, is that Lee and his teams, back in the fourth quarter, spent a lot of time talking about our goals and really putting time in to make sure that our goals are realistic -- our sales goals for our stores are realistic for 2014. Then they spent a lot of time messaging to the stores, communicating with the stores, talking about goal and having a very simple message; hit your goal.","Some stores needed to grow 30% to hit their goal because of the situation they are n, and some stores may not grow at all to hit their goal because it's a difficult comp, something like that. And it's working. If you look at January, we were at 98.7% of goal; February, we're at 98.7% of goal. We think those goals were affected by weather.","But we came back strong in March and we hit 102.4% of goal, which miraculously got us to 100% for the quarter. But I think there's more to it than that. I think the people are really buying in. They knew they were a little bit behind. They picked it up hard in March, and they came through for the team because they understood what they needed to do and it added up.","Now, I don't know if we'll ever do that again, the exact 100%, but we're still focused on that and we're going continue to pound that drum all year because it really resonates well with the field. They understand what they need to do.","If we are able to achieve our goal and I'm not giving guidance, I'm just telling you the way we're thinking. If we're able to achieve our goal in the second quarter, we would -- our goal -- or our sales would come in just over 13%.","We believe that's achievable. It's too early in the quarter to say it is, but we feel good about it and we're working very hard to achieve that goal. And I think the people in the field are motivated by that simple message of going out and doing it every day.","With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan and then we'll take some questions. Thank you very much.","Dan L. Florness","Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody. At Fastenal, we've never been known for brevity in our earnings releases. We try to explain the business as thoroughly as we can for the outside world; plus, we find it useful for our folks internally. They get a chance to understand better and learn more about their business and where it's going.","This quarter, I think we could have had a release that was about a half page long. I think the number that matters is that first line on that first page of 8.7% topline growth. And when you look on, as Will touched on, the pages where we dissect the stores of varying ages, the fact that our oldest group of stores is close to 10% growth is a tremendous feat.","And what that really does for us, it allows us, over time, to continue to leverage the business through the pathway to profit because we're driving up the average store size, over time and our largest, most profitable stores are continuing to grow.","Sequentially, very strong February to March. January and February were both heavily impacted by the weather, as Will touched on. But a very, very solid step up to get us back to where the business inherently is as opposed to where it was getting pounded down to because of the weather.","One item that I note that's positive and there's a lot of questions as far as how reliable the ISM has been as a predictor of our business over the last several years. Historically, it's been a very good predictor; the last several years, not quite so well. But we're seeing, as we go into 2014, a continuing improvement in that number, which I believe ultimately is only good for our business.","End marketwise, last year, our manufacturing customer base, which represents about half of our business, grew just over 6% -- 6.3% to be exact. The first quarter, as we touched on in the release, it grew at 9%; in March, it grew at 11.5%.","Construction, which has been weak for -- really, it's been a weak piece of our business for a number of years, and we're not the only one in that boat. Post-2009, a lot of construction activity that had occurred for the prior decade really dried up and it hasn't come back.","We grew at about 2.5% in 2013. We grew at 2.9% the first quarter. In March -- and I'm sure there's some things going on with weather in these numbers, but in March we grew 7.5%. So, again, very solid number.","Our heavy equipment, which we've touched on in the past, was very, very challenging for us as we went through 2013. It has stabilized and we're seeing some nominal improvement in that business.","Vending, a little noise in the release this quarter because we're trying to really better define how we measure our vending units and the equivalencies, really for the analyst community and some of the work they do. Page two of the vending is I think the page that matters. 40 -- close to 40% of our business today is with customers where vending is part of our offering.","In that arena, it's close -- it's about 30% of the business, so about 12% of our business right now is actually going through a vending machine. But, it's about the relationship. And that 40% of our business is growing at close to 20% right now.","And our goal, over time, is how do we take the 40% to 45%, how do we take the 45% to 50%, how do we continue to raise that because it's a very tangible measurement of engagement with our customer. It's not about the number of machines. It's not about all this other stuff. It's about engagement with our customers and driving that growth and the stickiness of that business.","Will touched on some aspects of the gross margin. As we said on our January call, we expect it to be back into our range. The improvements really came from the fact of some of the supplier incentive programs reset.","And, we did a nice job of freight in the quarter. Not just utilization piece that comes with greater activity, but we did a better job on every transaction, number of will calls we're doing at our supplier locations, the mode that our stores are using for moving their product. Because they pick the mode -- is it small parcel, is it going on our truck, is it going with a third party? We did a nice job of improving that and those things are shining through in the margin.","Expense-wise, we break out a few pieces. Payroll -- labor expenses increased, primarily related to headcount, as a lot of folks within the organization -- when you're in an organization that values incentive compensation, you get a piece of prosperity.","You also feel a piece of when the economy is more challenging and a lot of the district and regional leadership within Fastenal, as well as the national leadership are feeling that pain as we went through 2013 and the start of 2014. But we're investing in the business because we believe it's the right thing to do.","Final item on the cash flow, first quarter is traditionally a solid cash flow quarter for us. We benefit -- it's the one time of the year where we don't have Uncle Sam putting his hand out and taking a big toll on us and so we're able to have a better cash flow in the first quarter.","With the added growth in the business, especially leaning towards the latter third of the quarter, AR grew a little bit faster than we prefer to see. A couple things that are challenging in the numbers. One is the earlier piece I talked about, the amount of growth that's coming from those customers where we have great engagement. By and large, that's larger customer business.","Larger customers have more ability to negotiate terms than our day-to-day business that comes into the store. A good chunk of the day-to-day is actually business that's almost cash. It's either coming in a credit card payment or a fairly quick payment, so there's not a lot of days there. And so if your growth is disproportionate to that population of your business, you're going to have a little challenging aspect on AR.","With that said, we can always do better, and that's what we're working to do, both on the AR side and continuing to challenge the inventory. Over time, our inventory naturally leverages as our average store size grows. We just want to get a better piece of that.","With that, I will turn it over -- Lee, do you have any comments? Okay. I will turn it over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions)","Our first question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Will D. Oberton","Hey Adam.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","I guess first of all to follow-up on the gross margin comments that you were making, Dan. It seems like the transportation utilization problems from weather were probably a big drag in the quarter. It doesn't seem to have come through on the gross margin. Should we expect that to pick up more in the second quarter?","Dan L. Florness","Well, definitely there was drag in the first two months. But one thing you have to keep in perspective, part of our issue in the first two months was -- in the case of January, we had our largest distribution center shut down for a number of days. State of Indiana, the interstate system was shut down for at least a day and a half, two days, and so our trucks weren't even running.","And so -- and because they weren't running, product couldn't get through and sales couldn't occur. But when they are not running, we're also not incurring expenses, operating expenses. Obviously, we still had the payroll to the people, but not the direct operating.","So, I wouldn't look at that in the vein you are. I think we saw the leverage that we would expect to see because we're moving. Basically every time the semi goes out, the simplest way I think about it, it has more boxes on it. It has more revenue going through it, and we're better leveraging that fixed cost.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. Got you. And then on the SG&A side, the transfer costs were a big driver of the 9% overall cost growth, should we be thinking of that growth rate as pulling back?","Dan L. Florness","You're talking about the transportation, you said?","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Yes.","Dan L. Florness","Yeah. I believe that will improve. I know -- if you think about, when it's 10 below zero, and we had a lot of that in the Northern states of the country this year. There's a lot -- we have roughly 5,500, 6,000 pickups scattered across 2,700 locations.","Lot of times where a pickup stays running, a lot of times where things -- when it's cold, all of our vehicles you see our miles per gallons drop off because more of the energy is going towards heating and getting cold oil to move than it is about locomotion. And so we'll see some improvements just because of the severity of the weather not being in the numbers and we saw that in March.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Great. And then what was your guess at the impact to -- ","Will D. Oberton","Adam that's -- now three, Adam.","Dan L. Florness","Adam, I'm going to get you back in queue.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","All right.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel from William Blair.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C.","Hey guys, nice quarter.","Will D. Oberton","Thanks, Ryan.","Dan L. Florness","Thanks, Ryan.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C.","So, I'm going to be picky though and ask about earnings leverage because now that we've caught up on sales hires and you're in the process of optimizing vending, can we expect incremental margins to rise back in that mid 20%s range if you continue the topline growth at 13% to 15%? Or do we need stronger, faster growth and a little inflation to get there?","Dan L. Florness","If we're getting the sales growth -- right now, the challenge in the first quarter and we all knew this coming in the first quarter, is the challenge now that we've been doing a lot of investing. We also have a pretty ugly gross margin comp to grow over in first quarter. I mean we were down roughly 115 basis points.","As we go through 2014, that picture changes. It's still tough in the second quarter and getting great incremental margin in the second quarter is challenging. But with the added sales number, I believe we can see attractive incremental margin as we go into the second quarter, which, to me, means I believe we get into the -- get back to the 20%s.","And then it's really in the second half of the year, it's more akin to what we would expect where that number is mid to upper 20%s. With -- and depending on the strength of the increase, the year-over-year basis gain in the gross margin, we'd like that ultimately to be in the 28% to 33% neighborhood. But definitely believe, as we go through the year that will move up nicely. And I believe it will improve in the second quarter.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C.","Perfect. Okay. And the second question is I just want your read on if the industrial economy is truly picking up. You mentioned easier compares were part of the sales acceleration and then, of course, we have the Easter shift and we have weather.","But if you put those factors aside, is the answer, you're getting a little help from light and medium manufacturing, but heavy is still tough, especially given the fastener number this quarter -- March was better, but in the quarter, the fastener number was still weak, is that fair?","Dan L. Florness","Yeah. I mean if you think of our book of business and we think of our self as a growth machine. We add selling energy into our stores to go out and sell additional items to existing customers and find new customers every day. But we have a tremendous book of business that's established right now; close to 30% of our business is OEM fasteners. A rising tide is incredibly powerful in what it can do for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert W Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Will D. Oberton","Hey Dave.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated","First of all, Will, you mentioned in your monologue about your headcount goals for the year of adding 15% people, not necessarily dollars, of course. But I'm wondering, as T hub continues to ramp and you continue to get efficiencies in productivity on the vending side, are you planning on pulling back on the FTEs at the store level, or are you just continuing to reallocate those folks?","Lee J Hein","Yeah, Dave, this is Lee. No, we -- I just put a video out to our folks talking about the fact that we're going to continue to add. And we're going to be wise about it and look at the stores and the different markets. But it does something to the sales force when they have confidence that we're not going to add, then pull back, add, then pull back. They like the fact that we're going to continue to pour into the store.","And my whole deal with this, when I talk to our people, it's why we're adding people is to maintain a high level of service and to have someone out seeking customers every day. That does something to our people and it puts us in a position to take market share, so we're going to continue.","Will D. Oberton","What we're really saying, Dave, is that, if we can afford it, continue to increase our incremental margin, as Dan said, up into the upper 20%s, maybe low 30%s. Take the rest of the earnings and put it into sales drivers. And if our stores become more efficient, we would expect higher growth rates than we historically have gotten because there's more energy our selling and less energy packaging orders.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated","Right, okay. Thank you for that. And sort of as a follow-on here, as you're thinking about 2014 and even beyond that, I'm just interested because on Wall Street, we tend to get a little myopic here in terms of quarterly and monthly data and things and I was hoping you could give us a little bit of a longer term view.","What do you think in terms of three to five years, five to seven years? How do you view the future of Fastenal in terms of just growth and profitability? I understand pathway to profit and so forth, but I mean, are there still some good days ahead of you here?","Will D. Oberton","Dave, we think the days ahead of us are as good as -- or better than, the ones behind us. When you look at the overall market and you look at our share of the market being -- who knows exactly what it is, but it's no more than 3%, even 4% if you really go crazy on it and say it's only $80 billion or so. So, we're a very small player in a large market.","We know that many of our stores can be three or four, five times bigger than they are based on their current size, so there's a tremendous amount of opportunity. We have some of the -- we have the best service in the industry we believe. We have some of the best systems with our vending, with our distribution, with our FASTCO Trading Company. We have the ability to buy well, move it efficiently, and deliver it on time, almost every time.","And -- so, we're very focused on the future. Can we grow the business at 20% every year, year-over-year? I mean, the future will tell us that time; time will tell us, but we're going to invest to that level as long as we can afford to. We know that the profitability will go up. Even if the gross margin goes down some, if you look at our bigger stores, their average gross margin is lower, but their operating margins are much higher.","So, we're not super focused on the gross margin -- we're focused on it, don't get me wrong, but that's not the real measure. The measure is way further down on the sheet, the operating margins and the return on capital. So, we believe the company will continue to grow well above inflation or GDP.","We believe the business will continue to grow above most of our competitors, if not all of the large competitors hopefully, and we believe that the profitability will continue to improve year-over-year.","And as I said earlier, sometimes you take a step back to get two steps ahead and sometimes that is caused because we make some bad decisions, like pulling back on labor too much as we did in the past. But overall, the future, we believe is very, very good.","A couple things that are going in the direction of us and our large competitors -- more and more of the industry is getting bought up by bigger companies, the Danahers and all those companies, the GEs of the world. And what they want to do is they want to buy from fewer suppliers.","At the same time, there are fewer big brands. The Stanleys are buying the DeWalts, and so on, and they want to sell to big distributors because it's easier and more profitable. So, the larger distributors, not just Fastenal, we all have an advantage in that situation and we think that we can leverage that advantage.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question -- ","Will D. Oberton","Does that help?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Good morning. Thank you. Maybe if you could -- ","Will D. Oberton","Good morning Hamzah.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Good morning. Maybe if you could comment on how we should think about pricing in 2014? I realize inflation is low; demand may be picking up. A competitor of yours put through a moderate midyear price increase. I realize you don't overlap 100% with them, but maybe give us a sense of how we should think about pricing?","Dan L. Florness","I think pricing, generally speaking is going to be pretty quiet this year. There's always some movements we'll see on the steel side of the business, on the stainless steel side of the business. But I think generally speaking, it'll be relatively quiet.","So much -- if you think of some of the things that are growing our business today, so much of it is about we have a better offering, a better means of delivery. I mean we talk constantly about the vending portion of it, but it's really on the MRO side, it's so much about, I need this, and I'm buying it in nominal amounts.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","And then maybe a longer term question, I know it's not in your DNA to do M&A, but as you look out longer term, does that ever change for you guys? And how do you think about sort of diversifying to becoming more of an MRO business, relative to being tied to the production assembly line?","Will D. Oberton","As far as diversifying, the second half of your question, we're comfortable with being tied to the assembly line. We like the MRO business, don't get me wrong, but there's a tremendous amount of opportunity, so we're happy playing in both of those markets.","As far as M&A, going forward, it's not that we don't want to do it. In the past, we have never had to do it. So, it's really about what the greatest opportunity is. If the right opportunity came along, or if we found a company that would allow us to go into a new market, we're open to that. So, it's really about understanding where we want to go and understanding what is the fastest and the most accretive way to get there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Will, Dan, Lee. How are you?","Will D. Oberton","Good morning, Sam.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","A couple of quick questions here. Actually, piggybacking on Hamzah's last question there, you called out specific deflation in fasteners themselves, is that competitive pressures? Is that commodity based? How long lasting do you think that might be? And would it get to the point where you need to really start focusing on inventory turns and protecting gross margin or we're not at that levels yet?","Dan L. Florness","Okay. Sorry, I was talking more -- I was talking generically more about the steel has, over time -- steel and stainless steel has over time some deflation and inflationary periods. Right now, everything is pretty quiet.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. What percentage of your total machines installed now are FAST 5000 machines? I know with the changing in the definitions, it's a little bit more challenging for us to get at that number.","Dan L. Florness","I believe it's around 47%. It's just under 50%, I know that, Sam. But I don't have the exact number right in front of me, I'm sorry.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And if I could sneak one quick one in there, when will store person sales productivity begin to stabilize in your view?","Dan L. Florness","Well, as we go -- right now, we're in that mode of adding around 15%, 16% FTE in an environment where our topline is growing in the 8% to 9%. As Will touched on, our goal is to get us into -- start moving us into the teens, low-teens, potentially -- ","Will D. Oberton","No guidance.","Dan L. Florness","\u2026as we get into the year. And so we're investing at a 15% clip with belief that we will move above that number as we go into later in the year, so third and fourth quarter.","Will D. Oberton","But again, I have to make clear, if you look at our labor cost, it didn't go up even close to 15%. We're adding in part-time hourly labor, and it's not -- to correct an earlier question, it's not 15% heads, it's 15% more hours.","Dan L. Florness","FTE.","Will D. Oberton","FTE. And so we're adding at a lower cost. We're managing it very well and so I'm actually very pleased with what the teams been able to do to get the labor in there without hurting expenses.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Holden Lewis from BB&T.","Holden Lewis - BB&T Capital Markets","Great. Thank you very much. Had a question for you. It looks like the fastener growth was relatively consistent with Q4, which was -- they are all a little bit better than sort of the previous quarters. But I mean of the acceleration, it looks like it's coming more from the non-fastener mix.","And I guess what I'm curious about is, given the people that you're putting in place, which is aimed at sort of freeing up sales to go out and sell, I guess I would have thought that fastener growth would have been one indication that the initiatives that you have in place are beginning to gain traction and bite.","And I guess I'm just wondering the degree to which the fastener performance is a bit disappointing and what does that say about the state of the initiatives, if you will?","Dan L. Florness","One thing you have to keep in perspective, Holden, is -- my way of thinking of our fasteners, about two-thirds of our fasteners are more production-centered. And additional selling activity, in a three or a six-month period, doesn't necessarily change that gob of business because you just can't influence enough. It's too long cycle. You can't influence it enough in the short-term.","The MRO piece of our business, on the other hand, is like the non-fasteners in that it's MRO and selling activity can improve that. That business did improve in the first quarter. I don't have the stats in front of me for that subset of the business. But the MRO side of our fastener business did improve which to me, lines up perfectly with the added selling energy in the store.","Holden Lewis - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Got you. And then on the vending machines, as you noted, the growth of the customers that use them has been going up. I was curious, are you having more success in getting sort of the $2,000 per month, or whatever it was, from customers that are putting that in place?","I know in the past, you've sort of talked about maybe you weren't meeting that aspiration. Is part of the growth that you're seeing or the improvement in that metric just you doing a better job farming the incremental revenue that you've been wanting to get?","Dan L. Florness","I think it's a little bit of each, but keep in mind that the $2,000 number that we have out there is a commitment on total business with that customer. We're doing quite nicely in that regard.","The second piece of it -- we also look at it every day from the standpoint of -- this customer, their business went from $10,000 to $12,500, so we went up $2,500. They have completely met their commitment to us of increasing their business.","But we might look at the vending machine and we say, but the vending machine is only doing $1,000 or $1,100 or $1,300 or $800 and we challenge ourselves, internally, to understand -- that machine, we believe, can do more revenue.","And when we have a machine out there doing $800, are we providing the best service to our customer? Because, if there's a bunch of coils in that machine that aren't turning, the machine brings tremendous usage, both point-of-use access availability, so it's closer to where the employee is working, and it lowers consumption.","But if we have a bunch of coils in the machine that aren't turning because we don't have the right product in there, we're not providing the greatest value to our customer. And I'd love to be in a position where we add $400 to that machine because we're providing more value.","By the way, our sales just went to $2,900 of growth rather than $2,500. But as far as getting the growth, we're getting the growth from the customer.","Will D. Oberton","And your question, yes, we're getting more, and that's why our growth just keeps moving up over the last three quarters through those customers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry from Susquehanna.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group","Hey, guys. Thank you. Good morning.","Will D. Oberton","Good morning, Robert.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group","I wanted to just ask about the 13% growth number, the low-teens growth rate that it sounds like you're targeting for 2Q or later into the year, what are the assumptions behind help from the end markets in that? Or is that really just about kind of firm-specific initiatives?","Will D. Oberton","It's company-specific. What I'm saying is that we work -- Lee's team worked very hard developing the goals, trying to understand the sequential patterns and if we stick with those, we're going to end up just over 13%.","It uses a lot of looking at our historical sequential patterns and actually, being just above those, as we go forward, or exceeding those -- not a big above -- not well above, excuse me. And that's really what it's looking at.","And that aside, our assumption in the economy is that it will get ever slightly better as we go through the year. We think it's going to improve a little bit. The anecdotal stuff and as I've said, I've been out to see a lot of customers over the last three months.","And generally speaking, there's some positive feeling with the customers about things going on later in the year. So, that's making us feel a little better about the business and how we're going to end, or go throughout the year -- stuttering, I apologize.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. And then just maybe tying that into the outlook for the incrementals, mentioning it going back into the mid to upper 20%s or even the low 30%s, how much of that is in your control versus how much is about getting help from the end markets?","If you are doing the low-teens, which is -- sounds like it's mostly in your control, can we still, under that assumption, expect to see that improvement in the incrementals as the year progresses, based on things that you're doing at Fastenal?","Dan L. Florness","Yes. And I think there's things in life that are we and you -- I mean the market needs to help, or we need to do this. It's there. Again, the really challenging part, as we look at 2014 in general, is the fact that 2013 is kind of like two distinctly different years, from the standpoint of what our fastener business was doing and what our margin was doing.","And so, as those comp changes, as we go through the year, it just makes it easier. But I'm feeling -- I like what I see when I look at 2014 for Fastenal's opportunities.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brent Rakers from Wunderlich.","Brent Rakers - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Just two pretty -- ","Will D. Oberton","Good morning, Brent.","Brent Rakers - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Two quick questions. The first one, I think your insurance costs grew about 20% to 25% last year. First quarter, they were flat. Why don't you give us a sense for how that plays out over the course of the year?","And then second question, what's your best estimate of the drag in the March month from -- or the benefit, rather, in the March month from Easter? Thanks.","Dan L. Florness","Lee, you want to touch on the March?","Lee J Hein","Yeah, on the March, when you look at it, some of it, Brent, is -- we have to be honest, was pent-up, I think, energy from January and February. Some of it's just the timing and some of it was just we had good weather.","But you've got to look at it, and when we see our stores, and our large stores and what happened, we also got an indication sometime in February with five good days, that we knew something was starting to move in the business in a positive way.","And we really saw it come to fruition in March and that's really what played out. It was a good month, stripping out weather, stripping out pent-up January and February. It was a good month for our people, and like Will said, great direction for the rest of the year. ","Will D. Oberton","I think one other part that gave us some confidence in February is that when we looked at our February results, the areas of the company that hadn't been hit -- south of the Mason-Dixon, basically, because the weather on the north hit us all the way from Seattle to Boston. It covered the country.","But the south was pretty clean. And with only one exception, every region in the southern part of the United States hit their goal, and across the south, Fastenal exceeded their goal. So, we had confidence that our selling energy was working. And then March just brought -- proved that out when the weather cleared up, the regions in the north hit goal, so they came back.","So, it was very clear on a map to see what was going on and that let us look. As far as Easter itself, we gain a couple million dollars by Good Friday being out of there. It always changes, depending on where it falls in the month. It's a really difficult thing to measure exactly. If Easter falls early, it's easy, and so it's trying to figure that out. ","Dan L. Florness","Your other question about insurance, if you look at our insurance numbers, and I assume you're pulling numbers out of the K, there's really two drivers of that, two components. One is health insurance, and that's the majority of our dollars.","I don't have it in front of me, but I'd suspect its 75% to 80% of our dollars, and the rest is general insurance. I think if you look at 2013, the commentary on the delta from 2012 to 2013 is more of a statement about 2012 than it is about 2013, as far as what it means going into 2014.","Obviously, we saw some -- our nation is seeing some, let's just say, turmoil, in the health insurance side of the arena. And we've seen sizable growth in there. Being a large employer, there's a lot of tax components that were added to our expense pool, added to our employees' costs over the last several years and 2013 got a full dose of that.","I think the delta from 2013 to 2014 will be a little bit more muted, partly because it's maybe a little bit quieter, not a lot quieter, but a little bit, and partly because of the manner in which we're adding headcount right now, primarily through the part-time arena.","As it relates to the other side of the insurance, the general, the only thing -- the biggest component for us on that over time is the workers' comp and the fact that we have 6,000 vehicles on the road. They are backing in to a lot of loading docks by a bunch of 20- to 30-year olds.","And so, we get a lot of minor fender benders. And if we do a good job managing that over time, we can manage that expense quite well. The workers' comp, actually, some of our distribution automation over the last several years is actually improving that trend.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Kwame Webb from Morningstar.","Kwame Webb - Morningstar","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks so much for taking my call today.","Will D. Oberton","Good morning.","Kwame Webb - Morningstar","I just wanted to retouch on the topic of vending. I know you guys kind of took the pedal off the metal there just because you felt like you weren't getting the assortment right. Where are you guys on sort of the timeline for figuring that out, making sure that you're getting the economics you want, as well as making sure the customer is getting the benefit they need? Do you feel like you've really cracked the code by now?","Will D. Oberton","I don't know if I would say we have cracked the code, but we have made tremendous improvement. We understand the mix. Our throughput through the machines continues to grow, and we believe we're going to see improved signings.","But back to the 2012 numbers, it will roughly take us a long time, if ever, that we get back to those types of signings. When we talk about it internally, we say if we had 15,000 quality signings a year, that would give us tremendous growth through our business and we would take share at a rate that no one else is doing.","So right now, without just having a specific goal, we're pretty comfortable where we were in the first quarter with our signings, because with a little improvement, we'll get to the 15,000 quality signings and then we'll grow from there.","And we'll be able to manage it. It will not overwhelm the stores. They will be able to manage that and still go out and grow their other business, their construction, their MRO and all the other things they are doing.","And the message that Lee is doing a great job putting out to the team is, it's about profitable growth. But to maintain that profitable growth, you probably need to add some new customers, you need to add some vending and you need to do some other -- use some other initiatives that we have. If the managers understand that and focus on that, I think we'll continue to hit goal and grow our business profitably. Vending will be a pretty big component of that.","And we just continue to get better -- our packaging, our costs. I was looking at some product lines that are predominantly vending product lines in the reports, quarterly reports and there's just tremendous growth in so many of those. A lot of them are personal safety things, like gloves, dust masks, things like that, that fit so well into that system.","Operator","Thank you. And we have run out of time for questions.","I would like to turn the conference back to Fastenal for any concluding comments.","Dan L. Florness","Thanks. Similar to prior quarters, again, we thank the folks attending this call, our employees, our shareholders and the analyst community for your continued interest in Fastenal. And our annual meeting is coming up here in week and a half. We invite those of you that are able to attend to attend.","And in case you might have missed it, last night, we announced our second quarter dividend of $0.25. That will be payable during the quarter. With that, everybody have a good day and a good weekend. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Go ahead, Mr. Oberton.","Willard D. Oberton","Thank you, Ellen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our third quarter 2013 conference call. Thinking about the quarter, overall, I would consider that we -- or I believe that we had a good quarter considering the environmental -- excuse me, the challenging environment that we're into. I need to get warmed up here.","Starting out with sales growth. Sales growth came in about where we thought it would be for the quarter. On a sequential basis, we showed improvement over our historical numbers in 2 out of 3 months. July was a tough month but we came back nicely in August, had a good growth month in September. And 3 out of the last 4 months, we actually had -- we're over the sequential pattern that we look at the historical pattern. So we're moving ahead nicely although there are still low growth numbers in the high single-digit -- mid- to high-single digits.","On the margin, we had 51.7%. We were very disappointed with the margin. But saying that, I do believe the team is doing a very good job and they're working very hard on the margin. There are several factors that weighed in to this quarter's margin and are weighing into the year that I'd like to talk about. The first, in no particular order here, our slow growth in fasteners. Fasteners has been a difficult market this year. We've seen basically no inflation in the product, and we've had very slow growth in the product line. And it's historically -- or it is the highest margin product that we sell. We had growth of 1% in the quarter. So that's hurting, so it's a mix issue. On the other side of that, our non-fastener products grew about 12% roughly, and they're traditionally lower-margin product so there's a mix issue going on there.","Another mix issue that we're facing right now is customer growth. We're getting better-than-average growth or better growth out of our large customers and slower growth out of our small customers. And the larger customers, again, are the lower-margin customers; smaller customers, producing the higher margins. So we have that going on. Another thing that we're seeing in the market right now, and I've actually spent a lot of my time traveling over the last 2 months, I spent quite a bit of time traveling to customers, visiting with customers on many issues, and our customers are becoming more creative everyday in pushing for lower prices and better deals. And if you look at the first and second quarter reports of the industrial companies, many of them are hitting their numbers but they're not doing on the top line. They're doing it by squeezing on the bottom line. My guess is that's going to come true again this quarter, and when that happens, company like ourselves, like Fastenal and our competitors, are the ones that are helping support those lower operating costs. So the customers are pushing us very hard, and many of our competitors are responding to that just as Fastenal is. So if you look at the margin on a macro view, our fastener growth is not doing well. Our non-fasteners or lower-margin products are growing faster. The large customers, up; small customers, not growing as well. And then the pressure, just the competitive pressure's out there. Putting that all into perspective, I think 51.7% is probably, yet disappointing from where we thought we would be, a very good effort by our Fastenal team.","On the expense control side, I think Lee, Dan and the team or their teams are doing a very good job. They seem to have a great handle on what we can afford to spend, where to put the money, and they're making the right investments in managing our expenses very well, not just this quarter but over a longer period of time. I'm very happy with what they're doing there.","Another area I want to talk about is vending. But before I go on to the vending performance for the quarter, I just want to clarify a point that I made last quarter. And I know it was misunderstood by some because I've had several questions on it. I do not feel that we have overinvested in vending. I believe that we under-invested in supporting vending because several people, when I talked last quarter and said that we were pulling back the pressure a little bit, they took that to believe that we are overinvesting, and that's not true. If we had the people in place in the stores, we would be pushing harder than ever on vending, and we still believe it is a fantastic way to deliver product to our customers. It's a more efficient vehicle -- system to deliver product and provide a high level of service. So our goal is when we have better staffing in the stores, and I'll talk more about that in a minute, we plan to introduce new incentives, basically, in the early part of 2014 to the vending program with a goal of ramping up the signings in 2014. So it's really about get the people in place and then put the hammer back or put a little more selling power back into the vending program. And if you look at the numbers, you'll see that we still have good growth in the vending customers, just over 15%. Not as good as we are doing, but compared to almost any other measure that you see for industrial customer growth with us or any of our customers, it's about the best number out there. So we're very happy with the program. Although the signings were down from where we want them to be, we believe we're moving in the right direction. And one comment on the signing, just a side note, it wasn't -- it has dropped, as you saw, but that is a very natural number. It's a number that's coming without putting a lot of pressure on our field. That's a number that's just happening because it's a great system, not pushing it very hard.","On a positive note, we have made very good progress on adding additional support into our stores. On a quarter-over-quarter -- or quarter-to-quarter basis sequential, we've added 4.6% more FTE, which puts us on track. Our long-term goal was to be at 15%-plus or around the 15% number. So on an annualized basis, we're slightly ahead of that but we do have some ground to make up. So we are making good progress. Reports from the field is that it's hard to find the right people. But if you work hard at it, they are out there and there are a lot of good people looking for great opportunities. So as a company, we are very focused on growth. That's what we're talking a lot about. And I believe that we are taking the right steps to make this happen over the next several quarters.","With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan to give you some more color on other areas of the company. Thank you.","Daniel L. Florness","Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody. And I also want to thank you for joining in on Fastenal's earnings call today. Just want to touch on a few items. The store headcount, we go through quite a bit of discussion of stats, probably sometimes you might argue too many, but on Page 11 of our release goes through stats of headcount in various pieces of the business. And some things that I think are worth noting, as Will touched on, we added just over 400 people to the store -- FTE to the store in the fourth quarter, 4.6%. One thing that probably isn't as well-known is in addition to supporting our store, because really what we're doing is -- our goal here is we want to support every store, every vending machine, every key account, and grow our business. And in addition to the headcount we're putting into the store, we're adding resources behind the store to support the sales and leadership -- the sales leadership of the store. And that is we went from having just over 220 district managers throughout our organization, and we added 50 during the quarter. And so those are folks that are stepping in to expanded roles, reducing the number of stores per district manager to put more selling energy, more attention on each and every store every day, every week of every month.","In addition, we expanded our regional VP pool by 3, went from 18 to 21 during the quarter. So we put in a lot of selling energy to support our store, again, it's all about supporting every store, every vending machine, every key account, every day, week and month. There is -- reading through the analyst reports that have come out during the course of the month, I think this is generally well understood, but I thought I'd just touch on a few aspects of the quarter from the standpoint of calendar.","July, as Will touched on, weaker daily sales growth number. One thing to always point out, extra business day in the month. And with July 4 being on a Thursday versus -- with that 1 orphan day, that really negatively impacted that month. Rest of the month played out very much as expected, so seeing some good trends. Also we had in our sequential pattern 2 consecutive beats. August and September, we beat the historical pattern. We haven't had 2 consecutive beats since the spring of 2011, so if you're looking for some positives, that's the biggest positive in our release, is that there's some positive trends going on.","The ISM index, I'll be honest with you, it makes me scratch my head. It's been positive -- it's been plus 50 for 4 months, starting in June. It's been in mid-50s for the last 3 months. The ISM historically was a pretty good indicator of our business as far as trends. It tended to lead the industrial distributors in general by about 3 or 4 months. Since spring of 2012, that relationship, in my opinion, has been broken. Given what we're seeing with the strong ISM right now, I hope that old trend returns, and it is positive from what we see going into the tail end of this year and into the early part of next year but hope is in the strategy. Our strategy is putting energy into the store to grow our business and it's about growing our top line.","FAST Solutions, I would echo Will's comments. Without the pressure on every day, we saw a natural number emerge and the energy in reinforcing that as we go into 2014 will be strong. One other thing that occurred during the quarter, and there is -- I know there are some knowledge of this out there just from the standpoint of discussions on previous calls, our THUB facility turned on, on July 22, started picking product for our first store. Currently, we have 15 districts that are live on the system, and we are rapidly rolling it out. And the concept of THUB is a centralized facility located in the Indianapolis, adjacent to our Indianapolis facility. And it is picking products for our vending machines. So it's a highly automated, highly efficient picking area, where we are picking and containerizing a shipment to the machine level that goes out to the store. This will free up a tremendous amount of time at the store and probably it's more important than our FTE growth right now as far as the energy it's creating at the store, when you look at the next 12 months. I don't want to discount our FTE growth because that's a huge plus, but this really doubles down on that, and since we're adding available selling energy into every store. And this will be rolling out over the next 6 to 9 months and a lot of that in the first part of that timeframe.","Profit drivers, 22% pretax in the quarter. I think very good performance given the fact that earlier in the year we had the added impact of gross margin expansion. We really didn't have that, so we really had to rely on what's our gross profit dollars, what are they are growing. Our gross profit dollars grew about 7% in the quarter. They grew about 6.6% in the second quarter. And so very proud of the fact that we produced a 22% pretax in the quarter.","Gross margin, as Will touched on, I don't want to beat a dead horse, it's a tough market out there. A very competitive landscape. Product mix continues to challenge us. Within the product mix though, we continue to eke out month by month, day by day, additional progress in our private label products. We refer to them as exclusive brands. And vending is a big piece driving that. And that's a piece, that's a wave that's coming through, again, vending is a big driver of that.","Operational working capital, as you saw in the second quarter, we continued to generate good cash flow. Year-to-date, for every earnings dollars we have generated, after paying for working capital needs, we have $0.90 left over. After paying for capital expenditures, which are significant this year and next year as we've discussed in the past because of our vending initiative, because of our distribution automation initiative, after paying for all that, we still had 50% of earnings year-to-date left over in free cash flow, very powerful reflection of the pathway to profit and where that positions our business for investing into the future. Most of you probably saw last night, we announced our fourth quarter dividend consistent with our third quarter dividend, $0.25. And the takeaway message I have is grow the business, grow profitably, step back and look at your return on assets. Will touched on earlier the fact that one of the gross margin challenges is the mix. One thing we always have to take a step back, and Bob Kierlin reminds us this every time he talks to us, it's about your operating margin and your return on assets. Sometimes the optics are the gross margin is struggling a little bit because of the product mix, but if we're managing the expenses below that and we're generating good operating margins and a good return -- or I should say a great operating margin and a great return, that's going to make you successful long term. With that, I'll turn it over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel from William Blair.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So on the last call, you talked about average daily sales growth potentially improving back to a double-digit pace at some point during the next few quarters, and this was primarily based on adding sales FTEs, which it sounds like you're on track for that. But then if I also start to look at the -- if you have the normal sequential math, which you had the last 2 months, this also implies that average daily sales could start to pick up from here. So I guess I'm wondering is there anything you see out there today that would change this outlook.","Daniel L. Florness","No.","Willard D. Oberton","No.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Care to elaborate anymore or...","Willard D. Oberton","The market doesn't seem to be changing a lot, Ryan. I mean, it's a soft industrial market. We don't believe it's getting any worse. We don't see signs that it's improving, but our attitude internally is we have to deal with the environment out there and go take share, and we're adding the people. Our comps in October are softer than September. So we have good opportunity to improve our growth nicely in October and going out through the rest of the year setting ourselves up for a stronger first quarter.","Daniel L. Florness","The only thing I'd echo in on that is if you think of trends going forward, we're adding selling energy, we're adding vending quality to the organization. And I don't know if this third one will be -- will prove indicative or not, but the ISM is improving.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Right. Okay. And then on gross margin, I understand the mix headwind but I guess I'm wondering if you believe further sales re-acceleration might come at the expense of gross margin unless the macro improves. What's kind of the outlook there?","Willard D. Oberton","No, we don't think that our gross margin is -- results are a reflection of our hard push on sell -- or on sales. I really believe it's the normal environment that we're in. We were probably overly optimistic going in. So we're still confident or comfortable with our 51% to 53% range, and believe that's what we have to work or that's -- we have to try and stay in that range. We see nothing that would push us out of that. And if sales really took off, could it affect our margin, yes, but we'd be happy with that problem. I mean, if we had unusually great sequential growth. We're not pushing so hard to reduce it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is just on the production side of your business, you guys highlighted mix as a negative but also some competitive pressures. I'm just curious if you're seeing any impact of some of your larger publicly traded peers getting more aggressive on the manufacturing end market side, particularly on production consumables. Any sense of -- I realize the market is big enough for a lot of players, but just any sense of is that leading to increased competitiveness in the industry? Any thoughts?","Daniel L. Florness","I think the competitive aspects we're talking about really relate to more what the -- our customers are expecting and asking of us more so than what competitors are doing. Other than the fact that we're all -- we are all reacting to the competitive marketplace. But it's really being driven, I think, not so much by everybody else taking shots at us. It's really being driven by what customers need, because if -- we're squeezing our expenses tremendously as you can see when you look at our operating expenses. Our customers are doing that too, because in the absence, as Will mentioned, of sales growth, I need to squeeze profit if I want to get profit growth -- expenses to get profit growth.","Willard D. Oberton","And we're seeing that from the large public companies. We're seeing it from the small private companies. Everybody is out to keep the business they have and try and grow the business the best they can. And I agree completely with Dan, it's customer-driven and we're all reacting to the pressures.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. And just a follow-up question on the vending. Clearly, you're taking a more measured approach on the vending side. Could you give us a sense of maybe what inning you are in terms of moving towards higher quality vending? I'm trying to get a sense of out of your installed base in vending, what percent of that do you really need to prune? How much is low quality in that installed base? Any sense of that?","Daniel L. Florness","I don't know if we know the quality answer yet, Hamzah, because one of the things that we're seeing, and I touched on earlier is that the THUB rollout -- the quality is not about THUB. I don't want to confuse the issue. THUB is about efficiency behind the scenes. But some of the steps our stores are taking to implement THUB support expanding the quality, in addition to what we're doing with our vending improvement program. For example, looking at the activity of the actual machine and are there tweaks you could make to it. I go to our warehouse or I go to a place with a lot of younger folks, and you might see, in a soda machine, 5 out of 6 offerings are Mountain Dew. It's because that's what's turning that machine and that's what that marketplace wants. Even though I don't want Mountain Dew, I'll take the Dr. Pepper, but Mountain Dew is what's being drawn. It's taking a step back and looking at the machine and saying, what coils are really spinning on this machine for the replenishment from THUB, but that also optimizes the machine. So I think after we get THUB turned on and we've had the opportunity to optimize more of our machines, we've had our vending improvement program in place for a longer period of time, I think at that point in time, we'll be able to take a step back and say, you know what, here is the portion of the machines that were sub-optimal 6 months ago, and here's the portion that still are, and we need to scratch our head a little deeper on those. But it's a small, I believe, a small subset. The machine is just a better way of delivering products. Where we have issues is we have too many machines relative to the customer. I think that we'll run into more than we have a machine where it doesn't belong.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First, I was hoping you can discuss the impact to date of your full-time equivalent additions. Have you seen measurable improvements in stores where you added them? And then also if you could talk about the success you had in pulling back and asking customers to make good on the commitment to add an incremental $2,000 per month per machine? You talked a little bit about optimizing the machines but I understand that some of those are -- they're not operating at the level that customers had committed to. So could you talk about those 2 growth drivers?","Willard D. Oberton","On the first one, Dave, as far as the improvement of adding people, it's too early to tell. But if you look over a long period of time, we know when we have more hours, our businesses grow faster. So it's very straightforward. On the -- we've had very good success ongoing to visit the customers on the $2,000 per machine. And I don't know the exact percentages, but it's a very low percentage where we've decided to take the machine out. In most cases, it isn't about the customer giving us other business which we would like. It's about resetting the machine so that we have the right product in there. Dan mentioned that with his Mountain Dew analogy. It's really about looking at the customers needs and understanding what we should put in there. And our vending team who runs the system has developed some very good software to look at what's spinning and what isn't, or what's falling out of the machine and what isn't. So they have good analytics to go to the customer, identify what we need to put into it. And most customers want that conversation because if they don't use the machine, they don't save any money, and they don't run their plants as efficiently. So we're going down the list. We continue to see very good progress, and the quality of each machine continues to rise, basically, on a weekly basis. The team has done a very good job.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of this -- the emphasis on shorter cycle sales efforts, sort of unclear what the impact there was on growth. But it seems like you cited that it had a negative impact on gross margin, clearly. Could you put that in the context of the price guidance system where you've had such good success year-to-date? It seems like it overwhelmed the benefits that you had there, and I'm just wondering do you expect future improvement in sort of that underlying gross margin exclusive of mix.","Daniel L. Florness","On the last part of your question about gross margin, I'm going to shy away from answering that. We're going to hold to the 51%, 53%, and the fasteners move a little bit and half of this discussion goes away. And -- but in regards to the shorter cycle sales, to me, the best indicator I can point to of everything we're doing, going after some shorter cycle sales, going -- having some of our national accounts folks work in stores, the FTE we're adding, the district manager energy we're adding, if you look at all of those things, I go back to the sequential patterns. In the sequential patterns, we've now strung a couple of months together where we beat the pattern -- beaten the pattern, excuse me. And there's positive energy going into that. Since -- I don't know if I touched on this earlier, if I did, I apologize for repeating myself, it must be because I'm almost 50 years of age.","Willard D. Oberton","Next week.","Daniel L. Florness","Moving in a little bit. But if I look at it since May, and I'll probably lose the group with this comment. Since May, we've beaten 3 out of 4 months in pattern. And if you look at the delta, the -- if we beat the pattern by 0.5%, missed the pattern by 0.5%, cumulatively, our beating is giving us 0.5 point of lift. In the last 2 years, from May to September, we were down about 0.2% or 0.3%. So we've gone from negative. In 2011, it was negative, and that was the stronger year. 2012 it was negative, and that was a negative year. In 2013, if you look at the sequential beats and misses since May, we're up 0.4% and we've beaten 3 out of 4. I think all those tied together, the focus on just grow the business is impacting our business.","Willard D. Oberton","And, Dave, I didn't mean to indicate that our short cycle sales are affecting our reported gross margin. I'm not saying they are or they aren't. But I really think our gross margin is more about the 2 mix-related issues and the customer pressure for them trying to hit their bottom line. Like I said in the last 2 quarters, every industrial report I read was \"short on the top line, we did a nice job on expense control\", and that affects all of us, us and all of our direct competitors.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions. First off, I noticed that your store count expectations -- or the store additions were trimmed on the high end, now 55 to 60 instead of 55 to 80 before. Are you rolling those into next year? Or what's the reasoning behind the trimming there?","Daniel L. Florness","Yes, I think the reason for the trimming is we're now 9 months through the year and we have a better idea where we're going to finish at. And so you narrow the range down. There's nothing more than that. And then we also indicated a starting point range for next year. And I don't think either one of those are horribly surprising.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Secondly, Will, you mentioned that you're looking incentive-wise to create an environment where you may be ramping up the vending signages next year. Could you quantify that in terms of what goals or reasonable expectations might be for installs, both from the FAST 5000 machines and otherwise?","Willard D. Oberton","Well, on the overall number, our goal would be to, 2014, we'd like to get to the roughly 2,000 per month signing. We think that's a good number. And so that's what our incentives are going to designed to do. It's too early to say whether we're going to get there. But if you look at the fact where basically we've signed 18,000 without putting any pressure on based on last quarter, it doesn't take a lot more energy to crank that up. We think that we have some built-in energy when THUB is up and running because right now, if a store is struggling to serve the machines because it's a lot of work packaging the product and filling the machines, there's a reluctance to go out and sign more machines. And I talked to a group of managers this week about the very subject. So if we can get THUB up and running the way we believe it will, we reduce the workload at the store, the stores see, \"Hey, this is pretty good business\", they're going to go out and work harder to sell them, and they're going to have more time to work harder to sell them. So based on that, based on a little incentive, right now, looking at the year internally, we're saying, \"Hey, we'd like to get the number up around 2,000 machines per month\". We signed 23,000 to 25,000 or 22,000 to 26,000 for the year. That gives us great growth. It's very manageable and it doesn't overload any particular area of the company as far as stores and regions.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And, Dan, if I could sneak one more in if I could. I noticed your accounts payable, this might be nothing, but it's spiked and I was wondering if perhaps you were building inventory late in the quarter as a result of why that was the case?","Daniel L. Florness","There's a few things driving that. One is the timing of some of the inventory spend. We were building some inventory. Some of that is inventory is going in to THUB. Another one, which is a relatively minor event but it's still meaningful dollars is we changed the organization we use for processing our fuel cards in our vehicle fleet and their cut off is 5 days earlier in the month. So there's an added accrual in there for some fuel that's more mechanical than anything. The third one is all the distribution stuff we're doing, there's a piece of that sitting in accounts payables in the quarters and it will be paid out here in October. But nothing horribly meaningful other than that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","I was wondering on the fastener mix, the business really hasn't been growing too much. And it sounds like there has been some added pressure to try to increase the company's sales there. I'm just wondering how you think you're doing from a market share perspective on fasteners overall. And then where you think, over the medium-term, where that settles out in terms of your mix as you've been addressing non-fastener products more aggressively?","Willard D. Oberton","Adam, it's hard to understand because there's not a lot of data out there. If you look at the fastener index that BB&T uses, that Holden Lewis sends out. Holden, you're probably in the call, thanks for that. It shows that fasteners are in a pretty tough spot. I think it came out at 46 and change, with 50 being the center point on that index, very slow growth. And our purchasing, director of purchasing and the person who heads up our fastener initiative just came back from Taiwan, which is -- China and Taiwan, about 3 weeks ago, and I met with them. And they said that the factories that we support very heavily are very slow. The U.S. imports coming out of Asia are at a very, very low level, which tells me demand is slow, the fastener index from Holden tells me that demand is slow, and we know that there's no inflation in the product. You put all those together and it says we're probably doing a little bit better than average with our fantastic 1% growth, sarcastically. But we are working very hard at it. We have a lot of small projects and medium projects. Things we're working on, better bin stock technology, doing a better job of culling on the large customers. Lee has implemented some new quoting tools, or his team has. Tools to speed up the process to try and turn an inquiry into an order. We had kind of slowed that down with price guidance. They recognized that. They developed some software that the store managers, and I, again, spent a lot of time with store managers this week, are high-fiving us for doing this for them, and I get no credit. But -- so we're doing a lot of things to speed that up. And we're pretty confident that we're going to start taking share when that opportunity per share growth comes back.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then just a follow-up. Could you talk about where we stand with the metalworking initiatives, are the trends getting better or worse? The overall...","Willard D. Oberton","Yes. Well, the trends are slow. In the quarter, we grew our metalworking by just over 10%, basically, a little -- almost double where the Fastenal growth is. Metalworking is a tough area right now. Two-year pattern, we're up 37%. So we had a great first year, it slowed down this year. But we're still very motivated and believe it's a great opportunity for us. Based on what we're hearing from industrial -- or industry data, from other competitor data, metalworking may be one of the toughest areas out there right now. And we're still growing the business at 10%, off a pretty good base. I mean, we're not huge, but it's a nice piece of business for us, and we're still very optimistic. I believe the team is doing a nice job of growing that business.","Daniel L. Florness","Year-to-date on that, we're up about 13%.","Willard D. Oberton","Okay. Yes, I didn't have that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Baliotti from Janney Capital Markets.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","You guys have pointed out the correlation you've had or sequential pattern with ISM, and you pointed out that fasteners have been growing a little bit slower than you think you had hoped. And I was wondering, do you think that all the points you -- that, Will, you mentioned about the headwinds and tailwinds to gross margin, do you think that customers are still pruning their inventories? Because ISM picked up quite a bit in the third quarter versus the second quarter in every one of those months. And I'm just -- I'm wondering given your high correlation to that, do you think that maybe they're just working down some inventory in the short term?","Willard D. Oberton","No, I don't believe that. I don't -- since 2007, '08, '09, most of our competitors have been -- not competitors, customers, they don't have a lot of excess inventory in the system anymore. They're all living. And part of it has to do with there's a lot bigger pressure on taking cash out of the business, and the other thing that's going on is the suppliers are better. We're better, our competitors are better, so you don't need as much inventory. I have been scratching my head just as Dan has over the ISM. And when you look at the -- like I said, I've been out with a lot of customers over the last few months, it's hard to find one that's just booming. And it'll be interesting to see the reports coming out over the next 2 weeks from the big industrials, but it doesn't sound like any of them are seeing robust growth. It's hard to understand where that 56 is coming from. Hopefully, it's a leading indicator, as Dan mentioned, and we're seeing it in the next 2, 3, 4 months. But I do not believe it's inventory.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Yes, it seems like it's an encouraging number because it did move up markedly from the second quarter. And to your point, the things that you've flagged about gross margins, do you think that, I guess, we should expect those to continue through the balance of the year or so if we're kind of thinking about your range, your long-term range of gross margin, do you think it's smarter for us to be on the sort of in the vicinity we are now through the year?","Willard D. Oberton","We're not going to give guidance on gross margin. But unless the fasteners pick up and unless the business just picks up in general, unless fasteners pick up, that pressure is going to stay there. If the economy doesn't turn around, the competitive pressures from both our competition and our customer base are going to remain the same. So we don't see a lot of change, we don't foresee a lot of change over the next 3 to 4 months.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just finally, Dan, you pointed out historically, the sequential patterns and how, more recently, you've outgrown them by about 0.5 point or so. And do you have any kind of feel of what we should expect that exceedance? What would you guys view as a successful delta from, I guess, historical sequential trends?","Willard D. Oberton","I think that would be called guidance.","Daniel L. Florness","John, to be honest with you, we don't know. We know what we're doing that we believe positively influences our business, and I would hope to positively influence our benchmark -- our performance to our benchmark, what we're doing with adding energy into the store, what we're doing with working to improve the vending, what we're doing to drive our key accounts. Those pieces are ultimately good means to grow our business. Expanding our district manager roles will do 2 things: a, we'd be better at recruiting; and b, we'll have better -- we'll have a higher level of sales energy in our business to support our stores every day, every week, every month.","Willard D. Oberton","And if the ISM is an indicator of future opportunity, that is going in our direction. We do have some tailwinds from that perspective.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Somebody has to ask the obvious question. All the data we've gotten before the insanity in Washington, and now we have a combination of a government shutdown, we have ObamaCare scaring a lot of businesses from hiring. And I was just wondering whether you foresee or anticipate or looking for any impact from the environment that nobody chose but we're sort of stuck with those for now?","Daniel L. Florness","We're both kind of looking at each other, shrugging our shoulders. I...","Willard D. Oberton","I'm positive.","Daniel L. Florness","I think as a nation, and I'll go out on a little limb here, I think, as a nation, we've grown a little bit accustomed to the fact that we have a bunch of folks in our nation's capital that a high percentage of the time, do things that are pretty damn dumb. And that's unfortunate, speaking as a U.S. citizen. With that said, I'm a firm believer, if there's core demand for the things that we sell, that core demand will be there. And I don't think that distraction is going to be that destructive longer term, but we don't know.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","I was just pointing out the small business optimism index is weakening. And there's a lot of commentary coming out of the small business side about ObamaCare and their unwillingness to change their business conditions, and that's an important part of profitability as a company would say. But at this point, you're not seeing anything that -- or in the plans for the fourth quarter, is that fair?","Daniel L. Florness","That's fair.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","All right. And the incremental profitability, we talked about gross margins, the cost going, which really weighted on incremental profitability that we saw in the third quarter. And from the sound of it, you expect no real material improvement in those metrics as we go towards the end of this year. If volume is good, obviously, it would be better, but at this point, the conditions you're laying out don't so much improvement in incremental profitability or is there a distinct moving inside to control cost a little tighter to get the improvement in profitability up for the fourth quarter?","Daniel L. Florness","When you're operating at a level of profitability that we are, at 22%, and you're in an environment where you're not sure what mix is going to do to your margin and we're heavily investing in selling energy, that does create challenges for us to obtain incremental margin. We've talked in the past about the pathway to profit. Our stated goal, and this was a point in time goal, this is an end mark, end place, but our stated goal was, a number of years ago, was to drive the pretax to 23%, which would imply we have another 100 basis points of incremental margin to pick up at some point in time and beyond. But again, that 23% is not a target, it's just a number. But it's really predicated on the average size of the store. And the average size of the store right now, I forgot what it was in the release...","Willard D. Oberton","$94,000.","Daniel L. Florness","$94,000. That's what needs to happen to drive that up, and we need the top line to drive that. It gets a little easier at the top line if we have a good mix of products and our gross margin is giving us a little bit of tailwind. It's good if we're getting a little bit of tailwind in the operating leverage. But we're investing in a lot of things right now. We're adding folks into the store, great investments, because we focus on long term.","Willard D. Oberton","Our main focus is getting our growth back because if we can do that, that takes care of most of the other things: pretax profit percent, all the other things. And so we have to stay very focused on that, and we believe we're doing the right things to make that happen.","Operator","And that is all the time we have for questions today. I would like to turn the conference back to Fastenal management for any concluding remarks.","Daniel L. Florness","Again, speaking for Will and Lee and myself, we want to thank you again for your support and interest in the Fastenal business and for participating in the call, and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Today, I\u2019d like to begin the call to answer the question on what is our opinion of the economy. And when I say that it\u2019s a tough economy in a tough environment, I\u2019m really centering it around five areas for us: It\u2019s non-res; it\u2019s oil and gas; ag; manufacturing; and of course the currency. And so tough environment but when I look at it given this quarter, I think it\u2019s a solid quarter of execution given the revenue number. We were able to leverage our growth of 5% into 8.9% pretax growth; we were able to raise our pretax percentage to 22.6 and incremental to 40%.","Now when we talk about execution, the word that comes to mind for me and I think many of our folks within Fastenal, is discipline. To execute, you must be disciplined. And so we put a call out to our folks to the blue team we call them and we ask them to scrutinize every expense and to reduce where possible. The reason we did this and we tell our folks over and over why are we doing what we do. And we make it very clear. And in this point, we look to reduce expenses so we could add energy into the stores. And to that point, year-over-year, we\u2019re up about 1,129 people, 910 folks we\u2019ve added in the stores; that\u2019s a 9.4% increase. And what\u2019s nice and what I want to point out here is a few quarters back our adds were almost identical whether it was non-selling or selling. Today that 9.4% year-over-year, it is 4.9 on the non-selling. We\u2019re starting again show discipline and balance and what we\u2019re trying to do in our growth initiative of offering or getting more energy into our stores, again to offer a high level of service, immediate service when needed to stay in line on these large key customers and to serve our customers on a local level.","And so the other point that I look at for the quarter that\u2019s a highlight is we were able to sign 5,144 machines compared to 3,962 in the previous quarter. And today, it\u2019s our pleasure to point out that we have hit a milestone of 50,000 installs. And we\u2019ve done this all in just over five years.","So all-in-all, solid quarter but we will continue to pour energy into our growth drivers. Dan?","Dan Florness","Thanks Lee and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining on the Fastenal call today.","We changed up the look of our press release with this quarter. Hopefully, you find it useful. We tried to really boil it down and summarize little bit better than I think we\u2019ve done in the past. Our Q which will go out on Friday, still has a little bit more than meat [ph] that you\u2019ve grown accustomed to in the past, but we felt the best way to communicate is to get to the point fast. And if you want a little more detail, we can cover some stuff on the call and cover some stuff in the general Q.","The cash flow for the quarter, I\u2019ll touch on a few things and then I\u2019ll kind of work back through the press release little bit. Operating cash year-to-date, 97.5% of our earnings, we feel good about that number. Typically we think a good number for Fastenal\u2019s in that low 90s 90% to 95% neighborhood. So, we feel good about what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re doing nice job. Obviously the accounts receivable growth really centers on what\u2019s going on with our sales growth. But I think we\u2019re doing a nice job managing the growth of inventory. There is a lot of places we have found where we can free up some inventory dollars; there is lot of places where quite frankly, we want to invest some additional inventory dollars. But I think all in all in total, we\u2019re doing a nice job managing the first six months of the year and I\u2019m confident in our ability to continue managing that in the future.","If I look at our CapEx, no surprises there; we talked in our annual report about what we expected our CapEx for the year to be. That number was moderating from what it\u2019s been the last few years. A lot of our big distribution projects are behind us with automation and a bunch of our DCs over the last three years. Our vending, we spent a lot of money for about three years, building up our vending capacity, both from the standpoint of the teams and our equipment, and now we\u2019re in more of a steady state mode and so that number has come down a little bit to better match what we are actually installing as opposed to building up a base of machines.","And so, feel good about our CapEx in the first six months of this year. Free cash which is operating minus, our net CapEx about 177 million, so about 66% of earnings, again, I believe a very good number for Fastenal. We in the first six months of this year, paid out about a 165 million in dividends, so about 61% of earnings. So, most of our free cash went to funding dividends thus far this year. As you all know, we bought back some stock in the latter half of the 2014 and we\u2019ve been busy buying back some stock in the first four and a half months of 2015. We think it\u2019s a good wise decision for our shareholders. So, year-to-date, we\u2019ve bought back about $250 million worth of stock and we borrowed about $240 million to fund it. And as a quick snapshot of our cash flow, we think it\u2019s good decisions for our shareholders short-term and long-term.","In the first page of the press release, continuing on to second page of the press release, I touched on four bullets about the business that and I am going to touch on it again here. The first one, I think Lee did a great job talking about the people side of the business. We\u2019re putting people into the stores; we\u2019re trying to really allow the efficiency of the organization between the automation we\u2019ve put in, some of the technology we\u2019ve put in, everybody working smarter everyday to minimize what we\u2019re adding outside the store to minimize the expense growth there. And I think we did a nice job of adding people into the right spots in the first six months.","Item two touches on; we\u2019ve been head hard this year by a number of factors. In here, I talk about oil and gas. I don\u2019t think there is any surprise by that. Our customers have been hit hard by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Most of our business is in the U.S. and anything that impairs the manufacturing output of this country, impacts us and the strong dollar has done some of that. We also sell a fair amount in the Canada and that business is all denominated in the Canadian currency. So, that\u2019s created some headwinds for us. I site in bullet two that we see some signs of stabilization in the oil and gas. And I want to share a little more insight what I mean by that.","As you know from our press releases and our filings over the years, we\u2019ve put a lot of emphasis. We try to really understand the trends of our business, what\u2019s going on to improve our business, what\u2019s going on to hurt our business. And if I look at the Texas and Louisiana geography within our business and I look at that business and look at their sequential patterns, so not the company numbers but those two states and look at those sequential patterns and what\u2019s actually happening in our business, the story is really different in three distinct time periods this year.","In the January and February time period, I look at history and I look at actual results, there is about a 9 or 10 percentage point delta between what history says should happen and what\u2019s actually happening. So from January to February, if history says we should be up 2% sequentially, we\u2019re 9 or 10 points and we\u2019re down 7 or 8 points. So I want to explain that what I\u2019m talking about. In the March, April and May timeframe that 9 or 10-point delta, the deficiency on our sequential pattern contracted to about 4. In June, it contracted to two in change. Now, does it mean -- I mean our year-over-year numbers are pretty weak right now but sequentially the trends are starting to move closer to normal and that makes me feel better about what it means for third quarter and fourth quarter and going into next year as far as the health of that underlying business. So, I just wanted to touch on that.","Point number three, gross profit is hit by large accounts. It\u2019s no secret that our growth has been driven by the success we\u2019ve enjoyed in leveraging this network we\u2019ve built into growing a large account business. Because for so many years, most of our growth centered on local customers, local business as we were rolling out our short network. As we\u2019ve developed that store network in the last 15 to 20 years, we\u2019ve very aggressively gone after large account business. We\u2019ve had great success there. That business does not operate at companywide gross margins. But the beauty of going after that business is we can afford to go after that business even with the lower gross profit because that leverages the network we already have in place. And so those growth profit dollars shine right through quite well to the bottom line. In fact this quarter, if you look at it for every dollar in sales, we picked up about $0.41 in gross profit. $0.40 of that $0.41 actually shut, made us way down to our pretax line because our operating expenses were essentially flat. Now that\u2019s in spite of the fact that we were adding people at a very fast clip in the last -- as we site in our release, in the last 12 months, we\u2019ve added almost 1,400 people into the organization, an increase of 7.7%. We funded that by not spending dollars everywhere else. And that\u2019s the exciting part about what we were able to accomplish in the last 12 months in my opinion. And again, the fourth point just touches on what I just said, the strong incremental margins.","I\u2019m sure there has been periods in our history where we\u2019ve had incremental margins of 40%. I\u2019d have to go back up Bob Kierlin and see it back in the 70s quarter-by-quarter, if he has that information still. I can\u2019t recall the time in my 19 years here at Fastenal that we\u2019ve done it. And so, I\u2019m really, really impressed with that.","Some thoughts on revenue growth and in the past, I\u2019ve touched on this in passing in the calls. Sometimes I don\u2019t want to get too deep into the numbers into the weeds because I\u2019ll lose everybody on the call. But I think it\u2019s helpful to understand our business. And in the press release, I touched on we\u2019re really two distributors in one. We\u2019re this fastener distributor that has built up a book of business over the last 50 years; and we\u2019re an MRO distributor, really built up that business in the last 20 years. We really started to expand our product lines beyond fasteners in the early, the mid 1990s and have grown that non-fastener business now to [ph] 60% of our sales and that\u2019s 40% fasteners and 60% non-fasteners are really different businesses, different end markets going through a common channel.","And so, if I look at that fastener business, a lot of production business in there. The beauty of that business is incredibly sticky. It\u2019s really invasive and complicated and painful to switch a fastener supplier. Because that\u2019s a very tight relationship because I\u2019m supplying you the stuff you need in what your producing and the quality, the source supply, all those things we bring to the table are critical and it\u2019s very, very disrupted to change your supplier. That\u2019s the good news of that business. The bad news of that business is linked directly to production. If our customer\u2019s production is down 10% that business is down 10%; if our customer\u2019s production is down 30% that business is down 30%. The good news is if it\u2019s up 20, our business grows by 20. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve been seeing in the last few months. If I look at our top 25 customers, and I took a good hard look at that group of business, 11 of those 25 customers were negative in June; 7 of those 11 were negative double-digit; and 5 of those 11 were negative in excess of 25%. That\u2019s a negative of being directly linked to their business.","The positive is when I look at those relationships, these are solid relationships. I\u2019ve visited with most of those customers in the last six months. We have a great relationship; we\u2019re continuing to strengthen as most of those customers; we are growing our business with them. There is only one on that list that I can think of we\u2019re not growing our business and it\u2019s actually going backwards a little bit. The other 24 were growing our relationship but their business is struggling in this economy. That\u2019s a function of the end market economy. If I take that a step further and go beyond the 25 and I look at our top 100 customers in the company that group of customers represents a little bit over 20% of our sales. That group of customers has gone from 7% growth four months ago to 2% growth in June; it\u2019s still growing but it\u2019s struggling because there are so many in that group that are negative.","The good news is, if I look at all of our other large account customers, all of our national accounts outside of our top 100, that business is growing and growing well. In March that business grew at 11.3; in April it grew at 13.5; in May it grew at 14.5; and in June it grew 14.2. That\u2019s about Fastenal taking market share that\u2019s not about Fastenal being impacted by the economy. We\u2019re out taking market share as fast as we\u2019ve ever done. I look at our signings in the first six months of this year; they are ahead of our signings in the first six months of last year. So, I feel very good about the underlying business as far as our ability to take market share. But we\u2019re struggling with some headwinds right now.","With that I have used up a little bit more time than I planned on. I will be quiet and we\u2019ll take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Josh Wilson","Hi. This is Josh Wilson filling in for Sam. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations on the operating expense control. Could you talk a little bit about what your expectations would be going forward, under a range of growth assumptions? It looked like, if it\u2019s what would be in kind of low single digit environment that mid single and that sort of thing?","Dan Florness","That question gets pretty involved, because there is so many dynamics that kick into play. For example, at the start of the year, we talked about a goal that we expressed to our people in December of adding 3,000 people into our stores. Now that was anticipating a top-line growth a world away from what we\u2019re actually seeing. And so what you have seen is that number in the first six months is just over 900 people into our stores. And I would suspect that when the dust settles at the end of this year, we won\u2019t double that number because November and December, we typically pull back but you\u2019re probably going to see a 1,600 1,700 [ph] kind of increase. But the dynamic that comes into play is if we saw our business picking up for some reason, we\u2019d ramp that number up. In a single-digit environment, we will endeavor to keep our operating expenses growing in a fashion that you saw in the second quarter. It will be a little challenging. The one thing that helps us is last year, we had a little bit stronger growth and so some of our incentive comp was a little bit higher. And that\u2019s providing one of the puts and takes to keep helping us, keep our operating expenses low. But if all of a sudden our sales growth was to take off, you\u2019d see us adding people little bit faster, you would see our incentive expense expand quite quickly and you would see your operating expense growth move from that low single-digit into the middle single-digit.","To me, I wish to think about it in context of what do I think about our incremental margin and I feel very good about our ability to -- I was surprised quite frankly by the fact that we hit 40. I thought a number in the 30s would be pretty good. And I think a number of -- around that 30% neighborhood is a pretty good target for us to strive for in the next few quarters.","Josh Wilson","Thanks for that color. And I didn\u2019t see unless I missed it in the press release, an update on your guidance for store account openings for 2015. Could you give us an update on that?","Dan Florness","No change in our guidance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Manthey of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David Manthey","Hi guys, good morning. I\u2019m looking at a gross margin and I don\u2019t want to dwell too much on this. But with all the ongoing mix shifts and this rebate situation, is there any reason to believe that third quarter gross margin or fourth quarter for that matter should be any material difference from what we saw here in the second quarter all else being equal?","Dan Florness","I would expect pretty quiet on the gross margin front in the third and fourth. There is really -- the drop in rebate side, I indicated -- I see that\u2019s a transitory issue. If our growth gets stronger that number improves as well.","David Manthey","And then on SG&A, it\u2019s rare to see a downtick from the first quarter to the second quarter, so fairly, you\u2019re doing what you said you\u2019re doing here and keeping a lid on cost. But assuming a slow growth environment going forward, should we just see normal expenses flex up with volume into the third quarter and sort of the 5 million to 10 million uptick in SG&A that we normally see from the second quarter into the third and fourth quarters or -- again is there anything that sort of hit the second quarter that was unusual that will unwind in the third that we shouldn\u2019t expect to see?","Dan Florness","Probably the most noteworthy thing that hits from first to second is we get out of the heating season. And even though energy prices are better than they have been in the past, it still costs money to heat; and that steps out and you see that benefit from first to second. Second to third, I don\u2019t see anything that would cause me to think last year\u2019s sequential pattern would be anything outside the norm.","David Manthey","And then just final question kind of philosophical here, you have mentioned your CapEx requirements relative to your earnings power lower in the future and now that you\u2019re paying dividends and buying back stock, can you tell us, going forward will both of those be a part of your capital allocation plan and do you favor one versus the other longer term?","Dan Florness","Well, first off on the CapEx, if you look at that number over an extended period of years, say, ten years or so, what you would see is our CapEx kind of hovered in 25% to 30% of earnings zone typically. And that number as we\u2019ve indicated about three to four years ago, that number moved up dramatically when we were doing two big things at once. We were automating our distribution centers; we were rapidly building up an inventory of machines to deploy. And so we never had to be in a situation where a customer wanted a machine and we didn\u2019t have one to deploy. And so I think we had a high watermark of CapEx at 44% of earnings. And we really saw this year going down closer to that 30% number and probably being in that kind of zone going forward. So that gives us flexibility from the standpoint of free cash.","Free cash, I think our bias still leads towards the dividend. We have a lot of shareholders that I believe have grown accustom to that. We have attracted some shareholders because of that aspect of our business, a growth organization over time that pays out a meaningful yield on the stock. Quite frankly, the marketplace has pushed us to buy back some stock by how you price the stock. If our stock had a price that was materially higher than it is today, we won\u2019t be having this discussion, I don\u2019t think. And so, I think the question on allocation in the future is really going to center on where is our valuation. And I don\u2019t mean from an absolute perspective, I mean where is our valuation from a relative perspective, where is our valuation relative to our peers. And the tighter that number is we\u2019re probably more inclined to buy back all the stock.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Flavio Campos of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Flavio Campos","I just wanted a little bit more color on the SG&A line. We didn\u2019t get the fuel disclosure this time around. So if you could talk a little bit about what the impact of fuel was there. And also how much of that of those savings were coming from the fuel itself and some discretionary expense and how much is that tied to the fact that you had net 13 store closures this quarter?","Dan Florness","The 13 store closures really doesn\u2019t affect the numbers that much. Typically most of those employees go into an adjoining -- a neighboring store and it increases our selling potential because you don\u2019t have any -- you don\u2019t have all that labor that\u2019s tethered to the store. But in the short-term that expense is pretty nominal on its impact.","I am looking at the copy of the Q here. And our employee related expenses were up about 1% in the second quarter. Our occupancy related expenses were up about 3.5%, and most of that centers on vending. And then our selling transportation expenses, similar to what we saw in the first quarter, it\u2019s down around 20%, 21%. And if I look at our fuel component of that, in the first quarter, we spent just under $9 million in fuel, that\u2019s total fuel, that\u2019s in cost of goods; about half of that\u2019s in cost of goods for diesel going to semis, about half of that\u2019s in operating expenses, the gas that goes into our pickups at the store. And that number was just over $9 million in the second quarter. So, similar savings what we saw last year, about $3 million saved us.","Flavio Campos","And on the vending side, we saw that growth of customers with vending to drop to single-digits for the first time in the time series. How much of that is the replay of the national accounts that you are talking about in the call that the top 100 is lower and the lower and the smaller national accounts are growing faster, and is there a strategy to increase penetration of vending on those faster growing vending accounts, national accounts on the tail?","Dan Florness","Absolutely. I mean first half of your question was -- the linkage, is a direct language. Those customers that we have a lot of OEM relationship with, I was just at a plant last week in Redmond, Washington that we are on site with a lot of OEM business and I saw a lot of blue vending machines I was walking around those two facilities I was in. And so they are very tightly related. But the weakness we are seeing in our top 100 customers, heavily, heavily weights on what you are seeing on the vending because vending quite frankly, if you think about the vending machine, our goal with the FAST 5000 is when we place it, our goal is to get $2,000 in monthly revenue. And so vending by its nature tends to lend itself to a larger customer rather than a smaller customer because the $500 a month customer, if we\u2019re getting a lion\u2019s share of the business, they are probably -- they are not a target for a vending machine where you are targeting 2,000 -- that I spend.","Flavio Campos","But are you -- do you have a strategy to target those -- that end of -- those smaller customers as well or they\u2019re just not as attractive for any solution as a top 100?","Dan Florness","We are targeting every customer that has the business potential to justify it, whether that customer is a national account or a local account and in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. We are bringing that value to customers that the vending machine is valuable to. So that customer has to spend to make economic sense for their business to have vending, we\u2019re bringing it to them; we don\u2019t care what group they\u2019re in.","Lee Hein","And Flavio, we don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s gloves, office supplies, beverage, water. We look at the customer and we go in; we do a process mapping and we try to tailor our deployment by size of machine, number of machines to really give them the benefit of vending. We have a smaller 3000 we have a 5000, we have lockers. And so we really try to come to the customer with some type of solution that fits their business needs.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Adam Uhlman","I guess the first point of clarification seems pricing is still a headwind to revenue growth. I was wondering if you could detail how much that was a drag on your year-over-year sales growth. And then secondly, it sounds like you have a good amount of traction with the smaller accounts coming through and I might have missed it but what was your active account growth for the quarter?","Dan Florness","I don\u2019t have that number handy right off the cuff. That number is probably mid single digits I guess.","Lee Hein","Yes, 3 to 4.","Dan Florness","And that number is -- so much of our growth is coming from -- there is two components to our growth. There is active account growth and there is dollars per active. So much of our growth has been centered on dollars per active in this environment because all of our growth drivers with the exception of the people we\u2019ve been adding now in the last 12 months. But the growth drivers of the last three or four years have really centered on means to additional dollars per active because it\u2019s very, very profitable growth for us.","Adam Uhlman","What was the drag on revenue growth this quarter from pricing?","Dan Florness","The exchange rate drag from a pricing standpoint was about 1%. If you look at our year-over-year number, most of the drag comes from mix and not from pricing. I\u2019d say probably a quarter of a 1% drag -- a quarter of our drop in the gross profit was more about pricing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ryan Merkel","I wanted to start with a bit more color on June. I know there was an extra day in the month and also it ended in mid week but you still missed the sequential pattern by a decent amount. So, I\u2019m just wondering how the months play out and then are there any other signs of life outside of the energy delta coming in a bit? ","Lee Hein","June was disappointing, there is no question and even at the 1% on the extra day it was not where we wanted it. And when you look at and you talk about outside of the oil and gas, some bright spots for us I look at some things that are happening taking place within the business in Florida and California in some of our Midwest regions, we\u2019re starting to see Canada when you really factor in the native currency is actually performing well. And so this oil and gas thing as we\u2019ve talked before Ryan, it\u2019s just got such a ripple effect through the economy and through the business that it\u2019s just waiting astound. But if you look at non-res, that\u2019s we think and when we look at our information, we believe that\u2019s heavily tied to oil and gas. So that\u2019s a factor. We look at ag and heavy manufacturing, all headwinds right now for us.","Ryan Merkel","And I guess maybe a follow up is lacking anything else, should we just sort of assume normal sequential patterns for sort of the rest of the year just because there is really no obvious catalysts that you\u2019re seeing in your business, is that a fair statement?","Lee Hein","That\u2019s a fair statement.","Ryan Merkel","The second question and Dan you sort of hit on this but I want to ask it again. I thought that the higher EBIT margin year-over-year with lower gross margins was a big positive. But it\u2019s hard to tell how much of that is one-time cost cutting versus Pathway to Profit really starting to shine through. And Pathway to Profit really wasn\u2019t shinning through last year for example because gross margins were sort of coming down so much and offsetting it. So my question is, should investors view your results this quarter as a positive long-term signal that you can raise EBIT margins even if gross margin moderates due to mix?","Dan Florness","I believe so. We\u2019ve touched on that and really talked about the mix; what it does to gross profit but the inherent cost structure that we have and the ability to leverage that cost structure. One of the things I shared with our board yesterday is if you look at our business, we have the 80% of our business that\u2019s gone through either U.S. or Canadian store and 20% of our business that\u2019s either going through what we call an onsite situation or a strategic account store where we have a very close tight relationship with a large customer or our non-U.S. and Canadian store business. If I set those aside and look at the 80% of store business, when we set up the Pathway to Profit back in 2007, most of our business was going through that piece that store piece. And we said as this piece continues to mature, we could take the operating margins from the 18.3 we are at, to north of 23. This quarter if I look at strictly the store subset, so that chunk of business that represents about 80% of our sales, we were at north of 23%. So we actually hit our pathway to profit target in that subset of stores. And we\u2019ve always said that\u2019s a point in time number because that group of stores is about 106,000 a month in business. So, I think it\u2019s very, very bullish for our long-term ability to drive the profit machine that is Fastenal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Robert Barry","I wanted to just actually again follow up on the SG&A. I mean I understand you are in low growth environment and so it makes sense to really double down and try and dial back the costs. But Dan, you did mention you haven\u2019t seen this kind of performance in the 19 years you\u2019ve been at Fastenal. So, I\u2019m curious, beyond the next couple of quarters, were changes made in the way you\u2019re running the business that are permanent and sustainable? Can you maybe share a little more color on that?","Dan Florness","Well, I mean the leverage that we described in Pathway to Profit, that\u2019s structural. That\u2019s a case of our occupancy, as a percentage of sales, continues to decline because we\u2019re running more dollars through that same building. The portion of our labor that\u2019s tethered to the store becomes the smaller and smaller portion of our labor pool. Those kinds of things are structural. The things that aren\u2019t structural that are part of the tug-of-war of life if you will is one of the challenges Lee put out to the team and I think the team responded tremendously to is hey folks, we\u2019re investing and adding all these people; we can\u2019t spend money doing other things; we\u2019ve always been frugal with travel and sometimes we joke about some of the things we do when we travel because that\u2019s who we are. We\u2019ve doubled down on that. Now, how permanent that component is, is a function of the tug-of-war of life.","If we were growing faster, Lee\u2019s message might not have resonated quite as deeply with our district managers, our national accounts folks, our regionals because they might be traveling a little bit more because they are visiting more customers, they visiting more people, they are more things. And sometimes you dial that back, maybe you don\u2019t need to have that meeting; maybe you have that meeting as a conference call rather than a face-to-face; maybe you do these things in the short-term, but those in the scheme of our expense pool are relatively small but they are very symbolic. And the fact that we managed our travel, our non-store operating expenses as well as we did, I think was enhanced by the called action that Lee put out there, three, six and 12 months ago but we demonstrated we can do it when we need to do it because when you are growing your top line 5%, you\u2019ve got to do things like that that maybe you won\u2019t have to do if you were growing at 12 to 14.","Robert Barry","Right. Fair enough.","Lee Hein","Let me just add here -- yes, Rob, I\u2019d just add one thing though and you have to link this together that when you put a call out to the troops and you get them into the why and I said that at the opening, they were asking and they want to grow; their commission plans are setup that ways. So, they want to grow; they want to take market share; they want to serve at a higher level. So, when you put out that we want to add energy in your store but I need a little help over here; that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. They saw the reason and they responded like Dan said, the team just did a tremendous job.","Robert Barry","Could I also just follow-up on the vending some of the disclosure absent this third quarter was also the signings and installs on a machine equivalent basis; is that something that you could provide?","Dan Florness","That will be in our Q. Let me see if I have that page handy here. Let\u2019s see, on a machine equivalent basis, okay, the signings number would be 3,931 versus the 2,916 we did in the first quarter. The installs at the end of the period would be 37,714 versus 35,997 at the end of first quarter and I think the rest of stuff was in our release.","Robert Berry","So, even on an equivalent basis, that\u2019s pretty good acceleration year-over-year. And anything in particular driving the acceleration in the signings?","Dan Florness","We have a group of store employees, district managers and national account members that are keyed at driving that number because one thing that we know about our business that we keep reiterating with our team, the vending machine is a sign of engagement with your customer. If you are truly engaged with your customer, you should be able to put vending machines out there and it makes the business stickier and it\u2019s good common sense, have a reason to be in talking to your customer multiple times a week.","Lee Hein","I think the other thing too Rob is again I worked in the store and when you -- and again, it\u2019s a world of competition and we like that, we love it. And so when a competitor comes in and they see our blue machines in there, our folks are starting to understand that how tough it is for the competition to get us out. And it\u2019s a learning curve with 2,600 stores, 2,700 that more and more stores are adopting, more and more stores are seeing the benefit, more customers. And for me personally, if I am in a store and I have a customer with vending and I show you and take you to that customer and you see it in action, that is how we continue to see more engagement and more adoption in the field.","Robert Berry","I you had actually purposefully dialed down the pace a little bit a year or so ago in an effort to improve the efficiency and the profitability. I mean, do you think given you\u2019ve made progress there you\u2019re dialing up the aggression a little bit?","Lee Hein","I think it\u2019s -- what we said earlier, I think, this is actually linked to what\u2019s going on with our national accounts. Everybody is engaged with vending, whether it\u2019s a local store; district managers; regionals; and national accounts, but as our national accounts are providing the growth, are also providing a lot of what we\u2019re seeing on our vending right now.","Dan Florness","And it\u2019s 09:42 Central. It looks like we have time for one quick question, if there is any left.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Robert McCarthy","Now, in terms of -- I mean, I don\u2019t know if I missed this earlier, but did you talk about what you thought incremental margins could be in the back half for the year? Did you talk about kind of the 20s range or the 30s range, I forget?","Dan Florness","Our goal is always to be as close to 30 as we can. And I was frankly surprised by -- pleasantly surprised by the fact we were able to hit 40 despite the fact that June came a little weaker than we thought it was going to be. And I noted that on the last calls, we get antsy when that number is below 25. Because that number isn\u2019t at least better than our operating profit, what\u2019s causing us to\u2026","Robert McCarthy","Right.","Dan Florness","If we\u2019re losing that because we\u2019re consciously making an investment in something, that\u2019s one thing but our anxiousness rises if we\u2019re not meaningfully beating that number.","Robert McCarthy","Could you just talk about the effective -- kind of the roll over steel prices, have you seen any impact in terms of pricing and gross margin, how would you quantify it?","Dan Florness","We have seen the impact in our revenue; we have seen the impact in our gross profit. It\u2019s difficult to quantify it, because sometimes there is a lot of noise in the numbers. We have different customers and there you have customers we are changing the source of supply because you\u2019re bringing a better cost value to them. It\u2019s not just in steel; it could be in non-steel products as well. But there is no doubt about steel is creating headwind for us and it\u2019s creating some challenges; it also creates some opportunities. Earlier on -- when I asked about our gross margin change, I indicated about half of the drop from Q1 to Q2, centered on our supplier incentives and probably about quarter of the drop related to the impacts of pricing.","Robert McCarthy","Pricing, okay. And then in terms of the back half of the year, I mean obviously, you can look at the sequential patterns but also the compares are little tougher. I mean, I guess, you still see the prospects for positive organic growth in the back half for the year, given what we\u2019ve seen in terms of June?","Dan Florness","Yes.","Dan Florness","It is 9:45. We\u2019d like to thank everybody again for your listening on the call and your interest in Fastenal. And we\u2019ll talk to everybody soon.","Lee Hein","Thank you. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great rest of your day."],"9538":["Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) Q2 2013 Earnings Call July 10, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Ellen Trester","Willard D.

Go ahead, Mr. Oberton.","Willard D. Oberton","Thank you, Ellen, and thank you everybody for joining us today. Looking at the results for the second quarter, I think the main story is slow sales growth, and we believe that's really caused by a few things. One is a slow economic condition. It's very slow out there from an industrial side. And the other would be that we have just become too tight -- or we were too tight on adding people in the fourth quarter and for the -- basically the last 3 quarters. With our headcount down negative 2% at the store, we've just -- we do not have enough time in the stores to get out and make the number of sales calls that we need to make.","Our plan going forward to try and address that is to add between 100 and 150 FTE per month for the next 6 months throughout the rest of the year, adding 600 to 900 FTE for the year. So we can't do anything about the economy, but we do have the balance sheet and the strength to go out and add the people to grow the stores. And the decision to add the stores -- we've spent a lot of time looking at that, looking at the data, but mainly we've spent time talking to our store managers and asking them what it would take to free up some time or to get out there and make more calls, and that was the common theme, was, \"Hey, give us a little help, we'll grow the business.\"","One positive -- actually, a very positive on the sales side of the quarter were our June results. Our sequential growth from May to June was 3.2%. The historical number is 2.8%. So we're really hoping that, that continues and that maybe that's a trend of the things we're doing, with adding more people and trying to free up time in the store. So again, the major theme of the quarter was slow sales, but we're working very hard to correct that.","On the expense side of the equation, I think we've done a very nice job in almost every category. There are always a few things that jump out, but I think Dan and his team and the people in the fields who manages things, continue to do a good job and they really have it dialed in. And we've been -- become very consistent with our expense control and where the money is being spent and how we do it. So I feel very good about those efforts and what everyone has done there.","On the margin, the gross margin, we had a very nice improvement year-over-year of 60 basis points, but the other side of that is we had a disappointing trend from the first quarter to the second quarter, actually dropping slightly. And we were not anticipating that, and trying to look at the data, trying to understand what is going on. Part of it is there is a lot of pressure in the field from the customers. When the economy is slow, it's harder to increase your margin. But that being said, we still believe that with hard work and staying focused on our new pricing guidance system, that we will continue to see improvements. So stay tuned on that. There's a lot of opportunity on the gross margin, not by wholesales price increases but by being just bidding a little better line by line, with the customers, understanding where the opportunities are and understanding what products we can sell them.","General comments on the earnings, I think we've done a nice job there. If you look at creating earnings leverage with only 5% -- less than 6% sales growth, we've never done that. So very positive. And a 22.7% pretax number, although it's not 23%, the number I continue to talk about, we're getting very close and we're still confident that we're going to move that number up and achieve our 23% goal.","The last thing I want to talk about is our vending -- automated vending solutions. As you saw that our trend in the second quarter was actually down from the first quarter but still a very good number. We signed 20% more machines -- or excuse me, we installed 20% more machines in the first half of the year than we did last year. And our overall numbers are still very strong. My looking at the vending numbers and trying to understand it, I think the biggest difference, there's really 2 differences in the trend. One is that we have worked much harder at making sure that every machine we've signed is a very good signing. So we've really cranked up the quality on the signings. And that's reduced it a little bit, not a significant difference. But I think the other reason that we've slowed a little bit is we have backed off with some of the pressure. And the reason -- the pressure to sign at the store level, and the reason we've done that is because vending is a long-cycle sale. And right now, our focus has to be on creating sales immediately, going out knocking on the door and walking back with an order. So basically, the word out to our district managers and our store managers is improvement month to month to month. And so however they do that, whether it's through signing vending machines, whether it's knocking on doors and just creating immediate sales, is really our focus. So going forward into the quarter, the theme within Fastenal, our main focus was improve daily growth. Because we know that if we can improve our daily growth going in -- later into the year, that will bode well for us going into the first quarter of next year. And that's we're always focused on. Sequential pattern through the year, step into the next year and continue on with that.","With that, I will turn it over to Dan. Dan has some comments, more color on the things I've just touched on. Thank you very much.","Daniel L. Florness","Good morning, everybody, and thank you for participating in our call today. I have a handful of points I'll make just to highlight some items in the press release. Somewhat redundant to Will's, and bear with me as I run through them, please. First one, I agree with Will, huge plus on the quarter. The fact that we we're able to leverage earnings on 5.5% sales growth I think is a pretty strong feat, when you look at the type of investments that we continue to make into our business. I think it talks a lot about the pathway to profit that we started back in 2007, where we really slowly moved our business to being a more variable cost structure than historically when we we're constantly adding stores at a higher clip. We were introducing a lot more fixed cost into our cost pool, the occupancy associated with those sites and the fixed headcount in those sites, that it gives us a little bit more ability to adapt. That combined with the fact that we had a 60-basis-point improvement in gross margin, those 2 things really allowed us to grow our headcount -- or excuse me, our earnings.","Will touched on some of the things, with investing little more heavily in our stores in the coming months, which we think will also help on the revenue side because we're probably running a little bit too lean at the store level.","Second item, reiterate what Will mentioned on Page 4. In June, we beat the sequential trend. To be honest with you, that's a good feeling. We believe that positions us a bit better going into the tail half of the year. And when you look at the ISM reading out there, it really isn't because there's a rising tide that lifted our ship. We're just rolling a little faster and moving the sales forward.","On Page 6, our manufacturing business, again, this ties right into the ISM, has been climbing in the last 2 months despite the continued weakness on the fastener side. So this really demonstrates a bit of the greater engagement we have with the 30% of our sales base that now is linked to vending. It really is a very tangible way, and I've touched on this in previous calls. It's a tangible way of measuring the type of relationship we have with that customer and how engaged we are in taking additional market share with that customer.","On the flip side of that coin, construction continues to be weak. We see just treading of water. One of the things that we've been experimenting with in a handful of stores, I believe it's a few hundred stores over the last few months, is introducing some additional construction products to see if we can stimulate some activity. We're seeing some very positive results from that. And so we anticipate continuing to add some construction products. We want to be a destination. We want our store and that local market to be the destination for the customers in that market, including the construction customers, and we believe there's opportunity for us to take market share faster regardless of what the marketplace delivers and just overall growth.","As Will touched on, our vending pace slipped a little bit. I alluded to this in the commentary. We're really putting in the good discipline, I believe, of quality signings, quality installs. We're to the point now where a very meaningful part of our business of our store base has more than 10 machines installed. So we're becoming experts in vending at a greater and greater percentage of our store locations. And I think that bodes well for us in the future.","The other item that I'll touch on, and I'm touching on this one because I assume there'll be a question or 2 on it. If you look at -- we're starting to lap greater and greater numbers. If I go back 2 years ago, about 10% of our sales base included customers that had exposure to vending. And at that point in time, that business was growing about just over 40%. A year later, so second quarter of last year, that number had doubled to about 20% of our sales base, and at that point in time, it was growing in the low 30s. And this is me thinking out loud with math, which might be a little dangerous in a conversation, but I'll throw it out there anyway. If you think of -- and we don't have perfect ways to measure this, because a lot of times those incremental machines are going into existing customers, same plants, a sister plant, or it's going into a completely new customer. But if you think of that first year customer seeing, let's just say for discussion's sake, that number we saw a couple of years ago, 43%, 45%. And if that number dropped down to the mid-20s in the second year as we lap, if half of your business is at 45% and another half is in the low 20s, that'd put our average on that 20% in the low 30s, the 34% we saw a year ago.","If I take that a step forward and say, okay, we've gone from 20% to 30%, and the new blood is growing in that 40s neighborhood, next group of blood is growing in the low 20s, and let's stay the stock in the third year moves down to more in line with what the company is doing, what the marketplace is providing to us. If you start lumping those together, you get down to kind of a 20% number, because you have 1\/3 of it is new, 1\/3 of it is a year old and 1\/3 of it is more than a year old. And I don't know if that's how the math is playing out, but right now, that's kind of how I'm thinking about it, when I look at the pieces to understand the impact that vending has and the impact of what engagement with that customer base can mean.","On Page 9, this really goes hand-in-hand with my first comment and this is really the summary of pathway to profit. Continue to see nice improvement in 2 ways. One, that individual groups, their relative profitability improved in all groups except for the last where it pretty much maintained from a year ago. And just as importantly, our average store size continues to grow. And we're seeing the pathway to profit, the change in mix, continue to drive that operating margin up. We're not at 23%, but 22.7% we're at least in sight of that -- not the goal, but the threshold, we think, we could hit and achieve and surpass.","Page 12, personally, it's a little bit of a negative for me. I really felt coming into the quarter, we had momentum to get us north of the 52.3%. We're essentially at the same number where we were in the first quarter. I still believe there is opportunity for us to raise that bar and to raise that in future quarters and future years. And I feel still very bullish on that going into the third and fourth quarter.","The only other item that stood out for me that frustrates me a little bit is on Page 15, our AR grew a little faster than it should. And there's really 2 dynamics going on there. One is the calendar. Now both June of 2012 and June of 2013 ended on a weekend. So the calendar is similar, so my comment about the calendar might sound a little odd. But what we're -- and I don't know if this is a post office, logistics thing or what's driving this, but we're slowly seeing more and more of our cash come in, in the first 2 and 3 days of the week than what's historically the norm. Historically, we had a big cash come in on Monday, which is really weekend processing of mail coming through the post office because the goods -- most of our cash still comes in via the U.S. mail.","If I look at the stats today, about 50% of our cash comes in the first 2 days of the week. Another 20% comes in on Wednesday. So on the first 3 days of the week, about 70% of our cash comes in and that's even different from what it was a year ago. So if we held our books open until Tuesday instead of closing on the weekend, our AR would look a lot better. But bottom line is calendar is impacting and just the way the mail comes in is impacting our days.","But we're also getting a lot of hard push from our customers on extending some days, and we're working on that on a case-by-case basis. I believe there's opportunities for us to continue to improve our days out as we've done over the years. But that's a challenge for us right now. Despite all of that, I'm very pleased with the cash flow we had in the first half of the year. Obviously, Q1 and Q2 have some different dynamics because of tax payments. But in the first half of the year, I think we put up a very good number. I feel good about our number for the year. To that extent, we announced last night an increase to our dividend payout for the third quarter. We announced a $0.25 dividend versus the $0.20 we paid out in the second quarter.","With that, I will turn it over to any questions you might have. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is just on vending. Just trying to better understand what has led to the change in strategy from maybe Q1 where you wanted to grow your installed base as fast as possible and now to sort of taking a little more of a measured approach. I realize some of this maybe you're running too lean, maybe your profitability expectations have changed on vending. Just any color you can provide there.","Willard D. Oberton","I'll start out with no, our profitability expectations have not changed at all. It really comes to what I said in the call is that we're getting the signings by working very hard with the managers and pushing hard on signing vending machines. But when we really looked hard and listened to our managers about how we can improve our sales quickly, month-to-month versus year-over-year, the word was let us go out and just make regular sales calls, call on contractors and small accounts and pick up orders rather. The vending cycle, if we sign a vending machine, typically, it takes about 5 to 6 months to be producing revenue for us. It's a great business. It's just a longer cycle business. And so we said, okay, let's just let it flow naturally. And the fact that we signed almost 5,400 machines without putting all the pressure on, to me, was actually a pretty impressive number. And so it's nothing about our view long term of vending. We think it's still a fantastic opportunity for us. It's just about how much time you can consume in the store for just one initiative that's a longer-cycle initiative.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. And just a follow-up, any -- you mentioned the June number was pretty good, 6% relative to 5.3% in May. Has there been any change in July, what you're seeing? I know it's early days in July, but any change versus expectation?","Daniel L. Florness","Hamzah, this is Dan. First off, experience has taught us whenever we try to predict on the 10th of the month, our odds of being incorrect are incredibly high. And so we tend not to go down that path, especially in the July month because with the Fourth of July, it even adds a little more uncertainty. But our expectations, going into the tail half the year, we think we're doing some things on the headcount side, on the vending side, on a whole bunch of aspects of our business to position us better for the upcoming months and the last months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Joshua Wilson","This is Josh filling in for Sam. I wanted to get your thoughts, you called out the nonresidential construction industry as being a bit of a headwind to margins and the lackluster growth there. Could you give me any thoughts on your outlook for that vertical and what you think of it in the coming months?","Daniel L. Florness","As we touched on, the -- it's been essentially treading water for some time. And earlier in the spring, we thought it was very weather-centered because we really had a tough weather pattern. I mean, I know from first-hand knowledge we had snow storm here in the first week of May and a lot of the upper Midwest was hit hard. And so there was some weather going on. But when I look at the May numbers in total, I look at the June numbers, I mean the construction is weak. As I touched -- alluded to earlier, there are some things that we're doing, testing a few hundred stores with putting some more products in, that we've seen some positive results from, and it's going to cause us to take -- expand that more in some additional locations. As far as predicting where it could go, your guess is as good as mine.","Willard D. Oberton","But that isn't applying pressure on our margin. I don't think Dan didn't say...","Daniel L. Florness","On the gross margin, it does give us a little pressure because our construction business does run at -- or runs at slightly higher gross margin, so there's a little mix issue there. And I was just trying to identify pluses and minuses to gross margin.","Joshua Wilson","Got it. And then could you maybe just elaborate a little bit more, going back to the vending program, on how you're defining a quality of an installation? Is it purely the revenue potential of the machine or are there other factors that you're considering?","Willard D. Oberton","It's really about the revenue potential of the customer. There were just 2 things. One is revenue potential of the customer and how many machines per customer. What we identified is that in some cases, because of aggressive sales people there saying, \"Hey, we need to put 6 machines in here.\" And as we went in and sized up the customer, we found that really 4 was -- or 4 or 5 was a more appropriate number. And so what we're really doing is just a screening process. Now that we have so many machines out and so many customers, we have great data. And it's really looking very hard, to say is that the correct number of customers -- or per, for that customer or is this customer even capable of getting one machine. We've always done it, we just have better data today.","Joshua Wilson","And if I could just get one more, and you mentioned wholesale pricing not necessarily being a component of your bullishness on gross margin. Could you talk about the pricing environment in the industry?","Willard D. Oberton","Well, the pricing environment is always difficult. But with the economy slow like it is, it's more difficult to go in and ask for a price increase. And I think some of it is just reluctance of salespeople. When your customer's already putting pressure on you, it's harder to go in and push pricing. So it's just a more difficult environment. There's not real dynamic, not a lot going on. It's just when business is robust, it's a lot easier to walk in with a price increase than it is when business is slow. Timing is tough.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Could you elaborate a little bit more on the headcount increase for the stores, exactly what type of people are you looking at adding, support people or actual outside sales reps? And help us better understand when the revenue contribution from that could hit. Could we see anything in the back half of this year? Is that more for next year? And then, wrapped into that, if you could just talk about the active account trends that you're seeing today?","Willard D. Oberton","The headcount increase, we've started adding some people in June as you saw in the numbers, and we're going to continue, as I said, to try and add 100 to 150 FTE per month. The majority of the people we'll be adding will actually be part-time support people, which will allow the managers and the salespeople to get out of the store and contact the customers. Because in talking to many, many managers, which myself and Lee and the whole entire team has been doing, it's -- they're saying, \"Hey, we're stuck inside packaging orders, which someone else could do if I had the time or if we had the hours.\" As far as the -- when we expect to see improvement, based on looking at historical data of when we've added people and when it's -- the sales have improved, it actually comes very quickly. We would expect to see maybe slight improvement in August, but by the October, by -- the beginning of the fourth quarter, it should make a difference in our incremental gains, our month-to-month gains. And then really, as I had said in the call, our goal is to set ourselves up for a good first quarter, more of a historical first quarter in that high-teens, maybe pushing that 20% if we can do things very well between now and then. That's -- and, probably a little economic help as well. Who knows if that comes. But it's really about adding support so the salespeople can get out and monitoring it very close to see where we're getting the gains and where we aren't.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And where's the active account growth running right now?","Willard D. Oberton","Well, excuse me, I -- it's up slightly, but we -- it's pretty flat. And we believe most of that is attributable to not making enough sales calls, not having the time to get out and pound on doors. It's like anything, if you don't stir it up, it doesn't happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Guys, I was wondering, first off, with what you said, Will, earlier. You mentioned that there's no change in your profitability expectations. And as you're adding these -- the full-time equivalents, getting the store people out in the field more, it sounds like your growth expectations have not changed either, if anything, maybe have gone up. I'm just trying to figure out where these lines intersect. It sounds like the vending might be contributing a little bit less as it matures and as there's fewer being installed, but you might get a little bit of a boost from some of the more active selling efforts. Could you talk about your expectations on growth just from sort of a secular basis? Has it changed at all with what we're talking about here today?","Willard D. Oberton","No, it really hasn't. And we don't expect any less from vending. Although our signings slipped from first to second quarter, we still have thousands of machines that are being installed. We still have...","Daniel L. Florness","We did 20% more than last year.","Willard D. Oberton","We did 20% more than we did last year. So Dan and I, and we've talked about this a few times, we maybe got a little overzealous, throwing a 30,000 out there, but we've probably made bigger mistakes. So the vending, we expect it to continue to grow and continue to -- a higher percentage of our customers are deploying the technology, and it's going to continue to grow we believe at a rapid rate. As far as adding the salespeople, that's really nothing new. What happened there, and I take responsibility, is we got too tight in the fourth quarter. And part of the -- where we went wrong with the decision was I thought that vending was going to be automatically more -- it was going to automatically increase the efficiency in our stores. What I was missing on that is the tremendous amount of work to get to the position where it becomes more efficient, which it does, but there's a lot of work of introducing it and training it and setting it up. And all that work was taking away from sales calls. And that's what we're hearing from our managers when we spend time with them. So we're really getting back on the Fastenal model, the pathway to profit model, add 15% to 20% more -- or 15% more hours in the store, and you should get close to 20% more growth. That's what we're on. We've done a lot of work looking at the historical trends saying, hey, part of our sales growth problem, a lot of it is we need more hours to make more customer calls. Overall, the expectation has not changed, the mix has not changed. We basically slowed it down too much over really a 3-quarter period, over the last 9 months. Does that answer your question, Dave?","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. It does, Will. And related to that, I think THUB is slated to start coming on here and helping. It sounds like you're approaching this labor problem from 2 angles now. And could you talk about how THUB ramps up? And then if you have time, if you want to touch on the OEM fastener initiative, and then I'll hop off here.","Willard D. Oberton","THUB, we're kicking it off this month. It's going to really take probably 9 to 12 months to where we have it rolled up to all of our stores with the majority of the volume. So it will be a long ramp-up. But we know that we'll save hundreds of FTE equivalence in the stores by the time we've rolled it out. And it's really about taking labor out of the store and doing it in a more efficient fashion. We're very, very bullish on that, on that project. The other thing that it has is it has the potential, and we really believe it will happen, to make the economics of vending better because we lower the amount of labor that goes in to serve the customers and serve them at a higher level so there are some benefits there.","Daniel L. Florness","And we improve our ability to source the products going through vending.","Willard D. Oberton","Yes, the margin opportunity becomes much better with vending because we're buying tremendous quantities to bring into this one facility. So some very good reasons for doing it, and it's a few weeks behind schedule but for the most part, it's right on track. We we're hoping to get it going the 1st of July, and I think it's the 15th, so very good progress. As far as the OEM fastener initiative, we're also still very positive on that. But it's -- and I've said from the very beginning, it's going to be a slow process because most of the contracts or customers we're going after have their fasteners under contract. I would say on the average, that's a 3-year contract. There's 2 or 3 5s, but most of them are 3-year contracts, and so we're just positioning ourselves. So when those contracts expire, get close to expiring, we're standing at the door, the customer knows our capabilities and has a -- and we have a relationship with their buying team or engineering team and feel we're going to be well positioned when that happens. We have a lot of nice signings, but still not enough to really move the needle on the macro. But we believe that fasteners are a huge part of our future and that we have not done a very good job, broadly speaking, not done a very good job of explaining to the customers how good we are at fasteners and all the things we can offer with our manufacturing, with our importing capabilities, with our local store delivery, the things that most of our competitors really cannot offer that we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to go back to vending for a second, I guess a two-part question. I'm wondering what are you doing to fix the underperforming machines that you have out there today. And then secondly, is the lower revenue that we've seen per machine, is that mostly a macro issue, or is it a quality of machine issue?","Willard D. Oberton","I'll answer the first part first. We've identified all of the machines that are producing below what our expectations are. We've put together a very good program, and our district managers and our store managers are out visiting these customers. We have seen some improvement, it's coming slow. But in talking to the district and store managers, it seems like the customers are very open to, yes, I know we're not buying enough and it sounds like we have just not been aggressive enough with these relationships to move that forward. So we're very focused on it. I believe it's a well-designed program to communicate with the stores and the customers and move it forward. As far as the revenue per machine, it's really 2 things. One is the underperforming. If you pull them out, the revenues dropped maybe less than 10%, less than $100 machine, is that right, Dan?","Daniel L. Florness","Yes.","Willard D. Oberton","And so you pull out the underperforming, and it's back. But I think the other is pure macro, that the customers are not growing as fast. If you look out at the industrial economy, and you look at what other companies are putting up for numbers, it's probably manufacturing's maybe flat at best right now. And so in some cases, it's just -- there's not much growth there. And when we put a machine in and it reduces the spend, there's no way to grow that back. But overall, when you look at the growth of the customers that have vending and all the things we're doing, we're still very bullish on the overall industrial vending project and what it can mean to the company.","Daniel L. Florness","Well, the thing, I think, I'll add is just based on sometimes asking a bunch of questions behind the scene, and you learn some things. And I think part of the issue is, Ryan, you mentioned quality of machine. I would phrase it a little differently. I'd say some of them, the quality of the implementation. That's been our issue. The right parts -- are the right parts in it? Are we providing a high level of service? And are we -- a lot of times, you might have a machine that goes in, and inertia is a powerful thing. And it might have been on day 1 we're putting this machine in -- part of the agreement was some business getting turned over to us because some of the stuff in the machine we're already selling to the customer. And 3 months later, 6 months later has that happened, and are we popping in -- am I popping into Lee and say, \"Hey, Lee, you said you're going to turn this $500 worth of this over to me.\" We're just not seeing that activity yet. And Lee is like, \"Yes, you're right. We got to get that going.\"","LeLand J. Hein","Ryan, I'll jump in. One comment is we've learned some things, too, over the course of the year, and that is we're starting to lead our customer instead of sitting and waiting for them to choose the items. We were finding it -- the speed to revenue, is part of leading our customer. Really saying, basically, try this, try this, we know this will work, you should have a box cutter, you should have some batteries, what have you. That's helping, too.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great, that was really helpful color. And then the second question I had, this is a big positive, and I think Will you pointed this out. But you nearly hit a 23% EBIT margin with 92,000 a month in average sales. So does this suggest that pathway to profit margin can be even stronger than you originally talked about, and this is because you've done so well without ramping the sales as much you would have expected at this point?","Willard D. Oberton","We've been saying for the last 2 or 3 years, Dan and I, that the 23% is a point in time, and it really has to do with the average store size. It depends on what our gross margin does. At the end of the day, our real goal is return on invested capital, so whether it's 22% or 25%, as long we can continue to grow profitably, we think we can continue to move it up as the average store size grows. And what we're doing with the labor, adding people into these stores, as I said earlier, it's a direct piece of pathway, but more people on our existing stores create greater growth. And if we do that, our pretax profits will grow as a percentage of sales. So I guess the answer to your -- long answer to your question, but the answer is yes.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brent Rakers with Wunderlich Securities.","Brent D. Rakers - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Wanted to talk a little bit about the cost implications of the sales force additions. And then I guess on the other side, your non-seller employee number increases have actually pretty significantly exceeded the seller increases. I was hoping maybe you could talk about that historically, and then also talk about what the outlook is for hiring there.","Daniel L. Florness","I'll start with the non-seller piece. On that, it's more of a function of just the way the comparisons work out because we've been -- on a year-over-year basis, the numbers are up, but if you look at the various components, we've been managing that area pretty tightly. We've added some folks into our IT area. We've added some folks into select resource areas. But it's probably more of a function of what you really look at, as far as June-to-June comparison, than anything else. Will, if you want to touch on the store side?","Willard D. Oberton","I think -- well, on the store side -- I lost the question.","Daniel L. Florness","The cost of the FTE adds.","Willard D. Oberton","The cost of the FTE adds is really 2 things. One is we believe we still have room to improve our gross margin and offset some of it. But looking at the math and looking at how we believe we can ramp the sales up, we think we can pay for most of it in gross margin improvement because if we get -- it doesn't take a tremendous amount when you look at an almost $300 million monthly revenue. You don't need to see a lot of incremental improvement to pay for 100 to 200 people a month. And so we need to work very -- we're very focused on that. We've talked to the regional vice presidents again this morning on a teleconference, making sure they understand that their -- as our labor goes up, they need to improve their gross margin or increase their gross profit dollars to pay for these people. And in one-on-one conversations with our regional vice presidents and district managers, all of them feel very confident they can do that because they think they're going to get some pretty quick improvements. So overall, Dan and I are not afraid of it in the macro number from an earnings in the fourth quarter and the first quarter because if we do this right, we think it will actually be a positive in the fourth quarter and the first quarter.","Brent D. Rakers - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I guess my second question and I think, Will, you talked about increasing, I believe you said 15% more hours of productivity for some of the store managers and the sellers. Presumably, that's coming both from reduced pressure from vending, but also some of these additional kind of store support hires. Over what time frame you think you can get that profitability improved by about 15%?","Willard D. Oberton","That's not the profitability. What I meant by that is 15% more hours in the store. So if I have 3 people today working in the store, doing say, 140 hours a week, I'd want to add 15% to that number or roughly 20 more hours into that store to free up time. And if we really could free -- put 20 hours a week in a store and most -- the majority of that time, and not all of it is going to be spent on selling. If we could add 10 to 15 hours of selling every week in every store, we would see an impact very quickly is what we believe.","Brent D. Rakers - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Will, how quickly do you think with these hirings will you get to the point of freeing up that 15% more hours?","Willard D. Oberton","Well, it's not really freeing it up. If you look at the fact we're going to add 100 to 150 FTE a month, you can really do the math on that looking at our macro. But it's really -- here's what they are today, here's what they're adding. And it really adds up to about 1.5, I believe about 1.5% more hours per month going forward if you just run the math on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Baliotti with Janney Capital Markets.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I was just curious, Dan, or Will, is it possible, as you add these heads, that you could approach both the short-term sales goals by spending more time with your customers but also work the vending at the same time that gives you that long-term growth piece?","Willard D. Oberton","We are -- we've said this a couple of times. We are working the vending at 5,300, 5,400 machines a quarter would still give us. Now could we move it up a little bit, maybe get to 6,000 or 6,500? Yes. But if you look at any other period in time 5,500 or 5,300 would have been a fantastic number. So we're still very committed, and so I think we are working both sides of it. Like I said earlier in the call, I'm actually quite happy that we've backed off the pressure and only lost, not a tremendous amount, quarter-to-quarter. And year-over-year, we had nice growth.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So Will, do you think that -- is that -- sort of that exit you talked after the last quarter that while you're not really expecting a 2,500 a month at this point, but you thought you're going to exit the year at that rate, is that still something you feel good about?","Willard D. Oberton","I don't want to comment on it because we'll see what the stores do. Because we've committed to the stores to back off on hammering it. Let's see what it does naturally. What we're really going to the stores with is let's get our incremental sales growth above the historical pattern, and if we're able to do that, we'll give you labor. With that, we expect you to move your incremental pattern up. And if we're able to do that, we'll position ourselves in the first quarter of 2014 to have a very good year in 2014, and end 2013 on a stronger note.","Daniel L. Florness","And the other dynamic that's going on, and I also touched on this earlier, is right now, 44% of our stores have more than 10 vending machines. So we're not too far from half of our stores having more than 10 machines. We're going to have the impact of our centralized vending distribution model taking some pressure off the stores. So we'll see where that number takes us, from the standpoint of we've always been very good at being decentralized when it comes to decision-making, being more centralized when it comes to areas where we can be more efficient like distribution.","LeLand J. Hein","Dan, I'll just jump in. I think how to look at this is we trust our managers that -- John, I'm sorry. We trust our managers that if we give them more hours, they make more calls, what happens on those calls will dictate what happens in our sales. Whether it comes in the form of construction products, vending, national accounts, key accounts, what have you. They're saying \"Give us more hours, we'll make more calls,\" and then we let them determine what happens in the market based on where they make the call and what happens. And you really have to understand that the sales cycle of a branch and to the degree of what happens on the call.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And you guys -- I think you mentioned earlier about the impact or the absorption of the new salespeople and where you think you can offset that in the short term. And you've been able to keep that SG&A as a percent of sales in that 29%, 30% range. Is that -- so Dan, is that something you feel whether maybe if that goes up or you think you'd offset that with gross margins, is that kind of how you're looking at that in the near term?","Daniel L. Florness","I think we can maintain that range, or it will become challenging, and this is a good problem. If our sales growth moves up, and our profit payout moves up, it can move that percentage around, but I think we all would agree that'd be a good problem.","Operator","I'm not showing any other questions in the queue at this time, gentlemen.","Daniel L.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Ms. Ellen Trester. You may begin.","Ellen Trester","Welcome to the Fastenal Company 2017 first quarter earnings conference call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer. The call will last for up to 45 minutes and we will start with a general overview of our quarterly results and operations, with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers.","Today\u2019s conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal. No recording, reproduction, transmission or distribution of today\u2019s call is permitted without Fastenal\u2019s consent. This call is being audio simulcast on the Internet via the Fastenal Investor Relations homepage, investor.fastenal.com. A replay of the webcast will be available on the website until June 1, 2017 at midnight Central Time.","As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call may include statements regarding the Company\u2019s future plans and prospects. These statements are based on our current expectations and we undertake no duty to update them. It is important to note that the Company\u2019s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the Company\u2019s latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and we encourage you to review those factors carefully.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.","Dan Florness","Good morning, everybody and thank you for taking time today to listen to our first quarter earnings call. You will note two meaningful changes to our method of reporting from prior quarters, and I attribute that to our CFO and our Chief Accounting Officer, really challenging the format which we convey the information.","You will find a much more abbreviated earnings release document and then something new as we have a short slide deck to supplement the earnings call to help some of the talking points, I hope you find it useful. My comments are going to primarily center on the first two pages of commentary which I believe are pages 3 & 4 in the book, if you\u2019re looking at those pages.","Earlier this morning, and this is typical with every quarter end. At 7 this morning, central time, I had a call with our regional leaders and our national leaders, talk a bit about the quarter, give them some insight, a little bit about what we\u2019re going to cover on the call, but really just give some insight on the quarter.","I want to touch on a couple of points that were mentioned in that call and will dig into the slide deck. The first one and for those of you that have covered Fastenal for any period of time, you know that we are a sales-centered organization and growth-centered organization. That\u2019s been our D&A for 50 years and 2017 does mark our 50th year in business.","The first one centers on establishing goals and hitting goals. In the first quarter of 2017, we came in at roughly 101% of goal, 100.7% is the exact number, but roughly a 101% of goal. And we hit or exceeded goal every month of the first quarter. I mentioned that because part of growth is a mindset and attitude and I think we have a great mindset and a great attitude of going forward of serving our customers at a high level and challenging each other to grow and grow every day, every month, every quarter, and so very pleased with that.","The second item that I thought was noteworthy is, if you look across our 2,400 store locations, our 400 plus outside locations, look at our business in general. You always have customers that are going through different aspects in their business cycle. We might be growing handsomely with that customer because we are picking up market share. We might be growing nicely with that customer because their business is expanding or we might be contracting with that customer because their business is contracting, and that is true if every one of our stores; so in any given month, a percentage of our stores grow and a percentage of our stores don\u2019t.","In the first quarter, over 60% of our stores, about 62% of our stores grew. The last time we did better than that, it was in the first quarter of 2015, and I cite that because as we transitioned from the first quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2015, the oil and gas market of which we had a meaningful presence collapsed in North America, collapsed globally, collapsed in North America and our business suffered as a result. So, it\u2019s good to see us start participating from a store-to-store perspective in growth in a way we did before the oil and gas business dramatically slowed.","Getting on to the flip book here, first item mentioned, demand gains drove daily sales growth of 6%, 6.2% annually, again, our fastest growth since the first quarter of \u201915, so that my earlier comments go hand in hand. Our fastener sales, which are really indicators of the economy in all honesty, have struggled ever since the second quarter of 2015, and that business grew -- returned to growth in the first quarter and that business represents over a third of our revenue, about 36% to 37%.","Our non-fastener business grew at 9.5% and in the month of March grew almost 12%, so double-digit growth. So, very pleased with the trends in our business as it relates to both aspects of Fastenal fasteners and non-fasteners. Our pre-tax earnings grew 5.5%, it's the fastest rate of growth for us since the second quarter of \u201915. We achieved 20 basis points of operating expense leverage, and one thing about our business is, we have a tremendous amount of incentive comp, a tremendous amount of investments we make periodically in our business.","In 2015, we made dramatic investments, and as the economy weakened late in the year, we pulled those investments back. In 2016, it was a lot of about riding the ship, lowering some operating expenses, improving some operating expenses to set us up into\u201917 and \u201918 and beyond. I am pleased by the fact that we had 20 basis points of operating expense leverage, when you consider the fact that incentive comp, which was an historically low number in 2016 expanded nicely in the first quarter. But our incentive comp expands as our gross profit dollars and our earnings dollars grow, and so it expanded nicely, and that ate into some of it.","And our profit sharing contribution that goes to our employees in general expanded nicely from Q1 to Q1. Despite those natural headwinds, we obtained operating expense leverage. Very strong cash flow, first quarter is always strong for us as it for everybody in our industry because of the absence of a large tax payment, but very pleased with it. Our capital spending is at a lower level as we\u2019ve talked about on our first quarter call -- or excuse me, our January call, and we didn\u2019t have the CSP 16 investment driving our inventory increase.","In fact, if you remove the acquisition we did during the quarter from December to March, our inventory essentially held flat. Speaking of acquisition, on the last year of the quarter, we closed our acquisition of Manufacturers Supply Company or Mansco. It's about a $50 million distributor, so for the next 12 months, we\u2019ll enjoy about an extra point of growth from this acquisition.","Flipping on to our growth driver update on Page 2, some things I think are noteworthy. We\u2019ve got to a nice start on our onsite signs. We've signed 64 in the first quarter. We currently have 437 active onsite locations at a 51% increase from the 289 we had at the end of last year. And our goal remains to sign 275 to 300 onsite this year. That's a huge goal. Last year, we signed 176, which was more than doubling of the year before where we had signed 80. We also signed 5,437 vending units, a 17% increase from first quarter of last year.","I didn\u2019t go back and look at in detail, but it was either the early part of 2013 or during 2012, when vending initially exploded for us from the standpoint of we really gained traction. It's probably the last time we\u2019ve signed over 5,000 vending devices in the quarter, so very-very pleased with our start to the year. Our goal is to sign 22,000 to 24,000 for the year and very pleased with that. Probably the only challenge we had is, every year there is a certain number of machines that we pull out and that we pulled out some machines in the first quarter. But again very good traction as we enter the year and the sales to product to our vending machines grew double digits again.","National accounts grew over 9% during the quarter. We've talked in previous quarters about sales to our top 100 customers, 64 of our top on hundred customers grew with us, so that helped our national account number. Probably the one challenge point that I see when I look at that is, if our -- if national accounts represent roughly half of our business and our business grew at 6% and national accounts grew at 9%, it means the other half our business is growing in the low single digits, 3% or so.","That's a challenge and you see that challenge shine through a little bit on our gross margin. The one positive in that though is, as we exit the quarter that group of local other customers change from growing around 3% to 5.5%, so nice way to finish the quarter. And one of the things that driving that number up a bit is the CSP investment we've made last year and that group of products are growing about 10.5% in the first quarter.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Holden.","Holden Lewis","Great, thank you and good morning. Before jumping into the quarterly results, I do want to remind the listeners that as Dan said, we closed the acquisition of Mansco on March 31st, so what this means is our first quarter income statement is not going to reflect any of Mansco's revenues or cost, but our balance sheet will include the assumed working capital and asset. So bare that in mind and we\u2019ll call out when necessary when we\u2019re removing that information.","But flipping over now to Slide 5, as Dan has covered our Slide 3, our total and daily sales in the first quarter of 2017 were up 6.2%, that\u2019s a nice acceleration from up 2.7% in the fourth quarter. We do estimate that the benefit of the shift of Good Friday from March into April this year was about 50 basis point benefit to the quarter, but regardless even adjusting for this, the first quarter was the strongest that we\u2019ve seen in the last two years. And frankly that\u2019s strengthening was evidenced through the quarter with March finishing up 8.4%, now that does probably include about 100 to 150 basis points benefit from holiday timing in the month end particular, but again we just continue to see acceleration during the period.","On Page 5 of the presentation, first the point is that the backdrop against which we\u2019re operating, it really did continue to improve in the quarter. The Purchasing Managers' Index in the U.S. which still represents 88% of our revenue that averaged and improved to a pretty healthy reading of 57 in the period. Industrial production returned to growth with an even stronger showing from key subcomponents like primary metal, fabricated metal and machinery areas that are more pertinent to our business. And this broadening of industrial demand was reflected by the fact that as Dan alluded to the significantly greater number of our stores were actually growing in the first quarter relative to the 53% to 54% pace that had been set through 2016.","This general improvement showed up in other metrics that we track. Again, our Fastenal line returned to growth, finishing up 0.8% in the quarter. Growth at our largest customers as reflected by the national accounts accelerated to be up 9% in the quarter and that included up 11.5% in March. Growth among our manufacturing customers accelerated to be up 6.4% and our construction customers also returned to solid growth being up 4% in the quarter. The tone from the regional vice presidents mirrored these improvements.","here remains a great deal of enthusiasm around oil and gas, and during the quarter the outlook for the general manufacturing space and the construction space also improved even as the quarter we're on. The only laggard we could see would be manufacturing that\u2019s going into transportation markets, things like heavy duty truck, rail et cetera. But other than that, frankly on the hold customer demand strengthened and broadened throughout the quarter and we remain encouraged about the near-term trend.","Now flipping over to Slide 6, our gross margin was 49.4% in the first quarter which is down 40 basis points versus the first quarter last year. Now, we\u2019ve discussed before the ramifications of the relative growth in our non- Fastenal and large customer mix in the short and intermediate term, and that dynamic probably explains about 30 basis points of the declining gross margin this quarter. The remaining drag can be attributed to a couple of things.","First, net freight expense remained a challenge in the first quarter. That said, I do want to know that the freight revenue actually rose on an annual basis for the first time since the first quarter of 2015. On top of that, while the freight expense is a challenge, we did see the overall expense improved in the first quarter relative to where we were in the fourth quarter and the third quarter of last year. So, again that was an impact on our gross margin, but we saw some signs in improvement there.","Secondly, we did incur some cost in the period related to an inventory tracking initiatives that we have in some of our non-U.S. markets. These two things were partly offset by growth in the sales and margin of our Fastenal brands product, but collectively if you take the impacts of these latter items, they were relatively modest. And frankly if we ignore mix and just look at our Fastenal and non-Fastenal lines, margins were actually stable to slightly higher in the period. As it relates to pricing, there was not any meaningful impact from that source in the first quarter.","Now, our operating margin was 20.3% in the first quarter, that\u2019s down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis. But again given that our gross margin was down 40 basis points, frankly we believe our organization has done a really nice job leveraging operating expenses in the period. I am looking at a couple of numbers to make the point. Employee related expenses were up 3.7%.","This is well below sales growth, not despite the increase in bonus comps that Dan referred to, and it's a result of our being to grow our revenues with a 1.7% decline in our FTE headcount. I know we did add almost 200 new employees in the first quarter over the fourth and frankly if demand remains strong, we would expect that headcount to keep rising. However, we are committed to be disciplined with the headcount and continuing to leverage this line.","Occupancy related expenses were only up 1.2% in the quarter, that we had a 140 net store closures since the first quarter of last year and that includes 23 this quarter, and that results in the flattening of the store occupancy expense. The modest increase in cost then is mostly attributable to vending growth. The higher selling transportation related expenses were influenced by really with the 23% to 24% increase in the price of diesel and unleaded fuel in the period versus last year.","The incremental margin in the first quarter was 18.5%; however, we had been able to -- we\u2019ve been able to hold the gross margin steady. This would have been well north of 20%, and we continue to believe that assuming a stable growth margin we can achieve 20% to 25% incremental margins at low-to mid-single-digit growth and 25% plus incremental margins at mid-to high-single-digit growth in 2017.","Flipping to Slide 7, we generated 210 million in operating cash in the first quarter. Now, first quarters are seasonally stronger as the period tax is not due into April, but by any measure this was a record for any quarter. The amount also represents a 156.8% of the quarter\u2019s net income which is above last year\u2019s 131.9. Better earnings contributed as is working capital, which I\u2019ll address in a moment.","The net CapEx was 19.1 million and that\u2019s down 34% on lower spending on CSP 16 and DC Automation. As a result, our first quarter free cash flow was 191 million, up nearly 39%. We used the proceeds to pay 93 million in dividends. We obviously acquired Mansco and we still were able to low our debt in the period by 25 million to 365 million at the end of Q1. Our debt to total capital at the end of the quarter was 15.6%, modestly below the 16.9% a year ago and 16.8% in the fourth quarter of \u201916.","We view our balance sheet as conservatively capitalized with ample liquidity to continue investing in our business and pay our dividend. In terms of the working capital, we are really comfortable with where the numbers came out. Receivables growth, if you exclude Mansco, was up about 6.5% in the quarter. And now, it's consistent with the growth in sales. Inventory, if you exclude Mansco, was up almost 3% in the first quarter, but it was flattish sequentially. And this reflects the absence of last year\u2019s heavy CSP-related inventory investment. It also reflects though just greater productivity from our distribution center, and I think more energy enterprise-wide focusing on this line.","Payables, if you exclude Mansco, were down about 19%. Last year\u2019s payables reflected the aggressive inventory investment we\u2019re making for CSP 16. So, we had an easy comp there. The second quarter of 2017 should have seasonally lower operating cash flow, but better earnings in the absence of CSP spending suggest good cash flow for the full year. Similarly, we continue to anticipate lower CapEx in 2017 of approximately $120 million due to less spending on the DC Automation and the leased lockers.","That\u2019s all we have for our formal presentation. And with that, we\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Manthey with Baird.","David Manthey","First of all, Holden, I think you said that gross margin within the fasteners and the non-fasteners were each higher, but the mix was the thing that drove that 30 basis points of the gross margin degradation. Did I catch that right?","Holden Lewis","That\u2019s correct. If you look at just fasteners and non-fasteners without considering sort of the mix of those, you had margins that were slightly higher in both cases.","David Manthey","Great. Okay. So, as it relates to gross margins, two questions here. First, I\u2019m wondering if you can help us understand the range of gross margin from sort of highest product to lowest and not to get specific on what those percentages are. But just that we understand the delta between the high and the low, and I\u2019m thinking sort of the 80\/20 rule here, products you sell everyday, not manufactured or modified products, but y just sort of general products available for sale. Could you just help us understand what the difference is between the high and the low? And then the second part of the question is, you mentioned that if you can keep the gross margin flat, you can get to 25% plus contribution margin. Assuming that this mix shift is going on is pretty much of secular trend given your growth initiative. If you\u2019re able to keep gross margin flat, what would be the mechanism that would get you there that you haven't been able to achieve over the past several years?","Dan Florness","I\u2019m going to chime in and help Holden with that question just given my years. First off, David, if you've know from the prior conversations, range of margins in our business are quite dramatic, depending on -- are you selling something that\u2019s a relatively low value, a convenience pack time or something in our store that it is, I need it right now and price really doesn't matter, I just need that item to -- I\u2019m basically brokering a transaction and I am getting paid a fee for brokering and I am buying a palette of this product or something. So, I mean the ranges can be from the teens to 80%. I mean, if you really want to get crazy with it, but if you look at the bulk of our business, you really have a range that goes from probably the mid 30s to the low 60s.","And our fastener product line runs in the 50s, our non-fastener products as a group run in the 40s. And that kind of gives you some semblance of it, and you can see that play out when you\u2019re looking at a lot of our competitors and where their gross margins are in relative to the products they sell. And the only wildcard I throw into that would be the fact that, in our industry we're a little bit unique in that we have one of the lowest cost structures for freight. And we all sell our product line that by and large a lot of items have relatively low value per pound. So freight becomes a big deal and as structural advantages, we have for years to come.","If you look at some of the things that we have done or can do to manage to offset a piece of that mix shift. And I think it\u2019s just that, we\u2019ll be able to offset a piece of that overtime because we\u2019ve talked about our onsite strategy. And what that means, just like we talked about our vending strategy or we talked about our non-fastener strategy 10 and 20 years ago. All those things, over time lowered our gross margin and the way we offset it, one is by better sourcing, and one is by structurally challenging ourselves to lower our trucking costs, and those are things we\u2019ve done very effectively over the last 20 years. Third one is continuing to grow our exclusive brand offerings.","And so, it\u2019s really a case of looking at it and saying, here are our branded supplier offerings and working closely with those brands to grow that business, but over time maybe narrow some of those brands. The other one is having a strategy for exclusive brands. Today in the non-fastener world, exclusive brands are about 20% of our revenue. If you were looking at that a decade ago, it was probably 10% of our revenue. And I really don\u2019t see a reason why that can't be closer to 30 at some point in time. So continuing to challenge and carve out different pieces, and you can bring the cost savings to your customer and improve your gross margin at the same time.","David Manthey","It\u2019s helpful Dan. Thank you and best of luck over the next 50 years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Ryan Merkel with William Blair.","Ryan Merkel","So I\u2019m going to follow up on Dave\u2019s question. I guess, well I was sort of wondering, you mentioned that mix was a 30 basis point year-over-year headwind. So, should we assume that that continues for the rest of the year or is there something that you\u2019re thinking about that could lessen that impact?","Holden Lewis","I think given where our mix is going, I think you can look to us several years to probably have a headwind like that. I mean our growth drivers when you think about onsite and safety and vending and things like that, I mean, they lend themselves to that. So, do I think that given where we\u2019re seeing our growth, that that is a reality each quarter of this year, it is. Now, as Dan alluded to, we still hope that there are some things that are going to contribute to somewhat better -- to somewhat better gross margins. Exclusive brands are something we talk about a lot. I called out the freight a little bit, because again while freight was a bit of a drag in the first quarter, there were some signs that perhaps the freight picture is getting a little bit better and hopefully as we go into Q2 and Q3, we\u2019ll make further strides on that to help us sort of dig into that that more structural decline if you will.","So, I think the answer is, yes. The structural mix is you were certainly there, but we think that we have means by wish to dig into that, if you will and improve. Also bear in mind that, we\u2019re coming into the Q1 gross margin, when we think about the decline versus the fourth quarter. Some of that reflected the fact of the fourth quarter was an extremely strong period and we went and listed a couple of things. I mean, one thing we looked at was, fourth quarter of \u201916 was up 40 basis points over the third quarter. If you look back historically, what fourth quarters typically do against third? So, I spotted that -- I\u2019m sorry, 50 basis points against it. If you look back historically, what Q4 typically looks like against Q3? It\u2019s been more like a 60 basis points decline.","And last quarter, we called out we didn\u2019t deleverage the trucking network as much as the historically perhaps have, and we had a number of other things that were small individually, but added up they just went our way. So, I think a better way to think about the quarter -- about the first quarter number is, historically, if you look at how Q1 plays our versus the prior year Q3. We were actually up 10 basis points versus last year's Q3. And historically, we\u2019re down a couple of 20 basis points or so again the proceeding five years. So, we believe that we should be able to dig more into that structural decline than we did this quarter, but we feel like we\u2019re making some progress on the freight, on the EBs and things of that sort. And yes, where we don\u2019t view this as a de-gradation in our margin picture by any means.","I'll just add a couple of thoughts to that. So fourth quarter -- or excuse me, third quarter we were at 49.3%. Here in the first quarter, we\u2019re at 49.4%. I always look at fourth quarter is being noisy, whether it's up or down. The other thing is, if you look at our the $60 million in growth we\u2019ve had in the last 12 months, 50% of that came from either onsite or vending. And so, there is a certain weighting that goes in there and we need to be executing better every day to offset the piece of that waiting. When I look at the margin in the first quarter, the only thing that I'm troubled by is, there is about 10 to 15 basis points in there that I find just personally frustrating, but, I think we\u2019re executing quite a lot.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. So, few things go your way, your framework for 25% to 30% incremental margins at mid single-digit, high single-digit growth that still profitable for this year, but you do need to freight and you probably need mix helping you a little bit. Is that fair?","Dan Florness","Well, I mean next two quarters, our comps change quite dramatically because we still were a relative -- if you think what's going on in 2015 and near the part of the 2016. We were getting traction on the onsite model. We were correcting some, getting some traction and fixing some things and some customers were improving from the standpoint of our vending model. So, if you think the growth has been occurring in the last 12 months and how that compares to the components of our business that were there in the 12 months prior to that, Q1 of 2016 is kind of that one of those half -- last high water marks and again, every year I ignore Q4, whether it\u2019s a good or bad number that settle things in fix and much of anything.","So, yes, the commentary around the incremental margins is really to try to make a point that we believe from an operating expense standpoint that we deleverage of those lines, and that\u2019s despite the fact that we are -- as we grow, obviously we have that shock absorber effect coming from incentive comp and that sort of thing. But the points about the sort of the leverage, those incremental margins is, we feel that we can continue to leverage those lines and we did a nice job leveraging those lines in Q1, and we think that we\u2019ll continue to do a good job leveraging those lines. And yes, if the gross margins cooperate then we do have some easier gross margins to compare against in Q2 to Q3. But, if the gross margins are stable then we think that we can get the kind of incremental margins that we spoken about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets.","Scott Graham","Obviously, a little bit more on this operating leverage. So, if you were to sort of sketch out, how you generate operating leverage, gross income versus your O&A expenses? Is there a way to look at this with sales, whether your sales where for it is and where the trends are going, mid to high single. Does that give you -- is that more of a gross margin thing leverage or SG&A and then sort of a higher level or let\u2019s say low to mid single? Does that switch between those two lines? Could you kind of maybe sketch out how you look at that?","Holden Lewis","So, again, the guidance that we\u2019ve sort of given on that is, if we hold gross margin stable then we think that we can get those types of incremental margins, just by leveraging the SG&A as we grow. So, when we envision discussing those incremental margin levels, I mean that really talked about leveraging our SG&A more so than the gross profit. And again, we saw some good signs of that, we talked a little bit about how employment grew and occupancy grew from a cost standpoint.","But if you really look at it, when we think about like sales per head for instance, that was up 10% during the quarter, right, because we grew revenues nicely on slightly lower activity. Those are sort of the keys to how we get the type of incremental margins that we hope to get, but the discussion that we\u2019ve had was really wanted to address our ability to leverage our operating expenses and intending to hold gross margin flat. So, if we can achieve significant improvements in our gross margin, I think that that\u2019s additive but again that\u2019s working against the structural mix that we\u2019re talking about.","Scott Graham","Yes, I guess I get that holding, but where I guess where I am confirmed on this is that, if you\u2019re putting more stuff in a box, we\u2019re putting more boxes in the truck. There should be gross margin leverage on that too, right?","Holden Lewis","Well, that would be the leverage on the freight side in that year, you're having better utilization. First off, we have really excellent utilization of our trucking network to-date and so, it's not so much about you putting more boxes into a truck, it's -- those boxes you\u2019re putting into the truck. What customer are they going to? What\u2019s the nature of the business? You know, if it\u2019s a box or an item that\u2019s going to vending machine and it\u2019s a safety product, it's going to have a different margin profile than if it's a box of fastener that\u2019s going to an MRO user.","And so, it's really depending on what that box is destined for. The other thing to remember is as a distributor, the very large majority of the cost that runs through COGS for us is simply the cost of the product. So there maybe pieces within COGS that we can get leverage on, but at the end of the day, the very large majority of what goes through cost on COGS is going to be the cost of the product.","Scott Graham","Okay, got you. And then follow-up question essentially is on share repurchases. Is there a point in time? Is there, I\u2019m sure if you worked this carefully through an ROIC analysis and all that. Is there some type of trigger for share repurchase in \u201917 that you envision?","Holden Lewis","I will spend on that one. We have no trigger price as this will buyback or we won\u2019t buyback. That's a conversation we have with our Board on regular basis, we have not been in the market for some time. Historically, we have preferred to use our excess cash from the perspective of investing in the business, investing in our growth and if in case were we\u2019re not drilling enough to use up all the cash generate because the cash we generate is quite attractive. History has said, the bulk of that cash, we return to our shareholders in the form of dividend and that\u2019s just the way we structurally had it overtime. Our dividend release went out last evening has a good 10-year history to give you a perspective on that. No secret anyway in this call, our stock periods and then attractive multiple.","And the periods where you\u2019ve seen it, we\u2019ve had some periods with a multiple fell off and we took some excess cash where we took some -- we incurred some borrowings to buy back some stock. But we focus our energy -- we really focus on time and energy on growing the business long term because we think that\u2019s in the best interest of our shareholder. And in the short term, we return a fair part among the cash through a dividend. If you then recall that, I mean last year we had the leased locker program show up which is not something that so expected to begin the year and our first priority is to use our resources to be able to grow. And so we had a very nice quarter in Q1 by any measure. Q2 won\u2019t be as high and we use some of those resources to acquire great company and\u2026","Dan Florness","I'd say Q2 won\u2019t be slightly come up with cash.","Holden Lewis","In terms of the cash, correct, relative to earnings, just because of the double tax payments. But in Q1 we use the resources to buy great company and as a result our leverage is based in the same area that it has been for some time, and at this point we prefer to kind of look for other opportunities internally to spend -- to spend our resources on and like we did last year you never know when they\u2019re going to come up. So that remains a priority and what we are looking for.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert McCarthy","Holden, just one housekeeping item, which I am holding, I think we discussed, but just on Page 10 of your well-applauded new slide deck, you have the new benchmark out and just to remind, I think myself and investors, this is a new benchmark, the one you've published, right, that's going to be taking into account the five year average from \u201812 to \u201816 as opposed from a \u201811 to \u201815. Is that correct?","Holden Lewis","That\u2019s correct and last year\u2019s documents, we had two benchmarks that we were referring to. One was sort of our historic way of looking at it, which looked at most years from 1998 and then other one was sort of the five year average that last year would have included 2011 to 2015. As the calendar rolls forward so did our five year average into 2012 to 2016, and that\u2019s where we are focusing on now for a benchmark.","Robert McCarthy","Perfect. Okay. Just want to make sure people saw that. Now just in terms of on the fastener side of the house, what\u2019s your expectation for could you review and I do apologize, if you already kind of walk through this. Your expectations for what you saw for price in the quarter in terms of growth and then what are your expectations for the balance of year in terms of what we can see in place on the fastener side of the house?","Holden Lewis","Right. So, pricing was not a meaningful factor in the quarter. Price is something that we just continue to review at this point. Now, we obviously have seen some of our competitors take price increases. Many of them have talked about it publicly. We've seen charts where prices for metals are clearly up. So, it\u2019s hard to conclude anything other than the environment today is certainly more inflationary, that has been quite some time. But that said, Fastenal has the advantage of being a FIFO company with a pretty long supply chain for fasteners and that means it takes a while for cost to hit our COGS.","And that gives us the ability to evaluate how durable the marketplace is for pricing, and if you remember last year there was a time or two where we thought pricing could occur and then it wound up not materializing for probably demand reasons. And so, it\u2019s nice to be able to get that sort of look, if you will. I think the real question at this point is, if the marketplace in fact does look like it\u2019s going to be willing to accept pricing, is that something that we believe, we can get to protect our margins and protect our place in the market. And the answer is that, we think that we can, but we do have some time to evaluate at this point.","Robert McCarthy","I mean just looking at the math whether be any way to those price actions say the inflation did well attractive in this context for the balance of the year. Do you think, you could overcome the mix headwind in the gross margins? Will that math work or not?","Holden Lewis","Oh, in the short-term? Yes, surely.","Robert McCarthy","Yes. So, there is not used that for that to occur?","Holden Lewis","Yes. But keep in mind our inventory turns twice the year roughly. So, I mean, it would be -- it'd be short-lived event.","Robert McCarthy","And then the last question because I know you want to move onto others on the call. Could you just talk about perhaps March in terms of your expectations kind of exiting February, taking into account the Easter shift, how you feel about the months? And how you feel about kind of the prospects exiting the months?","Holden Lewis","We felt better and better I think as the quarter we're on.","Dan Florness","And the months.","Holden Lewis","Yes and the months were on. When I think about the feedback that we\u2019re getting from our regional Vice President about their marketplace, we talk about how -- in December we started to getting some pretty story that on the oil and gas business that we\u2019re translating on the ground, but by the time you\u2019ve got to February, you\u2019re starting to see the oil and gas business really sort of pick-up again and showing itself in results. And frankly through March are continued to be case, I think they remain enthusiasm from that area. But what we began to see began to gain some real excitement as we based in February and then into March was the manufacturing site.","And frankly the construction side, they\u2019re seems have been a consensus that is come together through March from our regional that construction is doing much better and I think you can see some of that in the growth of the CSP products, I mean the fact they grew 10% plus in the quarter, I think some construction as well. So even as recently in December, the marketplace didn\u2019t feel that great, but as we proceeded through the quarter and through the month of March. There was clear progress and improvement in the tender of the marketplace.","Robert McCarthy","Was there re-budgeted into the Easter shift during the April? I mean, how should we think about, it more than, Rob, 200 basis points in March or is that actually more favorable March rather? Would we expect further deceleration in April?","Holden Lewis","In quarter, the shift costs us about 50 basis points. In March, they cost us about a 150. It\u2019s probably around 5 -- it's probably around third of the day, if you think about it Rob, historically. So, it gave us probably not $5 million lift in March and you probably get it back in April.","Dan Florness","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna.","Robert Barry","Thanks for all the nice earnings day materials. I wanted to follow up on this op margin -- sorry op leverage outlook. You keep referring to stable gross margin, but just given where the growth is coming from and it also sounds like we\u2019re going to continue seeing some gross margin pressure here for a little while. So, is the bottom-line it for now op leverage is likely to be more in high-teens level or maybe even a little lower given the headcount is started to grow?","Holden Lewis","Yes. I mean, again, the motivation was just to emphasize the degree of which we think we can leverage operating expenses, right. That\u2019s why we talk about it with the presumption that we hold gross margins stable. Now, as Dan alluded to, gross margins are much higher in Q1 than they'll be in Q2, Q3, so we\u2019ll see what happens there. But, we remain committed to be able to achieve the leverage of the operating expenses. And we\u2019re going to just keep you at work to try to dig into the structural decline in the gross margin that you start with. And we certainly had that conversation with our regionals and our folks. So, I think that there were some early signs that would in the freight side that maybe there is some progress there. So, we\u2019re just going to have to keep working on improving the gross margin metric. But we do anticipate getting the leverage.","With regards to the headcount, we would expect that to move up as demand goes up and also as we continue to accelerate our onsite timings. We onsite signing take some folks in the store and we would like to backfill those and really get a lot of energy in that store to keep growing from the new base. And so as growth in our growth drivers continue to move up than we would expect to add head. But again, we saw some good productivity in Q1, and we\u2019re not just looking to give that productivity up. We got to do something to support our growth, but we\u2019re not looking to begin to dilute that productivity by adding heads too quickly.","Robert Barry","Got you. I mean I don\u2019t want to beat the dead horse here, but just to connect to dot. I mean it sounds like if gross margin is stable you can lever in the 20s. If gross margin continue to move down then we\u2019re probably levering in the teens. Is that fair?","Holden Lewis","A couple of things I'll throw in -- in terms of what your top line growth assessment is. In the previous call, we've said south of 6% to 7% is difficult with the cost components we had coming out of 2015 and then through the first part of 2016. But that picture improves and lowers it some, and that's why you saw our ability to grow our operating expenses roughly 5.5%. And if you think what that, you have to take a look at what drove the operating expense increase when you look at Q1-to-Q1. I often try to pull things into some buckets so I can think about it easier.","25% to 30% of that increase is incentive comp whether it's in the commissioning in a store of bonus paid to some of the outside the store, the profit sharing contribution, so things that are expanding as a profit growth improves. That\u2019s really what drives our labor cost to increase right now, it's not so much what headcount because the headcount you're adding typically and it appear this a lot of it is more on the entry level side so you could manage through that. If you think what's the next biggest group of cost that drove our expense up. We\u2019ve been -- it's no secretly that we\u2019ve been increasing our IT spend over a number of years.","We have some pieces that are turning on actually this quarter that will help out of store or our onsite model quite meaningfully. We\u2019re turning out our new website in Canada. So the things that we\u2019re turning on that are spiteful investments, those investments we\u2019ve been making and have been won through our P&L and the other component and I think that second bucket that was a jump from last year was the few of that Holder talked about. It\u2019s a big increase in our cost component, that piece of it normalize than Q2, because last year from Q1 to Q2 fuel prices jumped up dramatically, so we'll left that in Q2, but we haven't left in Q1.","The final driver of increases is the continued success that we\u2019re seeing in vending. When we add those vending there is an expense that shows up in our occupancy around the cost of the equipment. So those things are really what driving it and outside of that, managing the expense really-really quite well. And so, it puts us in a position when we go into the later part of the year, I believe that we\u2019ll be able to be more optimistic.","Dan Florness","Thanks everybody, its 45, 46 minutes past the hour. Thank you for your interest in Fastenal. I\u2019ll close to where I started. I am pleased quite frankly with the quarter from the standpoint of the business is executing better, our end markets have given us some lift or given ourselves some lift. Thank you.","Holden Lewis","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today\u2019s presentation.

","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness. ","Dan Florness","Thanks Ellen and good morning everybody, and welcome to the fourth quarter conference call for Fastenal. Before we delve into Holden\u2019s flip book, I just want to touch on a few things. ","If I go back in time to late 2015 or just 2015 in general, we\u2019d seen a dramatic slowdown in the economic we sell into. We\u2019d had a tough year. I was stepping into this role and I remember the first comment I made to the team was, hey folks, we have a ton of great things we can do for our customer, that we can do for our employees, our suppliers and our shareholders that\u2019s focused on the future, and let\u2019s just get going. In 2016, it was a year of investment. We invested in inventory in our branch network to support our customer. We invested in growth drivers of the business and the infrastructure to support those growth drivers, and as all you recall, we had a tough year from the standpoint of nominal growth but we really grew our expenses and our working capital because we were setting ourselves up to be a better supply chain partner for our customer.","In 2017, armed with an economy that was not kicking us in the face but was actually giving us a little bit of tailwind, we looked at the team and said, you know what? Let\u2019s grow our sales and earnings this year, and when I talk about earnings, I\u2019m not talking just about Fastenal, I\u2019m talking about our people too. We did a nice job that year of doing all three.","In 2019, we\u2019ve improved that from the standpoint I think we found a better balance in growing the aspects of our business, and one thing that was really important to us was an incremental margin that started with a two. The second half of the year, we\u2019ve been able to deliver that. It was good enough in the second half of the year that we produced it for the year, and that\u2019s an important component because it\u2019s not just about growth but it\u2019s about profitable growth and creating opportunities for your customer and your employee in the process.","In 2019, I think that mantra is let\u2019s find a little bit more balance and let\u2019s extend what we\u2019re doing it already, but let\u2019s extend it to the cash flow statement and really hit all pieces and rewards all constituencies. Speaking of constituencies, we keep it really simple here - there\u2019s four. There\u2019s customers, there\u2019s employees, there\u2019s suppliers, and there\u2019s shareholders. It has to work for all four for our business to be successful short term and long term, and we look at everything with a long-term perspective but we try to have a short term edge to it, to have a sense of urgency.","From a customer perspective, the biggest thing that we do every day is we thank them for their business. Thank you for trusting, embracing our supply chain partnership. The supply chain is critical to each and every one of our customers, and I thought I\u2019d share a few tidbits out of a recent customer letter that came in. It was an unsolicited letter that I received last week. It was a customer where we had taken on--we signed an onsite earlier in the year. It\u2019s been a customer for years from an MRO perspective, but we took on their OEM fasteners, and as we\u2019ve talked in the past, OEM fasteners is a very intimate relationship because we\u2019re selling them not just the stuff they need in their facility, we\u2019re selling them the components of what they\u2019re representing and selling to their customer. We\u2019re part of their DNA in the OEM fastener world, and the letter touched on a handful of bullets about the business. ","It first talked about the bidding process. The last sentence in a brief paragraph, Fastenal by far presented the best with the most advantages for present and future growth. Fastenal is the best option. From a transition and implementation, again that\u2019s a scary place for a customer to be because your production line is dependent on hiccups that can occur in a transition, and the second sentence in this paragraph, Fastenal immediately brought onsite a team of professionals with a lead implementation person that managed through each item of inventory with each group function within our company, and not seen a single stock-out situation within our company. Communication was and is top notch on all matters. ","Urgency - Fastenal\u2019s communication and sense of urgency has been exceptional. Engineering support - knowledge support and testing that we get now on all parts is exceptional. Sourcing - we have been able to keep current manufacturers as well as looking at other options for cost savings. The value we bring is the high level of service, but it\u2019s also an opportunity to challenge status quo and take costs out of supply chain. That\u2019s what we do for our customer. It\u2019s not just about fulfillment - that\u2019s an important component, but it\u2019s also about bringing the supply chain knowledge to lower your cost and improve yours and your customer\u2019s value proposition in the marketplace.","Service support - Fastenal onsite management has been exceptional, and our letter closes to say, we look at Fastenal as an extension of our company and with the onsite service we have, our folks don\u2019t have any doubt on where to go. So I thought I\u2019d share that letter. It was really fun to receive it. I called the individual that sent it and personally thanked her, but it\u2019s really indicative of what our business and our onsite strategy is about as it relates to engaging with our customer. ","Secondly, employees. We grew our business 13% in the last 12 months. Our FTE growth is up about 6%. Now, it\u2019s no secret in the marketplace there is some inflation going on because it\u2019s a tight labor market. There is also--when you have advancements in the organization, folks that are stepping into leading a new onsite, maybe you were the second or third person at a branch before, getting added to our implementation team, our national accounts sales team, our industrial services teams, all the teams within Fastenal, our base pay we saw increase about 9%, so on a 6% increase in headcount, base pay is up about 9%. Some of that is inflation, some of that is advancements in positions within the organization because of the opportunity our team and our customers are creating. ","Incentive compensation, that\u2019s commissions at the branch, that\u2019s incentive to our leaders, that\u2019s incentive to the folks in support areas of our organization, despite the fact that it had grown handsomely in 2017, it grew again in 2018 - it\u2019s up 20%. Profit sharing, we share the rewards of the business with everybody in the business. From 2017 to 2018, I\u2019m proud to say our profit sharing contribution this year is up about 24%. Despite all that, we were able to leverage our employee cost, which meant we were able to leverage our SG&A. Total employee costs are up about 11%.","Another way to think about it--there\u2019s a lot of ways to think about productivity, and productivity is key to our current and future success because it\u2019s bringing greater value to the customer but doing it in a more cost efficient manner. Every dollar we spent in payroll in 2017 translated into a $1.02 of profit, so we had $881 million of profit last year, we spent $862 million in total payroll. Holden\u2019s probably cringing right now that I\u2019m sharing that number because people will want it again and again and again - sorry, Holden. But I think that\u2019s an important component of our business, but despite all the investments we made in people and resources in the last year, the last three years, in 2018 we spent $962 million in total payroll costs. That\u2019s everything in there - base pay, incentive, profit sharing, Social Security taxes, workers\u2019 comp, health insurance. Everything added up, we spent $962 million but it didn\u2019t generate $1.02 of profit, it generated $1.04. We generated $999 million, essentially $1 billion in profit in the last 12 months. That\u2019s productivity, and I\u2019m really excited what that means for our team. I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to expand that in the future. ","Our suppliers, that third constituent, they\u2019ve had a really successful few years with us. Suppliers that have been willing to evolve and change to support our vending business in the last 10 years, our onsite business in the last three, four years, our construction business, our national account business, our local business, a Fastenal model, have had really successful years. I\u2019ve met with a lot of them over the last two months, and really excited about what 2019 can mean and what they\u2019re seeing downstream in their business.","Finally, shareholders. Our shareholders haven\u2019t been rewarded as well. Our stock has been a little bit in purgatory, it feels like, for a period of years. We\u2019ve started to move out of it, though, and we were seeing that, some in \u201917, some in \u201918. Our sector, no secret to the folks on this call, has been a bit of a multiple compression, and we\u2019ve tried to offset some of that by strong dividends and buyback aspects. I\u2019m pleased to say when I look at that press release we just put out last night on our dividend and our stock buybacks, if I take the dividend we just declared for the first quarter of 2019 and extend it to the year, assuming we pay about the same each quarter, and look at the last nine year and add the $600 million of buybacks we\u2019ve done, we have returned almost $4 billion - $3.85 billion, to be exact, to our shareholders in a business that\u2019s thrived and grown in that timeframe, and we\u2019ve essentially doubled in size in that 10-year timeframe from a little over $2 billion to about $5 billion in revenue.","In the last five years, we\u2019ve returned about 65% of that number, about $2.5 billion, and on a $15.5 billion market cap we\u2019ve returned about 16% of that number over the last five years. We\u2019re proud of that number and we believe we have the ability to grow that in the future. We just need to work on our cash flow statement a little bit better to be able to juice that even further.","Turning to the flip book, and before we start in on that, I do want to cite--you know, I mentioned the aspect of employees within Fastenal, a part of our blue team. There\u2019s a few blue team members I want to cite right now. First is we have two employees that are going to hit a really big milestone, and we believe in service and milestones, and every year at our Florida event we recognize our 25-year employees. We actually have two employees here in 2019 that are going to recognize 40 years of service within Fastenal. ","The first one is Nick Lundquist. He joined us in 1979. In March, he will hit 40 years with the company. He must have started when he was about 10, 10 or 11 years old, because he\u2019s got the--the spunk he has in him and the dedication he brings to the organization every day is impressive, and he continues to develop people around him, which is the sign of a great leader. The second person is Dana Johnson. In August, Dana will celebrate 40 years with the organization. Dana might not be as well known to this group. Dana leads our property area and over the years, Dana has had a multitude of roles within the organization, and the professionalism and the talent he brings to every role he serves is impressive. I congratulate both of them on the 40-year milestone this year.","Speaking of blue team, two people that are particularly close to me within Fastenal recently lost a parent. In December, Renee Weisska [ph] lost her father, and here several weeks ago Nick Lundquist lost his mother. Both of those individuals enjoyed long lives, they had great families, but for Nick and Maria and for Renee and John, you\u2019re an important part of our blue team family and our condolence and prayers are with you.","Now let\u2019s flip to the book.","Fourth quarter 2018 came in at $0.59. There\u2019s a discrete tax item in there. A little bit of noise in tax items in the last four or five quarters, something about a new tax law signed in the U.S. creates a little bit of noise. Absent this, our EPS would have been $0.60 for the quarter. Adjusting for discrete items in both years, EPS grew about 14%. ","Demand is strong - 13.2% sales growth in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s our sixth quarter of at least 13% growth. We continued to execute really well on our growth drivers, and I\u2019ll touch on that in a few minutes. Operating leverage remains strong. We have gross margin pressure. Some of that is self-imposed because our growth drivers naturally lower our gross margin, but inflation and more recently tariffs are creating some ripples in our business. Despite that, we had incremental margin of 21% in the quarter. ","Prices are trending favorably, and when I talk about price and cost in these discussions, price is our sale price to our customer. Cost is the inbound, whether that is the cost of goods cost, a freight cost, or an opex cost; but I\u2019ll try to use those terminologies to be more concise in how we describe things. Price trended favorably, but it\u2019s still lagging cost inflation a bit and that is pressuring our gross margin more than just pure mix. Holden will touch on that in greater detail. As you all know, List 3 of the tariffs did impact Fastenal, but most of the impact is on the working capital. They added to inventory late in the year, and again Holden will touch on that.","One things that\u2019s positive, we have a supply chain relationship with our customers. Tariffs and inflation are not a foreign concept, no pun intended, to our customers, and those discussions are going well and I\u2019m encouraged about what we saw in the month of December, what we\u2019re seeing in January, February and March--what we expect to see in February and March as it relates to our ability to pass through those tariffs or, better yet, find better cost options for our customer. In many cases, that involves substitution.","Q4 cash generation continues to be impacted by the working capital trends; however, we were still able to return $177 million to our shareholders via repurchase and dividends while retaining what I would consider a pretty flexible capital structure. ","Now let\u2019s go to the growth drivers, Page 4. Onsites - the team really is making progress there. When I think about back in 2014, we had a couple of hundred onsites, we were adding 10 a year which mean 3 to 5% of our district managers were really engaged in this game. The rest of the folks were really engaged in the more traditional side of our business plus the vending that we\u2019ve introduced in the last 10 years. We started to change that in 2015 and we went into high gear in \u201916, \u201917 and \u201918. In 2015, about 25% of our district managers signed an onsite. Next year, that went to 50; last year, it was in the low 70s, and we always talked about let\u2019s drive that to 80%. If we drive that to 80%, we are an onsite company because we\u2019re engaged in it throughout the business, not in a subset of our business. In 2018, 79% of our district managers signed an onsite. We will pierce that number of 80% in 2019, and I\u2019m really excited about what that means for our ability to keep growing and manage the business.","However, when you go from 200 onsites to 900 onsites in a few short years, you do deleverage that business quite dramatically, and so our average onsite back in 2014 did $150,000 a month. Today, our average onsite does $120,000 a month, and it isn\u2019t because we\u2019re lowering the bar on opportunity, it\u2019s because we have a whole bunch of really young onsites and that\u2019s deleveraging the business. But on the flipside of that coin, our branch network has been leveraging like crazy, and that\u2019s what allowed us to maintain an incremental margin in the last two years of a low 20%. ","But onsites, we signed 336 for the year - not quite our goal, our goal was pretty aggressive, but well above the 270 of last year. We have 48% more active sites today than we did just a year ago, and our goal for next year is 375 to 400. ","Vending - we have really breathed new life into vending. The team has done a wonderful job in the last few years. We met our goal for the year - we signed 22,073. We signed over 90 a day in the third quarter - incredible milestone in my mind, and our install base ended the year at just over 81,000, about a 14% increase from last year. Product sales through those devices is up more than 20%. For next year, our goal is 23,000 to 25,000. I told the team there\u2019s 254 days next year - if we hit 100 a day, that\u2019s 25,400. It\u2019s really nice number, but our stated goal is 23,000 to 25,000.","One thing that isn\u2019t mentioned in this list of bullets is construction. When we were making these investments back in \u201916, \u201917 and \u201918, a big one was inventory in our branch network. We had languished in the construction market for the better part of a decade with growth between 3 and 4% - very un-Fastenal-like. We were focused on other things and we lost our sight on construction. Between putting inventory in our branch, opening the door to our customer and we had a great local plan, and in the process beginning the development of a good national and international plan, our construction business is now not growing 3 or 4%, it\u2019s growing 15% as we exit the year. The construction market itself has grown about 5% -the end market. We\u2019re tripling that. That\u2019s market share gains and it\u2019s about a great team going after that market, being prepared. ","We ended the year with just over 3,100 locations versus 2,988 a year ago, despite the fact we closed 157 branches. That leveraging we\u2019re getting in our system is coming from people leverage and occupancy leverage, and we\u2019re converting those closed locations into ever more customer serving locations by moving onsite, by moving in and lowering our cost structure and improving our value proposition to our customer. ","National accounts, they had an outstanding year - 18% growth in the fourth quarter. Large customer growth was also 18% for the entire year. Our non-U.S. daily sales [indiscernible] grew at mid to high teens rate and slightly below in the latter part of the year, Europe and Asia have slowed a little bit and currency has given us some headwind. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Holden.","Holden Lewis","Great, thank you, Dan. Good morning. I\u2019m going to begin with a quick recap of our 2018 results before moving onto the quarter. In 2018, Fastenal generated a record $4.97 billion in sales, which is up 13.1% from 2017. We generated at least 13% growth in each quarter of the year, reflecting what have been stable and sustained macro tailwinds as well as effective execution of our growth drivers. To touch on those growth drivers, for onsites we signed 336 new agreements in 2018. That was shy of our 360 to 385 goal, but it\u2019s well above last year\u2019s 270 signings. If I exclude the branch transfer revenues, sales through onsites grew more than 20% for the full year. We\u2019re targeting 375 to 400 signings in 2019.","For vending, we finished 2018 with more than 81,000 installed product dispensing machines, which is up 13.6% over 2017. Our 2018 signings of 22,073 machines were up 14% and around the midpoint of our 21,000 to 23,000 signing goal for the year. Sales through our machines rose more than 20% in 2018, and we\u2019re targeting 23,000 to 25,000 signings in 2019.","Lastly, national accounts paced the overall business with sales growth to our largest customers in 2018 accelerating to up 18.1%. We were active with new signings, but this acceleration also reflects success in expanding our sales to existing customers. Though today they represent a relatively small part of our business, we also continue to see healthy growth in our non-North American revenues as well as sales through our ecommerce channel.","Our operating margin was flat year to year at 20.1% in 2018. This stability does mask improved leverage as the year progressed, with our operating margin expanding by about 30 basis points in the second half of 2018. Our gross margin finished 2018 at 48.3%, down 100 basis points largely from product and customer mix, freight costs, negative price costs, and growth allowances. Our ability to narrow our gross margin declines going forward will rest heavily on our ability to close the gap between rising prices and rising costs.","We generated an offsetting 100 basis points of SG&A leverage. Thirty to 40 basis points of this was from employee-related expenses as we cleared our incentive reset in the second quarter of \u201918 and grew headcount more slowly than sales. Thirty to 40 basis points was some leveraging occupancy as the closure of 157 branches in 2018 mitigated growth in our base of vending machines. Finally, we leveraged our remaining operating costs by 30 to 40 basis points. Given continued growth in our business, there remains further room to leverage our operating expenses. Given continued healthy growth, our overall goal for operating margins entering 2019 is unchanged: achieve an incremental margin between 20 and 25% and deliver some margin expansion.","Below the operating line, interest expense was up 39% on higher average debt balances largely from share repurchase activity. Our tax rate fell to 23.8% in 2018 from 33.7% in 2017. Excluding discrete items from both periods, our tax rate fell to 24.5% in 2018 from 36.5% in 2017, reflecting the Tax Act which had the effect of lowering our tax rate beginning in the first quarter. It all blended to a full-year 2018 EPS figure of $2.62 versus $2.01 in 2017. If I exclude the discrete tax items, however, our EPS would have been $2.59, a 35% increase from $1.92 in 2017. If I further adjust for the differing tax rates that applied between 2017 and \u201918 as a result of U.S. tax reform, our EPS grew 13.4%. ","Moving to Slide 5 and our review of the fourth quarter, as Dan covered, sales were up 13.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018, which included daily sales growth of 14.5% in December. We have now grown our organic daily sales at a 10%-plus rate for 19 consecutive months. We continue to see good contribution from our growth drivers. We also saw continued favorable macro trends as illustrated by fourth quarter \u201918 purchasing managers index and industrial production readings. Still, sentiment was a bit choppier in the period with rising cautiousness in November seeming to dissipate in December. Our business does not provide much visibility to future trends, so we cannot speculate as to whether this choppier tone will persist; however, it did not affect performance in the fourth quarter, as you can see by the growth of our end markets, our products, and our channels provided in Slide 5.","As it relates to pricing, during the quarter we put in place focused resources to evaluate and execute our pricing strategies. This is appropriate in light of the prevalence of inflation and tariffs, as well as the growth of our national accounts business, all of which makes the pricing environment more complex than we have seen it in many years. In addition to this group\u2019s strategic objectives, it is also taking a fresh look at how we measure pricing costs, with two observations resulting. First, as we reported before, we have achieved improved price realization throughout 2018 with a notable step-up in the third quarter, as is necessary because our costs have also risen throughout 2018. Second, the impact of price on our results is slightly below what we had previously modeled. As a result, we realized between 110 and 140 basis points of price in the fourth quarter of 2018, which is improved on the 85 to 150 basis points of price that we realized in the third quarter of \u201918.","As it relates to tariffs, there was minimal impact on the P&L in the fourth quarter of \u201918, but that will grow in the first quarter and full year of 2019. The impact on the balance sheet is also modest at this point with one exception. While we did not buy any excess inventory in anticipation of higher tariffs, we did accelerate the shipping of planned spend to arrive before the potential 25% tariffs kicked in, which was originally expected on January 1. This pulled roughly $12 million in inventory that would have otherwise gone into the first quarter of 2019 into the fourth quarter of 2018","Now to Slide 6, our gross margin was 47.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018, down 110 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2017. This decline was slightly more than we expected. Relative to prior periods, we did see the negative effects of freight and net rebates moderate in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of easier comparisons; however, product margin was below where we thought it would be. The negative impact of price cost widened as product cost increases outpaced our price increases. The negative impact of customer product mix similarly widened as an increasing proportion of our growth derived from our growth drivers. ","Our operating margin was 19% in the fourth quarter of 2018, up 30 basis points year over year. Continued healthy growth drove 130 basis points of cost leverage and generated an incremental margin of 21%. Looking at the pieces, we achieved 60 basis points of leverage over employee-related costs, which were up 10%. Growth in headcount was below growth in sales, and growth in incentive compensation, though healthy, moderated versus last year. ","Occupancy-related costs were up 7.2%, generating 25 basis points of leverage. Total occupancy costs grew very slightly with higher expenses at non-branch facilities more than offsetting a decline in branch facilities. As a result, most of the growth in costs related to higher vending expenses to support the growth in our install base. We realized an additional 55 basis points of leverage of other and operating administrative expenses.","Putting it all together, reported fourth quarter EPS was $0.59 versus $0.53 in fourth quarter 2017; however, the current year does include a $3.2 million discrete tax charge while the prior year period includes a $24.4 million discrete tax benefit, both related to the effects of the Tax Act. Excluding these discrete items, fourth quarter \u201918 EPS would have been $0.60, or up 34.2% from the fourth quarter of 2017, boosted by a lower tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. Absent tax reform, EPS growth would have been 13.9%.","Turning to Slide 7, we generated $178 million in operating cash in the fourth quarter of 2018, or 106% of net income. This is slightly below the conversion we typically see in fourth quarters, again relating to working capital - I\u2019ll cover that in a moment. Net capital spending in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $78 million, bringing our year-to-date outlays to $167 million, an increase of 48.3% over 2017. We expected an uptick in spending in the fourth quarter just based on project timing related to hub investments, but we also had an opportunity to purchase property in North Carolina for future hub expansion that was unanticipated and added nearly $20 million to this total. Our current growth and growth drivers require additional investments in 2019, and we expect net capital spending to be in a range of $195 million to $225 million largely for investments in hub property and equipment, vending devices to support our rising success in this initiative, and vehicles. ","We paid $114 million in dividends in the quarter and $442 million for the year. We also repurchased 63 million stock in the quarter and 103 million for the year, the second most active year in our history. We finished the quarter with debt at 17.8% of total capital, a little bit above last year\u2019s 16.5% but still at levels that provide ample liquidity to take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business. ","The working capital picture remained challenging. Inventories were up 17% in the fourth quarter and days on hand ticked up slightly for the first time in 2018. Some of the growth related to supporting demand in our growth drivers and some was related to the accelerated shipments mentioned above; however, a third major element was simply the growing impact of inflation. ","Receivables grew 17.5% in the fourth quarter and is up more than three days. Sustained strong growth in national accounts and international businesses matter, but the biggest factor remains customer pushing payments past quarter end, which intensified further in the fourth quarter of 2018. Receivables quality remains good with no deterioration in past due balances.","That\u2019s all for our formal presentation, so with that Operator, we\u2019ll take questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from Chris Dankert of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Chris Dankert","Morning guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess first off, and I know visibility is limited, but we\u2019re going into the new year here, obviously price cost was a headwind; last year, we\u2019re kind of comping on that. Given that you\u2019re going to be pushing some more pricing in a more focused way, given that volumes are going to be up, is it fair to assume that gross margin in the first quarter should be up a little bit sequentially, or are we still kind of fighting sideways here?","Holden Lewis","Well, I think if you look sort of sequentially at how things usually play out with gross margin, historically we\u2019ve seen an uptick in Q1 over Q4, but over the last three years really the Q4 to Q1 cadence has been more flattish, and I think a lot of that has to do with sort of the inherent volatility in gross margin in Q4. It can be difficult to predict.","We\u2019re moving into a quarter where we\u2019re going to see how the tariff price cost dynamic plays out. We still have an inflation price cost dynamic playing out. I think if what you\u2019re asking about is what you should think about in terms of sequential gross margin, I would think about Q1 looking somewhat similar to where Q4 comes in. ","Chris Dankert","Got it, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. Just as a quick follow-up, thinking about the full year price cost, with the team in place, is it fair to expect that by Q2 we\u2019re starting to claw back some of that price cost, or is this more of a back half type of dynamic?","Holden Lewis","Well, what I\u2019ll emphasize is we have improved our price realization each quarter this year, and setting aside the question of tariffs, just looking at generalized inflation, I would expect that that\u2019s going to continue as we enter 2019. Given that, the question really comes down to what do we expect out of costs as we go into 2019.","I\u2019ll tell you that as much as we\u2019ve realized the incremental pricing, we\u2019ve also realized incremental costs each quarter this year as well, so we still see pressure there, quite frankly. But that said, we are making a lot of progress in terms of our ability to realize price. We talked a little bit about the pricing tools that went in, in midyear 2018, we talked a little bit here about how we\u2019ve sort of re-jigged the group a little bit to give us a bit more focused information, etc., and I think that\u2019s going to continue to provide us some additional incremental benefits. Our expectation in 2019 is that we\u2019re going to continue to narrow and, frankly, get rid of the gap that exists today between price and cost.","Chris Dankert","Got it. Thanks Holden, that\u2019s so helpful. Congrats on \u201918, and good luck in the new year.","Dan Florness","Thanks Chris. Just one item I\u2019ll add to Holden\u2019s commentary. When I think of the dynamic that\u2019s going on right now, whether it\u2019s inflation or tariffs in general, I think this is a huge opportunity for the Fastenal supply chain capabilities where we can flex our skill set. I mean that from the standpoint we\u2019re not a fulfillment company, we don\u2019t just supply you what you ordered, we also challenge in the process of saying, you know, the item you\u2019re ordering, based on what we know about your business, we question if that\u2019s optimal for your business. Sometimes it\u2019s substituting the product from the standpoint of the durability of that product, does it fit, either is it adequate or too adequate to the demand of the use, but also we have great partner brands, we have great exclusive brands, and sometimes it\u2019s coming to a customer and saying, you\u2019ve used this same brand for years, we have this brand that we actively support and we have a better price point on, a better cost point which translates into a better price point, and we can offset inflation and\/or tariffs by actively substituting, and that comes from an active engagement with knowing how the customer is using it and where their pain points are, where they\u2019re willing to be flexible and where they can\u2019t be flexible. I think that\u2019s an important component of Fastenal\u2019s supply chain.","Chris Dankert","Awesome, thank you, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey of Baird. Your line is now open.","David Manthey","Hi, good morning guys. Happy new year. First of all, I\u2019m hoping I can get a little bit of color on these large customer pricing conversations. Are you through all of them? When do the changes start taking effect, and I assume you\u2019ve outlined agreements for the 10 and 25% tariff environments, but have you also reached contractual agreements as it relates to when the tariffs are eventually rolled back?","Dan Florness","You know, the agreements we have allow for windows for discussions. We\u2019ve talked about this in the past of when pricing can change. Legally, you can do things beyond that from the standpoint of there\u2019s always force majeure elements of contracts. We\u2019re not a fan of that up or down, because we don\u2019t think that\u2019s part of a supply chain partnership. We\u2019re having active discussions with the customers. The discussions are going quite well. Are some more successful than others? Yes, a lot of times it depends on where we find success in the things I just mentioned - the ability to substitute, the alternative sources of supply, the level of service trade-offs, are we growing our business, etc., but we\u2019ve been largely successful. We\u2019re seeing some price increases that are going into place as we speak and will be going in place over the upcoming months.","In regard to the specifics of what happens when it goes from 10 to 25, or what happens when it unwinds, you can talk through scenarios but there\u2019s no agreement that contemplates the--I don\u2019t know if I want to use the word craziness or the noise, or all the stuff that\u2019s going on in the marketplace, so it\u2019s going to be a fluid environment on all regards. ","The one thing, we did put through some price increases that took effect in mid-December, and in those we just--we really had a discussion with our customers, saying you know what? The tariffs started on September 24, here is the latency we\u2019re putting in, these tariffs unwind, here\u2019s how we\u2019ll unwind the tariffs in those discussions, and really having the same kind of latency. The idea was trying to match up as best you can where it\u2019s impacting your P&L, where it\u2019s impacting your business, and having a fair trade-off on the in and out because there are going to be distinct lines in the sand. But it\u2019s not a foregone conclusion that the 10 or 25, what\u2019s going to happen when or if, some or all of it remains there essentially and perpetually. ","Holden Lewis","What I\u2019ll add to that, David, is yes, I do believe that the vast majority of the conversations have been had. In fact, when I asked why our signings of onsites were perhaps a little bit lower in Q4 than we\u2019d seen the rest of the year, one of the answers I got was, because of all the time and attention that we diverted to having those conversations. So those groups, both locally and international accounts, have worked really hard to have those conversations in a compressed period of time, and they came to those conversations with a great plan and, every bit as important, with great data which allowed us to define the issue fairly precisely. It\u2019s a known issue, and I think those are the elements that have given--that make us be very encouraged about how those conversations have gone down. ","We do believe that those conversations have been generally successful. The costs related to the 10% tariff will begin to roll into the P&L in the first quarter, but frankly I think that most of the agreements that we\u2019ve reached with many of our customers will also begin to roll in, in that January and February window as well. What that means in terms of the incremental price cost in the January-February time frame, time will tell, but that\u2019s just a timing issue. Like I say, we\u2019re encouraged by how those conversations went and we\u2019re sort of expecting that we\u2019re going to largely be able to neutralize the tariff impact. ","David Manthey","That\u2019s great color. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Ryan Merkel","Hey, a couple questions from me. First, I\u2019m getting a lot of questions about tariffs and FIFO accounting, so how should we think about gross margin first half \u201919 to second half \u201919 as it relates to FIFO?","Holden Lewis","Well, that\u2019s why we began to build some cost into inventory in the fourth quarter, based on when the containers began to hit the shores at the end of September. We expect that we will begin to see that inventory that\u2019s currently sitting there roll into cost of goods as we get into the first quarter. That was all expected, Ryan. We knew that there would be some impact on the inventory side of the ledger, but it will take some time for that to roll through. But the nature of the tariffs as opposed to our usual purchasing was going to compress that window. That\u2019s why we spent so much time talking to investors in a very tight window, is because we knew how that was going to roll out in Q1.","I think the effects you\u2019re alluding to are certainly playing out, but our original goal was to have pricing conversations ready to roll out as we began to see the costs shift off the balance sheet and into the income statement, and we think that we have largely achieved that goal. Going forward, we\u2019re going to continue to see the containers move through the inventory and into the COGS as sort of comparable rate, and we should begin to see the pricing in Q1 and then Q2 related to that specifically, and that\u2019s how we tend to view it. I\u2019m not sure that I see a huge difference between the first half and the second half as it relates to the tariffs. ","Dan Florness","The only thing I\u2019ll add to Holden\u2019s commentary, and this is putting my old hat on for a second, is when I think of our business just holistically and I think about over the years, we\u2019ve had roughly 160 days of inventory, plus or minus a handful, and I\u2019m not going to get into exacts but just holistically, about 100 of those days were physically at the branch and about 60 of those days were physically at the distribution center. Now in the case of a lot of our products, and I\u2019m setting vending aside and I\u2019m setting OEM fasteners aside, in the case of a lot of our products, that kind of mirrors where the replenishment cycle is coming in, and really what put us in a position of having these discussions and having a little bit of a window to react to them. But that product that was in the branches is now we\u2019re three months away from--a little bit over three months away from the start of tariffs, that product that\u2019s going into the branches is starting to get replaced with stuff that was coming in, and so you\u2019ll see bits and pieces of it coming in in January and February and March. They\u2019ll be building as they go through the quarter. The full steam will really hit in Q2. ","Holden Lewis","I think maybe another way to think about it is traditionally when we buy a product from overseas, it might take six months or two quarters, or whatever, to move into our system, but the tariffs were not applied at the point that you purchased the product, the tariffs were applied at the point that it hit the shores. So when the tariffs went into place on September 24, I think it was, any container that hit on September 25, where we might have bought the product three months earlier, but that tariff hit right then, so that\u2019s why when you talk about the timing, the timing as it relates to tariffs and how our system is compressed compared to our normal purchasing period. Does that make sense?","Ryan Merkel","Yes, okay. That\u2019s helpful, guys. Secondly Holden, I think you mentioned the goal for incremental margins in 2019 was that 20, 25% range. Just two questions on that: first, what level of sales growth do you need to achieve that, and then secondly, it sounds like you\u2019re assuming that you can neutralize tariffs and product cost inflation with price.","Holden Lewis","Well, currently we\u2019re assuming that we continue to grow double digits. Now however the cycle plays out will have a lot to say about that, but we believe that the momentum that we have in our growth drivers is going to continue. We think that we\u2019ll continue in the current environment to improve the price profile, so the real question is what does the cycle do. But at least through Q4, demand is still fairly healthy, so we\u2019re assuming we\u2019re going to grow double digits in order to achieve that.","Dan Florness","The one thing I\u2019ll add to that, Ryan, is if you look at it in the last couple years, Terry Owen--we had our board meeting yesterday and Terry Owen came in and talked to the board about--Terry oversees a big chunk of our behind-the-scenes business, so all of our national accounts team, our solutions people, which is onsite, which is vending, our government, our marketing folks, our finance that support national accounts, all those things rolled into one. Those are the bedrock of our growth drivers. We\u2019ve added 30% more people into his team or teams over the last three years, and so when you look at that non-branch, the sales headcount that\u2019s non-branch, that\u2019s the part I\u2019m talking about. We plan to keep adding aggressively into that area because that customer letter I talked about, that\u2019s reflective of what that group does, as well as our local team and the district manager, of bringing that type of execution to our customer. So in a double digit environment, we\u2019re going to keep growing that group aggressively to support what we\u2019re doing. Obviously if we\u2019re weren\u2019t in a double-digit environment, I\u2019d have to go to Terry and I\u2019d have to go to a bunch of folks in the organization and say, hey folks, tighten the belt because we don\u2019t have the luxury to add that. ","But before I stepped into this role, one thing I learned from this population quite acutely is great incremental margin if you\u2019re not growing doesn\u2019t matter. Now it\u2019s changed a little bit - great growth where you don\u2019t have great incremental margin doesn\u2019t matter either, and I agree with both statements. But we want to be very mindful of growing infrastructure to be great at onsite because this is--just like vending, it\u2019s incredibly disruptive to the space, and we are designed to be the best at this, so let\u2019s go after it with a vengeance. ","Holden Lewis","Just to finish off the last part of that, so yes, with regards to tariffs, we do expect that the success we\u2019ve had will allow us to neutralize that. That\u2019s a different conversation from price costs. Price cost, I think was about a 30 basis point drag to our business for the year. Our intention is to eliminate that drag, and we\u2019ll see how that plays out over the course of the year, but our expectation is to eliminate that drag.","Dan Florness","We think we have a good plan to do it, yes, and that would be part of achieving that incremental margin.","Ryan Merkel","Helpful, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Scott Graham","Hi, good morning Dan, Holden, Ellen. I want to go back to what your just now comment was, Holden, on price cost and looping your earlier comment that the key to gross margin in 2019 will be to get to this, call it price cost neutrality, price cost broadly defined as being your entire P&L as opposed to just materials, I assume. I guess as we look at the trends of your sales, recognizing that on a longer term basis the onsite stuff does start to even out a little bit, but the mix is still running negative, so you have in the past said you have to look to backfill something like 20 to 30 basis points to just keep your gross margin flat due to mix. Is that number still applicable, and maybe connect the dots here for me that why is that not as important as managing price cost to get to your gross margin, to improve the [indiscernible] gross margin?","Holden Lewis","Yes, sure. I don\u2019t want to give the impression that mix is not important as something that we need to mitigate, right, because we do need to find ways to improve our profitability, and to the extent that whatever the mix number is, we should be able to reduce it just through other activities. But let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that the mix is going down or the mix is a drag on gross margin because we\u2019re getting tremendous growth in our growth drivers. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever asserted to you that our gross margin was unlikely to decline provided we are successful with our growth drivers, but it is still incumbent upon us as an organization to do everything we can to maximize our gross margin and mitigate the impacts of that, but you shouldn\u2019t have any expectation that our gross margins are going to be flat to going up as long as we are successful with these growth drivers. ","Look - onsites have a gross margin in the neighborhood of 35%, give or take. It\u2019s just math, right? I mean, if we\u2019re going to grow that business 40%, take out the transferred sales it\u2019s 20%, the math is going to tell you it\u2019s going to be difficult for us to expand our gross margin in that environment. But it\u2019s a real big reason why we\u2019re outgrowing everybody else in the space, so we\u2019re not as hung up with the idea of offsetting mix fully as perhaps your question suggests that we should. But that said, price cost, that should be in our control. We know when our costs are rising, we know what we need to offset, the market should allow it, and we should be able to go to our customers and say, look, we\u2019re not trying to take advantage here, this is what the marketplace is doing, this is what we need to be doing. That\u2019s something that\u2019s about our discipline as an organization. It\u2019s a very different conversation than the one about mix. ","Scott Graham","Understood, thank you. I was under the impression that if you were able to backfill the 20 to 30, that the gross margin would be flat for the year; but it sounds to me like you\u2019re not saying that.","Holden Lewis","Yes, I mean, whatever the number is, if we could backfill it, obviously it would be flat, and we always try to backfill. But the fact is, it\u2019s difficult to find those in any given period, so no, I think we\u2019ve been fairly open that if we\u2019re going to be this successful with our vending and our non-fasteners and our onsites, in all likelihood over a period of time, our gross margin will go down. That doesn\u2019t mean, by the way, that our operating margin needs to go down. We get tremendous leverage from the growth that we\u2019re seeing, and we saw that this year as well. I think the dynamic you saw this year is very comparable to the dynamic we expect to continue to see.","Now, I\u2019ll tell you, mix expanded beyond that 20\/30 in 2018, and it did so because if you think about it, national accounts in 2017 grew 14.5%, it grew 18% in \u201918. Onsites grew 35% including transferred revenues in 2017, they grew 42% in \u201918. Non-fastener accelerated. With those accelerations, we did see an expansion in the impact from customer mix, but again, we can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that growth in national accounts going from 14.5% to 18% also drives more dollars to the revenue line that we then have leveraged at the operating expense line. That\u2019s how our model works at this point. ","Scott Graham","Understood. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up would be in the past, you\u2019ve talked about in product line and in channel mix, so products, fasteners versus non-fasteners, markets, manufacturing versus non-residential. Did you see anything in the mix in any of these four groups that went with you or went against you? ","Dan Florness","You mean within the group itself, as opposed to the changing mix of the individual groups?","Scott Graham","That\u2019s correct.","Holden Lewis","Yes, where products are concerned, our non-fasteners grew faster than our fasteners this year.","Dan Florness","I think he\u2019s talking about within the individual components, the dynamic of margin.","Scott Graham","Yes.","Holden Lewis","Oh, okay, I got it. Yes, I mean, the element of price cost was a drag in a lot of these areas, right? I think I indicated price cost was about a 30 basis point drag to margin for the full year, and I think that that affected the margin in most of the channels and products that we\u2019re in. Now, it affected fasteners more than non-fasteners without a doubt. It was probably more significant in the local business than it was on the onsites and the national accounts, etc. There was some differential, but price cost was a challenge across the business.","Scott Graham","Fine, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Adam Uhlman","Good morning everybody, happy new year. I was wondering if I could go back to the cash flow outlook for this year. How should I be thinking about working capital in your plan right now for 2019? We\u2019ll get rid of some of the one-time pull forward impacts that you outlined on inventory, but just directionally, should we see cash days improve? Then could you just talk about your downturn scenario planning, if you\u2019ve done any? What if the business kind of ground to a halt? It\u2019s a lot different than several years ago, the last downturn. How would you expect working capital to perform with the change in the mix of the business?","Holden Lewis","Sure. Frankly, my rule of thumb model for our balance sheet would be a slight increase in days on the AR, simply because of the growth in national accounts and growth in international businesses. But you know, a meaningful multi-day decrease in days of inventory, that\u2019s how we would like to build it out. Now, the reality is right now, there are some challenges that by the back half of 2018 it was very difficult for us to achieve those. We have to take steps in 2019 to get back on the track that I just laid out. We\u2019re not there right now, but we have plans to begin to try to address that. ","Normally what I would tell you is for the full year, we should convert more than 100% of our net income into operating cash flow, and this year the biggest reason why we did not was because of working capital, and the expectation is that as we go into 2019, we should be able to deliver that. The challenges obviously are related to the inflation and tariffs and things like that, what impact that might have on inventory. That\u2019s sort of the rule of thumb that I look at when I think about the balance sheet. We have to show that we can deliver to that again in 2019, because 2018 was a struggle and the variables that caused it to be a struggle in 2018 have not gone away. ","As it relates to a downturn scenario, traditionally if it\u2019s a short, relatively normal downturn, we need less working capital in that environment, and our cash flow is traditionally pretty stable and steady. ","Dan Florness","I\u2019ll just throw in a couple thoughts, just after being here for 20-plus years, I\u2019m the old guy so I can give a little perspective. The interesting thing about a distribution business, it\u2019s a working capital business. We have a little bit more fixed capital in our business now because of things like vending and automation in our warehouse and the fact that we have our own trucking network, but it\u2019s really a working capital business. When we put up good growth, the number Holden just cited, that 100%, that becomes more challenging, and historically I would expect our number if we\u2019re putting up good growth to pull down in to the mid-90s as a percentage of earnings, because your AR and your inventory are growing faster because you\u2019re supporting an ever growing business. That\u2019s considered a good problem. ","The dynamics have changed a little bit on that math because our tax rate is lower now, so we produced a higher--the 100 of earnings isn\u2019t 100 of earnings anymore, it\u2019s a little bit higher, so you can--it raises that relationship. If I look at when growth really stalls, I mean, the best year we\u2019ve had for operating cash to earnings as a percentage, the best year that I\u2019ve ever seen was 2009. I hope that never repeats itself. We threw out more cash than you could imagine because the business slowed down, and if you don\u2019t have more sales, you don\u2019t have more receivables. If you don\u2019t have sales growing in the future, you don\u2019t need to be beefing up your inventory. The only dynamic that can muck that up is if it slows down quickly because we can\u2019t shut off the inbound inventory fast, but the receivables would drop off as the sales drop off.","Dan Florness","With that, I see we\u2019re at 9:59. I just want to close the call with a few final thoughts. First off, thank you for participating on our call today. Thanks for your interest in Fastenal and for being a shareholder in Fastenal. ","One thing for us to think about as we\u2019ve moving from a $5 billion to a $10 billion company and you start thinking about gross profit, operating expenses and operating margin, the message internally is quite clear for our employees. As our business evolves, if I looked out to that $10 billion company and I was just putting a guess of where I think the numbers are, I think gross margin--if the mix ends up where I think it\u2019s going to be, I think the gross margin is around 46 and I think there\u2019s some things we have to do to get better at, to be at 46. Is there upside to that? Sure, but in planning for that 46, I also tell our team we need to plan on operating expenses being in the lower half of the 20s. Twenty-four is the number I always think of, and that allows us to be in a position where we could throw up operating margins at 22. I think that\u2019s very realistic. ","If I look at regions where we have a lot of onsites and a mature business, the midwestern U.S. as an example, we\u2019re above those numbers. This is a conservative view of the future, but I look at it and say, if I look at Page 9 of Holden\u2019s flip book, the question a shareholder needs to ask himself is Fastenal is investing to grow rapidly - we\u2019ve added 30% to our key account teams in the last three years. Technology, we decided three years ago to spend 50 basis points more every year to become a leader in technology in our industry, not a follower of technology in our industry. We saw with great partnerships over the years - our vending partnership for the last 10, our mobility partnership we put in place next year, we think we\u2019re a different organization now. Fastenal Express, as I touched on in the last call, is not a train, it\u2019s a rocket. It\u2019s growing nicely in our business. It\u2019s not about the revenue growth it can produce, which I think it can; it\u2019s about the efficiency it can bring to our team. ","But looking at all those things and are you interested in being a shareholder in Fastenal, looking at the return on invested capital that we throw off, that Holden details out on Page 9, I think we\u2019re a great proposition to own and I would challenge our shareholders to step up and buy some more, just like I challenge our employees to be willing to learn and change, and we challenge our customers to be open-minded about their supply chain. That\u2019s how we all get better.","Thanks, and have a good week, everybody.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

Also present for today\u2019s call is Lee Hein, our President.","The call will last for up to 45 minutes.

Forward-looking statements are made as of today's date only and we undertake no duty to update the information provided on this call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Will Oberton. Go ahead, Mr. Oberton.","Will Oberton","Thank you, Ellen, and thank you for everybody who is joining us on the call today. Looking at the second quarter 2014, I would rate it as a good quarter, not a great quarter, but a good quarter. The most positive numbers being in the sales area, we had 12.1% sales growth for the quarter.","Some of the highlights as I see it, our older stores grew right at 10% and even stronger in last two months of the quarter. So, when our store historically, when our older stores are growing in the double-digit Fastenal does very well.","Our sequential pattern from January to June, which we follow the sequential pattern very closely was up 14.8% from January to June. Our fastener sequential growth was up 15.1% from January to June and our construction business was up more than 20%. To see those number -- to see number similar to that you would have to go back, all the way back to 2010, where we had similar results and you can see how it came out after that.","So, from a sales standpoint, we\u2019re feeling very good about what we've done. We believe a lot has to do with us adding the people back at the end of or during 2013 and continuing to be committed to drive more sales [cost].","On the EPS side, we were somewhat disappointed, we thought we would do a better job or produce higher earnings per share and it's really a margin story. I think, Dan, did a nice job in the earnings release stating our margin and some of the pressures we\u2019re having with larger accounts and things like that, and that we are not going to push the margins so hard internally that we make start -- put our people in a position to make bad business decisions.","A couple of things in the margin though that that were disappointing other than the net result, freight slipped just a little bit, which we have to work on that, that's really about pounding the drum and making sure that we make that work, and some of our measurements on pricing habits slipped slightly. So we are looking at that very hard, we are working very hard on the margin and I believe we will continue to do well there.","On the expense side, team did a nice job. We grew our SG&A by 10%. That was with 15% more FTEs. So we added the people, we got the sales results, we produced the sales results and we still maintained our expense level at a very well. So, we are happy about that.","Vending -- and also on the sales side, our vending performance remained strong. We had good signings. Our sales growth was good, it\u2019s still about 20% and we saw improvement in the margin.","We have a tremendous upside on the margin with the vending. It will take time to do it, but with things we are doing with THUB and buying better packaging. There are a lot of initiatives going on with vending and so we are very excited about the vending opportunity and believe it's a big part of our future along with fasteners and many other things.","So to summarize, I am going to keep my comments short today. To summarize, as I see it, we have very good sales momentum. Our fastener sales are recovering. Our vending remains strong. We have -- we did -- done a very nice job on our expense control and we need to continue to work hard on our margin.","So as looking at our business, that's what you can expect from the future is continue to work hard in the sales, work on the margin, manage our expense and hopefully be a very good company for you to own.","With that, I am going to turn it over to, Dan, who will give you more color on all of the numbers. Thank you.","Dan Florness","Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody, and also thank you for joining us on our call today. I\u2019ll just add a few noteworthy points on the patterns, primarily looking at the sequential patterns.","As Will touched on, since January our business is up about 15%, daily average and he touched on some of the components and he touched on the fasteners growing with the company. He touched on construction growing faster than the company.","Now, my guess is for the analytical folks listening to this, you look at them and saying, yeah, but you are comparing to a January that wasn\u2019t that impressive, because the weather really dampened it. If you take four points, three or four points out of each of the numbers that Will cited, its still a number that nobody is coming close to and we haven\u2019t come close to since 2010, 2011 timeframe. So we have great momentum going into the second half of the year.","And I think the real impressive part of that is, we talked a year ago about we\u2019re investing in people at the store, we\u2019re investing in selling energy at the store, that\u2019s going to provide us the energy to ramp up our growth and that\u2019s what you are seeing in the year-over-year numbers, but more importantly, that\u2019s what you are seeing in the sequential patterns and I think that\u2019s really strong statement going in.","There are some sacrifices that come along the way and right now one of those sacrifices is a weaker gross margin than we would prefer. With that an industry leading gross margin and when you start peeling back it's really about what\u2019s happening in the business more so than what's happening our habits. Although, our habits like anything else in life we can tweak and make a moment better and we should have been in the range, now there is no question about that.","We\u2019re less concern today about the noise in the range and more concern about whatever our patterns with sales growth. The -- but the sacrifice that comes with the hangover we have in gross margin, a hangover that I think everybody is aware of, that hangover changes dramatically as we transition now from Q2 to Q3.","Because what will the dynamics of our gross margin a year ago. And so, because of the short-term sacrifice we didn\u2019t hit, we get frustrated internally when our incremental margin does not have a two -- at least a two in front of it.","We are in the mid teens. I believe looking into the second half of the year, we have incremental margin that we\u2019ll be proud of. And it pushes us well as we approach 2015 and beyond.","Will touched on THUB. Our THUB facility is ramping up. You know, like any new business that\u2019s taken us some time to work through the pains. Quite a few of the regions have now turned on. I was looking at our picking activity as it relates to our THUB facility and our vending replenishments and our picking activity from May to June went up 2.5 times.","So 2.5 times is the ramp-up. And we still have ton of opportunity. And what comes as that improves is it creates great efficiency at the store level. It helps us on working capital but it creates greater efficiency at the store level because we\u2019re picking that product of replenishment for those machines as high frequency product.","We\u2019re picking that in a more efficient manner. It also allows us to drive towards product consolidation of what\u2019s in THUB. Efficiency is the win at the store. The gravy on top of that is as we drive consolidation, we improve the gross margin of our vending business because we\u2019re consolidating the brand of skews that are going through the machines.","Finally, touching on our cash flow, we -- I missed one point, sorry. We did announce also in our release that we\u2019re closing some stores in the second half of the year. And we\u2019ve closed a number of stores over the last several years. And like -- and as we\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019re always challenging ourselves of looking at our business today, based on how we go to market today and say what is the best thing for this local market. Because the key to our success long term is being the best distribution company we\u2019re located.","If that\u2019s Eau Claire, Wisconsin, we\u2019re the best distribution business in Eau Claire, Wisconsin for serving the customers needs there and serving the growing opportunity of the marketplace. So we announced in the latter half of the year, we\u2019re going to close about 45 stores. And the way we approach that internally is we reached out to our regional leaders with 20 plus regional leaders gathered around North America.","And we said to them, hey folks, if you could do a do over, if you could look at your business right now and identify where you want to open stores because there is still lot of stores for us to open. Where you want to open stores, where you would prefer to consolidate some businesses into fewer locations in this market because it makes more sense for our business today. It makes more sense because of our vending, because of our distribution capabilities, because of all the tools we have in place. What would you do and they identified 45 stores.","So during the second quarter, we accrued up some cost for the future leases related to those facilities and we\u2019re moving on to our future. But I think that\u2019s a good healthy thing for our organization to do.","Touching on the cash flow which I was getting to a second ago, I\u2019m still proud of all the things we\u2019re doing. As a growth company, we produce operating cash as a percentage of earnings, that\u2019s in the 90s, was 92% in the first six months of this year, it was 93% in the first six months of the last year. That\u2019s impressive number when you look at what our growth is doing today versus a year ago at this time because that takes cash to fund that growth.","We continue to invest heavily in both the vending side as well as our distribution infrastructure. And if you look at the numbers, we have published in our annual report looking at CapEx for the year and you will apply that to our patterns of business. Historically, our investing activities are just shy of 30% of earnings. Last year, we were in the mid-40s so we invested a lot of cash into the infrastructure of the business.","This year we anticipate being in the mid 30s. That number is working back down to a more normal number. And we think that infrastructure investments that we've made positions us well for the years to come.","With that, I will turn it over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Holden Lewis from BB&T. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Holden Lewis - BB&T","Great. Thank you very much. Good morning guys.","Will Oberton","Hey Holden.","Holden Lewis - BB&T","I just sort of want to get a sense of, on one hand, you\u2019re kind of talking about working hard on sort of the margin, but I think in the sort of in the transcript you talked about how you definitely have a sort of a focus now on perhaps more growth than margin? So I\u2019m trying to reconcile in terms of trying to get a sense of when we could start to see margins getting better? How do you reconcile those two comments that caring about margin but on the other hand really caring about growth perhaps more so than margin at this time?","Will Oberton","Well, we care about both of them equally, but what we have discovered as if we push margin too hard that we make bad business decisions and we\u2019re walking away from very -- what might be very profitable business.","So we have to do is from a margin standpoint, work more on the mechanical side of it of what the pricing should be versus just standing up and saying, hey, we need to be at 52% or we need to be at 53%, talk about good decisions, talk about what the opportunities are, talk about how we buy product and so it\u2019s more of a mechanical discussion piece by piece than it is about getting every penny for on every sale.","So it\u2019s about creating better habits at the store level and building it into the culture and as we get there whether that gets us to 51.5 or 52.5, whatever that is, we still want to be able to grow our business at 18, 15 to 20 plus percent as we do that. We\u2019ve done a lot of sole searching on the margin and we found as if we push it too hard it throws breaks on sales. I don\u2019t know if that helps yet, it\u2019s a fine line.","Holden Lewis - BB&T","Yeah. Okay. And then just on the follow-up, fewest number of heads I think that you added this quarter since the Q1 of \u201913. Are we sort of seeing one of this plateaus or floors in the headcount adds, do you feel like you sort of over added, you want to grow into it or is it sort of a temporary random noise? How should we think about your strategy about heads going forward?","Will Oberton","Well, our headcount growth goal is to stay at 15% right now on the brand side of it. But last year we are very flat in the second quarter, so we didn\u2019t have to add a lot. You look at that we ended up right at the number of 15% growth rate, we actually\u2026","Dan Florness","Yeah. We\u2019re north of 16\u2026","Will Oberton","Yeah.","Dan Florness","\u2026 stores.","Will Oberton","I\u2019d say, overall, so at the store we\u2019re above our number. But we\u2019ll continue to add through the third quarter the adds won\u2019t be real great because we didn\u2019t have again a lot last year, as fourth quarter comes that number will start to ramp up. So if you just pull out last years number and add 15%, 16% to that, that\u2019s pretty close to where we are going to be.","But that, again, we\u2019ve been working very hard with our regionals, we had a mall in this week, talking about folks, get your numbers, we\u2019re not going to give you exact headcounts, run your businesses like CEOs. And we have 20 of them doing that. There\u2019s a little fluctuation in the numbers, some of we will had and some of we will not, but overall our goal is to add about 15% to our stores.","Dan Florness","Only thing I will add to that is, back in both our January and April call we did a talk about that that we wanted to end the year in that 15% neighborhood and we were slowing down. We weren\u2019t pushing as hard on the adds, because we\u2019re also very conscious of the fact that we want to manage our operating expenses through all this. We want to invest for growth, manage our operating expenses and I think that\u2019s what you saw in the quarter.","Holden Lewis - BB&T","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is Josh filling in for Sam. Thanks for taking my questions.","Will Oberton","Hi, Josh.","Unidentified Analyst","In light of the store closings coming in the second half, could you give us an update on the potential number of stores you think you could have in the U.S. or North America, like what the potential store count could be years down the road?","Will Oberton","Our published number has always been around 3,500. As far as what we\u2019ve talked about internally and externally, and we don\u2019t frankly know that number is right or wrong. What we do know is the market opportunity, depending on whose set of numbers I\u2019m going to look at is maybe its $160 billion, maybe its $140 billion, maybe its $110 billion. At $3.5 billion, we have a tremendous opportunity to go out to take market share for years into the future.","I\u2019m 50 years old. I\u2019m confident. When I\u2019m long gone from being around here, this organization will be growing. Maybe at that point in time a good chunk of that growth is coming from outside of North America, who knows, depends on how successful we are in the next 10, 15 years.","But that -- but it\u2019s really about what\u2019s the opportunity? I don\u2019t know how many stores we will have. I don\u2019t know how many vending machines we will have. I don\u2019t know how many bin stock programs we will have. I know that we will be doing business with more customers in more locations, doing more dollars and I look forward to seeing how that evolves. But our stated number right now is 3,500 and we -- it\u2019s a little bit of a napkin calculation, but we think it\u2019s a reasonable way to look at the future.","Dan Florness","We are also spending time trying to understand the changing customer habits with internet, with -- more terrific, with where people want to travel, and that\u2019s going to determine a lot of where that number eventually falls, what the customers expect out of us as a distributor or supplier.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for the color. And then specifically on the pick up in fastener growth, could you discuss in a little bit more detail, what was driving that and specially what the -- whether pricing was positive or negative?","Will Oberton","Pricing is pretty neutral, if anything, it\u2019s challenging because, one thing you had to keep perspective, if you look at the economic improvements we have had, which have been meager over last five years. But if you look at that them, they are heavily skewed to larger companies than they are to smaller companies, at least that\u2019s my perception when I read in the paper, what I see in the media, what I see in connections I have with friends in my hometown of, their own businesses, that employing where from five to 25 employees or 50 employees, of where the recovery, albeit, meager has been achieved.","The other thing as we raised our fastener business, we have talked a bit about 20% of our business today is heavy equipment manufacturing and that pummeled us in 2013. In 2012, we were seeing very attractive growth in that business. As we went through 2013 that we growth weakened.","We bottomed out in the third quarter with low single digits growth, we had a month there, but we actually went slightly negative and the only growth that we were seeing in the months around it, were the facts we were adding market share, but our core business was down.","That business has been improving as we have entered into 2014. We saw mid, kind of mid single-digit growth in that business in the first quarter. That improved a few percentage points in the second quarter. We were at about 8% to growth in that business and from a sequential pattern that\u2019s given legs to our fastener business as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. I will get back in queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Will Oberton","Good morning, Adam.","Dan Florness","Hey, Adam.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Just to clarify, Dan, you mentioned earlier that the second half of the year, you are looking for an improvement in the incremental margins, you think you can still hit that mid to high 20% range that we were talking about a couple months ago?","Dan Florness","Well, if I look out the fourth quarter, I am very comfortable with that, because that the hangover has gone in gross margin. The wildcard for third quarter is topline and gross margin. I -- come end of the quarter, I personally will be disappointed and this is a dangerous place me to go, but since you asked the question. I personally will be disappointed if its not a two in front of the incremental margin and I don\u2019t think, I am going on and live with that comment, because when you look at where our expectations are and where our expectations should be.","And that\u2019s, we just had all of our regional leaders in on Wednesday and Thursday of this week and those are the discussions we had with them and I believe the selling momentum we have in the business, went itself to having that type of belief in the future and I don\u2019t think I am smoking something and saying it.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Okay. Got you. And then, unrelated to that, percent of sales to vending customers fell for the first time, I think ever, what exactly is unfolding there?","Dan Florness","Similar to the, what you saw in assessing our stores and our stores that we have today, we have a business that\u2019s gone from zero to $350 million, $400 million in sales annual run rate, plus in a handful of years and in 2012 and 2013 we signed a tremendous amount of vending machines.","As we become smarter about the business we see vending machines that are performing unbelievably. We see vending machines that are performing damn well, excuse my choice of words. We see vending machines that are disappointing. And we take a good hard look at them and we pull some machines out. And when we pull it, the way we report the number is we count -- if we have a customer that has 30 locations that we sell to and we\u2019re vending in 20 of those. We only count the business in those 20 when we\u2019re reporting our numbers.","So if we pull vending machines out of one location and we scratch our head and say this location just doesn\u2019t have enough employees, want to pull it out of this one. That might be a location that spends a fair amount of dollars on something but vending machine did make sense. And it pulled out a little bit.","To me the number that really matters is the 21% or 22% growth with the customers that have vending because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive our business long term. The other thing you had to keep in perspective some of the things that are raising our numbers right now, improving our growth of 15% Fastenal improvement, the 20% construction.","Some of those customers don\u2019t have vending yet. And so one thing that\u2019s happening, we pulled some machines up. What is really happening is the tide is rising.","Dan Florness","Better business mix.","Will Oberton","Yeah. But you know essentially, you look at 37 or 38, it\u2019s a little bit noisy.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna","Hey guys. Good morning.","Will Oberton","Good morning Rob.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna","I had a question, follow-up question on the gross margin outlook. So in the release you alluded to it being near or just below the low end of the range for the short term. I\u2019m curious what gives you confidence. This pressure on gross margin will only be a short-term phenomenon?","Dan Florness","Well, the real reason I put it in there to be honest with you. You guys wore me out in the last three months. The number of questions I got about, we would be here, be here, it almost wore me out and it\u2019s really more of a statement to everybody, hey let\u2019s manage growing the business. We\u2019re going to work really hard on the gross margin. There is a whole bunch of things mechanically that I can look at that we\u2019re doing today, tomorrow, next week. I touched on a few with THUB that we\u2019re doing to structurally improve the gross margin.","But we\u2019ll mention it earlier. What we don\u2019t want to do is play the music so darn loud that we have a store somewhere in Fastenal tomorrow that turns down a 28% margin sale or 22% margin sale because of the noise they heard from us. And we want to say to them, grow your business and grow it properly. One thing, Bob Kierlin taught us years ago that we can never forget, at the end of the day, it\u2019s about returns. At the end of the day, it\u2019s about your operating margin. Are you generating cash to support your growth in terms of the business? And if you do that everyday and you service your customer well, you\u2019ll grow your business. And you\u2019ll build a better business tomorrow than you have today.","Will Oberton","I think also staying on what we learnt from Bob is that our biggest factor we believe in margin isn\u2019t markets and isn\u2019t products, it\u2019s pay programs. And I have been saying that for a long time when we are all Fastenal\u2019s, we are margins at 52. We\u2019re now 40% Fastenal\u2019s, our margins at 51.8. So not a lot of variance over 20 years the way we got, excuse me, 50.8. So it has not moved a lot.","We have the pay programs in place to motivate these people to make the good decisions. And those decisions just aren\u2019t all about margin, they are about growth versus margin and that\u2019s what we want to let -- we want to let that work but we haven\u2019t lowered our programs to allow lower margins and pay it.","So I think the systems are in place at the store level, at the district, at the regional and the top level and that\u2019s why I have confidence that the margin is not going to move a lot. And going down, we\u2019ll keep our hand down.","Dan Florness","To be honest, I\u2019d rather report second quarter with 12% growth and 50.8 gross margin than 8% growth and we\u2019re at 51.8.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna","Yeah. I mean, I guess, it all normalizes out on the earnings line, right. And I think that there is a big picture concern that it\u2019s becoming more expensive to grow in industrial distribution. And so I guess the follow-up question is, if you want to shift the conversation to operating margin that\u2019s fine or even earnings growth help us see how you get back to your kind of target growth range of 15% to 20% without it costing so much that you\u2019re not really seeing as much or greater leverage on the earnings line.","Dan Florness","If we grew, we grew our expense at 10%. So we had leverage on the growth. Our problem was on the sales growth versus expense. Our problem is we had a tough margin comparison from last year. So if we roll it forward, if we maintain our margin at 51% range and hopefully we move it up on that\u2019s given guidance I\u2019m saying, we should -- we will have earnings leverage. So we\u2019re controlling our expenses well. We have great sales momentum. Again we\u2019re up 14% from January and so we think we\u2019re in a good spot. It\u2019s -- we just have to continue to do well.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair","Thanks. First question on pathway to profit, I noticed you changed the 23% EBIT margin target. You now needing a 110,000 per month for the average store from 100,000. Just wondering if you can expand on that a bit?","Dan Florness","The language we had in there was the range of 100 to 110. We\u2019re at a base. We had a $100,000 average store this quarter. And our gross margin slipped at 50.8. We need to be closer to 110 to hit 23. At 51.5, it would be a different discussion.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair","Right. Okay. And then on vending, what is the average gross margin today on those products and where do you think it could go, is 50% achievable at some point or is that too optimistic?","Dan Florness","If I look at our vending where it\u2019s running right now, a few years ago when we were talking about vending and a lot of questions about the weaker gross margins in it and we take a step back and say, the customers that have vending are larger customers and their gross margin is around X and our gross margin in vending is very much in line.","And when we look at our customers before vending and after vending, the gross margins didn\u2019t really change and they were in that neighborhood of 40%. If you look at our vending today, we've improved it meaningfully from where it was two years ago. And if we hadn\u2019t, we would have more drag from it because it\u2019s roughly 12% of our sales right now vending, 12% to 13%. I don\u2019t have the exact number in front of me.","Will Oberton","Its north of 13","Dan Florness","It\u2019s north of 13. And so -- and we\u2019ve move that margin up more in that 43.5 to 44 range. And right now if I look at the concentrations of products going through vending and that\u2019s why I touched on the THUB comment earlier. Our concentrating effect isn\u2019t that strong yet. And so I really see no reason why that the gross margin in our vending can't normalize to the gross margin of the company allowing for the products. And what I mean by that is our fastener\u2019s gross margins are 51%.","Our non-fastener margins aren\u2019t 51%. Fasteners are above that number, non-fasteners are little bit below that number. But there is plenty of room for us to improve gross margin over time and it\u2019s really about being smarter about the products that go into a machine. A machine that we know a lot more about today than we did two years ago and that\u2019s why our margin is improved by 3.5 points.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair","Right. And I would assume private label more than the machine is only going to help as well.","Dan Florness","It\u2019s private label, it\u2019s brands. Its really about the scale and efficiency that comes from -- if I can say to my supplier, we would like to buy this product and we\u2019re selling so many of this product, whether it\u2019s a private label or a brand, we\u2019re selling so much of this through our vending machines that we want to buy it this way. Its not even pallete pricing, its container pricing. By this way we\u2019re going to bring in the THUB and we\u2019re going to push it out through our machines.","It allows you to source so much better and the margin improves and it isn\u2019t just because you\u2019re putting your brands in it, it\u2019s because you\u2019re putting -- you\u2019re even getting the business. And you are improving the economics of the business and improving the labor efficiency at the store unbelievably and it gives you more selling energy.","Will Oberton","I\u2019m still completely convince looking at the numbers that vending will be our most efficient and most profitable business overall or on period, not very shortly but for a long period of time, for years to come because of all the things we built in. And in the second quarter for the first time, we had a run rate to actually be over a $0.5 billion going through the machines.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair","Yeah.","Will Oberton","So it is become a big business that\u2019s growing well above the company, so if we continue any, even similar growth rates, our profit picture for the future looks great.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair","Thank you.","Operator","And next question comes from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone.","Will Oberton","Good morning.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Well, I hate to go back to the margin question, which is really the focus we are seeing from clients.","Dan Florness","That\u2019s okay.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","\u2026 from clients.","Dan Florness","We\u2019ve heard it before Eli, go on\u2026","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","I know, but, you\u2019ve articulate a stronger incremental in the second half, the mix is sort of trending little bit better, you are controlling your expenses to a slower add. So the question becomes, why our gross margins hanging around the same level and so as you look out? And there is got to be something else affecting it whether its lack of supplier rebates or changes, something else is affecting the market that you shouldn\u2019t show some leverage from 50.8%, that's meaningful basically with last year based on the current trends? So can you help me get some idea what -- why it was at the same levels?","Dan Florness","We are not saying we\u2019re not. What we\u2019re saying is, if our growth, like I said, in part of my commentary it was, the focus, the spotlight of every question that comes in is about gross margin here, here or there. And we are not going to jump out the window. If we report a quarter with 51 or 50.9 or 51.1 gross margin, we are seeing a tremendous amount of growth in our business right now, from non-fasteners, we are seeing improvements in fasteners, we see great trends in fasteners, but the year over numbers are what they are and it\u2019s disproportionate to large account business.","If the small customer was growing as fast with us and we had that that mix in our numbers, we are being challenged by mix in a massive way, all these things that are under the hood that we talked about, the vending -- improvements in vending gross margin, the improvements in our sourcing, the things we do everyday, the improvements over the years in our freight, all these things are structural changes we are making to combat the massive change in customer and product mix that occur in our business.","When I joined Fastenal in 1996, 4% of our business was national account, today its 44%. If I add large reasonable accounts more than 50% of our business today is a large multi-location customer.","When I joined Fastenal in 1996, I think at that time fasteners were about 80%, 85% of our business, today they dropped in half to low 40s, but during that timeframe, we've managed all the structural components within the respective product categories and end market categories and we\u2019ve basically had a gross margin that has been unchanged. There has been periods of turmoil, but, yes, you have a business that goes from $220 million a year to $3.5 billion a year in 17 years that comes to the [third-party].","Will Oberton","Here is our internal thinking on it. If we had a point of growth to our business where we are right now, we had just about $10 million in quarterly revenue and $5 million in gross margin. If we give up 20 basis points, which everybody's freaked out about, we give up $2 million, so do I want a point of growth or do I want the 20 basis points, I like them both, but on balance, a point or 2 of growth is worth a lot of margin and we have to find that balance within our company and keep the street in and the know at the same chart to keep, Dan, is checking his calculator here, if I got it right.","Dan Florness","No. I am not.","Will Oberton","Oh! I do have a right. So at a $1 billion you had a point of growth, you pick up $10 million and so that\u2019s trying to find that balance, where do you get the return on, the extra $5 million in gross margin.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","All right. Thank you. And one follow-up question on a completely different topic? One of these, I am surprised that I don\u2019t hear much is that, the company is undertaking sort of a metalworking initiative, more venture into cutting tools, I know, you have the deal with the Kennametal? So, we are not hearing very much about what's going on in that business, how its growing, whether or not it's still a main focus and cutting tools or right to vending machine would add a lot to margins still at the same time? So if you can give some idea of should I not expect much in next couple of years or is that a real focus area outside of what we had discussed?","Will Oberton","No. We are continuing to work very hard at a metalworking, it\u2019s continuing to outgrow the overall company revenue, not by the amount that we had expected but we are growing well above. We see our public peers that are working in that area. Our metal working sales are growing well above any one else that we can get public data on. We\u2019ve just -- we haven\u2019t been talking as much about the different product lines. What Dan and I have learned over long period of time is the more we talk about it, the more we have to support it. And it\u2019s easier for us to give more general information, continue to work harder on the macro numbers, growth, margin, headcount and -- but when people ask we do talk about this. So, we\u2019re very excited about the metal working opportunity just as we\u2019re about Fastenal\u2019s safety, vending and many other areas.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Manthey from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","David Manthey - Robert W. Baird","Thanks. Hi guys. Good morning.","Will Oberton","Good morning.","David Manthey - Robert W. Baird","First off, Dan, you mentioned is there is a lot of things that you\u2019ve got going on that if you call them mechanical factors that will structurally improve gross margin and not to dwell on this too much. But could you just tick up a few examples of those things just so we can have a [longer] list?","Dan Florness","Sure. The first one is what we touched on was THUB.","David Manthey - Robert W. Baird","Right.","Dan Florness","The consolidate -- the aggregation of our spend whether that\u2019s going to one of our brands that we support in our THUB facility or private label that we support in our THUB facility. It\u2019s identifying all the opportunities we have and communicating that to the field and communicating that to our district managers and our regional leaders. So here\u2019s the gross margin opportunity for this, this and this. And we\u2019re always doing that for the business in total but there is tremendous opportunity.","I always think of the vending machine as an end cap if you want to use a retail analogy. And on the end cap, as our retailer yield lot of choice, but what goes on to that end cap. We have a lot of influence while that goes into the vending machine. We need to exercise that influence and we need to go to our customer everyday with cost savings ideas and this is one of them.","We can -- you can do a sharing, a gain sharing components of that and it\u2019s a win-win scenario for our customer, for our business and for our suppliers. And so because it\u2019s a more efficient supply chain, the freight one is another component of that, that we always talk about. And then the third one is being really good on the sourcing side at the store and at the company level on commodity pieces, the branded pieces and challenging ourselves on the exclusive brand pieces. And again that relates to our business everyday and I challenge our product managers and our sourcing folks on that everyday about what we\u2019re stocking in the store, about how we\u2019re sourcing, how we\u2019re expanding our capability to source and how we\u2019re helping our stores do a better job too.","Will Oberton","David, I would throw in a fourth there and that is the education of our stores to charge for the value that they provide our customers. That is -- I know that\u2019s an intangible but I\u2019ll tell you we were adding 16% to 17% more hours in the store. They are inexperienced people. As they gain experience and they gain confidence, things will change but that goes right back to the habits of pricing our customer or a sale appropriately. And that is an ongoing item for us too.","Dan Florness","As long as I have a list, I\u2019ll throw in a fifth.","Will Oberton","There you ago.","Dan Florness","And that is that Lee has promoted a gentleman to work for, I am working on pricing but he is really working on, he is trying to identify the current systems that are available, software, trends and study the science of pricing and understanding the opportunity of the products we sell into the market. And we\u2019ve always been pretty good at that but we think there is upside. So he is and it\u2019s really -- that is really more focus on larger customers understanding what the needs are. And so I had all these things put together give us some help and at the same time, everyone is pushing you for the other direction. So it\u2019s going to be a tug of war forever. We just hope to win a little more on the rope.","David Manthey - Robert W. Baird","Right. Okay. And then just to follow-up, dragging that down the P&L to where it matters at the EBIT line. Historically, you\u2019re changing EBIT, divide about change in GP dollars has been, let\u2019s call it around 50%. And I guess, the theory is that if -- let's say your customers are getting bigger, the mix is changing and so forth but the cost to serve goes down. Should that number not be as good or maybe even better than it has been historically, meaning you get better leverage on your cost structure because of the cost to serve these bigger customers is lower.","Will Oberton","That\u2019s really inherent in pathway to profit, that\u2019s kind of what we identified bigger customers, bigger stores, lower cost to serve.","Dan Florness","It\u2019s about volume ","Will Oberton","Yes. It\u2019s -- and we see -- we have lots of data points with the number of stores. We have and we can see where it is and as long as we continue to grow our average store size, this quarter is difficult because we had tremendous drop in the margin, I mean 140 basis points, everything looks skewed in the wrong direction. But in more normal quarter, you would have seen that come through.","David Manthey - Robert W. Baird","Yes. Okay. All right, thanks very much.","Will Oberton","Thanks, Dave.","Dan Florness","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","And that is all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn our call back to Will and Dan.","Will Oberton","Once again, I want to thank you for your continued interested in Fastenal.

I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Ellen Stolts of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Ellen Stolts","Welcome to the Fastenal Company 2018 second quarter earnings conference call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer. The call will last for up to 1 hour and we will start with a general overview of our quarterly results and operations, with the remainder of the time being opened for questions and answers.","Today\u2019s conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company\u2019s latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and we encourage you to review those factors carefully.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.","Dan Florness","Thank you, Ellen and good morning everybody and thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. I realize at this stage of the economic cycle, our industry is a bit out of favor, but however, I believe we have a great story to tell. And I believe our moat is expanding in the marketplace.","Let\u2019s start out by going to Holden\u2019s flipbook. If I look at some of the highlights he called out, I will start with, it will be probably good if I got on the right page, I\u2019d start with our non-residential construction business is accelerating. In June, we hit 17%. In all honesty, I don\u2019t understand the strength behind it. I know the things we have done to build momentum there, but I was very pleased with the progress we saw in the second quarter. Our manufacturing demand is stable at very healthy levels. We rolled that together. We grew our sales 13.1% in the second quarter. That\u2019s our fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. So, when I think about it I think there is two things that are noteworthy there. One is we are growing on some good growth numbers and I think that\u2019s a pretty strong statement. The second thing is a year ago in late March 2017 we acquired a great organization in Michigan called Mansco, we anniversaried that acquisition on March 31. So, our growth in the second quarter was 100% organic. And we put up I think a great number.","If I look at on the operating income side, our operating income grew 13.3%, which is a beautiful thing. Our reported EPS was $0.74. However, there was a discrete tax item in there, so really pleased with the earnings growth we saw in the quarter and our ability to manage our expenses. Holden will touch on some of this a little bit deeper later. Onsite and vending signings are on pace to achieve our 2018 targets. As mentioned, we had significant operating leverage in the second quarter, including employee-related expenses and our gross margin was stable on a sequential basis, which I think was an important thing to note. And the real key to the stability from Q1 to Q2 from my perspective is we did a little bit better job using our own trucks. We have always talked about the fact that we have a great trucking network we built over the last 35 years. We have a structural advantage in the marketplace. And frankly, the marketplace is becoming increasingly more expensive and so our ability to divert some of our shipments off of third-party carriers on to our own network serve us well in any economy. It served us really well in the second quarter. In the context of normal seasonality, our operating cash flow improved in the second quarter. We repurchased some stock. And as we announced last night, we increased our third quarter dividend from the $0.37 we had been doing in the first two quarters to $0.40.","Flipping to the Page 4 of Holden\u2019s book, we signed 81 Onsites in the second quarter, that\u2019s a 19% increase over the second quarter of 2017 and we finished the quarter with 761 active sites, that\u2019s a 57% increase over last year. Our 2018 goal for Onsite signings remains somewhere between 360 and 385. Total in-market locations were 3,051 at the end of the quarter, up over the 2,937 a year ago. What you are seeing before your eyes is a morphing of the Fastenal distribution model. We are consolidating some locations throughout the marketplace probably a little bit more in the major metros where we have a wide smattering and some of those locations are morphing into Onsites. And so we continue to expand our in-market presence. We signed 5,537 vending devices in the second quarter, a 13.5% increase over the second quarter of \u201817. Our installed base grew 14.3% and the sales through our vending devices grew in excess of 20%. Our 2018 goal is to sign 21,000 to 23,000 and we feel good about that goal at this point. National accounts, our daily sales grew 19% in the second quarter. In June, we broke 20%. I have to say that tasted pretty good and I was proud of the team and everything they are doing to grow their business. Outside the U.S., our sales continued to well outpace the company and we are seeing great results within the U.S. and throughout the rest of the world.","Before I turn it over to Holden, just wanted to share some commentary and call this in the category of trying to be ever more transparent of what we do and what we are seeing in the marketplace. And at 7 o\u2019clock this morning, Holden had his typical call with our leadership group, our regional Vice Presidents, our VPs that lead up support areas as well as our officers. He discussed through the earnings release to give them more insight into what we saw in the business and he gives me a few minutes at the end to throw in a few thoughts and I just thought I\u2019d share with you some of the thoughts that were covered on that call. The first one we talked about with the group is we have really decided that hitting goal matters. We have hit goal \u2013 at January, we missed goal. Weather messes us up a little bit. So, we came in just shy of goal. Since February, we have hit goal every month and we had a big goal number in June and I was pleased to say we hit it. And in total for the first and second quarters, we hit goal. Hitting goal consistently gives you confidence to invest in where you are going.","From a gross margin perspective, we maintained our gross margin and the mantra of, hey, just use our trucks, played out really well. We have, as I mentioned earlier, a great trucking network and we are tapping into it a little bit more. We have been having a lot of discussions about expenses. And this is one where if I am looking at myself in the mirror, I have to say either we are not communicating really well or you are not listening. And I think it\u2019s probably more we need to step it up on how we communicate. So I am taking that piece on from the standpoint \u2013 after the first quarter, when we grew our labor expense about 14%, I got a lot of phone calls from shareholders in the sell side community really wondering, what the heck is going on that you are growing your expenses so fast and you are not able to leverage. What we have been talking about the last 2 years is the investments we are making in growth drivers. We made dramatic investments in our ability to sign vending devices. We made tremendous investments in our ability to implement and improve our Onsite network. We made sizable investments a little over a year ago in our ability to grow our e-commerce locally, and the other piece is understanding the fundamentals of how we compensate. Historically, a sizable piece of conversation within Fastenal has been incentive-based. If you read our proxy, you can see that if we don\u2019t grow our earnings, our leadership better enjoy living on base pay because that\u2019s the key driver of incentive comp.","In the first quarter of 2018, we added $21 million in pre-tax to our business that was double the $11 million we had added the year before when we compare \u201817 to \u201816. That causes our incentive comp to grow quite dramatically. And if I look at the 14% labor growth in the first quarter, 6 points of it comes just from expanding incentive comp, 1 point of it comes from Mansco acquisition, and the other 7 comes from adding people in the organization. ","If I look at the transition from Q1 to Q2, you saw our labor expense growth drop 400 basis points from 14 to 10. What really changed there? We put a little bit of a pause on hiring. We had gotten ahead of ourselves, but that wasn\u2019t the real change. The real change was we anniversaried Mansco and our incentive comp, while at a high level, is not disproportionately higher than second quarter of 2017, because in the second quarter of 2017 we added about $27 million in pre-tax. In the second quarter of \u201818, we added $31. The delta there isn\u2019t as great. So, our team throughout the organization are enjoying enhanced incentive, but they were second quarter last year. So, the comp is different. I apologize that I haven\u2019t communicated that better, but we saw a nice change in our ability to leverage. Frankly, I didn\u2019t think it was going to happen until the third quarter and the team did a nice job of deciding to move it up 3 months.","If I look at the MSAs and I have started to talk about that more, talked about that in the President\u2019s letter, talked about that at our annual meeting and in previous discussions, we are really learning a lot by really taking a good look at those 100 large MSAs, communities little over 0.5 million, what is our plan in those markets? And there was something that\u2019s jumped out for me and this isn\u2019t an exclusive thing to the MSAs, but it stands out when I look at it from things we are doing. And so, yesterday at our board meeting, the individual that leads the e-commerce drive is within Fastenal, it\u2019s a relatively small business, because there is so many things we do that don\u2019t lend themselves to e-commerce. We do Onsites. We do our local branch network. In many cases, we are fulfilling things for our customers that they don\u2019t even have to order and so e-commerce really isn\u2019t part of the Fastenal model.","But one thing that\u2019s really was interesting to see is that as we have been quietly building momentum in our ability to go to market in a bunch of different ways. And if I look at true, local e-commerce transactions where we are taking advantage of our last mile advantages, that\u2019s about a $100 million business and it\u2019s growing 30% a year. I think that speaks well and forget the fact that it\u2019s e-commerce. It speaks well to the capabilities of the Fastenal organization to fulfill and to serve customers\u2019 needs. And the interesting thing is we are seeing really nice growth within our Onsites as well. It\u2019s about ease of doing business. If I \u2013 I am also \u2013 and bear with me a second, I like milestones. Sometimes they are fun to point out. And this is probably a ridiculous one, but bear with me.","If I go back to 1987, the year we went public, we had about 50 locations back then. We had 300 and some employees. For the year, we did just under $20.3 million. I believe it was $20,294,000 or something like that. In the month of June, on a daily basis, we broke $20.3 million. So, in June of 2018, we did more revenue everyday than we did 31 years ago that the company that went public. I think that\u2019s a pretty neat milestone and I am proud of what our team has done in that 30 some years to accomplish that. Said another way, we are 254 times bigger than we were 31 years ago, that\u2019s kind of fun. I also thanked our regionals and our VPs and RVPs for a great quarter. I think they really demonstrated the power of the Blue Team and what we can accomplish in the marketplace and some of our structural advantages. I am blessed from the standpoint I have a wife that\u2019s not afraid to challenge me in most things in life, personal and business. And the other day, she was asking me some questions about the quarter. And I told her I can\u2019t tell you, because it\u2019s not public yet. But all kidding aside, she was asking about what we are seeing from the tariffs, she said, you are thinking any of your strength you are seeing is coming from the tariffs in the marketplace. And I answered really quickly and with confidence I said, absolutely not. I said what our business is about is we are a supply chain partner. And most of our customers are able to operate in a very lean environment because of what we do.","And I don\u2019t believe there is any impact from the lift other than if there is any impact to any of our customers and their activity that would create but there is no inventory build in the cycle from what I am seeing, which caused me to immediately go to Holden and say, hey, Holden, this is what I told my wife, am I accurate? And he canvassed our RVP group and he got a resounding, no, we are not seeing that at all. So, I thought I\u2019d address that in the context of the time. Second question she had which was actually just as good as the first was how does Fastenal react in an environment like this? And I looked at her, and I said, well I gave her the proverbial, I\u2019m a farm kid. And I learned at a young age, you don\u2019t react to the weather. You plan for it because you can\u2019t change it.","This is just like the weather. It seems to change on a daily basis. What I can tell you is Fastenal\u2019s biggest strength is our field network, our branch and Onsite network we unlike any other regional, national, or global distributor, we source a tremendous amount of product locally and so, we don\u2019t have a small, centralized group that has to be really agile, although they are. We have 15,000 people working in our branch and Onsite network that are agile every day so our ability it is not easy to manage through it, but our ability to manage through it is stronger than anybody else in the marketplace. And I would be going into a period like this, the confidence I have comes from the team we have on the ground. And that makes it pretty exciting. When I was finishing up with the RVPs this morning, I didn\u2019t say this to them because I didn\u2019t want to get weird on the call but I thought back to a movie \u2013 Gene Hackman is one of my favorite actors of all time. And I thought back to a movie he made back in the early \u201880s called Hoosiers.","And at the end of the movie, he cites a line as the scene is going dark to his team that, I love you guys. 22 years ago, I joined the Fastenal organization. And I didn\u2019t join because of the growth of the organization. I didn\u2019t join because of the opportunities of the marketplace. And I didn\u2019t even join because of the great people. All three of those were true. I joined because I saw in Fastenal an organization that treats people differently than other organizations I\u2019d seen in my prior experience. And I wanted to be a part of that. In an organization where you\u2019re inclusive, and you treat others well, and you invite others to join, and the only requirement to join us a willingness to learn and change, a willingness to help each other succeed, and a willingness to be challenged by others and to be willing to challenge others to think big, when you have all that, you have a home at Fastenal. Come join us. We can do great things together.","And I think you see it come through in a quarter like this and in what we\u2019re doing in the evolution of the last few years. I\u2019ll close with two thoughts, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Holden. My mom is having a double mastectomy at 11:00 this morning. I wish her well on that. I\u2019m going to visit her after the call and Godspeed on her recovery. 60 days ago, my wife had the same surgery, and I\u2019m proud to say that today, she looks and feels better than she ever has. So, I\u2019m thankful for organizations like Gundersen Health down on La Crosse. Our medical in this nation can do great things.","With that, I\u2019ll shut up and turn over to Holden. Thank you.","Holden Lewis","Thank you. Good morning. Why don\u2019t we go over to Slide 5 five? As covered, the total and daily sales were up 13.1% in the second quarter. That\u2019s consistent with the growth that we logged in the first quarter of 2018. We estimate that pricing contributed between 50 and 100 basis points in the period which is also in line with last quarter. Although, we should say that this quarter did have to grow over what were modest price increases from last year\u2019s Q2. And that did mask what was some incremental progress on price in the period. The quarter finished on a healthy note with June\u2019s daily sales growing up 13.5%. This represents the 13th straight month of organic daily sales growth ranging between 11.5% and 14.5%. And that\u2019s despite the stiffening comparisons we\u2019ve seen over the period. In addition to contribution from our growth drivers as Dan discussed, this growth is supported by what remains healthy macro conditions. The PMI averaged 58.7 in the second quarter and industrial production continued to expand at a low to mid single-digit rate.","Non-residential construction continued to accelerate for us leading our mix this quarter with growth of 15.5%. This includes growth of 17.4% in June. Manufacturing end-markets remain stable at high levels, growing 13.3% with sustained strength in most sub-verticals and from a product standpoint, non-fasteners were up 14.8% and fasteners were up 11.1%, both were in line with the first quarter levels. Though it\u2019s worth noting that fasteners in June grew 13.5% which is the fastest rate we have seen this cycle. From a customer\u2019s standpoint, national accounts were up 19.1% with 80 of our top 100 accounts growing. And in June, our national accounts grew 20.4%. Growth in non-national accounts continues to run in the mid to high single-digits with roughly 66% of our branches growing in the second quarter. In terms of market tone, sentiment in the field remains constructive, especially as it relates to the non-residential construction market and the good demand of the past few quarters appears to be carrying into the third quarter of 2018.","Now over to Slide 6, our gross margin was 48.7% in the first quarter of 2018, down 110 basis points versus the second quarter \u2013 I am sorry, our gross margin was 48.7% in the second quarter of 2018, down 110 basis points versus the second quarter of 2017. While mix is always a factor given where we are seeing our strongest growth, it was a relatively minor factor this quarter. There were two larger impacts. In the second quarter of 2017, we had a modest price increase ahead of anticipated higher product costs. So, the large decline in the current period reflects the degree to which those costs have caught up. Higher freight expenses were also a meaningful drag on a year-over-year basis. Sequentially, on the other hand, our gross margin was flat. There were no big movers in either direction, but seasonality was offset by a little extra leverage due to the strong growth, a slightly lower mix drag and steps to counter increasing cost of freight and imports. Price cost was slightly negative in the quarter and there is further work to do here. We do believe we will make further progress in coming quarters.","Our operating margin was 21.2% in the second quarter of 2018, flat on a year-over-year basis. Stronger seasonal volumes and the lapping of certain cost resets generated 110 basis points of cost leverage and an incremental margin of 21.5%. Looking at the pieces, we achieved 80 basis points of leverage over general corporate expenses and occupancy related costs. The latter was up 3% with growth in vending being partly offset by flattish facility expenses. Employee related costs were up 10% and that generated 50 basis points of leverage. We were restrained in our headcount additions this quarter with total and FTE headcount being up just 3.4% and 4.7% respectively. This was aided further by inclusion of Mansco expenses in both periods and a moderation in the growth of incentive comp now that we have entered our second year of stronger growth.","Putting it altogether, the second quarter of 2018 EPS were $0.74 though excluding a one-time tax item, this would have been $0.70 or up 36% from the second quarter of 2017. In the absence of tax reform and the lower rate that it provides to us, EPS would have been $0.59 and growth would have been 13.8. We continue to anticipate a tax rate of 24.5% to 25% absent refinements in the application of or discrete events arising from recent tax reform.","Turning to Slide 7, we generated $152 million in operating cash in the second quarter of 2018 or 72% of our net income. Second quarters are usually lower cash generating periods due to our having two tax payments. Still we were pleased that the conversion rate in the current quarter was above the 57% average conversion of the past 5 years which reflects the lower tax rates. Based on our expectations for continued favorable cash flow, we have increased our quarterly dividend from $0.37, which we established in the first quarter of 2018 to $0.40 for the third quarter. Net capital spending in the second quarter of \u201818 was $25 million bringing our year-to-date outlays to $53.8 million, consistent with the first two quarters of 2017. However, this reflects mostly timing. And we would expect higher capital spending in the second half of 2018 for expansions and upgrades at hubs and for property purchases.","We have also identified a need to increase our spend for vending equipment given the strength that we are seeing in that growth driver. And as such, we are increasing our full year of 2018 net capital spending projection to $158 million from our previous $149 million. We increased funds paid out in dividends by 15% to $106 million and repurchased $40 million in stock in the period. We finished the quarter with debt at 16% of total capital below last year and at levels that provide ample equity to invest in our business and pay our dividend which we actually increased for the third quarter. The picture for working capital was improved versus the first quarter. Inventories were up 11.4% in the second quarter of \u201818. Inventory on hand fell 5.5 days, which we view favorably in light of inflationary pressures and plans for additional inventory investments in the field throughout 2018. Receivables grew 19.6% in the second quarter of \u201818, expanding days by a little more than 3.5. This continued to be affected by growth in our national accounts and international businesses as well as customers pushing payments past quarter end. Fortunately, the intensity of this latter factor has moderated, and we have not seen any meaningful change in hard to collect balances. That\u2019s all that we have for our formal presentation.","And with that, operator, we\u2019ll take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Cieslak with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Ryan Cieslak","Hi good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Dan Florness","Thank you.","Holden Lewis","Thank you.","Ryan Cieslak","The first question I had is looking at the June sales growth rate, particularly with fasteners, big acceleration there from maybe what you guys were trending in May. Dan or Holden, maybe if you could peel back the onion a little bit and think about what\u2019s ultimately driving that, do you feel like it\u2019s a combination of both the market accelerating there but also maybe some share gains just trying to get a better understanding on what\u2019s driving the acceleration in fastener growth here?","Holden Lewis","I\u2019m not sure that I have a tremendous amount of granularity there for you I would say that if I look at June, our fastener growth in most of our categories actually stepped up pretty nicely right and that\u2019s true of our OEM fasteners which no doubt, the Onsite growth is playing a role on that as is the general economic strength that we\u2019ve seen but construction fasteners were up quite a bit in June relative to even May as well or March or April. MRO was up as well. So, I would say that it\u2019s fairly broad but we\u2019ve definitely seen the same sort of acceleration that we\u2019ve seen in the construction business broadly, we\u2019ve seen that in the construction fasteners too and so, I would look at it, and I would say that we\u2019re seeing stability relative to prior quarters in many categories. And then the construction piece which is accelerating broadly also we are seeing that from the fastener component of construction too so, that\u2019s probably what I would say about those pieces.","Ryan Cieslak","Okay, great. And then for my second question, really nice to see the operating leverage here in the quarter and the incremental margins within that range you\u2019ve talked about. It feels like as you get in the back half of the year, you continue to lap some of the headwinds you saw last year from an expense standpoint and if I hear you right, you said price cost dynamics maybe there\u2019s some additional opportunity there how do we think about incremental margins then into the back half of the year is there anything that we should be keeping in mind from a negative standpoint or an offset that comes in that maybe keeps you at the low end of that range versus potentially getting to the higher end of that range? Thanks.","Holden Lewis","Yes. So what I would say is the components that drove it in the second quarter, I think those are intact in the third quarter and when we\u2019re talking about the occupancy leverage, the general corporate leverage those should continue to be leverage able pieces of our overall mix. From an employee expense piece, yes you are right we have lapped those resets and that\u2019ll certainly be true in Q3 so those pieces that led to this leverage this quarter, those are still very much intact as we go forward you combine that with double digit revenue growth, assuming that that\u2019s what we achieve in the third quarter, and I think that that is a formula to continue to make progress on the incremental margins, particularly because I would not expect the gross margin comp to be anywhere near as difficult. So, that we did 21.5 against that gross margin is fairly satisfying and I think that where you\u2019re going with this is should we do better, we should be I think that the math would tell you that we should do better in Q3 than we did in Q2 from an incremental margins standpoint the one piece that I will contribute to that is the strong work that was done by everybody at Fastenal to deliver that leverage in the quarter, that does also afford us the opportunity to keep investing in growth and so, there is the potential that we may choose to take some of that growth and reinvest it in the business to sustain the type of growth rates that we\u2019re having but yes I would concur, Ryan I think that the pieces that drove this incremental margin are still intact as you go to Q3 we shouldn\u2019t have the same difficulty with the gross margin comp and if we continue to grow quickly, I think that the prospects were doing better on incremental margin in the back half are still pretty strong.","Ryan Cieslak","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Graham","Hi good morning. Three questions for you all. Number one, Holden, I harken back to the comments you made about a year ago that you have to deal with 20 to 30 basis points of gross margin headwind from mix. Is that still a number that you would go with and maybe talk a little bit about how you will backfill in the second half on that a little bit more. Secondly...","Holden Lewis","Hi, Scott. Let me take them in order and also, we\u2019re going to take two so, think about the second question carefully before.","Scott Graham","Sure. No problem.","Holden Lewis","As it relates to your first question, yes, the mix elements aren\u2019t changing. Again, with national accounts growing as quickly as they are within the mix and with the Onsites growing as quickly as they are within the mix, they continue to contribute more to our growth overall each quarter, I think this quarter, the Onsites were contributed 4% growth in our business and a year ago, that was 3.2% Those are mix issues that we\u2019re happy to take those on. But it does push the margin down and I still believe that 20% to 30% mix drag per year is the right number to think about. I haven\u2019t changed off those terms.","Scott Graham","Good thank you. Secondly, you\u2019ve got some really good operating leverage at the operating expense line, could you talk about the sustainability of that and how you\u2019re looking at that in the second half toward some of the incremental margin comments you made?","Holden Lewis","Yes, not a lot to add versus what I just contributed again, the pieces that drove it this quarter, I think those pieces are intact as you go into Q3 and Q4 in terms of lapping some of these expenses but what we won\u2019t have is we won\u2019t have the difficult gross margin comp and so, you blend all that together, and there certainly is a path to doing better incremental margins in the third quarter and fourth quarter than what we did this quarter the only caution I threw out there was we\u2019re afforded the opportunity to invest in our business because of the leverage that we achieved this quarter and we might reroute some of that into sustaining the type of growth that we\u2019ve enjoyed and so, I don\u2019t have a lot to add to that.","Scott Graham","Well, I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at, Holden, simply is you have this gross margin headwind, it is not going to go away. Does that get the entire company, particularly at the regional level much more focused on their operating expenses to generate the leverage to offset that gross margin issue?","Dan Florness","This is Dan. I will just chime in quick if you go back in time, a decade ago, we were talking about the pathway to profit and in that discussion, we talked about the inherent profitability of the Fastenal business and how that gets enhanced over time and how when I look at our most mature regions that frankly have a higher percentage of Onsite and in many cases, [indiscernible] business than the company average, they\u2019re also our lowest operating expense businesses and typically, our highest operating margin businesses and it comes from part of the expense management, comes from doing - it\u2019s hard work, you do it every day you don\u2019t let things slip through your fingertips, you understand what\u2019s best in class across the organization but part of it comes from the inherent leverage that comes in the Fastenal model when the average branch is doing 120 versus 100, you pick up hundreds of points of operating margin, when it goes from 120 to 150, you pick up expense leverage and only partial offset to that can come from the fact that your gross margin typically, a branch doing 100 will lose 100 basis points of gross margin on its journey to 150 a month but it\u2019ll also shed 450 basis points of operating expense and your net win is a 350 point win and so, it\u2019s really not allowing being a little bit lazy or a little bit lax on expense management today to let any of that slip through your fingertips, that economic model is what affords us to do what we\u2019re doing with Onsite.","Scott Graham","Thank you.","Holden Lewis","And at the Analyst Day, if you recall, we showed a couple of lines one was the gross margin declining over the past 30 years as we\u2019ve invested in these growth drivers and the other one was the SG&A as a percentage of revenues declining over 30 years as we leverage and I would just point you to the SG&A percentage in the first half of this year has never been lower in the history of our company and that\u2019s how the model is supposed to work. As Dan said, this leverage came through perhaps a quarter sooner than we might have expected, but the model is working as we would have expected it to.","Scott Graham","Great. Thank you, both.","Holden Lewis","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Your line is open.","David Manthey","Hey, good morning guys. First off, looking at that number of top 100 national account customers experiencing growth, I guess it was 80 this quarter. And Dan in the earlier part of this decade, I think you were talking about 75 out of 100 was normal, what is the historical low and high in that figure?","Dan Florness","I am going off the hip here, Dave. So, bear with me on that. I believe when I go back to 2015, I think we had a quarter where it got down in the 40s and as you know that was not helpful to our business. What I don\u2019t know here is obviously we have a solid economy. We also have some growth drivers at our fingertips that either weren\u2019t there or weren\u2019t contributing at as high a level when I go back to 2015. The Onsite, as Holden mentioned has changed the game and 75% of our Onsites are with national account customers. I believe that\u2019s the stat. It\u2019s in the 70s. And so we are seeing \u2013 so, what\u2019s the cause, what\u2019s the effect or chicken and egg or whatever analogy you want to use. The economy is given lift, but are the growth drivers getting lift? The fact that our vending is operating at a really high level that benefits all customers, including national accounts, but 80 is a really strong number. And when I go back to prior periods where we were able to grow our fasteners, especially at this kind of rate you needed to be in the 70s.","David Manthey","Okay. Maybe I will follow-up on that. But the second question for Holden, were you saying you picked up I guess $5 million to $10 million year-over-year due to price and you are saying that the price cost equation isn\u2019t quite there yet. So, I assume you are not fully recapturing your COGS increases. But am I right to assume that you are capturing enough of it that you are picking up incremental gross profit dollars, Holden, you are not getting lower gross profit dollars because you are upside down on that price cost equation, are you?","Holden Lewis","No, we are not, we are not. As I said, we are slightly under water just with regards to a price cost standpoint, but yes, as we said in the first quarter, we got a little incremental pricing in the first quarter from efforts that we put into place in the fourth. We actually got incremental pricing in the second quarter over the first. That was masked a little bit, because in the second quarter we were growing over last year\u2019s modest price increases where we weren\u2019t in the first quarter, but we made some incremental progress on pricing. There was certainly some incremental moves on the inflation side as well, but yes, we are not backwards in that regard.","David Manthey","Yes, sounds good. Thank you.","Holden Lewis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari","Hey, good morning. The first question is just around tariffs, you mentioned sort of they are not leading to strength. Does that mean that you didn\u2019t see any pre-buy related to tariffs? And then maybe if you could just update us what your sort of direct and indirect exposure is to China sourcing.","Holden Lewis","Sure. With regards to pre-buying, I actually canvassed the RVPs this morning to get a sense of what they are seeing in the field and it came back fairly uniformly that we really aren\u2019t seeing anything or at least nothing is being discussed with us about pre-buying product ahead of time. Now to be fair, I am not sure that gloves and goggles are necessarily the type of product that people load up on ahead of demand. So, we may not be that kind of product or that kind of company, but we don\u2019t believe that that is impacting our revenue growth rates in any meaningful way. As it relates to the 232s and 301, 232 at this point is just meeting inflation generally speaking with regards to that one. As it relates to 301 I think there is a couple of threads here, one is the first $50 billion that has been talked about. There is not a huge impact on us from that. Now that we have had a chance to see how our products are being affected, I will probably stick with about $10 million of COGS perhaps being affected by that. Although, it\u2019s in places we hadn\u2019t necessarily expected sort of indirect shipments on things like ball bearings and welding consumables and things like that, but it\u2019s a pretty small number. I don\u2019t think particularly meaningful. And so if it stops there, I am not overly concerned about the direct impact to tariffs. I think the question you are really getting at is what happens with the other $200 billion, should they go into effect? And honestly, at this point, we are not sure. I mean, it\u2019s hard to sort of speculate on that. I think you can make a case that somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% of our COGS may come from China directly and indirectly, but I am only guessing at the indirect piece. Again, that\u2019s more art than science figuring that one out. And also I don\u2019t assume that everything that we get from China will be tariffed, so that would pull the number down, the impact down. And of course, we would expect to be able to shift product perhaps from China to Taiwan or Vietnam or other sources. I think one of the great values of having a significant local sourcing operation on the ground in that region is that we know where there is alternative source of product that we can shift as quickly as anybody else. And so, it\u2019s conjecture as to what the impact will be if any, you would expect that it could have an impact, but we have mechanisms and such to manage that.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. And then just secondly, any color on just improvement in non-resi? For you, it was pretty dramatic. I know you have oil and gas in non-resi. Do you attribute it to that? And then is the margin mix on non-resi better than manufacturing, any color there? Thank you.","Holden Lewis","I think that the oil and gas and things around that are certainly helpful. The other thing I would point out is relative to manufacturing, right we talked about how our growth has been up between organically 11.5% and 14.5% for 13 months. That is not necessarily true of non-residential. I mean, for most of that period, our manufacturing was really driving that. If you look at the quarter a year ago in non-res, we were up about 5.5%, 6%. And so to some extent, I think what you are seeing is an acceleration off of some easier comps, but I do think that also we are benefiting from having injected energy over the last two or three years into the effort. If you remember, we really started talking about the tone around non-res starting to get better in March of last year and I think that that tone transformed into actual facts on the ground in November, December of 2017. And it\u2019s just continued to run from that point. And right now, it\u2019s running against relatively easy comps. And so that\u2019s about the color that I have for that. And from a margin standpoint, we always think about from a gross margin standpoint, construction fasteners fall somewhere in between the OEM fastener on the low end and the MRO fastener at the high end.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. Thank you.","Holden Lewis","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Merkel","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Dan Florness","Hi, Ryan.","Holden Lewis","Good morning.","Ryan Merkel","Congratulations on making me look completely wrong in my preview to you by the way. Nice quarter.","Holden Lewis","Don\u2019t take it personally, Ryan.","Ryan Merkel","So, just to follow-up on price cost and it was slightly negative. So, I don\u2019t want to make a big deal here, but can you just articulate for us why is price cost negative, what are the key issues there?","Holden Lewis","Well, I mean, the key issue is that inflation continues to run very quickly. As I said, we got some incremental pricing, but the quick math is we had feedstock or product cost that was going up somewhat faster. And so, yes, that\u2019s the environment. I don\u2019t know what more to add to it, I mean, it is inflationary for products and that inflation has not stopped.","Dan Florness","I will add just one thought to that. And I touched on this in April. I think we really started the hard press about 4 to 5 months later than we should have. We did some things last summer. Holden touched on that where we were raising some prices. Actually, in the second quarter last year, we got some nice lift in our gross margins. So, we were actually ahead of it a little bit. But in November, December time, we really should have been putting on the hard press. We have our meeting in December every year with our leadership. We should have had the hard press on. And I didn\u2019t really turn it on until April and that\u2019s completely on me. And so we are a little bit behind.","Holden Lewis","And to give you a sense, right so in Q1, we were sort of reacting to things. I think in Q2, we actually put a lot of discipline in the field just in terms of the messaging and that messaging flowed down to the RVPs and into the field and that was a part of that. And then in Q3, we have some additional tools that are going into the field to hopefully make this pricing process easier and so, that\u2019s why we struggle like everyone else does with what is ramping inflation but we believe that we continue to make incremental improvement each quarter, and I think that\u2019s going to continue into Q3.","Ryan Merkel","Got it, yes. I am just clarifying that it\u2019s transitory and it\u2019s not anything that\u2019s structural different than the past it was more just being late, not passing through the pricing so, that\u2019s good to hear and then my second question okay and then my second question, the non-national accounts, I think you said it was up mid-single digits and I don\u2019t think that has accelerated much correct me if I\u2019m wrong over the past couple quarters but my real question is that a market growth rate are the smaller customers or non-national account customers just not growing as well or is it just not a focus for you, and that\u2019s why the growth rate just isn\u2019t anywhere near the national account growth rate?","Dan Florness","Yes, I think there is a couple things going on our growth drivers, when it relates to Onsite really benefits the national accounts and a piece of the non-national if I think of the strength we\u2019re seeing internationally, that\u2019s much more akin to our national accounts Heck, our national accounts are doing a great job if I think of our local business, one thing that is impacting that and Holden, refresh me on the number I believe our branch count is down about 6% Q2 to Q2 when we consolidate a branch in a market, historically we\u2019ve talked about 65% to 70% of our business is our top ten customers in that branch frankly, you can retain that business without a great plan because that\u2019s a group of customers you\u2019re naturally engaging with and you do enough business that everybody matters to each other from the standpoint of they know Fastenal\u2019s an important part of their team and we\u2019re typically delivering the product to their backdoor so, the fact that we\u2019re coming from a branch two miles away or seven miles away doesn\u2019t really matter if you think of the other third of our business, so the other 35%, 5 of that is retail business and a piece of that retail business, when you consolidate, you have a high risk of losing now, in a $50,000 branch that you consolidate, there\u2019s three grand that\u2019s there and you\u2019re going to lose a piece of it the other 30 of the 35, you need to have a really good plan in place to make sure you don\u2019t lose touch with that customer because that\u2019s a customer doing $300, $500, $700 a month with you and your relative importance to them might be different and so, there, we have to have a really good plan and so, some of the delta you\u2019re seeing, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because it\u2019s industry growth, which it happens to be I think it\u2019s a case of 6% of our branches disappeared and so, there is some impact from that. Now does that account for why it\u2019s single-digit versus double-digit, I honestly don\u2019t know, but that comes into play.","Holden Lewis","And Ryan, I might contribute as well so, we are growing in the non-national account business faster than industrial production, which I think is meaningful in addition to what Dan talks about in terms of the branch closures, the Onsite growth most of our Onsites are within national accounts, but some portion of our Onsites are not within national accounts and remember, we do shift revenue from a branch into an Onsite and so, for those Onsites we sign up, maybe some of those have been serviced out of a store that wasn\u2019t a national account business and there might be a little bit of an impact there as well so there are a few pieces that are working against that number being better than what it is today but it is outperforming industrial production and we think the field is doing a nice job.","Dan Florness","And it\u2019s helped for farming the organic growth for the industry.","Ryan Merkel","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Adam Uhlman","Hi good morning.","Holden Lewis","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Uhlman","Hi, I was wondering if we could cycle back to the.","Dan Florness","Hi, Adam. Adam?","Adam Uhlman","Yes?","Dan Florness","Good report yesterday.","Adam Uhlman","Thank you. I wanted to circle back on the investment drivers I guess as we think about the back half of the year here we touched on it maybe a little bit but the headcount growth has been relatively low and it would seem as if there might be some need to add additional heads into the back half of the year to support the growth that you are seeing and I\u2019m just trying to understand how you guys are conceptualizing that investment spend into headcount could it be only a couple of points of extra growth or is there something where we should be expecting a bigger ramp?","Dan Florness","The message we\u2019ve had to the team is where you\u2019re signing Onsites, where you have business growth, add people and we\u2019ve been investing at a pretty healthy clip and as I mentioned, by the first quarter, in all honesty, we probably got a little bit ahead of our self and so, we just put a pause on we didn\u2019t stop hiring we put a pause on but if you actually drift into the weeds a little bit, you\u2019d see that from a pure headcount standpoint, there was more drop in the part-time than there was in the fulltime so, the loss of hours and energy wasn\u2019t as great the other thing is as we migrate to a bigger and ever bigger piece of our business being Onsite, we become more efficient if I think about some time ago and I forget the exact time it was a little over a year ago we took over the hosting of our vending network what that afforded us to do is to interconnect the vending information much more directly into our point of sales system so, the lift, the workload for servicing vending, while it\u2019s still sizable and we are doing things every day that make it a little bit more efficient, it\u2019s much more efficient today than it would have been 12 months ago because the interconnectedness within our point of sales system and our trajectory system that runs the vending platform is much more seamless today but we will continue to add headcount to support our growth but we\u2019re working against comps that are really different and that really is what speaks to Holden\u2019s confidence in our ability to achieve leverage.","Adam Uhlman","Okay, got it. And then secondarily, thanks for the disclosure on the e-commerce business that\u2019s a lot of incremental revenue off of a small base I was just wondering if you could touch on anything new or different that you\u2019re doing there relative to what you\u2019ve talked about in the past and how big do you think it could get for you within your current business model? Thanks.","Dan Florness","Yes, at this point, on the last part of your question, I\u2019d be just posing a wild guess and my wild guess would be, frankly, no better than anybody else\u2019s wild guess but to the part about what we are doing different for 3 years, our e-commerce was negative, nominal and it was a relatively small business, because it wasn\u2019t an emphasis point we started investing in resources into our team early part of 2017 and we added an RESS and I hope I have the acronym right help me out, Holden, regional e-commerce sales specialist.","Holden Lewis","There you go.","Dan Florness","Okay. And it\u2019s a small team, but really what they are about is engaging with our branch network, our Onsite network to go out and drive that our IT team is operating at a higher level today than I\u2019ve ever seen in my 22 years what the team has put in place we\u2019ve always had great talent, but we weren\u2019t always able to muster up the resources to do great things and right now, we\u2019re doing some great things and the system they put in place that we rolled out what we call FAST 360 a year ago and that\u2019s really a visibility tool for our customers to see what\u2019s on their plant floor, whether it\u2019s in a vending machine or in a bin stock location so many times historically, customers don\u2019t know always what\u2019s in their facility because a lot of what we sell is coined MRO so, when it\u2019s bought, it\u2019s expense. So, there\u2019s no visibility to where stuff is even on the OEM side, most ERP systems don\u2019t give you the level of visibility to know where stuff is our FAST 360 does that for our customers and we rolled that out a year ago and that\u2019s growing nicely in our business and it works out really well in our Onsites as well the team is really leveraging that start and our same day capabilities at our branch network to really tap into we can do today what many companies aspire to do and we\u2019ve connected some of the dots electronically to do it but I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself it is still a relatively small number, but we\u2019re tapping into making it easier to buy from us today, 90% of our sales go through an omni-channel, goes through we only have \u2013 we have 10% of our sales where the customer buys through one channel and that\u2019s typically our retail business and our what we call Tier 1 customers, so relatively small customers that interact with us only at the branch level. But when you start layering in where you source at the branch through an Onsite, through vending, through a bin stock internationally, e-commerce and put all those together, that\u2019s 90% of our revenue. So, we are doing things today and we have been naturally for years what other companies aspire to do and you are just seeing it shine through because we have a group that has a really good plan and they are executing to it, but it\u2019s still a relatively small part of the business and I have the foggiest idea where it will go to.","Adam Uhlman","Best of luck to your mom and wife.","Dan Florness","Thank you. With that, I see that we are at just a few minutes before the hour. I hope I am not cutting anybody off who had a question, but thanks again for your interest this morning. And I do sincerely believe we have a great story to tell. The Blue Team is blessed with great people. And I believe we do something special for our customers and they recognize it and it affords us the ability to grow.

Last -- will be filing our annual report here in the early part of first half of February. And so last weekend, I was drafting the letter to shareholders and employees for inclusion in that annual report. And one of the observations contained in that letter is a comparison of 2019 and 2015. Because when I was -- when I'm writing that letter, I typically will go back and reread a few letters. And one reason to do that is so you're not too repetitive. Another reason to do that to see what observations jumped out the time. ","Back in 2015, we started out the year with PMI Index 52.6% that's the average of the first three months of the year as we disclose back then, not sure if there's been adjustments to the PMI since then. We ended the year just shy of 49, I believe it was 48.6. And in 2019, we started a year a little bit higher at 55.4 in the first quarter, in Q4, we were at 47.9. So, and we've been sub 50 since August. If I look at it using an internal benchmark or an internal yardstick, I -- I looked at our top 100 customers and this group represents about 25% of our revenue historically. ","In the first quarter of 2015, about 72% of those 100 customers were growing. By the fourth quarter, that number was 49%. And, given our size or relationship with each of these customers, the change in trends in a window like that is usually more about their underlying business than Fast now gaining or losing market share with that customer. If I look at that same statistic in 2019, we started the year at 81%, we finished the year at 57. Again, looking at the percentage of our top 100 customers that are growing with us. And I think that's a great barometer on the marketplace. ","If I -- yesterday in our board meeting, one of our directors asked, hey, if you're looking at Q4 and the question was about Q4, my comments your second goal was on 2019 in general, what would you give for a grade on the quarter? And without giving -- giving as the second thoughts, I looked at him, I said, you know what, I'll give it a B. And the biggest reason for the B is we did not leverage our earnings. In other words, our operating income growth was less than our sales growth. And I just can't give an A to that performance. So, I graded it a B. ","However, if I look at our team, leaders throughout Fastenal and the execution of the team throughout the organization, I think given the subdued activity, as indicated externally in the PMN -- PMI index, as well as internally in our top 40 or top 100. I believe the -- I believe the blue team executed well in the fourth quarter. December as you all know from reading our release, December was a tough month, we grew 1%. The midweek holiday over Christmas was not our friend. The January and -- the doing this been passed on for 24 years. And that means I have done just shy of 100 earnings calls. ","And there's one thing we don't do and we don't talk about current month in the current month. I'm going to break that rule. January started with a midweek holiday that Thursday and Friday the second, third was not our friend and we really haven't recovered from that. And I expect at this point, January will feel a lot like December. I don't know, if that means it will be 1%, but I think, it's going to feel like December did. Our sales team is adamantly opposed to that, they see reasons why will do better and time will tell. I genuinely hope they prove my expectation wrong at this juncture in a month, but I'm just sharing that. ","This has absolutely no bearing on my thoughts for February or for 2020 in general. Time will tell what the economy is going to provide for us and what headwinds are created or tailwinds are created. But December ended with a midweek holiday and January started with one. So I want to make that observation. ","Flip it over to Holden's flipbook. The -- I've touched on that second bullet, we really talk about December weakness and in the impact of the holiday timing. Despite everything that's going on in my comment about my beliefs and the blue team and it's being impressed by their executing ability. We leveraged our operating costs in the fourth quarter. ","We continue to focus on controlling our costs, not as a means just for the expense, but to put us in a position where we can continue to invest in our growth drivers. Because we still have incredible opportunities for growth. We have a relatively small market share, and I truly believe, we have a better supply chain model for our customers. ","As we talked about last quarter, the moderation and challenges of inflation and tariffs -- and tariffs and our ability to manage through it, has stabilized the price cost, holding violated rule last quarter and that he talked about his expectations for gross profit. I suspect he won't do that again. But what time will tell, but one observation I'd have for everybody listen to this call. Don't get caught up in the minutiae. ","The real issue in Q4, our sales fell off a bit more than we expected, and we have an incredibly large fixed cost trucking fleet that operates. And whether we're bringing one pallet, or three fourths of a pallet product to a branch, we're running a truck it still a stop. And that delivered more in the fourth quarter than we expected. ","So to add a little to the -- to that pain, our freight revenue also weakened. That's a short-term execution issue. If I were to attribute to anything, I think there's a bit of fatigue in the organization from all the tariffs and pricing and inflation energy that we had -- have expelled in the in the summer and fall months. And I think it showed up in our fourth quarter. That's an execution issue on Fastenal and that's on me. But don't get caught up in the minutiae of a gross profit a 0.1% or 20 basis points. It's deleveraging of a freight network. And that happens always in the fourth quarter, this year was a little bit more huge.","Flipping to the Page 4 of Holden\u2019s flipbook, Onsites, we signed 362 for the year. Our stated goal was 375 to 400 came in just shy of that. We ended the year with 1,114 active sites, about a 25% increase from end of last year. Sales growth with this group and this is excluding transferred sales. So this is looking at peer growth. So if we have a $30,000 customer that pulls all the branch and we go Onsite, it's looking at dollars above $30, was up in the low double-digits. As you can appreciate, in our more mature Onsites, we did see some degradation and that's a sign of the economy. Going into 2020, our goal remains 370 to 400, we're really excited about this growth driver in our business. ","Total end market locations were 3,228 verses 3,121 at the end of last year. We closed or converted 36 locations, traditional branches. We also closed 26 Onsites in the fourth quarter. Now that probably raises a few questions in many of your eyes. Here's a couple things to always keep in mind about Fastenal. Some organizations prefer only showing pretty pictures. Some organizations only prefer talking about good things. ","We talk about the real, we talk about the things that that -- the change. We address today's issues today. One of the -- one of the things the team at Fastenal has learned to live with over the last five years is every year I share with them what I consider my top 10 suggestions on life. ","Things that I learned from, from friends and family as a kid and that includes, where I grew up, family was also your neighbors. It includes teachers and coaches I was blessed to have in my life. It also includes the people you associate with in your adulthood. It starts with your spouse, extends your kids, but it also extends to friends and associates you come across. ","Number five on that top 10 list is make great decisions. Share the reason why and start today. If we have an Onsite location where that customers business has downsized, maybe they closed that facility. Maybe the economics don't work, and we decide to take that relationship and move it back into the branch. That's not a sign of failure. That's a sign of wisdom. That's a sign of saying, how are we allocating our resources and what's the best resource allocation for our customer, for our next customer, for our people and for our business. ","And I consider those decisions to close an onsite that doesn't meet the requirements, to be a good decision provided we don't think it's going to recover in a reasonable timeframe. Exiting an Onsite doesn't mean you don't come back. Doesn't mean you lost customer relationship. It just means the economics for being Onsite, aren't holding true right now, you take a step back. I think that's a great decision. And we will make those decisions every day. ","From a vending perspective, we signed 5,144 devices in the fourth quarter, essentially -- in line with our in 21,857 for the year essentially in line with our goal with 22,000 devices. Our installed base ended up at 89,937 an increase of about 11% from last year and our product sales through those devices were up in a little double-digits. ","In the order of avoiding confusion, earlier in the year, we celebrated vending machine number 100,000. This 89,937 includes machines that are principally producing product sales. We have another 15,000 devices out there that are leased out to customers for check in, check out purposes just to clarify that. ","Finally, e-commerce, our sales grew at 25% Q4 to Q4. For the full year, we were up 32% and this includes a 35% increase with our national account customers. The way we think about e-commerce, it's about making our business a little bit more efficient every day. Because, as our supply chain partnership with our customer grows, most of our business activity is coming from vending from been stocks. ","Where the customer really gives an order in the product and we keep stepping deeper and deeper into the business. Today those two pieces are about 30% of our revenue. I believe in the future, that number will more than double as a percentage of our business as become more in trench their and customers business. This is really a reflection of stuff that customers order outside of that supply chain window, the non-recurring stuff. ","With that, I'm going to turn it over Holden. ","Holden Lewis","Great. Thanks, Dan. Good morning, let's just jump right into Slide number 5. Total sales were up 3.7% in the fourth quarter, which included a particularly poor December growth of just 1%. December was affected by holiday timing and extended customer shutdowns. But even setting these aside, business activity was generally soft throughout the quarter. This was reflected as well in the macro statistics with the leading U.S. Purchasing Managers Index averaging a contractionary 47.9% in the fourth quarter and printing a 47.2% in December. U.S. industrial production swung to a decline of 1.1% in October, November. ","Manufacturing was up 5.1%, heavy equipment lagged at 1.4% growth with weakness as well in oil and gas, metals and transportation. Construction was up 3.1% in the fourth quarter consistent with the third quarter. Our larger construction customers again outgrew smaller ones. ","So we have seen a moderation in the rate of contraction in those smaller customers. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we sustained the pricing that was implemented and realized in the third quarter of 2019, as a means of offsetting general inflation and tariffs. However, things could change, but as we enter 2020, weaker end market demand and a more encouraging tone around trade policy has reduced inflationary pressure. ","From a product standpoint, non-fasteners continues to lead but did decelerate with 5.1% growth in the third quarter, while our more cyclical fastener line was up 1.8%. From a customer standpoint, national accounts were up 8.2% in the quarter with 57 of our top 100 accounts growing. Non-national accounts sales actually contract in the period with just 54% of our branches growing in the fourth quarter. ","November and December can be difficult months from which to draw conclusions about the future and that is certainly the case this year. However, business conditions clearly remain sluggish and the feedback from our regional leadership remains cautious on the early part of 2020. That remains our intention to take advantage of this environment to continue to invest in our growth drivers even as others pull back. ","Now to Slide 6, our gross margin was 46.9% in the fourth quarter, down 80 basis points versus last year. This annual decline was primarily a function of product and customer mix. The 30 basis points declined sequentially was in line with normal seasonality. So we were a bit shy of our expectations that gross margin would be at least 47%. This was primarily attributable to freight as Dan commented on. ","While the cost of maintaining our captive truck fleet is fairly stable quarter-to-quarter, our ability to charge for freight to partly offset those costs can vary depending on market conditions. In the fourth quarter of 2019, our freight sales declined 7.5% which resulted in less absorption of our fleet costs and anticipated. With our pricing sticking from the third to the fourth quarter and was weakening demand causing inflationary pressures to moderate, price cost was not a meaningful variable one way the other affecting gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2019. ","Our operating margin was 18.7% in the fourth quarter, down 30 basis points year-over-year. We believe the blue team did a good job controlling expenses as SG&A as a percent of sales of 28.2% was better by 60 basis points and a record low for a fourth quarter. However, as we have commented before, given our intention to continue to invest in growth drivers, even as conditions slow, it will be difficult to defend the operating margin when growth eases into the low single-digits. ","Our inability to leverage occupancy costs in the fourth quarter of 2019 a perfect example of this, with current growth not being sufficient to produce leverage over the vending investments to drive our market share gains.","Looking at the other pieces of SG&A, we achieve 20 basis points to 30 basis points of leverage over employee related costs which were up 2.4%. This was largely due to reduced FTE growth of 1.4% combined with lower performance based compensation in the period. In the current environment, we would expect further low single-digit growth going forward. ","We realized 30 basis points to 40 basis points of leverage over general corporate costs with lower bad debt expense and the absence of certain legal and structural expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2018, offsetting a higher IT spending in the fourth quarter of 2019. Putting it all together, we reported third quarter 2019 EPS of $0.31, up 5.4% from $0.29 in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Turning to Slide 7, looking at cash flow, we generated $252 million in operating cash in the fourth quarter or 141% of net income. Higher earnings combined with lower working capital needs to produce the cash flow. Full-year cash conversion was 107%. Net capital spending in 2019 was $240 million, exceeding our targeted range of $195 million to $225 million. The sources of higher capital spending in 2019 vending trucks and hub capacity were planned. The overshoot related to our addressing a number of facilities in 2019, as it means of managing a sharp increase in our volumes over the past three years, and a couple of those facilities simply costing more to complete than we anticipated.","In light of weak or macro conditions, we expect net capital spending of $180 million to $205 million in 2020. We paid nearly $500 million in dividends in 2019 and increased our dividends for the first quarter of 2020 by 13.6%. We've finished the quarter with debt at 11.5% of total capital, below last year's 17.8%. ","Inventories were up 6.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Nearly three quarters of this growth related to inventory to support Onsites. Hub inventory growth slowed sharply a function of both deliberate efforts to reduce inventory as well as weaker demand, while field inventories were slightly down. Setting aside the impact of demand, we believe there remains further opportunity to improve our inventory days in 2020.","Accounts receivable grew 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019, the slowest rate of increase in more than three years, which largely reflects slowing demand. Mix in customer behavior will likely continue to influence AR days in 2020 with our expectations being flat to slightly higher days. We believe these factors will continue to produce good operating and free cash flow in 2020.","That's all for our formal presentation. So with that operator, we will take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is coming from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Merkel","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Daniel Florness","Good morning.","Holden Lewis","Good morning.","Ryan Merkel","So first off, in terms of price capture, you said it was consistent with last quarter. So I just want to confirm, does this mean pricing was up 90 basis points to 120 basis points? And then sort of a related question, I recall that you thought you'd get some incremental price into fourth quarter, did this not materialize? And why was that? That's the case.","Holden Lewis","Yeah. So, what I -- ","Holden Lewis","What I would say is if -- the impact of price in the fourth quarter was probably the neighborhood of 70 basis points to 100 basis points, which would have backed off a little bit from where Q3 was. But again, much as we saw much of the year, that reflected having to grow above some increases from last year. If I look at the overall price level in our business and fourth quarter, it was slightly up from where we were in the third quarter. So, we look at the overall pricing activity from Q3. And then for the most part I would characterize Q4 is living up with our expectations as it relates to the price side.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. So the bottom line is I was maybe picking up there was maybe a little price pressure starting to materialize, but that doesn't seem to be the case just yet?","Holden Lewis","We aren't seeing price pressure materialized. Now, what we're commenting on has more to do with inflation. Remember, what we've said is as we've had two things affecting us over the past 12 months. One was the generalized inflation, the second was the tariffs. And frankly, the generalized inflation was a much more significant impact on us than the tariffs were.","What we are seeing is with some of the activity around tariffs of late and was the overall sort of slower demand level. Some of those inflationary pressures that have been a part of our business for the past 12 to 18 months have begun to moderate. But that shouldn't be ready to suggest that we haven't maintained our pricing that we achieved in Q3 because we have.","Daniel Florness","With that a slight color to that. When I -- first off, there's always price pressure. That's a constant life and it's, its intense now. If I -- but I make that comment again any quarter. The one element that does exist in the fourth quarter, that does exist in the first quarter is keeping the facts straight in the confusion at a minimum. And what I mean by that is we've talked in prior calls and we've talked internally continuously about the tariff and anti-dumping duties that are out in the marketplace, you have a 232 anti-dumping as relates to steel and aluminum that was put in place. And then you have the 301 tariffs. ","So the 301 tariffs and, and I get an update on this every two weeks and even that's not enough in many ways, because there's so many pieces that are flying around. I suspect if I'm in a branch in Fastenal, I'm going to have customer talking to me in December and saying, please the tariffs were just eliminated. ","Now the List 4 B that never went into effect that was had been postponed was cancelled on December 13. But that number went into effect and that was largely consumer goods, so that the impact of that is less than our world. Then the next comment might be we'll list, I thought I went from 15 to 7.5 well, it was just announced that List 4 A is going from 15 to 7.5 and it's taking through that piece. For us of the bigger one was frankly List 3, nothing's changed in list 3. ","So our biggest challenge internally is to make sure that an individual in a branch, a branch manager, a district manager, a regional leader, a national accounts person is familiar with these pieces as what I just laid out. Because when you're familiar with the facts, you can have a discussion. If you're not, it's very difficult to have a discussion about it. ","So that price, that pressures there primarily because of all the noise and confusion that can come into the marketplace. And a lot of the misinformation that can float around, but the fact is 4 B never went into effect. 4 A it was just announced that it's dropping and -- but List 3 is where the -- where the dollars are, at least for our marketplace. List 1 and List 2 were less meaningful.","Ryan Merkel","Yeah. That's helpful color. Yes, I think we're all sort of interested to see how that materializes if tariffs are removed, what happens with pricing such, but guess TBD on that. And then on the Onsite, you mentioned the closings and you mentioned the economics. I'm curious, is the reason for the worst economics do this only economy? Or is this more of the local team didn't assess the opportunity correctly? And this is something you can face?","Daniel Florness","I think it's typically economic. I'm sure there's examples of ones that, that we, that we decided either to, to pull it back, because it dematerialized is what we thought. Keep in mind, I know -- and I've used this example before, I remember travelling with the district manager several years ago and he had an Onsite that when -- when we were driving to the Onsite, he said, yes, and this individual knows as much about Onsite as anybody in our company. ","He's based in Wisconsin, and he said, I'm thinking of this one, and I'm not really sure about if it's a good idea or bad idea, but here's why I did it. He talked about going Onsite, he talked about what the relationship was and he talked about where he thought he can get it to and he thought he can get it to 75,000 a month, which is a small Onsite for us. ","But we've had a real frank discussion with the customer that, I'm only going to be able to staff at this many days a week, but again the freedom to move to branch a little bit further north and -- it was a better location for the branch. There he was looking at it and saying, if it doesn't work out, I pulled that back into the branch. As it turned out, he got it to 75 and a couple months later, he sent me a message and said, hey, we picked up some OEM parts, and we were to get it over 100. ","That change occurred because the customer loved what we're doing. And they figured out ways to buy more from us. That doesn't always happen. And so sometimes, you might have one where you're going in on an Onsite and you think you can get it to X and you find out that you can only get halfway there that's 30 that's 80 but you can't get 130 and you pull it back. I don't consider them failure. We took a $30,000 relationship with the AD we're having a frank discussion with the customer. It's easier for us to service that from the branch. I consider that we're engaging with that customer and it's a win. And that's one of the 26, I'm fine with that.","Holden Lewis","I'll add a little color to that as well. I think, looking at the causes of the closures this quarter, there were really no differences versus the ones that we covered with you last quarter, right? So, it's all sort of the same reasons. And we have to remember that in those, as Dan alluded to, some of those are simply taking business that we had it Onsite and moving it to a branch. So, I -- we didn't see anything different in sort of the character of those closures. ","And I think you have to think about the larger installed base. Once you get to a certain level, you do review that base for underperformers. And again, as Dan was saying, I think that's a healthy transition. But I think you should also think a little bit about the culture of the business. I mean, if you think back to vending, I think we started that initiative in 2009 that really began to get legs in 2011. ","And in 2016, we sort of went through and we looked at all the machines we put in and said, should this machine really be here, right? And that year, we had a higher than normal sort of removal rate than we had seen in previous years as we sort of evaluated the installed base. ","And, we're in fifth year of this Onsite push. And, I think that our culture in some respects is to sort of find these growth drivers, run fast, grab ground, and clean up a little bit later. And at the end of the day, what you're seeing right now is we built a good installed base, we're evaluating what we have, the churns gone up a little bit, it's down from Q3, and frankly, I think we're expecting a lower rate of churn in 2020. ","We'll see how that plays out, but in the end, what you wind up getting much as he did was vending is a great business where we're ahead of the field in terms of being able to implement it, and it contributes to gaining market share. And we're looking at this very much the same way. ","The other thing to your point about opportunity, this past quarter, the Onsite team actually sampled 400 locations. I'm not sure which 400 those are, but they wanted to sort of get to the same question that you're asking. And, these were decently sized 400 Onsites in terms of the average, but they found that in the products that we currently deal in there's still more than two times the revenue potential than then we already have in those Onsited. And again, these are smaller Onsites. ","So, the potential, -- we don't see any diminishment in the potential for this business. And I think what you're seeing us transition to -- I would say is historically consistent with how we execute our growth drivers and leading just to have a great business.","Ryan Merkel","It makes sense. Thanks. Pass it on.","Holden Lewis","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Barry with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your questions. ","Robert Barry ","Hey guys. Good morning.","Holden Lewis","Good morning.","Daniel Florness","Good morning. ","Robert Barry ","Could you say or could you how much the freight was a headwind to gross margin?","Holden Lewis","It probably impacted us by 10 basis points to 20 basis points relative to the expectations. ","Robert Barry ","And you think it now that just goes away or that persist as long as the sales growth is low-single digits?","Holden Lewis","Well, I think as long as sales growth is low-single digits there's going to continue be some pressure there, for sure. And that's not new and that's not necessarily unexpected. I think, Dan, also talked about, we just have some focus to bring to that, right? We spent a lot of effort in the last 12 months on pricing discipline on the product side of our business. And the degree to which you've seen us not really have to talk about price cost is a direct result of the success of that, right? ","We've been able to mitigate some of those inflationary pressures. We need to bring some of that discipline to the freight side of as well. And that's going to be a focus and a goal for 2020. And the degree to which it is or is not a drag will depends on our level of success. But again, we always have to put this into perspective. We're talking about 10 basis points to 20 basis points. ","We want those 10 basis points to 20 basis points, right? But, we're not talking about 100 basis points of riskier 150 basis points. And then we're also talking about something which is related to an asset, that being our capital fleet, which is a huge competitive advantage for us. So there's thing that we have to do better. It's -- focusing on that will be something we do in 2020. We do have to address the market that doesn't make it easier, but there are some things that we can do from a self-help standpoint. And that's probably how I characterize the situation free. ","Daniel Florness","Yeah. Rob the only element I'd add to that is. Part of it is, is about year-over-year growth, a part of its about sequential. So if you think about where we were in October to November, December that delver that's occurs, because you have this infrastructure to support that and it falls off. History has shown where January is relative to October. And depending on with the start of January will be in that normal landscape will still come into play. ","But once you emerged from that slowdown that you get around the holidays, and you get further away from that and the dollar's climb back. Then that delivered occurs from our distribution, our trucking freight, the trucking fleet, that dissipates. Because we not only want that 10 basis points to 20 basis points back, message to our team is, here's when we expect to get it back. ","Holden Lewis","And then to Dan's point, don't forget seasonality as well, right. Again, the crux of the issue is that you have relatively stable costs in your fleet. And seasonality, as you get into Q2 and Q3, you get a seasonal uptick as well on just naturally. So Dan's right. Part of this reflects simply the seasonal nature exacerbated by the cyclicality. So that is an element of it. But, we're going to work on executing it better as well. ","Robert Barry","Got it, I guess bigger picture, where do you see price costs going from here? It sounds like if the non-tariffs inflation was actually the bigger piece and we're seeing commodity deflation. I don't know, how do you think about the puts-and-takes because I think you said the tariffs inflation will peak in 2Q. But if you're seeing some meaningful commodity deflation like steel, I mean, could you see price costs I don't know even to be modestly positive? Do you see any line of sight to that or how should we think about it track? ","Holden Lewis","Rob, I'll make a deal with you. If you can tell me what tariffs are going to do in the next six months, I'll tell you what I think our reactions going to be. I've had numerous times over the last year where I have a discussion on Friday. And by Monday, what we just talked about a completely changed in the discussion became irrelevant. So I'm going to respectfully declined answer that. Only because I don't know sometimes from week to week and month a month, what's going to happen with tariffs. ","The economy, I can look at trends and look at prior years in Fastenal and I can least give up an informed thoughts. On tariffs, we really can't. All I know is we focus every day on shedding the best light we can for our customers, and building the best supply chain for our customers. And we're appropriate moving sources of supply. And that we've done quite aggressively in the last 10 to 15 months. ","Daniel Florness","And the only thing that I would probably add to that is, over the past six to nine months, the pricing teams the way they've been sort of structured, the work they've done to sort of surface, a lot of our challenges, the tools that they've deployed to allow us to react to events. We're in a far better position today than we were a year ago to manage whatever happens, right. ","So, to the extent that tariffs go up or go down, we'll be able to adjust to that in the way that we promised our customers that we would. And that would be within eye towards maintaining that price cost dynamic. Inflation, deflation again -- we'll have to see how that plays out. But I think that it really is, it's the other side of the same coin, right. I mean, many of our national account contracts have terms in it that are linked to specific steel price indices or what have you. And so those conversations get had. ","In the end, the question that we have to deal with our customers is what's the right action, to again be able to neutralize the impact on gross margin. We're not trying to take advantage of our customers. But at the same time, we're just looking to deploy the tools that we developed in the last few months, last couple quarters to essentially neutralize the impact. And that would be the intention, but again, we'll have to see how things play out as the year goes on. ","Robert Barry","Got it. Okay. Hey, just lastly could you say how December were...","Daniel Florness","Hey Rob [multiple speakers].","Robert Barry ","Yeah, okay. Up time, No problem. Yeah. No problem. Okay. Thanks, guys. ","Daniel Florness","Yeah. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Manthey with Baird. Please proceed with your question. ","David Manthey","Hey guys, good morning. ","Daniel Florness","Good morning, Dave. ","David Manthey","Over the past couple of years, your gross margins were pretty consistently been down 100 basis points year-over-year and some of that secular, some cyclical. And just as we look ahead to 2020, if the decline is less than that, what would be the factors you would see as is driving a better outcome? ","Daniel Florness","Yeah. So I think there's two things to think about next year in terms of big sections and assuming that the price costs dynamic remains neutral as it has been in the last couple of quarters. And that's obviously it depends on anything that occurs that we have to react to, but we don't know what that looks like. ","Based on what we know today, I think that with the slower, small customer business where we have fairly good margins and expectations for growth on the Onsites, I think you're looking at mix probably being a 50 basis points, 60 basis points, 70 basis points drag next year. Now that could change depending on the relative growth between the small customer and the large customer, but that's, that seems like a decent range to me. ","I think that we also have to think just about the cadence of the price trend from 2019, right. I think in the first half, we did not do a great job addressing inflation and addressing tariffs, actually we did better job on tariffs we did inflation, but the -- in the second half, I think we did a very good job on that. ","And I think that success will carry over into the first half of 2020. You might have some easier comps in the first half of 2020 before that sort of normalizes in the back half. And, I think those are the two big things to think about when you're thinking about how to model our gross margin next year. And then, yes, I think those are the two big things to think about at this point.","Holden Lewis","The -- what I would add is if we're able to channel that out, it's some things that we're doing, specifically inside the organization related to some of the products. For example, we're challenging and this is ongoing, we're always challenging our folks from the standpoint. If I think of our vending platform, so that's highly repetitive transactions. ","How do we -- how do we channels much of the spend to our -- to a select group of preferred branded suppliers and our own exclusive brands our private labels from the standpoint of it, it's not just about the costs of product, it's about the cost of the whole supply chain. Because its product we have on the shelf, if it's on the shelf, our distribution centers operate more efficiently, our trucking network and our freight costs are more efficient, our local labor costs are more efficient. ","And the first two of those three pieces impact our gross margin. The third obviously is an operating expenses the branch labor. But it allows us to have a product offering in that machine or in our ongoing supply chain offering, where we can offer a better price to the customer, because our cost structures inherently lower, and that typically helps our gross margin. So we're sharing some of the benefit with the customer. So it's a win-win scenario, and we're driving more spend to our preferred suppliers.","David Manthey","Great. Thanks, guys.","Holden Lewis","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe ","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Great color on the gross margins Holden. Just thinking about, you normally give forward quality guidance, we normally see gross margins in 1Q pretty flat, it feels like cubic units. It sounds like that holds true in 1Q '20. Any comments on that?","Holden Lewis","Well, a couple of things. First, I would dispute the idea that I normally give to our guidance. Dan, commented on how we rarely talk about the current month in the current month, because it's hard for us to know what's going to play out till it's all said and done. But sometimes things are moving in a direction where you deserve a little bit of guidance. And for the last two quarters, I've given you a little bit of forward guidance on the next quarter, because we had a lot of moving pieces as it related to the inflation to tariff a success around pricing, et cetera. ","And when your second quarter gross margin is down, I think it was 180 basis points. I think you all needed a little bit of guidance about what we were seeing and expecting. And so I provided a little bit of that color, but the idea that we usually provide that color, I would disagree with, and I'm not going to get into that game now that frankly, I think most of these moving pieces are kind of stabilizing out. So I'm going to remove myself from that game until a future period where there's -- where there's a lot of volatility that you need a little bit of guidance on. ","But, you asked me about the seasonality. At this point, if I assume that the trends in the back half of 2019 are sort of the ones that'll carry over into 2020 was sort of a neutral price cost dynamic. And then -- our usual mix piece and all that I think that judge what you think the seasonality is going to look like, and I think that's a reasonably -- that's a reasonable way to approach the cadence of the quarters. ","Nigel Coe ","Okay. Got it. I didn't mean from what the amount, but thanks for the color Holden. ","Holden Lewis","No problem. ","Nigel Coe","Just -- look my questions around the attrition on the Onside, so I'm just now that we've got to a base of over thousands, some level of attrition is normal and should we expected. So I'm just curious as if you can think about what you've considered to be, as a CEO, CFO, a normal rate of attrition going forward. Is it a 2% for the quarter the right number? Is it lower than that? But maybe also, if you just clarify the freight issue? ","It sounds like that's, -- I understand the seasonality and the absorption. But that -- this sounds like more of a price center obviously, we've seen LTL and TL rates, obviously down. So I'm just curious if we should be tracking price of freight volumes as a proxy for what's going on that side of the business. But my real question is on the attrition on the Onsites?","Daniel Florness","I'll touch on the Onsite attrition. And the second one and my count is a third so I'll let Holden to answer that. [multiple speakers] ","If think of -- ","Holden Lewis","I'm going to answer first in the context of vending, and then I'll transition to Onsite. So if I go back a few years ago, Holden mentioned in '16 the number of vending machines we were moving. It actually started before that. So in 2012, our vending really took off, and we pulled out -- if you look at the number we had again in 2012, and I'm going to pulled out 2013 it was 20%-some of the devices we pulled out. Because we've gone from a handful of district managers doing vending to a big chunk of district managers doing vending and a big chunk of our branch is doing vending and we didn't really have it doubt in where they should go and because it was a new industry we're creating. ","And that 20 some number was 20%-some percent the next year. And then it dropped I think to 17%. I don't have the stats in front of me, but then it dropped to 16%. We believe the long-term that number is going to settle in around 10%. Right now, we're at about 14%. So 14% of the installed base that 89,000 we said a few minutes ago, I would expect would get removed based on history in 2020. And our goal is can we get that down to 10%. If I looked at Onsite historically, just back when we had a couple of hundred a month, I think we would close about 10 a year. That's about 5%.","I think if Chris Wundrow were sitting here and Chris leads our team that really drives and hones our Onsite model. The team that is involved with evaluate our Onsite. I think the number he typically thinks it is about 6%. So how that plays out quarter-to-quarter if anybody's guess? But it's probably in that neighborhood. History has said it's going to be -- it's probably 5%. A person who is more informed to me and he thinks it's going to be 6%. ","Daniel Florness","In the interest Nigel, I was not encouraging people to ask one question with 12 parts. We'll address your second question when we talk after the fact.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Thanks Dan.","Daniel Florness","Thanks. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning. Thank you very much. My first question is just -- good morning. Dan, a number of years ago, you had something called pathway to profit and 23% up margin was sort of the goal. So maybe, do you view that is achievable still and any thoughts on that target as you look long-term?","Daniel Florness","Yeah. So that was pretty close to that one back in the day. I'll touch on that. In fact, I talked about pathway to profit in this year's letter to shareholders. So a little bit more insight you can gain from that in early February. But the pathway to profit was about our branch network. And about the fact that as our average branch revenue went from 70 to 80, and I'm talking about the revenue per month, so $70,000 a month to $80,000 a month, to $90,000 to $100,000 and beyond. ","As that number went up, we had a whole bunch of branches out there that were doing $120,000, $150,000, $200,000 a month. And we already know what the profitability is of that group. So we have talked about in 2007 when we introduced pathway to profit was, we're opening fewer branches today, which means the dilution factor is going to go away and the average revenue per month is going to keep climbing. And as its climbing, the inherent profitability of our branch-based model will shine through. ","We had a whole bunch of branches that were deep into the 20s. But a branch that does $50,000 a month doesn't have that kind of operating margin. A branch that does $70,000 or $80,000 a month doesn't have that kind of operating margin. So that 23 is still true for our branch network, but branches represent about 70% of our business today and the other 30% is Onsite. For Onsite that number is down in the upper teens from the standpoint of where the profitability is. ","There still a pathway to profit element of it. When we go from having 200 Onsites at the end of 2014 to having just over 1,100 Onsites today, that's a massive take off, and so our revenue per Onsite actually dropped, because we opened so many new ones. And so, we've been living through that for the last four years of that deleverage of our onsite business, because our average revenue dropped.","We're approaching now an inflection point where our steady state of how many we're adding is going to kind of neutralize. And our revenue per Onsite when we get later into 2020 and into 2021 is actually going to start inching up. And so that will still come into play. On a previous call, I believe I cited the fact that I think our branch network over time that branch network moves ever closer to 200,000 a month. Today it's in the -- I forget the exact number we cited, but it's in the 130, 135 neighborhood I believe. But as that moves up, I would expect that profitability piece to improve.","As the mix changes, I see a path to an operating margin where you have a 50-50 business who have a branch and Onsite in that low-20s. I've cited number at 22%. Time will tell if I'm right or full of it. But -- the number you said Hamzah was really about the branch network, which is a subset of our business.","Hamzah Mazari","Got it. Very helpful. And my follow-up question, I'll turn it over is on freight, how much of a cost advantage is your captive fleet? And, do you view that cost advantages offsetting execution risk? Just any broad high level thoughts there? Thank you.","Daniel Florness","Look, well the cost advantage is a constant. So it doesn't offset execution risk -- execution risk stands on its own. But the cost advantage, we've always felt that, running on a highly utilized trucking network, where you have products going and by highly utilized I mean, there's products on both directions. ","The number we've often cited if you contrast what it costs to move it on our trucking network versus shipping industrial product small parcel. And industrial -- and shipping, a relatively low value products mall parcel is incredibly expensive. And that's where the e-commerce world lives. And that's why they keep trying to build different types of networks to change that dynamic. We've often cited the relationship with 10 to 1 that it's about 90% cheaper. ","But again, we're moving a relatively low product on a captive trucking network. A third of our products, so if I look at our Fastenal products, there's a big chunk of that product category that has secondary operations. So it isn't just that we're moving it from supplier to the branch to the customer -- from supplier to the customer with the Onsite. ","We might be sending that Fastenal product out for secondary operations, it's going to go get heat treated, it's going to go get plated. And what it means in our faster industry and the reason we built the captive network to start with is many of our competitors, because they're using a lot of LTL shippers and other parties don't have that advantage. And so their freight costs, in many cases can become equal to if not greater than their product cost. ","And so one of the reasons we enjoy the gross margins we do in fasteners. And the reason we built a trucking network is we've just built a better means to move product around. But execution risk, that they're disconnected in the standpoint of what you're doing and what are your habits -- your behaviors every day? ","Daniel Florness","But I think it's fair to say Hamzah that the value that [affords] us because of our captive truck fleet is well in excess of a one quarter 10 basis points or 20 basis points lower result than we expected. We get huge dividends from the ownership of our captive fleets. ","Holden Lewis","Speaking of dividends we've raised ourselves.","Hamzah Mazari","Good. Very good. Thank you very much.","Holden Lewis ","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Hey, good morning, guys. ","Holden Lewis","Good morning. ","Daniel Florness","Good morning.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Dan, if you -- commenting on how we should think about mix in your kind of historical recovery. Dan you lead off talking about maybe the analog to 2015 that you saw. If I were to look at similar points in time or other, other periods where you think it feels like today. What is the mix on the way out? Is it that the Onsites recover faster because they're captive? Is it that the kind of the smaller customers or non-national accounts, where there's higher mix recover, faster. Just trying to calibrate how we should think about mix as markets eventually recover?","Daniel Florness","Yeah. So if I think about my comparison 2015 was more about just a trend and what we're seeing in the numbers. The other observation I'd made looking at 2015 is, in 2019, we started a higher point, and we finished at a higher point. And I really attribute that to the success we've enjoyed taking market share at a faster clip and the backlog we have in energy. ","I mean, in the last three years, we've signed either renewals or new contracts rough about 1,500. That's an incredible tear that we've been on. And that builds a certain level of just market share gains you get and consult. When I look at our relative outperformance to -- in 2019 versus 2015, in a similar PMI Index scenario, it's what the team's done to engage with our customers. And we have a massive footprint. ","So, to the extent that the percentage of our top 100 snaps back, and it moves into the 60s, and it moves into the 70s, because of there's a bit of a lift in the economy. That piece will snap back pretty fast and in our large account -- our accounts with a contract relationship would grow disproportionately faster because they've contracted disproportionately faster. And, but, and that's -- that's just a reflection of recovery in the underlying market. So, I would expect that to play out, the speed at which is going to be depending on what the markets doing and maybe holding us more insight. ","Holden Lewis","Yeah. I mean, I think this is an area that I think can be over thought many times. I mean, the fact is, whether it's an Onsite, whether it's non-fasteners, fasteners, most of our businesses, essentially all of our businesses are cyclical. And so, when you see an upswing it's fun talking about an upswing by the way, I hope it happens. But if you see an upswing, what happens is, you see the growth rate at particularly our older Onsites to get better, just as you see the growth rate in our smaller customers get better, just as you see the growth rate in our fastest and non-fasteners get better. ","Now does non-fastener growth coming out typically maybe outpace or sorry -- does fastener growth coming out, outpaced non-fastener growth probably? Just like it outpaces it going in, but if you look at Page 5 and you kind of look at the non-fastener and fastener lines, there is not a difference in how they move, right. They really move in the same direction. ","The gap may narrow or widen depending on the cycle, but as long as we're successful with Onsites, as long as we're successful with vending, I don't think you're going to get a period where mix works in your favor frankly. And that's just how the math works out. This is always where I always feel a need as well to, however to point out that, if mix is going to continue to work against us, if we're successful or when we're successful with our Onsites and vending and our growth drivers, you have to remember that we get good leverage over SG&A. ","One piece of perspective I might offer you is, if you think about our gross margin, fourth quarter of '16, to fourth quarter '19, I think it's, is down something like almost 300 basis points. If you think about our fourth quarter operating margin over that same period of time is down 60 basis points. There is inherent leverage in Onsites, there's inherent leverage in the pathway to profit we talked about earlier. And so, I wouldn't expect that mix is going to start pushing our margins up. Because, I mean -- I expect it will really successful as our growth drivers. I wouldn't conclude from that, that our operating margins are at risk, because there's inherent leverage ability in the growth drivers at the operating expense line as well.","Daniel Florness","So, Josh, I'm going to -- we're coming up on the hour. So I'm going to bring the call to a close. I'll just close with one thought and that is and I often bring a personal touch into this and I apologize for those people that rolled their eyes right now. But, last weekend, I had the opportunity to go to a funeral, a funeral for a very dear individual. Her name was Lillian Petersen. She was known as Till to family and friends. ","For me she was both in a way while she was a neighbor, she was also my godmother and I consider that family. She was 88 years old. She's married to the -- to her husband for 67 years. She and her husband had six children, as you can appreciate a multiple that and grandchildren and a great grandchildren. She was my Sunday school teacher. She was a giver of a great advice and affection. She was the writer of many letters. ","Over the years, I've received many letters from her and as did many others. Said simply, she was a second mom. I alluded to earlier the top 10 suggestions I share with folks over the years. And, as I was at her funeral and hearing the story about her life and learning all much of things that I didn't know, it dawned on me that she was an incredible influence around three of them. Number eight on that list is trust people. ","My exposure, Bob Curtin put a little add on that is incubating serious ideas. Number Nine on that list is cherished embrace the special words. Say please, and thank you. Always say you're welcome. You willing to say you're sorry. And show respect for all. And finally, enjoy something outdoors and all four seasons. She loved to ride bikes, she loved to go for walks, and she loved to cross country ski in the winter. And if you're foolish enough to live in Wisconsin or Minnesota, you better do all -- you better enjoy all four seasons. ","I'll close on that note. Thanks, everybody. ","Holden Lewis","Thanks, everyone. ","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Ellen Trester","Welcome to the Fastenal Company 2015 Third Quarter Earnings conference call. This call will be hosted by Will Oberton, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Florness, our Chief Financial Officer. The call will last for up to 45 minutes. The call will start with a general overview of our quarterly results and operations by Will and Dan, with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers.","Today\u2019s conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal.

This call is being audio simulcast on the internet via the Fastenal Investor Relations homepage, investor.fastenal.com.

It is important to note that the company\u2019s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company\u2019s latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we encourage you to review those carefully.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Will Oberton.","Willard Oberton","Thank you, Ellen, and thanks everybody for joining the call today. I\u2019d first like to start out telling you how happy the board, Fastenal board and myself are to announce Dan as our new CEO. We\u2019re very excited - Dan still kind of considered a new guy because he won\u2019t be 20 years until next year with the company, but we think he\u2019s going to do--we really believe he\u2019s going to do a great job. He has a great team around him that both Dan and I have helped develop over the last 30 years or so, and we think Fastenal has a great future under Dan\u2019s leadership. Thanks, Dan.","Then, I\u2019m going to switch to the quarter. As you know, it\u2019s been a difficult quarter for Fastenal. Talked a little bit about our sales - September slowed down slightly, and really it\u2019s a story of industrial fasteners and the slowness within or the slowdown within that part of our business. In the first quarter, we grew our industrial fastener business 5.5%, not great but market taking share, and then by the third quarter it dropped to negative 4.4, driven by not only volume but also some deflation in the markets, weak steel prices. We do not believe we are losing share. Actually, we believe we are still taking some share, not at the rate we would like to take or expect, but still taking share.","On a more positive note, our non-fastener business grew at 5.9%, taking share, growing that business, and that\u2019s driven by a great effort by our sales team and continued success with our vending program. ","On the margin side of the business, I believe the team did a very nice job considering the balance of things with margin plus and negative. Product mix goes against us when the fasteners are not growing. Customer mix goes against us when our large customers are outgrowing our small customers due to our success with the national accounts program, and then the deflation and weak steel prices. The positive on the margin that helped support it to where it is as we--transportation costs are lower than they would have been a year ago with lower fuel pricing. So there are some puts and takes, and overall I think the team has done a very good job of managing the margin. As Bob Kierlin always reminds me, the margin is more about our pay programs, our incentives and our pay programs than it is about mix. Hard-working, smart people have a way to make the margin work for themselves by delivering additional service to our customers, bringing value to the field.","I also feel the team did a nice job on expense control. We were able to add, I believe it was almost 1,300 people - I get so many numbers in my head at this point of the month, I lose it; but I know close to 1,300 people in the year, and still managing our expenses to have earnings leverage, which we\u2019ve never been able to do that in the past, and that\u2019s really a testament not so much to Dan and I and the senior people, but the people in the trenches that are working every day to run their businesses profitably and create opportunities for themselves.","The last thing that I might--my comments are going to be very short today. The attitude at Fastenal, the mindset that we\u2019re in right now is a mindset of we need to create our own luck. We\u2019re not economists; we don\u2019t know what the economy will do over the next two to three quarters, but we\u2019re not real optimistic that it\u2019s going to bounce back quickly, so we need to create our own luck as an organization. That\u2019s what we want to talk to the investing public about on November 5, all the things that we\u2019re doing - we\u2019re having an investor day on November 5 for those of you that don\u2019t know that - all of the things that we\u2019re doing to help separate ourselves and take more market share in 2016 than we would otherwise be able to do without being very focused.","We\u2019re going to talk about our increased investment in our stores. We\u2019re going to talk about the increased investment in our vending program, how we\u2019re refocusing that program, and believe it will give us well above average growth through 2016 and beyond. We\u2019re going to talk about our onsite program. Dan mentioned that, I believe for the first time, in our quarterly release that came out this morning about our onsite program, what we\u2019re doing with that, and why we\u2019re so bullish on that as a business--is why that brings value to our customers. We\u2019re going to talk about our web program, our e-business. We know we\u2019re not--we\u2019ve fallen behind some of our large competitors in that, and we\u2019re working very hard to make efforts to come back on that and present our customers with a very, very good solution for them to buy products electronically. ","There\u2019s a common theme to the four things that I just mentioned - our stores, our vending, our onsite, and our web. All four of those bring value to our customers. They bring product closer, so the customer has to do less work to run their business, so they can spend more time running their business than they have to spend buying parts that are necessary to make the place run.","So with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Dan and he\u2019ll cover more information on the quarter. Thank you.","Daniel Florness","Thanks Will, and thanks for the message that started the call as well. Good morning everybody, and thanks for your interest in Fastenal.","I\u2019m going to work to keep this focused on the quarter. As Will mentioned, we plan on having an investor day on Thursday, November 5 at our Indianapolis facility. We\u2019ll be talking a lot about 2016 and beyond, and one of the things--and I think one of the things that will stand out on that day is always looking at the facts at hand in a business. In what ways are we great, and in what ways do we have the best opportunity to leverage that greatness? The thing that always stands out for me when I think of Fastenal, and that was true 20 years ago when I joined the organization, it\u2019s true today, and that is we put a lot of energy into recruiting, identifying talent, and nurturing talent, and unleashing that talent, letting people make decisions in their business to impact their future. ","Knowing that, the second thing that we\u2019re great at is early on, we figured out how to make money in a footprint with a lot of small locations. We figured out--when I look at a lot of industrial distributors, a lot of great companies, regional companies, national companies, one thing that stands out is it\u2019s really difficult to make money in a store doing 50,000 or 60,000 or $70,000 a month, but if you can figure that out as you move beyond that, you can put people closer to customer, you have the ability to provide a different type of service than anybody else, and we thrive in a marketplace that wants to get better, that wants to be helped by some of the tools, some of the things that we bring to the table, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driven our ability to excel, is if you put great people closer to customer and you have a business model with a low--with a structurally low operating cost, you can compensate people fairly for what they are doing and you build a great machine over time, and you build a great organization over time. That\u2019s really what we\u2019ve done, and we want to talk about that in early November.","But getting back to the quarter, you know, I\u2019ve tried to incorporate over the last few quarters into our press release obviously the usual items that we talk about and disclose, but really some quick bullets on what are some negatives and positives in the quarter. I always want to get the negatives out of the way so we can then talk about the positives, because I think there\u2019s--the one list outshines the other. But the reality of it is, in 2015 we, our customers have been hit hard by the slowdown in the oil and gas sector, and hit hard by the strength of the U.S. dollar and the ability of our customers to compete effectively across the globe, and 89% of our sales are in the U.S., so anything that\u2019s negative to the U.S. market is negative to us in the short term as far as managing through it.","The other item, and you saw it in our September number, we have seen stabilization in a lot of parts of our business in recent months. The Texas market for us did take a little bit of a step down in September, and the other item I noted is our Canadian business - and this is all in local currency, so I want everyone to be mindful of that - you know, I\u2019ve heard a lot about the negatives in the Canadian market and the weakness in the Canadian market. We continue to--I put it in my negatives because we\u2019re only growing at 6%, because we were growing at 10% in the second quarter, but I continue to look at that and say it\u2019s a negative in that that business has slowed, but it\u2019s really a positive in what we were able to accomplish up there in a very tough environment, and it demonstrates the types of things that we can do, and Jeff Watts and his team, I think are doing a wonderful job with that business of continuing to manage through and prosper. ","If I looked at individual regions around the country, there is a lot of similar stories to our business. It\u2019s just that you have some geographic areas that are getting really--hit really hard, and those areas are big areas for us; but the positive is we\u2019re executing well in a lot of places.","I think that shines out in some of the positives I mentioned. We entered the year saying we weren\u2019t sure what the oil and gas was going to mean for us in 2015, but we\u2019re going to invest in people at the store level. We\u2019re going to invest to keep growing our business long term because the opportunities for us are immense, and year-to-date we\u2019ve added 1,234 people into our stores in the last 12 months - we\u2019ve added just over 1,300, and we\u2019ve continued to invest in the energy of the business. I think that\u2019s meaningful.","I did introduce our 2016 estimate for store openings, and right now we\u2019re setting a range of 60 to 75 stores, so 2 to 3%. I\u2019m happy to talk about that. The last few years, most of discussion has been about looking at some of our locations, rationalizing some of our locations, and we\u2019ll always do that, but also talking about what we\u2019re doing to grow the business because, again, when you have the ability to break a profit at a reasonable level in a store and you see opportunities to take market share in a lot of different ways, get close to your customer, this is one of those pieces.","The other thing that is positive is when I look at our national accounts business, and I\u2019ve gotten--I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with the folks in our national accounts team quite extensively over the last year or so, and some things that I\u2019ve learned over the last year is the opportunity is immense, and we\u2019re seeing that shine through in our signings. Now, we might have existing customers that their business has been weakened, and we have their business but their business is down 10, 20, 30%. We can\u2019t change that in the short term. What we can change is, are we doing everything we can to get all the wallet share we can at that facility with that customer? Are we doing things to help their business, because when we help our customers, they help us back with more business. Are we doing those things, and are we out meeting new customers every day? When I look at the pace of signings, we are on pace to easily exceed our last three years of individual signings with new customers, and I feel very good about where we are even year-to-date and the fact that we\u2019re almost at the 2014 number right now as far as signings and will easily exceed it through the end of the year, so very excited about what\u2019s going on in our national accounts business.","The onsite, as Will mentioned, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever mentioned it in an earnings release. You know, when I look at our onsite business, and I take a little bit more expansive view of it when I think of that business. I include in that what we call onsite today, as well as what we call strategic account stores. When I combine that business, it\u2019s really about dedicated locations, either physically inside the customer\u2019s facility or really nearby, dedicated locations that are about this one customer and getting closer and closer to that customer, helping them in their business, becoming more knowledgeable of their business. That business over the last 15 years has grown to be almost 15% of our--just over 15% of our sales today, so it\u2019s about a third of our national account business. It\u2019s a great win-win relationship - we can get onsite, lean up some of our operations, and really take a much wider view of things we can do for the customer, and I think that bodes well for us into the future, and we\u2019ll be talking on that, as I mentioned, in our meeting in early November.","As Will mentioned, our gross profit improved in the quarter. You know, we\u2019re doing a lot of things to make good, wise decisions every day at the store level, at the district level on how we price our product. Clearly the fastener piece is tough because there\u2019s some deflation going on in that market right now. It\u2019s creating top line issues for us. It\u2019s creating some gross margin issues for us. Despite that, we continue to manage through it and eked out a nominal improvement in our gross profit.","Finally, and this is about our district managers and about our regional leaders, they are managing the business really well in a tough environment. We\u2019ve asked them to go out and add people, and to that they\u2019ve added 1,300 people into the business. We\u2019ve asked them to open some locations, to keep building for the future in an environment where our existing book of business is going through a very weak period. Despite all those things, we had incremental margin of almost 50% in the quarter. I\u2019m proud of them for what they accomplished, because that\u2019s about them because we\u2019re asking them to do a lot of things. ","But with that, I will turn it over to the Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Adam Uhlman","Hi guys, good morning.","Daniel Florness","Hey Adam.","Adam Uhlman","Congrats, Dan, on the CEO position. I guess I\u2019m wondering, and I\u2019d like to start with--you know, you talked about it a bit in the release and the prepared remarks about the national account wins. I\u2019m wondering if there is any way to quantify the opportunity that\u2019s popped up with a lot of these wins already on track ahead of last year. Is that the revenue opportunity or just the sheer numbers of them, so could you help us with that?","Daniel Florness","Well, I guess the biggest way to think about it is national accounts, when we started that business 20 years ago, was low single digits as a percent of our business. Today, it\u2019s about 46% of our business, and when I think of national accounts and I add to that other large customer pieces that we don\u2019t classify as national accounts, but large regional accounts, a lot of our government business, when you start adding all those pieces together, you\u2019re probably talking 56%, 57% of our business. Yeah, I don\u2019t know if everybody knows all the facts of life, but I\u2019ve always been a firm believer - 80\/20 works in a lot of things, and I really believe that the large account business, the national account business can be 70%, 75%, maybe 80% piece of our business if you broaden the definition a little bit of our business long term. The real question is how do we keep growing that business? Given that we have a structural advantage in the marketplace, we have people close by a lot of these locations. A lot of these locations are not in the major metros - they are in various locations through the States, through the provinces in Canada, around the planet, and so the fact that we can get close to a lot of them and grow it long term, I think is tremendous. I do believe that\u2019s going to be a driver of our growth long term, and vending and onsite are merely another tool to that, growing that business.","Adam Uhlman","Okay. I\u2019m just wondering--you know, because the revenues were only up 1% in the quarter. If nothing changes next year, should we expect it to get another --?","Willard Oberton","Revenues are up 1% because our top 10 dropped. I mean, if you look at where we\u2019ve done a great job in the last three or four years, it\u2019s heavy industry, and that heavy industry has dropped tremendously. Dan mentioned oil and the strong dollar. The other big one is agriculture for us, and mining and, things like that, so the gap between us signing a lot of--you know, more accounts and our national account performance, it\u2019s two different things right now. We\u2019re taking share for the future. The economy picks up, we will be rewarded for that, is what we believe.","Adam Uhlman","Okay, thanks. ","Willard Oberton","Does that make sense?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Robert Barry","Hey guys, good morning.","Willard Oberton","Good Morning Robert.","Robert Barry","And Dan, congratulations.","Daniel Florness","Thank you.","Robert Barry","So it sounds like even though the top line is decelerating that the messaging on investment is that it\u2019s going to remain strong, maybe even accelerate with more store openings, ecommerce investment, et cetera. So curious how we should be thinking about the SG&A line over the next 12 to 18 months.","Willard Oberton","What we have--you know, over the last couple quarters, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking at where we can make the maximum investment and still maintain at least not negative leverage - you know, some positive leverage like we did in this quarter. We\u2019ve done a nice job of that, so we\u2019re going to invest in--we\u2019re going to talk about investing in some inventory for our stores, but we\u2019re going to take that inventory out of our--we\u2019re going to redeploy the inventory from distribution to the front line, and we have a very good plan for that. We talk about vending - we\u2019ve added--we\u2019ve greatly increased our sales force. We\u2019ve found other areas to offset those expenses, and we\u2019ve found ways to pay for those people. ","So what we\u2019ve had to do is we\u2019ve had to become very focused, and one of the reasons we have to do that is for the investing public, but the bigger reason is for our employees who get paid off the performance of the business, and so we\u2019re very focused on creating our own luck, but at the same time we\u2019re not going to give away the bank and destroy the quarter. So looking forward, tight expense control, continue to add people at a certain level, and hopefully separate ourselves with additional growth.","Daniel Florness","One thing you have to always keep in perspective, and we\u2019ve touched on this a lot over the last seven or eight years is what we have always coined the pathway to profit, and that is anything that we can do that drives the average--that drives our average store to get a little bit bigger has incredible profit gains built into it, and you can invest some dollars to do that, and the only thing that\u2019s on our list that doesn\u2019t drive that in the ultimate sense is opening 60 or 75 stores, and we know what that costs and that\u2019s a pretty modest cost. So it\u2019s really all the rest of the things are about things we can do to drive the top line, because the deflation--the negatives that we\u2019ve had in our business are already embedded in our business. The negatives that have occurred in 2015, the customer that\u2019s down 10 or 15 or 20 or 30%, that\u2019s already inherent in our business, so the things that we can do to drive market share gains faster, whether that\u2019s national account signings or driving our vending, driving our onsite as a complement to the national account signings, all those are wins that are highly profitable wins and allow us the luxury of investing.","Robert Barry","Guys, that all makes sense, and I think the focus on the top line seems reasonable. But it does also sound like you are willing to live with, at least in the near term, what could be very low incrementals given what\u2019s happening on the top line, and yet this commitment to pushing on the investment. Is that fair? Like, how are you thinking about the incrementals?","Willard Oberton","I think that\u2019s fair. I mean, although a 50% incremental is great, when you only have a couple percentage points of earnings growth, it doesn\u2019t add up in real dollars. Our pathway, and I believe what our true long-term shareholders want, is they want us to grow, and we\u2019re going to work very hard in that growth but be very smart about it. We\u2019re not going to be trying a bunch of crazy things that we don\u2019t--you know, new things, because we don\u2019t have a lot of luxury to do that right now. As both Dan and I laid them out, we\u2019re going to invest in things that are very tried and true with a great team that knows how to execute, and we\u2019re going to have to say no a lot to good ideas that don\u2019t make the top of the list. In doing that, we believe we can be on that balance point, a little bit of incremental earnings growth, but that\u2019s not our major focus. Our major focus is getting some growth back and doing it wisely, and that\u2019s using the things we know very well and keeping our costs low in every investment we make. We\u2019re good at that.","Robert Barry","Great, thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","David Manthey","Thank you. Good morning everybody, and congratulations Dan. ","Daniel Florness","Morning, Dave. Thanks.","David Manthey","First off, on the deflation, both of you in your monologues mentioned it, and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019d tell us what the top line impact on revenues of fasteners and non-fasteners were in the current quarter relative to pricing?","Daniel Florness","The deflation is really about the fastener side of the business, and it\u2019s about 40% of our business. That\u2019s about--we\u2019re seeing about two points of deflation right now in the business.","David Manthey","Okay. Then as it relates to your FIFO inventory methodology as we look ahead to 2016, are there any implications there or generally what are your expectations for pricing and margins in 2016?","Daniel Florness","Sure. You know, our inventory turns about twice a year. That\u2019s our overall inventory. Our fasteners turn slower than that, and so the deflation has been a full this year. It\u2019s hurt our top line, it\u2019s hurt our gross margin, but we really haven\u2019t seen much of the benefits through our cost of goods because that inventory was coming on our shelves, and if you think about the pace of our business, if our business is growing faster than we expect, that inventory is turning a little faster. If we\u2019re growing a bit slower, that inventory stretches out a little bit. But that bodes well for us going into 2016. That will be a friend to our business.","David Manthey","Okay, so you expect pricing out the door to remain relatively benign, then, and you\u2019re benefiting from the lower cost inventory?","Daniel Florness","The pricing out the door is going to depend on what the market is doing in the next 12 months, Dave, more than anything. Is the market stable, is the market improving, is the market weakening? If the market is stable or improving, I think we can do a pretty good job holding onto that, and most of it will be about the new business we\u2019re adding and is there a mix difference going on, than anything else.","David Manthey","Alright, and just to be clear, the 2% you mentioned, that\u2019s revenues to Fastenal on fasteners in terms of pricing?","Daniel Florness","Yes.","David Manthey","Okay, very good. One clarification here - when Will was talking, I think he cut out a little bit. Will, you were saying something about creating your own luck, and then I believe you said you\u2019re not optimistic things will bounce back quickly. Is that what you said, or did I catch that wrong?","Willard Oberton","No, I\u2019m saying that we\u2019re not planning--personally, I\u2019m not real optimistic when I look at everything going on in the world, and that\u2019s the way the thinking is, is let\u2019s create our own luck. If I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019ll be the happiest guy in the room, but right now when you look at election year, you look at the turmoil in the Middle East, China, and many other parts of the world, weak economy in Europe, there\u2019s nothing that points--it doesn\u2019t like oil is going to come back, and corn is probably low for a long time. There aren\u2019t a lot of strong economic indicators that are going to push us up, but we\u2019re in a huge market. We\u2019re in a market that in the U.S. alone is, who knows, 100 to $150 billion. It\u2019s at least 100, we know that, [indiscernible], so we have to go out and take share. Our problem today isn\u2019t that we aren\u2019t taking share. ","Our problem today is that our base business, as Dan said earlier, has shrunk. Our good existing customers are buying less for us, so to grow at 2%, we have to take share at a much faster rate. If the economy just stabilizes and that base of business just stays flat, we\u2019re going to stack business on top and we\u2019re going to separate ourselves from our competitors and the market, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re planning on. Now, if it were to bounce back and we were to do that at the same time, then you\u2019ll see growth like we had--I believe you\u2019ll see growth like we had in 2010, where we were getting the benefit of our existing customers growing at a rapid pace and new business piling on top of that. So those are the two scenarios. My crystal ball tells me it\u2019s probably the one where we take share and add it on top of a more stable base.","David Manthey","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy of Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, everyone. Congratulations Dan.","Daniel Florness","Thank you.","Robert McCarthy","So a few questions here. I guess in terms of--you know, we\u2019ve spoken in the past that the expectation is that perhaps you would have seen growth in September, given what you saw in recent pronouncements and monthly sales releases, but it\u2019s obviously inflected negatively. Could you expand on what your expectations are, given the tougher compares in the fourth quarter into 1Q, given the stack of what you\u2019re seeing? What should we expect qualitatively for growth in the fourth quarter?","Daniel Florness","You know, we\u2019ve never been good at forecasting the future, so we\u2019ve tended to stay away from it. What we are trying to do is talk about what we\u2019re doing to invest and how we\u2019re going to manage through it. We were disappointed by the September number as well. With 10 days left in the month, it was looking to be slightly negative, as we saw, and so it wasn\u2019t a case of strong finish, weak finish, that kind of thing. It was pretty steady throughout the month. It was more pronounced in certain geographic areas, like I talked about. Like I say, I look around the country and I see a lot of positive things, but saw some things that did worsen. So--","Willard Oberton","Business is slow.","Daniel Florness","Business is slow, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to--I don\u2019t see anything externally that\u2019s going to cause it to pick up in the next three months, so Will\u2019s point of we need to make our own luck. We need to look at our business, we need to look at things we\u2019re really good at, things where we have great relationships with customers, and set our priorities accordingly and drive our own growth, make our own luck.","Robert McCarthy","Yes, and just as a follow-up to that, I think I\u2019d take your comments to imply that the fourth quarter, given what we see in terms of the stack of compares, would be negative in terms of the top line. How do you think about the gross margin, given the supplier or lack of supplier incentives, and the seasonal nature? Should we be thinking about a sequential downtick there qualitatively? Probably, right? I mean, how do you think about the fourth quarter in terms of the factors that are going to drive gross margin there?","Daniel Florness","You know, I think we\u2019ll manage through it just fine. We know our team on the supply side, managing our transportation areas, they are ready to manage through that piece. They know what we\u2019re expecting as well. When I think of the mix of our business and what are the things that are positive and negative to our fourth quarter and our 2016, I believe we can manage the gross margin through it just fine, so I\u2019m optimistically looking at 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015 that we\u2019ll manage through it in true Fastenal style, and to be just fine with our gross margin.","Robert McCarthy","One last question, if you\u2019ll indulge me. In terms of the 60 to 65 of store adds, could you talk just qualitatively how we should think about capex and opex there? What are the learnings from basically driving growth at your existing stores now? Are you looking at different geographies or different footprints or different configurations for your stores so that you\u2019ll get a better return on the store growth, because probably you\u2019re optimizing for the right region? ","Daniel Florness","You know, first off on the capex side, our capex, whether you\u2019re looking at 2015 or 2016 and beyond, there\u2019s never much capex that goes into new stores If you think about a new store, the capex that\u2019s going into it, it\u2019s really centered on computer system, some shelving and a pickup. The rest of it is working capital, primarily inventory obviously. So the investment going into a new store, we\u2019ve dialed that in years ago, so we\u2019re really, really efficient about that.","Our capex going into next year is really about what are we doing on the front of vending, what are we doing as far as our distribution centers, and what are we doing as far as our vehicle fleet, because those are really where the dollars are driven, not if we open 75 stores or if we open 25 stores.","Robert McCarthy","I guess we\u2019ll get further color on that at the November analyst day in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about the capex, but clearly given the level of investment, you expect an uptick there?","Willard Oberton","No.","Daniel Florness","No, no. I can give a preliminary number on our capex for next year. This year, we\u2019re going to be in kind of that mid-150s neighborhood, between 155 and $158 million, and that\u2019s very much in line with what we talked about earlier in the year. I would expect next year, our capex will drop meaningfully. It will be in that 130 neighborhood, maybe 125.","Robert McCarthy","And what\u2019s the driver of that? What\u2019s the driver of that, given the level of investing and vending and DCs, et cetera?","Daniel Florness","The real driver of that is if you think about our business over the last few years, we had two big drivers of capex. One was we came out a number of years ago and said, you know what? We\u2019ve automated two of our distribution centers. We really like what we\u2019ve seen, and we\u2019re going to do that into the future and we\u2019re going to do it aggressively. So we went from having two distribution centers fully automated, today about 84% of our picks are done through automated DCs, so now what happens is in an Akron, Ohio, for example, where we have a highly automated distribution center, the dollars that go into there today are more about how much of that business is growing, what do we need in distribution capacity to support that growth, but we\u2019re not automating the facility, we\u2019re expanding the facility. So that\u2019s a completely different proposition, so our capex when I think of distribution will drop meaningfully from where it was in each of the last three years.","The second one is vending. When we started vending back a number of years ago, we really didn\u2019t know how fast this thing would grow. If you recall in 2012, we started the year saying, jeez, if we could sign X-number--you know, 10,000 machines for the year, we\u2019d consider that a home run, and we hit that number, I believe it was around July 6. The one thing that we wanted to do is we wanted to have our powder dry to support that business, so not only did we invest capital in the machines we were deploying, we invested capital in the machines to be deployed because we didn\u2019t want to outshoot our ability to produce machines. ","So we have an inventory of machines that we\u2019ve been working through, and so that puts us in a luxury of now managing our vending equipment to the needs of the business, as opposed to staying well out ahead of it, because we have a better idea of our pace. ","Robert McCarthy","Well, I\u2019ll see you in Indianapolis. ","Daniel Florness","Very good. Thank you.","Willard Oberton","Great, look forward to it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Merkel","Thanks, good morning everyone. We have covered a lot of ground here, but I just want to go back to the incremental margins just for a second. Just assuming next year, sales are up only 2, 3%, let\u2019s say, what would incremental margins look like, do you think, given that you\u2019re going to ramp some of the investment spend a bit more?","Daniel Florness","You know, incremental margins would probably move a lot closer to our operating profit. ","Ryan Merkel","Okay.","Daniel Florness","You know, we wouldn\u2019t be in the--I mean, let\u2019s face it, right now we\u2019re in kind of an unusual place of incremental margins being north of 35. In our history, you look at a lot of our--over the last decade, 25 to low 30s was a much normal range, and I think in an environment, if you\u2019re investing for the future, to hope for being on that upper end of the range probably isn\u2019t realistic and you move down closer to our operating margin. But the piece you have to keep in the back of your mind is we have a natural lift to our business profit as we add dollars to our individual stores, so if we\u2019re adding--in your example, Ryan, if we\u2019re adding 2 to 3% top line growth and we\u2019re opening 2 to 3% stores, we\u2019re kind of treading water there. But we don\u2019t have some of the mix issues going on that we\u2019ve had going on over the last few years if we\u2019re only doing two or three.","Willard Oberton","We\u2019re going to be very focused on beating that sales number.","Daniel Florness","Absolutely.","Willard Oberton","That\u2019s the way we win, and that\u2019s the way everyone dependent on us - our shareholders and our employees - win, and if the economy just stabilizes, our customer base stabilizes, we have a very good chance of making that happen, we believe.","Ryan Merkel","Absolutely fair. I hope it\u2019s better than 2, 3% too. I just wanted to sort of calibrate everybody on what the incremental margin would look like under that sort of more dire outlook. Then just lastly, Fastenal growing zero percent here in September and in a non-recessionary environment, it\u2019s pretty surprising, I think, for a lot of us. But if we just step back and we think about quantifying some of the headwinds, and I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth but it seems to me, oil and gas customers are probably down, what, 30% this year. It might be a 3% headwind to sales. And then what about exports? I\u2019ve got to think that\u2019s an even bigger impact, but you tell me - and we\u2019ve also got FX as a one-point headwind.","Daniel Florness","Yeah, a couple things. First off, the premise of the question, I would argue that anybody selling into the industrial market is not selling into a non-recessionary environment. We are--","Ryan Merkel","I agree. I agree with you there.","Daniel Florness","The industrial environment is in a recession - I don\u2019t care what anybody says, because nobody knows that market better than we do. You know, we touch 250,000 active customers a month.","Willard Oberton","CAT, Deere, Emerson, Terex - name the list, they\u2019re all down 8 to 10.","Ryan Merkel","Right.","Daniel Florness","If I look at our top--you know, last quarter I cited some stats of our top 25 customers. I\u2019ll take a broader brush and I\u2019ll look at our top 100. Right now in the third quarter, 44 of our top 100 customers are negative. We have not lost any business with that group. They are negative in their spend. In some cases, they are negative because their business is very negative and they are somewhat negative with us. In some case, their business is treading water and they decided to tighten their belt. I mean, look at our capex next year - there is going to be suppliers to our capital spend that will have a tighter year in 2016 than they have in 2015, because we\u2019re not automating two, three, four distribution centers in the next 12 months.","Of that 44 that were negative, 32 of them were negative more than 10%. Of that 44 that\u2019s negative, 17 of them were negative more than 25%. That\u2019s a sign of a recessionary environment, because despite all that, we continue to add customers at a faster pace than we\u2019ve done in recent years, which is about momentum into the future. We continue to grow our national account business, which is about momentum, but we have existing customers that are struggling through a pretty weak environment in their own business.","Ryan Merkel","Right. I mean, you read my research - you know I agree with you in the recession for the heavy manufacturing. I just meant the traditional GDP for the U.S. is negative two quarters in a row. Really, the focus of my question was if I think about the headwinds this year - you know, oil and gas 3%, exports maybe 4 to 5%, FX one point - you know, were those things to turn around, you could be back to a 10%-plus top line grower.","Daniel Florness","Yes.","Ryan Merkel","So I was just trying to quantify--","Willard Oberton","Even if they just level out.","Daniel Florness","Even if they just settled down.","Willard Oberton","Just leveled out.","Ryan Merkel","Right, okay. Well great, thanks.","Daniel Florness","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Sam Darkatsh ","Good morning, and again Dan, kudos on a very well deserved promotion. I want to make sure that\u2019s reiterated.","Daniel Florness","Thanks, Sam.","Sam Darkatsh","Two or three questions, just housekeeping of nature. First off, can you give us, Dan, what the machine equivalents were, the vending machine equivalents, both signed during the quarter as well as the install base?","Willard Oberton","I don\u2019t have that number, but I\u2019m going to throw out one stat that\u2019s impressive. The volume through the machine, sales dollars through the machine grew 16.6% in the quarter just in a very difficult environment. I think I said this to Ryan Merkel recently that that\u2019s about a $600 million business for us growing in high double digits, almost 17%, probably the fastest growing industrial business out there of that size. So we\u2019re doing--seeing very, very good growth, and that\u2019s the reason that as a team, we decided to double down on that growth.","Now I think Dan has his numbers here. He\u2019s paging through.","Daniel Florness","Yes, I have the number of units in service. I don\u2019t have a copy of the 10-Q in front of me. We\u2019ll be filing on that on Friday, and all the details are in there. But our equivalent number of units in service at the end of the quarter is 40,067, and the actual device count is 53,547.","Willard Oberton","And Sam, internally we are more focused on the growth through the machine than any other metric, because that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. That\u2019s what creates the commission and the profit.","Sam Darkatsh","Thank you for that, and a couple more quick questions, if I could. I think if I\u2019m understanding it, Dan, the store openings of 60 to 75 next year is a gross number. I\u2019m guessing you may still have some closings that are anticipated. Do you have a sense of what the net store count, the change in the net store count might be next year?","Daniel Florness","This is a little bit of a stab in the dark. I would suspect if we closed 20 stores, that wouldn\u2019t surprise me, and I don\u2019t have a firm number on that but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me. So a number--you know, a number I\u2019ve had in my head is we\u2019ll probably add 50 net next year.","Sam Darkatsh","And then the last question - you had a little bit--you repurchased, I believe, about 600,000 shares in the quarter, which was a little bit below the pace the first half of the year. Was that timing? Was there something strategic to that? What do you anticipate that the level or the pace of repos over the near to intermediate term?","Daniel Florness","Yes. You know, we hit it really hard in the second quarter, as we talked about on the July call. We pulled the pace back a little bit. Part of it, we\u2019re in discussions right now to up our line nominally to have dollars in place for that and some other pieces that are going on with our business in the next nine to 12 months. But we\u2019ll probably continue at that pace, maybe a little bit higher in the next few quarters. A lot of it is going to depend on where the market values the stock, too.","Sam Darkatsh","At the third quarter pace, you\u2019re referring to?","Daniel Florness","Yes.","Sam Darkatsh","Okay. Thank you gentlemen. I appreciate it. Much obliged.","Daniel Florness","Thanks Sam.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Daniel Florness","This is Dan speaking. Again, we reiterate - thank you for participating on our call today. Thank you for your continued support of Fastenal. Our investor day in early November, in addition to hosting an investor day, we will be broadcasting that on the web for people to listen to remotely. Thank you and have a good day.","Willard Oberton","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program.

I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ellen Trester of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellen Trester","Welcome to the Fastenal Company 2014 annual and fourth quarter earnings conference call. This call will be hosted by Lee Hein, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Florness, our Chief Financial Officer. Also present for today\u2019s call is Will Oberton, our Chairman.","The call will last for up to 45 minutes.

Good morning. Before I start, I\u2019d like to just say thank you to the Fastenal members on the call, I know there is a lot of you that tuned into this and we are so appreciative of the work that you did in the fourth quarter.","So just a great job and I\u2019d like to report that it was a good quarter for our company, 13.8% sales growth, that\u2019s 15% or 15.7% on the daily average and there will be some questions I am sure on Christmas and December was in line with the rest of the quarter. We just thought it was a right thing to do to take the 26%.","20.1% on earnings growth and that equated to 28% incremental margin growth, which again these are strong numbers for our company. And how we got, there really was we continue to work hard on our gross margin, but in this quarter we really focused our attention on our expenses and the Fastenal Company and their members, I\u2019ve got to tell you really did a nice job looking at all different types of expenses and we really clamped down and one thing that really came out is our ability to manage our labor.","Historically, our daily average is going to decline somewhere around 10% from the end of October to the end of the year, we know that. And what we simply did is we turn down the hours or pullback the hours and we look at the timing of Thanksgiving, Christmas, et cetera, and just with the natural decline in our daily average.","But we continue to add people at the company and especially in the part-time ranks and I would say in 2015 with the good economy we are committed to putting selling energy into our stores and I just again when we talk internally we are committed to a store-based model, we are committed to the fact that we really believe being close to our customers offering a high level of service is really the best -- is best way to really approach the industrial market.","The other question we get is, if you are going to add 10% to 15% more hours in the store can you afford it? That really equates to about a 7% net effect on the labor dollar impact and so it's a good model for us, it really bodes well for our stores and for most importantly our customer.","So strong quarter, we continue to stay disciplined in -- on the gross margin and there is pressure there, but we really like the momentum in the direction we are moving.","With that, I will turn it over to Dan.","Dan Florness","Thank you, Lee, and good morning, everybody, and thanks again for participating in our call today. I think our press release is certainly self-explanatory on the quarter. We published monthly numbers, so I think, as we touch on, our sales trends remained strong throughout the quarter, we think that bodes well as we go into 2015.","I\u2019d tried to highlight on the bottom page one, top of page two, the handful of bullets of things that I think were important to the business. One of them I wanted to and some of this commentary is based on questions that I might get and so did want to touch on. The headcount patterns as we\u2019ve been going through the fourth quarter especially at the store level as we have talked in the past about the investment and selling energy and adding hours.","The one position we were in this year, yeah, we really weren\u2019t in last year is we are in a position to much more acutely manage the expense because we weren\u2019t in a ramp up mode, we were in a manage the business mode and so we did a much better job of managing our expenses.","We went through the fourth quarter. We were able to dial up and down the variable components of our expense, a big piece of that being the store-based labor to really match the needs of the business and really the needs of the customer to serve the customer.","One item that I typically touch on or get questions on is the table we have on Pathway to Profit. I think it\u2019s a good way to assess some of the underlying things going on in our business. And one of thing is always helpful I think is depreciate how we look at our business.","And one thing that we do is we\u2019re an organization that rewards our personnel internally whether that be people at the store, at the district level and at distribution center or some other support roles.","We reward folks based on our ability to grow the business. We will reward more for growth sales than we do for maintenance sales as an example. We reward for managing containing the cost of our business and growing the profits of the business. So those are three things that are really critical when we look at how we compensate.","And so one thing to keep in mind when we look at that pathway to profitable, over the three years -- because I always look at different buckets. And my poster child is always looking at 150,000 plus store where I look at the last two groups combined. Because it helps me understand what's really going on in the business. And I'm pleased to say when I look at 2014. I look at that group. The number of the level of profitability, the components of the profitability make a lot of sense to me and position us well to go forward.","One thing you'll notice is the profit in that group slipped slightly from a year ago. Now we\u2019re largely beyond the noise we've had in the past month. So what\u2019s going on in gross margin year-over-year. So it\u2019s really about how are we managing the expenses of the business and invest in to grow the business.","When I look at that, slight leakage, what really drove it is a decision we made a year ago to dramatically expand our district and regional leadership. We went from roughly 230 district managers to shy at 300. We expanded the key accounts teams. We expanded our ability to manage the business and grow the business.","The other thing that happened is if you look at the business this year, Lee just mentioned, we grew at 20.1%, our top line 15.7 on daily but 14% on absolute basis. A year ago those numbers were 9% pretax growth and about 7.5% sales growth. So what the other component of our P&L that changed dramatically is folks at the district level, folks at the region level, our teams throughout the organization were paid a premium to grow our earnings.","Bonuses and store compensation were up meaningfully from a year ago. And so when I look at that, we picked up about 70 basis points of expense because of the fact we\u2019re not growing earnings at 20% versus 9%. And I don't want to get too deep into the weeds here. But that\u2019s -- but despite that 70 basis points, our profitability in that group only went down 20, the other 50 is pathway to profit leverage, which not only did we improve the profitability of the organization because the mix change but the underlying help of the business improved. And where we did get deterioration, it\u2019s because of the investments we made, a, and the way our incentive compensation works, b. And I think that\u2019s a winning combination.","With that, again I think our press release probably gives most people more details than they want to know about the world within Fastenal. With that, I\u2019ll stop and Will, if you\u2019ve anything you want to add, otherwise I\u2019ll turn it over to Q&A.","Will Oberton","No, I\u2019ll wait for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Sam Darkatsh","Good morning, Lee, Dan, Will. How are you? Very nice quarter with respect to expense control. First question, the spread between vending customers and non-vending customers in terms of the growth rates is -- continues to moderate. How should we look at that? And the concern obviously would be it\u2019s a reflection of the maturation of the initiative but there is got to be some other factors or components driving the contraction of the spread?","Lee Hein","Well, I think it's really a function. If you look at the growth of the customers with vending. They\u2019ve been in a neighborhood of representing about 40% of our sales. So that group of customers. It inches up a little bit every quarter but it\u2019s been in the upper 30s. Now, it\u2019s approaching 40. The growth has been basically at 20% all year.","I would say that the moderation of spread is really about the fact that the other 60% of our business, the investments we made in people at the store and at the district level. The rest of the business has lifted itself up. It isn\u2019t so much that the gap has narrowed. It\u2019s the performance of the other 60 has improved and it\u2019s raised our company number. As we\u2019ve been basically at 20% growth in that group for the entire year.","Will Oberton","And part of that is, Lee, a little bit resurgence in the fastener business. If you look at year ago, the fastener business was seeing almost no growth at all, bringing that growth back basically does not come through vending. It\u2019s non-vending business. It changes the mix a little bit about where our business is.","Lee Hein","And that business is about half of the 60 that isn\u2019t vending.","Will Oberton","Yeah. So that really influences the gap.","Sam Darkatsh","Helpful. And my follow-up question, how do you look and it\u2019s here in 2015, both early on and for the year, I know you voiced 51% expectation. What are your thoughts around pricing in fasteners and non-fasteners and how realistic the 51 expectation should be for the year and for near term?","Lee Hein","On 51, I frankly don\u2019t know. What I can tell you is -- I think what we demonstrated this quarter is we can invest heavily in the business. We can manage the expenses. We can let the pathway to profit mechanics shine through in our profit growth. We can do that without expansion of gross margin.","And to me, that\u2019s the most critical. It\u2019s a competitive market out there right now. Our mix as we\u2019ve talked on prior calls is not -- isn't inherent to raising margin. If you talk about the growth drivers of our business but the profitability on those growth drivers is great when it comes to the pretax line.","Will Oberton","We get couple other positives on the margin. We do have a couple tailwinds. One is we still have a tremendous opportunity on upside for our exclusive brands, our private brands. And other is our transportation costs with fuel where it is or oil situation is going to drop. And as you saw in the fourth -- or as you see in the fourth quarter and other quarters or late quarters, the flexibility of our fuel and the costs going up in our fuel and utilization. Our utilization will be high in the first quarter of our transportation. And as it looks like right now, fuel costs will be down.","So however we get to gross margins, it\u2019s great. So exclusive brands, tailwind there on the fuel. And also our fastener business is doing a little bit better. So there are gives and takes all over the place in margin and it\u2019s always going to be a fight. But I tell you what the team has done a great job of managing our margin through changing business environment.","Sam Darkatsh","So no reason to think why the 28% to 33% incremental margins should not hold true in '15?","Dan Florness","We feel very good about our ability to get strong incremental margins we had in July. In April, we talked about getting the 20% in the third quarter -- or excuse me in the third quarter -- on the third quarter call, we talked about this quarter really being in the upper 20s and we feel very good about where we\u2019re are positioned going into 2015.","Lee Hein","I think one of the other reasons I feel good about that is we made very heavy investments at the end of '13 in our district managers, a lot of outside -- sales people outside of the stores and so we\u2019re in a heavy investment mode. We can -- we don\u2019t have to do much of that this year. In fact, in the leadership roles, district, regional, outside sales people were very set for at least the first six months of the year. And so we\u2019ll able to -- that will come through in the P&L and incremental gross margins or incremental margins.","Sam Darkatsh","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you all.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baliotti with Janney Capital Markets. Your line is open.","John Baliotti","Good morning. Thanks for taking question. Dan, as part of the assumption for '15, I know it\u2019s early in the year, but with respect to gross margins, the fact that you pointed out the mix of business being larger customers, is it -- are you for the time being expecting that the mix to kind of stay where it is?","Dan Florness","Well, the mix has been changing over many years that our large account business -- you see when you look at our vending numbers, because a good chunk of that is large account business, our large account business. And you see that the rest of the group like we talked on that first question, the rest of the group has stepped up and gotten closer to it.","So we actually have a little bit more balanced growth in, in fact on gross margin in the next 12 months and we probably did in the last 24, because by adding -- selling energy in the store, the local business is stepping up to the play a little more. So when it\u2019s not being pulled by the vending, the large account business, but there is still little bit of mix right there, but we will touch on both the fuel and our private brands is really powerful.","John Baliotti","Yeah, I mean, the mix is not, I mean other distributors said the same thing, it\u2019s not unusual as an industry now that the larger customers are contributing more. But to the point earlier, I think Lee brought this up, in terms of adding heads and you put it in your release, adding more in '15. As you said, you did a nice job of controlling your SG&A cost. Do you see that as a percent of sales more level with '14 this year, given that you are going to add more heads, but maybe offset with some further focus on cost or how do you see that shaping up?","Dan Florness","I am not sure if I clearly follow your question.","John Baliotti","SG&A as a percent of sales was down about 54 basis points this year or just under 30%. And you pointed out that you had pretty tight controls on expenses, especially in the fourth quarter. You also said that you are going to add some more heads in '15 to kind of resume what you were doing in '14. I was just curious how do you see those two in aggregate focus on cost control, but also adding heads? How do you see that aggregating into your SG&A as a percent of sales?","Dan Florness","If you think about the pathway to profit, everything about that, including adding heads is about leveraging your SG&A. And so that in order to get the 28 to 30, low 30s incremental margin talked about, from our perspective that\u2019s all coming from SG&A. The position we are in is that when you look at the labor growth for next year, the SG&A growth for next year a lot of the incentive pieces like I talked -- touched on what we gave up in the fourth quarter year-over-year because there is actually bonuses paid out again. That\u2019s in our numbers now.","That\u2019s been growing into our numbers as we\u2019ve gone through the year and stepping up a little bit every quarter. And so, it really puts us in a position to make investments, but the rest of the expense pool really isn\u2019t growing that fast. And so we think we are in a great position to manage the SG&A going in 2015.","John Baliotti","Great. Okay, thanks. And Lee, congratulations on your new position.","Lee Hein","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Winnie Clark with UBS. Your line is open.","Winnie Clark","Good morning.","Lee Hein","Good morning, Winnie.","Winnie Clark","So in terms of the store count, you closed 52 stores in the second half ahead of that initial 45 target, are closings largely competitive at this point and how should we think about net store count additions in 2015?","Lee Hein","Net store count additions, I would expect to be positive in \u201915, marginally positive. We are always looking at our business. And even before we announced the 45 in the second quarter, I think we closed around 20 stores in first half of the year. And we think that\u2019s a healthy thing because in our business, our locations are about -- in my mind and Lee, if you can chime in if you disagree with my approach on this. But my thought about our locations, it\u2019s a base for our sales people that stocks inventory and customers have the ability to stop in.","So we can do a great same-day service and a high-level to service for our customers. But if we come, if one of our district or regional leaders looks at our market and says, I think this market is better served, having us operate out of 4 points than 5 or 3 points than 4, when we know we are going to retain an incredibly high percentage of that business. We\u2019ve got to look at and say what\u2019s the smartest way to grow, but to answer your question I would expect it to be nominally positive in 2015.","Winnie Clark","Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just finally, I was hoping you could give us a sense about your exposure to oil and gas region is and how sales growth has been trending in those areas relative to the company average? And then maybe just how you think about the various puts and takes for your business of lower oil prices?","Lee Hein","Sure. Will, I will take that. When you look at our sales about 12% to 13% of our sales, I would say are effected in some way shape or form from oil dropping, especially under 50 bucks barrel. And when you look at that but there is a percentage. And I\u2019m kind of framing up from Pennsylvania to Texas to North Dakota, Tulsa, Western Canada, Alaska, we\u2019ve really looked at that and that\u2019s about 10% to 12%. We are going to fill it. Now what happens is I think, when you look back in time when oil drop, by the time it drops to the net effect where it hits us, it could be six months out there or something. There is that lag. So we are keeping an eye on it and we are definitely going to fill it in those regions. The flipside is we don't quite understand what it\u2019s going to do to our other customers because it actually puts a little wind in their sales so to speak from a bottom line. So that's kind of how we look at it and how it affects company today.","Winnie Clark","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Lee Hein","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","David Manthey","Hi guys. Good morning. First off, back on the contribution margin side, just given the level of profitability and the earnings growth that you are seeing right now. I know on the upside and the downside, we\u2019ve had these stabilizers or shock absorbers through bonuses and profit-sharing and things. And I'm just -- I just want to press a little bit more on that contribution margin side. It sounds like you took a little bit of that in the fourth quarter here but as we look to next year, is there a possibility that those things kick in and even at a flat gross margin, it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to get to that 30% level, Dan?","Dan Florness","Well, with growth where we\u2019ve talked about it in that mid-teens neighborhood, we are in a position to invest in energy at our stores and really get in the neighborhood of those operating margin, I mean, incremental margins, Dave, because when I look at our bonus pools, our incentive comp, it really stepped up when I look at it in the four quarters of this year. It really stepped up when we got into the second quarter and in the first quarter it was pretty really number too. But it really stepped up and so, I think that layer of added expense is really in our numbers when I look at the tails of the \u2018015. And I think it positions us well. And the offset of that, some of the pieces you normally don\u2019t count on and Lee just touched on it and Will touch on it earlier is you have some SG&A that\u2019s going the other way in the short-term.","I mean, we have some nice benefit coming into the first quarter as it relates to energy. I know you are down in Florida, as you don\u2019t always appreciate this anymore now that you are no longer from the Midwest but it is cold up here. And energy prices for heating a lot of our locations in the northern half of the country and throughout Canada is a meaningful piece to us. So it gives us some tailwind coming into the first part of the year.","Will Oberton","Hey, Dave. I'll jump in here. This is Will. But if you -- the biggest component by far of our SG&A, as you know is our labor and with the plan that Lee and his team have laid out for adding the vast majority of our new selling energy. They are not selling energy but storing energies so our sales people can get out by hiring college students. We can add 15. I\u2019m not saying we are going to add 15%, but the math says we can add 15% more hours in our stores and that would translate into just under 7% labor, not including bonuses. So the base labor to fuel that were to support that 15% more hours and those are the scenarios we are looking at. So that gives us a tremendous amount of leverage when you look at the labor is by far our biggest expense where we can add the hours with only about just under half of the expense as a percentage. That\u2019s where a lot of it comes from. And it allows us to be very bullish out there with our customers and serve our customers at a very high level.","David Manthey","Okay. All right. Thanks Will. And then on the gross margin, I know this gets far too much attention here lately. But the 51%, I\u2019m just -- as I look historically at the company has maintained that level of gross profit profitability. And I know that historically there has been offsets, whether that was direct sourcing of Fastenal or ramp up the exclusive brands or changes to the logistics network, et cetera? So I know that historically even no national accounts have moved up in the mix and non-Fastenal as the percentage of the mix, you been able to maintain that level? What I\u2019m wondering about is as those secular changes continue as they have for the past several decades, are there offsets that will allow you to remain in that range or is it just we reached a point where gross margins could potentially just be lower and we have to rely on better cost leverage?","Dan Florness","Well, if you recall on the last call, Dave, we -- I probably not so artfully, but I tried to walk through what happens on the Pathway to Profit as our average store size gets bigger. I think that's really the underlying cause of a lot of what we are telling about.","Our average store size gets bigger because we\u2019re more and more successful with our larger customers and we drive some key counts in those individual stores and that\u2019s what pushes our store from 80 to 100 or from 100 to 150 or 150 to 200.","Overtime we have some $40,000 and $50,000 month customers and\/or maybe an $80,000 month customer. But you have some big business that\u2019s coming into those stores and like I talked about on the last call, if I look at our stores that are -- that do more than a $100,000 a month in sales, so -- at the time goes about just over 1,000 of our 2,700 stores, that group operates at a lower gross margin and goes up to\u2026","Will Oberton","70.","Dan Florness","\u2026 70 basis points lower than the company does. And so as we move from 100,000 to 110,000 to 130,000 to 160,000 average store over the next few years, because only nominally adding units, so that means our average store size going to grow.","I would expect our gross margin to compress and right now I would expect it would be closer to 50 than that say, 51 or 50.5 that we just reported, because of the impact of that. But as I also talked about given up that 70 basis points, you give up -- you pick up both 450 basis points in operating leverage and that\u2019s the secret.","Will Oberton","And that\u2019s going out over one, two, three years.","Dan Florness","Oh! Absolutely. I mean\u2026","Will Oberton","Just want to make sure.","Dan Florness","\u2026 lets look at out into the future because that group of stores averages a little over $160,000 a month.","Will Oberton","And in this quarter that group of stores is a 24.5% pretax and that\u2019s the fourth quarter. So that gives you an idea of the potential of the profitability of the organization.","David Manthey","All right. Yeah. Got it. Okay. Guys, thanks a lot. Stay warm.","Lee Hein","Thanks, Dave.","Dan Florness","Thanks, Dave.","Will Oberton","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Your line is open.","Eli Lustgarten","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Lee Hein","Good morning.","Eli Lustgarten","I\u2019m glad to at least listen at the overemphasis of gross margin is strongly been recognized. I have two questions. One, we talk about sort of current business conditions as we look out the \u201915. Typically, first quarter has a very easy comp within December from the weather impact a year ago so it doesn\u2019t repeat? Last year if you know, nobody love -- if you look to which you not going to forget January and February so quickly? Can you give us some idea some benefits in there?","And then second part of that thing, can you talk about the heavy manufacturing impact you told 20% of your business. Can you talk about the impact of ag and the Canadian economy, which is now starting to show signs of stress on Fastenal, particularly the ag market is one that we know was crashing at the moment and whether Canada is becoming a bit of a problem or not?","Dan Florness","No. But quite a few items there. I\u2019ll try to bounce through a few and Lee or Will, if you want to chime in, feel free. First off, on the end market piece, the manufacturing, that business really improve for us. And I think that\u2019s really shines through in the fact that we exit the year with our fastener business growing double-digit. We started the year with our fastener business growing low singles, 1.5% first quarter, 1.9% fourth quarter of last year. That\u2019s says a lot to the health of our OEM manufacturing customer out there.","So I think that has very good trends going into the New Year. When I think of our Canadian business and I know enough -- some about a lot of details, sometimes get myself in trouble in the conversation. To me, the biggest issue we have with our Canadian business right now isn\u2019t how well it's growing. It\u2019s the value of the currency. That business grew for us in the mid single -- in the mid-double digit, excuse me, here when I\u2019m looking at the last few months.","But what shines through on our company level, when you look at it in USD, it cuts that down by almost two-thirds because of deflation in the currency. But the underlying business up there for us is healthy. Now one thing you have to keep in mind when you look at our business in Canada, it is weighted towards the eastern part of the country. We went into Ontario first and because we were expanding from the basically the Great Lake states in the U.S., when we first entered Canada been 90s.","So we have a big chunk of business sets in the Ontario province and then out towards the Maritimes. It was later that we more expanded into Western Canada from the standpoint of where our dollars are. And that business, the eastern part of the country is stronger than the western part. Obviously, the western part is much more link to extractive industries.","Eli Lustgarten","Can you talk about the weather impact in the ags and the firms out there?","Lee Hein","Well, the weather coming into last year -- we had a tough start to the year. Weather really beat us up and -- weather while it\u2019s been cold in the upper Midwest, it hasn\u2019t been pounded by the weather you saw. And time will tell how that plays out in rest of January and into February. But I don\u2019t see weather as a threat right now.","Will Oberton","But we did have a good March last year. So that balances it out too weather wise. We came back very strong. So it wasn\u2019t the entire quarter that was affected. It was mainly January.","Lee Hein","Yes.","Eli Lustgarten","Again, one other question. You had an initiative in metal working that was started several years ago, which really hasn\u2019t done very much. I mean the relationship with Kennametal really just seems to be plotting along. Is that still a focus of the company or future growth lever or is that sort of just been put on the back burner?","Will Oberton","I\u2019ll jump in on that. Metal working continues to do well. Our relationship with Kennametal is good. People, I think, had too high of an expectation going in thinking we are going to be as big as MSC in overnight and that doesn\u2019t happen. Our metal working business has grown not double digit, but almost double digit above the Fastenal growth over the last -- over 2014. We even did better than 2013. And we\u2019ve grown a very nice size of business. We are doing well with it. We think the upside is great.","It\u2019s just hard to grow a business that right now represents about 10% -- just under 10% of our total revenue. So it\u2019s a meaningful size business. And it\u2019s hard to grow it more than 20 plus percent year-over-year with the business that big. So we are very committed. And we think we are going to continue to do well in it for a long time. And part of it is what we learned is that although Kennametal is a very good supplier, they don\u2019t have full spectrum of what the customers need and neither does any of the other suppliers.","So we\u2019ve developed relationships with the wide range of suppliers and most of them are enjoying very good growth through Fastenal. So we are still very committed to and believe it\u2019s a great opportunity for the future of Fastenal. The main thing that makes sense is our Fastenal and MRO customers. Most of those are using metal working products. We already have developed relationships. Now we have to develop a product relationship in this specific area.","Eli Lustgarten","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Merkel","Thanks. Just want to clarify the 10% to 12% you said was tied to oil and gas. Is that direct to energy customers or were you saying that 10% to 12% of our stores are in energy levered states?","Lee Hein","10% to 12% of our sales are in those geographic areas and shooting from the hip, I would say probably half of that would be closer to the energy piece. But that\u2019s somewhat anecdotal talking to our regional leaders in those geographic areas. But it\u2019s really looking at the Gulf Coast, the Texas market, Western Pennsylvania, Western North Dakota up into Oklahoma and Western Canada, kind of looking at those and engaging it.","Dan Florness","And it\u2019s pretty close to 12%. And more information, that grew in the third quarter. It grew at about 24% versus the company now. We have enjoyed very nice growth. So that\u2019s the -- so we have that 12% of our business. It will probably slow down.","Ryan Merkel","Yes.","Dan Florness","I mean, probably will look good. But the other part of our business at 90% or 88% remaining, we are hoping we get a little tailwind through lower energy cost and maybe it balances. If it doesn\u2019t balance, we also have about a $12 million of quarter energy and have $10 million energy, Will.","Will Oberton","Yes.","Dan Florness","That we think is going to go down by $3 million or $4 million. So we could give up a little revenue and balance it with the expense. We are hoping we don\u2019t give up any revenue and we get to capitalize on the expense. So we\u2019ve looked at it hard, Ryan and we are trying to figure out. But there\u2019s no crystal ball for this right now. It\u2019s all about how the rest of the economy is affected because of lower fuel prices.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. So you are kind of saying that 10% to 12% is direct and indirect and direct would be more like 5.","Dan Florness","It\u2019s always the geographies.","Ryan Merkel","Yeah. Okay. I just want to be clear. That would have been a little bigger than I would have thought but 5% makes sense, which would be direct. Okay. Second question, given the decline in steel prices, should we be worried about deflation in fasteners and can you just remind us how your fastener contracts work with regard to price?","Will Oberton","The large contracts which probably make up 20% to 25% of our fastener business are tied to a CRU index which is a steel index. And when -- the triggers on that are typically, they are not all the same, but majority of them have a 5% trigger. So as steel goes down more than 5% or up more than 5% over a six month period, it\u2019s always on the calendar and January and July are the trigger points, that we will either raise our prices or lower our prices accordingly and then based on that, we are figuring out what percent. So Steel goes up 5% or down, it doesn\u2019t mean we lower our price because we factor in the labor, so there is a formula there. So the other 75% of our business is not on these contracts when steel goes down, we have some upside from margin if we can hold on to that pricing. And that\u2019s really where we think the balance is.","There is always margin pressure exposure if there is lot of deflation in the business. So far, we\u2019ve not seen a lot but that time will tell. We\u2019ve been very close with our guys in Asia that run our business for us over there, our trading business. And trying to understand what the manufacturing are saying and seeing.","Ryan Merkel","I mean, what would the lag be?","Dan Florness","Pardon.","Ryan Merkel","What would the lag be? So steel prices go up or down 5%, you have to change your pricing. Is it a quarter lag or is it right away?","Dan Florness","It\u2019s usually six months.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. Great. And then probably just one more and kind of a big picture question. There is a view by some that the MRO industry is more competitive, more consolidated today and therefore the growth going forward would be slower, potentially less profitable. So what is your view and has anything changed in your view over the past 10 years?","Will Oberton","Well, things have changed. But if you look at the big players and whoever you throw into that group, we\u2019ve all grown nicely, but so maybe we\u2019ve gone from 25% market share to 28% or 30%. So it has consolidated at pretty slow rate when you look at the -- combined if you look at us, MSC and Grainger combined and there is others I know, but our growth is probably 10% if you add us all up.","Takes a long time to consolidate the industry. It\u2019s always been competitive and I think it will remain competitive, but there is a tremendous amount of opportunity out there. We think the opportunity is as good as it\u2019s ever been. And that's why we\u2019re so focused as Lee talked earlier about staying close to our customers, using our same-day store model to grow our business and take market share.","Ryan Merkel","Very good. Thank you.","Dan Florness","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Adam Uhlman","Hi, guys. Good morning. Congrats.","Lee Hein","Hey, Adam.","Adam Uhlman","Can we go through the cash flow outlook for next year? Pretty good job this year and getting cash conversion, I guess. How should we think about the CapEx? What are you thinking from an inventory side that would be helpful?","Dan Florness","Our CapEx will drop, as we go into the New Year. The number I would expect us to be citing in our annual report will be number of around 150 plus or minus 5 million. And I think we\u2019re positioned -- I think were positioned well. I think we\u2019re in a good position to manage the working capital needs.","The biggest component of need there will be more on the AR side than the inventory because I expect our business to keep growing nicely. And I think it puts us in a great position to generate very, very strong cash flow. And our operating cash flow this year was even high by our norm, because we basically had operating cash of essentially in line with earnings.","Part of that was the fact that, our friends in Washington D.C. saw fit to continue the bonus depreciation and the few other things there. So we didn't get that tax bill coming and that defers that off, but it\u2019s really a strong operating cash flow year. I think we have a great position for next year, because a lot of those investments in distribution are in the rearview mirror rather than in the windshield.","Adam Uhlman","Okay. Got you. Thanks. And then clarification on the headcount it\u2019s been asked several times. It\u2019s still not clear to me. We had 2% year-over-year growth in December on FTEs. And I'm just wondering, how you think about that? For the first half of this next year, are we going to bounce back the 10% to 15% that was mentioned earlier? Or are we going to remain in the single digits and then ramp back up?","Lee Hein","Are you talking about at the store level?","Adam Uhlman","The total headcount growth on FTE basis, year-over-year in December we stay there some time.","Lee Hein","You really have to discount a lot of what the year-over-year numbers are in November and December. Because in November and December a year ago, as I touched on earlier, we are in the massive ramp-up stage and we kept the hours just dialed up because we wanted to get our sales people out of the store selling.","And this year as we manage through it, we were able to dial down the part-time hours in November and in December. And that\u2019s really what -- that drives the FTE and one of the reason I put that bullet in on one page was really to talk about, hey, on the headline it looks like we dropped our numbers at the store.","Our FTE did go down, so we dialed down the hours, but we actually added people. And so coming in to January and February that will dial back up because we have the need.","Dan Florness","When we looked it at trying to normalize it taking out to people going home for the holidays and all that, we are in the high-single digits. I think we have 8% to 9% more selling energy, if everybody was at work all week long. And that\u2019s a little lower than what we wanted, but it\u2019s in the neighborhood. Does that make sense Adam?","Adam Uhlman","Yes. And so that we kind of get back to that normalized 8% to 9% and then maybe grow from there as you have need.","Lee Hein","We want to push it up from there, yes.","Adam Uhlman","Okay. Thank you.","Lee Hein","Thanks.","Lee Hein","I see we are at 9:45. Again, I want to thank everybody for joining on the call this morning. And well good luck.","Dan Florness","I\u2019ll be here.","Lee Hein","Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a good day."],"9532":["Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) Q4 2011 Earnings Call January 18, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Ellen Trester - ","Daniel L.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ellen Trester, with Investor Relations.","Ellen Trester","Welcome to the Fastenal Company 2011 Annual and Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call will be hosted by Will Oberton, our Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Florness, our Chief Financial Officer.","The call will last for up to 45 minutes.

Go ahead, Mr. Oberton.","Willard D. Oberton","Thank you, Ellen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're proud to announce another good quarter. In fact, it's our seventh quarter in a row where we've had EPS growth north of 30%. We're very proud of that. It's also our second year in a row that we've had EPS growth north of 30%. So we're feeling good about the accomplishments that the team has done, and I want to thank all the Fastenal people for a hard -- a job well done.","For the quarter, our sales -- we had a very good quarter for sales, coming in about the same as third quarter. And I guess the way I would describe our sales over the last 6 quarters is very consistent. If you look at it, we've been in that 20% to 22% range almost every month for the past 18 months. So they've done a nice job with just growing it consistently over a long period of time.","December, a little bit of color on December. December was actually, in my view, a better month than we reported, at just over 21%, because we had a very strong first 3 weeks and then we slowed down for the holidays. And my own personal opinion is, every year, it seems like holidays become longer or businesses take more time off if you look at the Fourth of July and different holidays. It's probably just a cultural thing. But it's very hard to read looking at the month, but the positive is we came into the month strong and had a great 3 weeks, which led us to still having a good month even with a disappointing finish.","On the margin side, we did take a dip in the margin. As you see, reporting 51.2%, still within our range of 51% to 53%. I guess, and I'd look at the numbers closely to -- things just didn't line up for us. There was some seasonal things, there -- a little bit of pressure from mix, but overall it was a disappointing quarter on margin, but we're still very comfortable with our range and believe that some of it will snap back in the first quarter. But Dan will also give more color on the pieces of where our margin deteriorated some.","Earnings standpoint. I really feel comfortable with what we did there, nice earnings growth, and I'm very proud of the fact that we reported pretax of 20.2%. That's the first time in our history that we've ever had pretax above 20% in the fourth quarter, so that was a good achievement. For the year, our pretax came in at 20.8%, the first time that we've been over 20% in actually more than 15 years. We were there in 1995. So another good accomplishment, I think, and it just shows that the power of our 'pathway to profit' is working and we're still able to get the good growth. So we're very happy with that.","From an expense standpoint, it's kind of a tale of 2 -- or there's 2 stories here. On the non-payroll expenses, which make up about 1\/3 of our SG&A, we did a great job. Those expenses grew, for the quarter, in the low to mid-single digits, and for the year, very similar numbers. The payroll on the other hand grew faster. For the quarter, our payroll grew 16%. For the year, it grew just under 21%. I believe it was 20.9%, which was a little higher than we had expected. So we do have some work to do on payroll. On a positive note there, because of the -- what is normally cutter sales in the first quarter, we can work that through very quickly and feel that we're going to see leverage in 2012. But we talked to all our people about it, we understand where it's going. And some of it is make-up from the slowdown or lower bonuses in 2010, but some of it is we just have to pay a little closer attention. And the way we do it here is we tell you what we think, where we have to work on, and we're comfortable that we can correct that situation very quickly.","Vending. Vending was a little slower than we had expected. But we actually -- vending was very similar to what I've described December. We had 2 good months, October and November, and then December kind of fell on its face with vending. And did not surprise us because it's very hard to get people to make decisions and sign contracts at the end of the year and around the holidays. So we're not at all discouraged by it. We knew it would be a tough quarter with December in there.","But from an overall standpoint, with industrial vending, the concept and the long-term opportunities continue to look better every day. And as we study the results, we look at all the things that are going on, the opportunities that are out there, we are more excited about what it could do for Fastenal over the next several years than we've ever been. ","Structurally, we are very well positioned with our store network, with our distribution and with our large workforce in the field out in these small communities. We're very, very well positioned to service this business and should work well for us.","And the thing I'd like to say when I talk to people who don't really understand the concept and they're trying to understand what we're doing, very -- there's a note on my desk, a little -- it's like a fortune cookie sign, it's been on my computer for about 10 or 15 years. And what it says is, \"The best way to sell is make it convenient to buy.\" And I always remind myself of that and that's really the essence of vending. Vending is a more convenient way for our customers to buy product from Fastenal. And if we can make things more convenient and more efficient, we believe we will sell more product and it will give us long-term growth opportunities, and that's why we're so heavily invested in this project and we're so bullish on it whenever we talk to the investment community, the customer community, the supplier community and any other community that's willing to listen to us about this prospect. So very, very positive on vending and believe that -- have a long run there.","So overall, I believe Fastenal had a very good year. We had a very good -- excuse me, we had a very good quarter and we had a very good year. And we believe, with the strength we saw in the fourth quarter in our sales, we're well positioned to launch the business into 2012 and hopefully maintain our string of north of 30% EPS growth in quarters to come.","With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan will give you some more color and then we'll open it up for questions. Thank you.","Daniel L. Florness","Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for participating on our call today. Before I start, I'm going to touch on one housekeeping note, and that is related to a change we plan to do next quarters -- for our first quarter release, so that would be our release scheduled in April. ","What we have done over the last, gosh -- most of our public life is that before market opens, at 7:00 in the morning Central Time approximately, we publish -- we publicly release our earnings for the previous quarter. And one thing I've learned over time is that you always keep your ears open for suggested improvements or changes that you could make that maybe improve the process. Something we're going to try in April, and in our scheduled conference call is for Thursday, April 19, I believe I wrote that date down correctly, and -- or April 12, excuse me.","But instead of releasing at 7:00 in the morning, before market opens, we're going to release the evening before. Typically, the way our process works currently is that we will queue up all of our documents for release somewhere between 7 and 8 p.m. in the evening and schedule them to come out the following morning. We're going to queue them up between 7 and 8 as we've done in the past, go through our normal process, but make them immediately available. We believe that will help inform the marketplace, the analyst community and the marketplace in general on our quarter; and will add to the quality of this earnings call, potentially some of the questions; and also help with the dissemination of information. So that will be a change. We'll try it next quarter. We'll do it for this year, and we'll see how it goes and continue to try to improve the process of communicating with The Street.","I will echo some comments that Will made and delve a little deeper on a couple of them. This morning at 7:00, I had my typical call with our Regional Vice President. It's basically -- it's our group of leaders, our regional CEOs if you will, that manage our business and are a large part of the success behind our business. And some of the messages I've shared with them, first and foremost, was nice quarter, nice year. And we did a really nice job in a lot of fronts and like always, we identified the things that we did well, we identified the things that we can improve on, and we'll work on those as we move into 2012.","As Will mentioned, and I would echo the comment, continue to be impressed by our top line performance. As all of you know, over the last several years, especially in the bottom of the 2009 dip, tried to do a lot of things to try to look at our seasonal trend patterns, to try to really understand and communicate what our business normally does, and we used that '98 to 2003 as a benchmark for that.","If you look at the chart we published in our press release and in our quarterly documents, you can see that we have soundly been at or above that trend line now for both 2010 and 2011. So it's not about the recovery or easy comps or hard comps or all that kind of stuff you can talk about. It's really what happened from June to July, July to August, August to September. Are we building the fundamentals of our business every day to launch us into the next year? And that's the secret of Fastenal's top line growth for the last 40 years, is we build a little bit more everyday and we step higher. ","And when I look at that, we continue to handily outperform those numbers, which makes me feel very good as we go on into 2012. And as you see in the ISM numbers, they continue to support what we're doing, and we feel very good going into the new year. ","On the expense side, Will touched on both the labor and the nonlabor side. I'll add a few more tidbits to the nonlabor side. If I look at 2009, 2010 and 2011, our total operating expenses have gone from 35.6% of sales in 2009, granted that was a high number because of the recession, to 32.8% in 2010 and 31.1% in 2011. So we dropped 450 basis points in 2009. Probably the more meaningful comparison is we dropped 170 from 2010, 2011, because 2010 was a good number.","If I look at that, we've always talked about labor being about 70% of operating expenses, labor and labor-related. So payroll, health care, school business, those types of expenses, versus all the other expenses. Our occupancy, our store fleet, our gasoline going into that fleet, all the expenses we have to operate our business day in and day out. That represents about 30% of our operating expenses. That 30% piece has performed so well in the last 2 years that 80% of our improvements in operating expenses have come there. And a big piece of that would be on the occupancy side, and that's 'pathway to profit'. It's not complicated math, it's just we're leveraging our store base. ","When I look at that, the good news, good news in that story is we've done a great job with that component. And I think we're poised really well coming into 2012 to have another piece, a big piece of our operating expenses, that we can leverage quite attractively, and we've jumped on that midway through the fourth quarter to really go into the new year and attack that well. And with the rising sales and gross profit dollars because seasonality of our business, it poises us well for 2012. ","The other thing that I think is real compelling when I look at that, the non-payroll piece, is that non-payroll piece also contains all of our vending expenses. So we've gone from 567 units in service at the end of 2009, or said another way, the start of 2010, to almost 7,500 machines in service at the end of 2011, a thirteen-fold increase. And all those expenses have been absorbed in an area where we saw great leverage in our P&L, frankly [ph] everything else, but even better. And I don't want that to be lost in the whole message.","Speaking of vending, there is one clarification I do want to make when I look at the information we've released, and this is on top of Page 6 of our earnings release. In there, we have a table of information, and that table goes through -- and it talks about the number of machines we added, that we signed contracts on during the quarter. That's to try to give you a current touch on what activity is happening, of machines that will go online today and in the future and what those trends look like: The cumulative machines installed, so how many machines did we end up each quarter with, the machines in service; the percent of total sales to vending customers, so that's customers -- total sales for that customer group, both vended and non-vended dollars so we can measure the impact of it, how big that business is; and then the final is what's happening with that business, how fast is it growing. ","If you take a good close look at some of the numbers compared to prior quarters, you'll see some slight changes in the numbers. Really what's happened is we've -- as vending ramped up, we were compiling a lot of that information in a very manual process. We've migrated now to a more automated platform. Decided that -- we took another look at the data, and we slightly modified the field of definitions.","The first group, any changes there would just be cleaned up and the changes are very modest. The second group, you would see some changes. Really, what happened was a definitional change. Instead of the number of machines installed and scheduled at the end of the quarter, it is now very clean number. It's the number of machines installed and producing revenue at the end of the quarter, which I think is a cleaner number. None of it changes the trends, but whenever you see numbers that change, I think it's worthwhile pointing it out.","The third category, slight changes, very modest. The fourth category, if you look at Q2 and Q3, instead of growth in the upper 40s, it's growth in the lower 40s. Still a very attractive number but slightly lower than what we previously reported, and I wanted to point that out in the release. My take, when I look at all 4 sets of data, unbelievable numbers and doesn't change my opinion, it only enhances our opinion of vending as we go into 2012 and the future. I think it's a very compelling growth component to our business, one of many.","The -- as always, as I mentioned earlier, we talk internally and we talk externally about the good things in our business and some of the things that were proved more challenging or maybe the work side of the business, if you will. Two things jump out in my mind when I look at 2011, particularly fourth quarter. Our gross margin did drop about 70 basis points from 51.9% to 51.2%. Hopefully, the narrative I put in the release helps to explain the sum. I will provide a little more insight. ","Historically, we talk about the transactional piece of our gross margin, the organizational piece of our gross margin and the vendor incentive. And the transactional is about things we do every day, day in and day out. Organizational is more about leveraging our trucking network, as well as our ability to source products domestically and globally, using tremendous volume capabilities to buy, as well as a dedicated focus to improve our source of supply. And the third, vendor incentive, while it's a smaller component of the gross margin, it's a piece that can move around some. So that's why we mention it periodically. ","If I look at those 3 pieces and I take even a deeper dive into some components, one component of the transactional and organizational, it crosses actually a little bit of both, is the freight side. How are we utilizing our trucks, how are we doing charging freight, how we are doing with our -- how much LTL shipping are we doing because we don't have volume on certain lanes, et cetera. And Will touched on this earlier but when I look at that piece, one thing you see -- whenever you're predicting numbers coming into a quarter or looking at a year or you're looking at what you think you can do, you always have kind of a mind of where those pieces are. And one piece is going to be higher, one piece is going to be lower, and that's just life. What we really saw in the fourth quarter is, directionally, they all moved the same direction. We gave up 6 basis points here, we gave up 7 basis points there, 12 in another spot, 15 in another. If I look at all those pieces, we gave up about 40 basis points.","Now a piece of that, about 1\/3 of that, ends up being in our ending inventory. So it doesn't hit the P&L because it's capitalized in the inventory. But most of that, 25, 27 basis points does impact our gross margin in the fourth quarter. A second piece and an almost equal size is the rebate number does fluctuate a bit from quarter-to-quarter. Typically, in the fourth quarter, you have some true-ups. It might increase the number slightly, it might lower the numbers slightly because trueing up, most programs are calendar based. Gave up about 25 basis points there. ","That's the bad news. The good news is when I look at those pieces, that is a seasonal piece of our business and now the freight piece, we got to do some hard work to improve those. Some of it occurs naturally because we better leverage our trucking network. Our trucks have more product on them. So our relative cost is lower. Some of it takes -- sometimes taking a good hard look at it, kicking a few people in the butt, including ourselves, and saying we need to be better at this as we go into the new year. ","The last piece I'll touch on is what we talked about our organizational gross profit. Gave up a little bit in the quarter. That always moves around a bit from quarter-to-quarter, some natural gives and takes. Things that we're doing to exclusive brands tend to improve that number over time. Our large national account program tends to erode a little bit of that number. The real case is managing the mix over time to constantly improve it. ","Long story short, gave up some gross margin in the fourth quarter. I believe we're poised well as we go into 2012. So the last one is on the working capital. We continue to improve our working capital. That's part of the 'pathway to profit.' Our inventory utilization should improve over time. My issue there is we're just not making fast enough progress and that's something we'll work on. ","Our internal calculation really looks at the ending inventory and looks back in time against cost of goods to comp with the days of inventory and days that they are on hand. So how much working capital. Our business, as everybody on this call knows, historically uses quite a bit of working capital but we get great returns on that working capital, so we can afford it. But we operate in that 220, 225 days of working capital neighborhood when you combine the 2 together. Our challenge is how do we get to that sub-200, down in the 185, 190 neighborhood and how long does it take us to get there. Not to say we can't improve beyond that, but you always have shorter and longer-term goals.","We made about 8 days of improvement from last year. That should have been twice that number. So that's our challenge for 2012, is continuing to improve those days and do what we think we should do, not what we did in 2011. So I think we have good opportunity there, and that just enhances our cash flow and our ability to get returns as we go forward.","I believe our operating margin and our pretax margin will continue to improve if we can improve the relative performance of our working capital. It's a great one-two punch. ","With that, I will stop talking, and we'll open up for some questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So my first question has to do with your sales outlook for 2012. I guess, in your view, is this another year we could do 15% to 20% top line growth, given the many initiatives you have working?","Willard D. Oberton","Yes, Ryan, as you know, we don't give guidance, but if you look at our sequential pattern, historical patterns for the first half of the year, which is pretty well mapped out, we should be able to do the high teens if not better. But we're comfortable, 15% to 20%, we're very comfortable saying we should be at that or maybe a little better.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And then secondly, the vending initiative was a major success this year and from what I hear, there's a lot of momentum heading into 2012. Are there any tweaks or changes you have made that should make 2012 potentially a better year for vending? I think, in the last call, you mentioned new software that could increase efficiency.","Willard D. Oberton","There's actually -- we could talk all day, but I'll just give you 2 of them. One is we are developing new software and we're testing it in 2 districts, so probably 25 stores, and the feedback has been huge. The estimate is that it could save up to an hour per machine per day -- or excuse me, per week. So you look at that and you're -- it's $4 per machine out there in labor savings just because of the software. Just streamlines the flow of the product and the invoicing. Great opportunity to save some dollars and some time. The second is we implemented or introduced a vending incentive to give our store managers, district managers and all of our outside sales people a meaningful opportunity to make more money if they sell a certain number of machines. What we're really doing we're trying to buy their time. They're getting pulled in a hundred different directions and this is a way for us to get them more focused, and believe it will give us a little boost going into the new year.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just lastly, it sounds like 2,500 machines signs per quarter is a reasonable target at some point next year.","Daniel L. Florness","Yes, we're still very comfortable with that goal.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First off, on the gross margin. I guess, given that some of these seasonal factors might abate, would it be safe to say you'd expect gross margin to be roughly the same range next year? And the reason I asked the questions is we've heard that steel carbon rod is down about 10% in the last 6 months, and I'm just wondering what your expectations are in terms of fastener pricing and then other finished goods pricing.","Willard D. Oberton","On the fastener pricing, we haven't heard much yet. We believe that -- it's also saying that iron ore's going to be down. So there could be a little deflation on the fasteners next year, but we historically have been pretty good at keeping that, not having to pass as much of it along. But right now, we haven't seen anything from our suppliers. We haven't seen pressure from our customers to push it down or to pass it along our suppliers to give it to us. So it's a pretty long-cycle thing from ore all the way to a processed fastener. But as far as your question on our margin range, we state 51% to 53% this year. We came -- for the last 2 years, we've been right at 51.8%, and I think that's a good number for 2012. Looking at it right now, we're 10 days into the year -- or 12 days.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just on vending, and we've looked at this, we have asked on this, but I'm interested in hearing your view on it. As you look at the trade-off of vending relative to outside selling sales force or other opportunities, you might have new store openings, et cetera. Do you have an idea of what incremental growth you're driving today from vending? I guess you can look at it in a vacuum, but you have to consider that you're also offsetting that by not pursuing other growth avenues. Do you have an estimate for what you think, just incremental growth from vending alone is generating today?","Willard D. Oberton","We don't have an exact number because it blends in with the store, but the trade-off is actually very small because the more our people are out selling vending, the key to that sentence is about selling. And so they make hundreds of calls to sell 1 or 2 machines or dozens. It's a small ratio. And the more we keep them out selling, the overall business benefits. And I've actually talked to our managers about this recently, if they were to sell 1 machine per month -- and this is the group last week, 25 managers, I said if you were to sign 1 machine per month, how many days per month would it disrupt your business? And the answer from the group was 1 day, it takes one day to install it. So they have 19 to 20 days to go out and sell everything else. If we could sell 1 machine per month per store, you can do the math and see what it would do for us. It would be -- and I'm not saying we would. But it's a very small disruption for the gain. And we are going to continue to open stores. It's not a 1:1 trade, it's probably a 9:1 positive.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions here, again regarding the vending and sort of trying to get a little bit deeper into the data here. What percentage, or ballpark, of your installed machines are going into customers who never before used vending solutions as opposed to machines going into customers that are rolling out vending, of machines, into more of their own locations?","Willard D. Oberton","Okay. What is added on to -- I think if I -- the majority of our machines today are going into customers that have never had vending through Fastenal or probably in most cases never had vending. There is a number of the machines that are going into existing customers that signed up a year ago and they want more, but I actually don't have a breakout on that. But still the majority of them are new signings. I would say at least 70%. But the importance, I think, in that question is that as we sign up more customers -- I looked at our top 100 list at the end of the year, of customers with -- number of machines per customer, and going through it and adding up in my head, I think that we're probably less than 10% penetrated into these customers, many of them big Fortune companies. We're just planting seeds is the way I look at it. So I hope the ratio changes with growth if they're going into customers that already have it.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And that leads me perfectly to my next question then. So I mean, it looks like your average sales per -- your vending customer is on average maybe 8 to 10x the size of your average customer across the whole network and obviously growing much, much faster, 2 or 3x the rate of the overall company. You get a sense of how many of those types of customers that you have of that size and of that ilk, we can get a sense of what the, at least, the low-hanging fruit might be.","Daniel L. Florness","Well, here's one way to think about it, Sam. We've often talked about our average -- the proverbial average store, that $83,000, $84,000 a month store. It's top 10 customers represent about 65% of sales in that store and the other 1\/3 of the customers represent about 25%, and then there's some cash business on the tail end, so retail business. And one way I think about it, real simplistically, if I think that we have 2,600 stores times the top 10 customers per store, there's a group of 26,000 customers. And some of those customers -- that's based on account numbers, so you might have some replication in a given store. But you essentially have 26,000 customers in our business that represent a big percentage of our business and are very prime candidates for vending. As we develop the additional machines over time, that's where you start to scratch your head and you wonder how deep in the organization you can go with what size of customer. And I guess I would say a lot of those 90% that are smaller customers are smaller customers because we don't do that much business with them today. They don't have smaller potential.","Willard D. Oberton","I think I'll add one point, and that's the 26,000 customers we sell to does not include all the potentials that are not buying from us today, which is a much greater number.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then the last question as it relates to vending. Obviously, the productivity per machine is down but that's understandable because of the amount of machines that you're installing. Are you seeing the sales growth in like machines accelerate? And then the machines that have been installed for at least a year, the volumes through those particular machines, the growth is accelerating?","Daniel L. Florness","We are, and some of that comes from the fact that, you get 6 months into heavy machine, 3 months into heavy machine, you're always challenging what's in that machine from a SKU basis. To say, is that the right fit for this customer because what kind of velocity are you getting from SKU to SKU. And then in the next 6 to 12 months, you're always fine-tuning that, and then if you're introducing additional machines, you're still fine-tuning that. So we are seeing growth in it. But what I can't tell you, when you get into that second and third year, what happens. Because when you get to fine-tuning in there, it's in there, plus we just don't have enough machines with history.","Willard D. Oberton","Understand, 70% of our installed base has been in the last 12 months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","I guess just a clarification first, of the 16% of revenues that are with customers that have machines. Have you guys taken a stab at how much of the volume is actually going through it? Is it half of that 16% or...","Willard D. Oberton","Well, it's only about -- it's just under 20%, Adam. It moves around a little bit, but just below 20%. As you do, I get an 18%, a 19%, a 20%.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then could you give us an update on the metalworking opportunity? I think last quarter you talked about the first quarter is the one that would start to take off. Do you have the SKUs in the distribution centers you add, and are the new metalworking vending machines available for installation?","Willard D. Oberton","Yes, we're still very optimistic about the metalworking. In fact, we made a decision in October to recruit and add another 20 to 25 metalworking specialists, which will get us up into the mid-60s. The machines are available. We've signed some, but I don't have the exact number, but they are going out being installed. I've seen a few pictures come back of installed machines. So those are available, and from the reports back, they seem to be working well, the machines out there. We continue to expand the inventory in the warehouse. Actually, that's kind of a little slower than we planned. And part of it is a little bit of caution from our suppliers, which I appreciate, because they're saying, \"Let's not put it all in until we really understand what you need because they don't want to return.\" So it's a lot -- a more thoughtful process, but we continue to add every month, continue to add SKUs and continue to add suppliers. So we have the customers in the field that are buying the product, our fastener customer base. We have sales expertise out there. We've also done a good job with our sales people having the stores of taking this training through Tooling U. We have the online training. We have hundreds of store people that are certified. Not to an expert level but a very high knowledge level, so they can go out and talk the talk with their customers. And then if there's an interest, they can bring in a higher-level expert either from our team or from the supply team. Really nothing new there other than continued effort and still believe the opportunity is a very good opportunity for the long run.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brent Rakers with Morgan Keegan.","Brent D. Rakers - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was hoping maybe you can talk a little bit about the strategy and the store closings, I think the number was 28 for the year. And then also maybe give us, specifically, what the occupancy numbers were down year-over-year for the fourth quarter.","Daniel L. Florness","Well, first off, the closings. What we constantly do, we are a look-forward-only organization. We look at where we're at today and we look at a given market. And what process sometimes is we -- as we've disclosed in the past, we have a fair number of leases that come due every year because we, generally speaking, sign short-term leases. And we look at it market by market and allow our district and regional teams to look at their business and say, \"This market where we have 3 stores or 2 stores or 5 stores could be better served with one fewer store.\" And whether or not that is the right decision long term, we'll find it, we'll find that right answer over time, but it's not a bad decision in the short term. And I always fall back on the premise of I don't get too caught up in that in the short term. I look at it and say, it's a great -- it's a vast market out there, we have 2% market share and what's going to drive our ability to take that market share over time. And I look at all the growth drivers we have in place, that's what's going to drive that, not one component of it. And but when I look at the total store closings in the current year as well as cumulatively in our life, it's a pretty small number in the scheme of life. As far as the actual occupancy reduction, I believe that's -- occupancy was up 7.4% -- I'm sorry, that's an annual number. I don't have that number right in front of me, Brent. But I'll get that number and get it to you.","Willard D. Oberton","It was about 6%. I don't have my P&L in front of me.","Brent D. Rakers - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just maybe the follow-up to that. You talked about some of the benefits on the non-payroll side for the year on the cost side. Any sense, materiality, of those 28 closings positively lowering cost structure overall?","Daniel L. Florness","Yes, it did, but the measurement is immaterial because the only thing you would have would be the occupancy component. Because when we go from 3 stores to 2 stores in a market, the folks that were in that third store moved to one of the other 2. So there isn't a labor differential. It would be -- and the vehicles we still have because we still have them for those people. It's really the $3,000 a month we're spending, $4,000 in rent and utilities.","Willard D. Oberton","And in the first year, being 2011, it probably actually adds expense because we have to clean up the store. We have to move the product. We have to, many times, pay out a lease. Net-net, it's just about going forward with our business, a more efficient business model. There's nothing in there that we saved a bunch of money by closing a handful stores.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Barry with UBS.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just comment, as you look across the business, if there are any end markets that are looking especially better or worse during the quarter.","Daniel L. Florness","I guess our construction business improved during the quarter. I think the mild weather everywhere sure didn't hurt that business, but I guess nothing jumps out that I think is unusual.","Willard D. Oberton","And from a geographic standpoint, we really saw pretty good growth throughout North America and our International business. There isn't an area where we're looking at it and saying that area of the country or the world is just slow because of economic reasons.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I know it's a small percent for you, but the Government business, if you could just maybe comment on, if possible, on a same-store basis kind of what's happening in Government. I mean, I know you're adding a lot of share there, so it's probably a, I'm guessing, a big growth number, but...","Daniel L. Florness","The overall number is growing handsomely above the company number. We don't really think of it on a per store basis because our approach is one of a -- primarily U.S. approach, but just because of the way it's -- some of the early contracts we picked up, but it tends to be something we're doing at across a state. So we sign a state contract. We don't want to think of what is happening in Redwing, Minnesota versus Winona, Minnesota. We're thinking what's happening in Minnesota.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, that's kind of what I meant. Kind of on a same-contract basis maybe would have been the better way to say it.","Willard D. Oberton","Well, our state and local business, as Dan said, is growing well above the company. We have the teams in place, we have 32 people in the states, we have a person in every state that we have a contract focusing on the government. I believe we're hitting our progress goals. What we look at -- internally, the way we think of this, and we think of it the same way as vending, metalworking, government, is that we're expanding the market for the local store. So if you're in a local business here in Winona, Minnesota and we just picked up the state contract, which we did, now that store has more opportunity to go out and grow their mark over a long period of time. If we introduce a new product line that we've really sourced well and we believe we can sell through to the customers, like metalworking, we have just expanded the market for that store. So we think about it a little different than I think you do in your industry. We're building market opportunity, increasing market opportunity, everyday with these initiatives. And the better we get at it, the easier it is for that individual that runs the store or sells everyday to do their job and create an opportunity for themselves and their family. They only have the best store.","Daniel L. Florness","And one thing I'd add to that. I think when you look at some of the data we provide on growth in different age of store. You look at the 5-year-old-plus store or the -- our annual stuff we talk about from the 10-year-plus stores, what allows them to keep growing, because those are substantial businesses in their local markets. And the way you allow them to keep growing is -- obviously, they continue to add new customers. You give them tools like vending and government and metalworking to give them, again, more avenues to expand the potential wallet in that local market.","Operator","And so our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A question on store growth. You've guided the 4% to 6% store growth in 2012. Could you maybe talk about longer term? Is your store base where it needs to be? Is 4% to 6% the new normalized growth going forward, given initiatives on vending, et cetera, relative to the 8% historical growth, if you will, or higher historically? How should we think about that?","Willard D. Oberton","I think that's a good way to think about it because it's probably the new normal. What we've really tried to do over the last 2 years is go to our business leaders, as Dan called them, our regional CEOs, and give them growth goals, work with them on their goals and let them determine, for the most part, how they're going to achieve those goals. Whether it's new stores, adding outside sales people, sales specialists. But at the same time, we post different goals. We will continue to open stores, but the reason we're a little soft in committing to how many is it really depends on how these other initiatives will allow it. What we find with vending, with metalworking, and over a long period of time, I think we'll continue to open stores. We're still comfortable that we could open up to 3,500 in North America. It's just over what period of time that happens and what we need to do that. We want to find the most efficient growth model that we can and then stick with that. Or work on that.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, that makes sense. And just a last follow-up question. Do you have any thoughts, or how do you view the e-commerce sales channel? And I know you talk a lot about vending recently. How should we think about your strategy in using that channel?","Willard D. Oberton","We're working very hard on developing our e-commerce strategy. We introduced a new website in 2010, we had great results in 2011. We know that we'll probably always be behind many of the companies that just have a warehouse operation because we have all the keep-fail [ph], all the Line-Stock and all these other things. But it's a great way to receive orders and it's a great way for our customers to search for product and place orders. Our business on e-commerce, I believe, was fivefold last year, Dan?","Daniel L. Florness","Yes, yes.","Willard D. Oberton","It grew fivefold from 2010 to 2011. We don't expect it to grow that much this year but we expect above-average growth. It's simply another very good tool for customers to buy from us, an easy way to buy. It goes back to what I said, the most convenient way to sell is make it -- or make easier to sell -- I'm losing my mind here, sorry about that -- make it convenient to buy, and that's what we're trying to do with all of these tools, vending, delivery, local service, and e-commerce.","Daniel L. Florness","And I think one thing, too, is a definitional question. What is e-commerce? I look at vending as e-commerce. I look as electronic systems we use in our Bin-Stock programs. You can call that e-commerce, it's electronically gathered data. It's not just web, it's not just EDI. Historically, we talked about it from the standpoint, what's our web business. But it's really a case, are we making it convenient for our customer to buy?","Willard D. Oberton","And if we're making it convenient for our customers to buy, and it's very efficient for us to serve, that is the best business model that we can develop. Efficient way to serve and make it easy for the customer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Holden Lewis with BB&T.","Holden Lewis - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Since you guys started the 'pathway to profit' back in '07, you've had a fantastic run in terms of the incremental margins. Well in excess of kind of the pre 'pathway to profit' you all have done, which obviously was part of the goal. The last, I guess, 4 quarters or so, you've seen moderation sort of in that incremental margin. Q4, it was modest, but it sort of continued that pattern. What do you expect as you go into 2012, in terms of where incremental margins might settle out? And is there a broader statement as sort of about the aging process, the maturity of the 'pathway to profit' at this point?","Willard D. Oberton","Well, the one thing I'll say, then I'll hand it to Dan, is we did add 180 basis points in 2011 over 2010, and our goal was 100. But I'll give it to Dan.","Daniel L. Florness","I guess the better way to think about it is we've seen great success with the 'pathway to profit'. But I would argue most of the benefit of 'pathway to profit' haven't been realized yet. Because if you look at what's happened from 2007 to 2011, our improvement in operating margin -- as I touched on earlier, we've seen nice leverage in our occupancy. But our occupancy leverage hasn't come because we raised our average store size. Because we have raised it, don't get me wrong, but we haven't raised it -- when we started 'pathway to profit' we said 200 basis points of improvement because we go from 70,000 a month to 125. We've gone from 70 to the mid-80s, and we've taken out a meaningful piece of our operating expenses as it relates to occupancy just by lowering our rents and being smarter, re-approaching how we look at it. Fourth quarter of 2009, our rent was 540 basis points, today it's 395. And that's just the rent component, there's utilities and other things. But a lot of the improvement came from we raised our gross margin. So when I look at the 'pathway to profit', we've gotten a piece from occupancy. We've gotten a piece from labor, don't get me wrong, but that's primarily been in the non-selling areas. If we look at the data on headcount, you really see we've done a great job managing our support headcount, a great job managing our distribution and manufacturing headcount. We've invested in a lot of selling energy, both store and non-store. And so as the average store size grows, we still have a lot of runway left as it relates to the labor side and nice runway on the occupancy side.","Willard D. Oberton","We've also kept our sales above the numbers that we put out in 2007. Our goal then was 18% the center of the range, and we've actually, for the last 2 years, have been 4 points above that. And we were spending some money to stay there. But we think that's a great investment. I'll add one thing, Holden. We are still very committed to meet or exceed our 100-basis point improvement, annually, going over the next several years.","Holden Lewis - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And just as sort of the follow-up to that. You commented about how you sort of saw the holidays carve a little bit of momentum out of the revenues after being very strong earlier. Have you seen sort of a return to the early December levels of activity in the beginning of January? Or how is that -- given the difference in that pattern, how have you seen that play out so far this year?","Daniel L. Florness","Holden, I'll answer this way. On February 3, I'll give you some insight on what we saw in the January sales. As we enter the year, and as we enter every year, we're optimistic about the trend pattern we've created in 2011 and how it feeds into 2012, and the pieces of growth that we held to drive our business to grow and grow profitably into the future. ","With that, I see we're 3 minutes past our 45-minute call limit. So I'm going to close by saying, again thank you, everybody, for participating on our call.

Go ahead, Mr. Oberton.","Willard D. Oberton","Good morning. Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call. I'm going to spend a few minutes with some brief comments on my view of the quarter, then I'm going to turn it over to Dan.","Overall, I felt that we did a very good job in the quarter considering a little bit of economic headwind. Sales were slow, but we did see an uptick in September. So we're very optimistic about that. Another thing on a positive note is on a sequential basis, from June to September, we're really on track with what our historical numbers are. So we also see that as a positive. We had a very weak April-May time frame, although we lost a lot of ground for the year. But since then, we've really been tracking very consistent. So there is a little life underneath all of this.","We've seen very slow growth in both Asia and Europe. That's also been holding us back. If you compare it to last year, in 2011, we actually were getting about a 200-basis-point bump in our sales because of our foreign activity. And this year, it's about equal to the U.S. business. So we're just not getting any tailwind from our Asia and European businesses.","Mexico remains very strong, which is very positive. They've just done great over the last 3 or 4 years, and we continue to invest. I believe we've opened 7 stores in the last year in Mexico, and they continue to perform at a very high level.","A little bit on some of the vertical markets. Construction actually bounced back a little bit in September, but if you look at the number, August was a -- was like the low point. And so September is more on a normal number or more a traditional number, almost 10% growth on the construction. In manufacturing, we just haven't seen much change. I think it went -- moved about 10 basis points over the 3-month period, up 10, down 10. So manufacturing has been very consistent, which we actually look as a positive, because it had been moving down prior to that. So we're holding our own in manufacturing. And hopefully, things will pick up as time goes on here.","On the margin -- I'm a little disappointed in the margin. We've been working very hard on improving our margin. We didn't lose any ground. We also didn't make up much ground in the quarter. One thing to note on that, though, is that steel remains soft. If you follow the steel markets at all, steel continues to decline a little bit. If you look at -- we look at the Asian steel markets, because a lot of our fasteners come out of Asia. A lot of their prices are down 10% to 20% from a year ago. And so that continues to put pressure on our margin. But I think the team is doing a good job of holding the prices up as they can, but it's more difficult to make gains in a deflationary market. And with fasteners making up close to 50% of our business, that makes a big difference in our margin opportunities. We will continue to work on it and believe we can -- we will show some improvement as we go forward.","Some of the other projects or initiatives that we're working on. We continue to work hard on metalworking. Our goal going into the year was to grow that business, the product line, metalworking product line, at least 10 points faster than the overall Fastenal growth. We've been able to maintain that -- actually exceeded that goal. We continue to make nice wins, still not a huge business for us, but it's a nice-sized business, and it's growing meaningfully faster than the overall business. So we're optimistic, and our margins have maintained at a nice level. We're not giving up a lot of price to get that sales. We're not getting the sales on price. So that's very positive for us, and we'll continue to invest heavily on the metalworking business.","On the Government side, another one of our new initiatives, our goal is the same in Government: grow the business at least 10% faster than Fastenal. We're also exceeding those goals on that business, tremendous upside, and we'll continue to invest. We continue to make nice wins there. That's going to be a -- it's almost door -- it's like street fighting. It's door-to-door business. You have to go to a lot of small entities, county shops and small hospitals and city shops.  Very good, dependable business, but it's hard to get. So it's not one big swing gets it all.  So we're working very hard in the Government business and continue to develop our people and train them on how to go after that business, because it is a little different than our traditional industrial and construction business.","Vending had a very strong quarter. We had a very strong quarter in vending. We signed over 5,300 machines. We installed just under 4,000 machines. So we've made nice progress in both areas. Some of the positives that I've -- things that I see as positives in that is we've had broader participation at the store level. We're getting more stores to buy into the program. We still have a ways to go there, the stores that have bought in early. The early adopters are signing far more machines than the rest. It is broadening out. And we've also made some very nice customer wins that we picked up over the last 3 to 4 months. So we're optimistic about what's going on there. We believe it will continue to grow in the future. And as a company, we will continue to invest in the vending program as we will in the metalworking and government programs.","On the 'pathway to profit', I'm again a little disappointed there. We only picked up 50 basis points year-over-year. Our goal was 100 basis points, but we really didn't have the sales growth to make it happen. You need probably north of 16% -- 15% to 16% sales growth to pick up 100 basis points without squeezing the business too hard on other things. On a positive note, though, if you look at the 2-year run, we're up 190 basis points. We're still staying pretty close to the goal over a longer period, and that's really what we want to do. We know we're going to have some stronger years and some weaker years. So as a project, we're doing nice. The team is doing a great job, I believe, and we believe we can stay on that track going forward.","Expense control, done a nice job considering we didn't have the great sales growth that we were -- as good a sales growth as we're expecting. But I think the teams did a nice job looking at the little stuff, and that's how we've been able to maintain the earnings growth that we have.","Strong cash flow. Dan and his team did a great job with that, controlling the inventory growth and creating very positive cash flow for the company.","So overall, I believe we had a good quarter. I think there is a lot of work to do, a lot of things we can do better. We're very focused on improving our business and growing into the future.","With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan, because Dan will provide more color on the quarter.","Daniel L. Florness","Thanks, Will, and thanks, everybody, for joining on today's conference call.","A couple of things to make note as we flip through the various pages of the press release. On Page 1, inserted a paragraph into this quarter, a bit atypical for us, but the calendar had some impacts on the quarter. So I wanted to share a few thoughts on that. In the third quarter, we actually had 63 days versus 64 days a year ago. In some businesses, that might not make much of a difference, but for us, when you're selling a very tangible product, the number of business days really does matter. Our headline number is we grew our earnings -- grew our sales, excuse me, at 10.5%. But if you really peer under the hood a little bit, look at our daily growth, that's over 12%. I think that's the number that's really relevant because that's the number that carries the trend into the future. And so I added a little comment -- a blurb on that. Looking at that 10%, very pleased, and to touch -- build on what Will just mentioned, very pleased the fact that we were able to obtain leverage in an environment where we could grow -- where our top line dollars had only grow at 10% and we had a little bit of headwind from the gross profit side as well.","One item just to make note of when I look into Q4, we will have -- it's a 63- to 63-day quarter. So there's nothing really going on from that standpoint. There is a little bit of movement around within the months of the quarter. October will have 23 days this year versus 21 a year ago. So that will give us a nice headline number. Daily will probably suffer a little bit because of that just because there's a certain piece of our business that's more centered on the month and there's a piece to our business that's more centered on the day. So just to make everybody aware that there is 2 additional days. Those 2 days we give back in December. So if I look at trade-offs in life, October is a big month for us. And if I can get 2 extra days in October and give them back in December, I'll take that deal anytime.","Will touched on the sequential patterns a little bit that we looked at on Page 3 of the release. If I look at the last couple of years, 2010 and 2011, we were beating the benchmark pattern that we laid out, 50%, 60%, 70% of the time. And when we got out to September, we were 490 basis points ahead of the trend line, so 5 points ahead of the trend line year-to-date, looking at January to September. This year, we had a setback in February, some weather issues going on. We quickly got it back in March, but then May came along. And May really changed the year for us and created more conservative tone within the organization for the balance of the year. And at the end of June, we were about 330 basis points behind year-to-date history, and we're basically at that same point. We're about 330 basis points behind now at September. So since June, the business has been kind of treading water as far as how we compare to history, but nice momentum and also nice pickup, as Will mentioned, that we saw in September. And that bodes well as we go into October and into 2013, the more important way of looking at it.","In that context of the April-May-June time frame when we did see the slowdown, it was really in the fastener area. The non-fastener area held up much better, but that's also the area that's helped by all the growth drivers, the vending, the Government business, the metalworking. All those things we're doing really demonstrated that we can work through a period of declining economy and maintain very attractive top line growth rates.","One thing, in September here, ISM did pop up. Historically, when we looked at ISM, we've always felt ISM led us by about 3 months. So if ISM drops in June, we'd expect to see a drop in September. What we've been seeing in really the last year, 1.5 years is that we kind of coincide with ISM. I'm not quite sure what caused the change, but when we dropped off in May, the ISM dropped off in June. I'll be interested to see if the ISM over 51 in September is a blip or if it has some legs. At this juncture, we're -- the jury is still out for us. And we're still maintaining a conservative tone as we go into the tail end of the year and into the first part of 2013.","As Will mentioned, on the growth drivers, top part on Page 6, all I can say on the FAST Solutions is really a nice quarter.  Great signings, I attribute that to great focus on it at the field level. Our stores, our districts, our regionals are really running with this. Russ Rubie and his team does a great job and very pleased with that. To me, that gets the piece that jumped out the most is the fact that obviously, this is wrapping up quickly, but we have a fair number of machines that have been out there for 12, 18, 24 months. That's not an inconsequential number. And the fact that, that entire group of customers that have vending, overlapping numbers is still growing faster than 30%, I think it's a staggering figure and demonstrates the power of what vending can mean for our business. It's really about customer engagement. Vending is just the way we measure it. It's about we're engaged with that group of customers, and we're growing because we're providing great service and great value for them.","In that same section of growth drivers, did touch on a bit on 2013, we set out some expectations for store openings for next year, indicated a range of 50 to 100, which is about 2% to 4%. And I think our focus really is continuing the growth drivers we have in 2011 and 2012. They're demonstrating great results. We integrate the fasteners. We have some things that we're working on to really drive our OEM fastener growth. And in July, we mentioned the elevation of Lee Hein to President. And I think we announced that right after our call last quarter. So I want to congratulate Lee on that promotion. But I think the final thing we've touched on in that paragraph was talking about fixing our underperforming stores. And when I think of people and their strengths that they bring to the table, one of the strengths that I think of when I think of Lee, he's great at assessing people and talent, and he's great at raising the bar. And if you're driving down the road and you -- in your car, and the brake is stuck on one of your tires, it's going to slow you down. And we have a subset of stores in any given month just aren't growing and aren't performing, and we need to raise the bar and get that brake off, because it damages the rest of the engine. And I'm brutally excited about that looking into 2013.","Profit drivers of the business on Page 7.  Continue to be pleased with the progress of 'pathway to profit'. We took a step back a little bit in some of the smaller groups. I think there's really 2 things that are driving that, one we're working on, and the other one is probably a good problem. One is the gross margin that Will touched on. We're down in gross margin as a percent year-over-year. That creates drag in all those groups of stores. The other thing is we're preventing a rolling out. In the smaller stores, the expense of that vending does put a little drag on their pretax, but I think that's a good problem from the standpoint it really is driving our growth. But if you look at the stores that do more than $150,000 a month, where there is no vending impact, I mean negative vending impact, because the dollars of expense isn't big enough, well, that group is impressive, and we saw nice profit growth on a year-over-year basis.","The other thing, I think, to think about, and I touched on this in last quarter's call as well, if you look at since we started the 'pathway to profit' back in 2007, we have increased the size of Fastenal by about 65%. We improved our gross margin from 51% to 51.6%, and our profits have doubled, and that's just talking the power of growth, leverage it with improving gross profit and managing your fixed operating expenses and leveraging quite effectively. If you look -- looking at our expenses in the organization, we've always talked about our biggest operating expenses is the people side of the equation. And if I look at what we've done since 2007, we've added around 3,800 people to our organization since the first quarter of 2007. 87% of those adds are in roles that directly contact, that interact with customers every day. 6% are involved in our distribution centers. 6% are involved in our manufacturing. So if I add those 3 up, 99% of our headcount growth since 2007 is in those 3 areas, and that's how you leverage overhead in an organization.","The -- I'm very pleased through the fact that -- we hit 21.9%. I'm just going to round up and say 22%. It just feels better. But again, those are 2 highly profitable quarters for us despite the fact that we didn't have great sales growth in the quarter. We continue to make progress on our exclusive brands. We're essentially at 10% of sales to date. Vending really is helping move that number.","And then finally, I'm touching on some working capital. Will mentioned continued improvement on working capital. Now I do want to mention that Scott Camp and his team really did a nice job, I think, year-to-date on managing the distribution side of the inventory. We've lost a little traction on the accounts receivable side. Part of that was a short September. It takes X number of days to collect cash, and there's enough of August business that's coming in here the first week of October. That's more of a calendar issue. But when I look at cash flow year-to-date, we've taken 90% of our earnings and turned it into operating cash. We've spent about 27% of earnings on CapEx. A big piece of that relates to the success we're seeing in vending, and we've thrown off 63% of our earnings in free cash flow year-to-date, great number. And because of that, we did announce last night an increase to our dividend and are paying out a $0.21 dividend in the fourth quarter.","With that, I'll turn it over to what questions might come up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a question from Hamzah Mazari of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is just on store growth. You've talked about 2% to 4% growth next year. How should investors think about that number? Is that more of a normalized growth rate for you guys on stores? Or do you plan on increasing store growth if you get more comfortable on the economy? Just curious to see how we should think about store growth given where Fastenal is right now.","Daniel L. Florness","I'm going to be perfectly honest. I don't know that we know, and I'll say that in a couple of ways. We still don't know yet from our non-North American business what that means for store openings into the future. We just don't know. If I center the answer on North America, what we know about the market is it's big, $140 billion to $150 billion. It's $160 billion a year, depending on whose math you're looking at.  And we have somewhere between 2% and 3% market share. And historically, a lot of our eggs are in the store opening basket. And with 'pathway to profit', we really took a step away from that and said, \"There's a whole bunch of ways for us to go out and go after this market share, and we have this network that's out there that is -- that has unbelievable capabilities.\" And that's balanced our total growth drivers across more channels. So we put tools in the hand not just of an area where we're more sparse but area where we're more dense. I mean, when I look at the growth we continue to see in the Upper Midwest in a business that we've been in for 40-plus years -- and we're doing it with a combination of store openings, vending, government, the whole gamut as far as growth drivers. We think 2% to 4% is a good number for 2013. 2014 and 2015, we'll see when we get there. Long way of truly not answering your question but saying the opportunity is so big that we don't want to pin ourselves into the corner of saying, \"It has to go from this one thing.\" It comes from a variety. But when I think of, for example, the Government business, and I don't know in our products how big the government is, but if you read the headline, government is 20% of our economy. So if we have 2,500 locations, I'm using that so I can do the math in my head, and we add a 20% potential to that, that's like opening 500 stores. So is that a better route to go down in the short term or it's a goal of store openings, I think it's a combination of the 2, but I'll take that Government business.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's very helpful, and I appreciate it. Just one last follow-up question. On vending, could you maybe talk about how your vending offering is different from some of your largest -- larger competitors? Specifically, is your machine different? What are you stocking in there relative to what others are stocking? Do you own the inventory? Does the customer own the inventory? I know there's a better [ph] difference between your offering and some of your competition, maybe if you could touch on that.","Willard D. Oberton","This is Will. I think a lot of it is quite similar. Our machines are Internet-based appliances, which we think is an advantage, because they're more dependable. Some of the other companies offer a machine that has a PC built into it. Same system that we used to offer 4 or 5 years ago, and we find ours are far more dependable. Because it's a PC-based appliance, it's also a lower-cost system and so we're able to provide them at somewhat lower cost. The inventory in some customers is consigned inventory. In other customers, the customers choose to own it.  But the majority is consigned. Some of our competition does consigned inventory, and some of them have the customers own it. I think one of our biggest advantages, compared to the big public companies that we all know of, is our local branch network, because this is a physical business. If you think about the person who's supplying your soda machines or pop machines in the office, those people aren't driving from 3 or 4 hours away in many cases. Our local branch adds a service element that's going to be very hard to duplicate for some of our competitors. I know some of our competitors, their strategy is to ship it into the factory and then have the factory workers put the product away. But I would guess if your person providing the vending machines at your office said that they'll just ship the product to the dock, and you guys can put it away in the morning, probably you'd find -- or you may find a new supplier. So we have that local advantage that really gives us some leverage, and we have this distribution network to move the product more efficiently. But machine to machine, product to product, it's not that dissimilar.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First off, Dan, back in the third quarter of last year, you said that you could take your leverage probably down to maybe 12% or 13% growth with energy and you said lower if you hit the wall. And it seems like you've taken the leverage probably down to that level or lower.  And I'm just wondering about the strength you saw here in September relative to an uncertain economy. Are you happy where the set point is right now, that you'll maintain that unless things change one way or the other into 2013? That's the first question. And then I'll just sneak the second one in here, too. In terms of vending placements, the number of vending machines, by my math, is up over 300% in the past year, and revenues to customers with vending machines looks like it's up a little bit less than 100% and I'm trying to understand that dynamic. Does that mean you're now getting into smaller customers? Are you placing more of the FAST 3000 machines with their less yield per customer? Or what is the implication from that math?","Daniel L. Florness","Okay. First off, a couple of different questions there. First, on the breakpoint, my comment a year ago, '12 and '13, I'm glad to say I was wrong. I think part of it is maybe I'm Midwestern, and I'm an accountant, so it makes me probably too conservative and not willing to put my neck out and say we could do it at 10%, because I didn't think we could. So that's just, I think, good execution, especially in the face of the gross profit dynamic going on, which made it more challenging. On the vending machine, I'm not sure if I'm following your math on the 100% pieces. And in fact, I think I'll kind of restate it back the way we have it. And I'll think out loud a second, and then I'll give you a third question to follow up on my answer. But the way I think about it is the customers that are coming into that group when we introduced vending, our -- that overall business is growing at 30%, and that includes the weight, if you will, of the customers that have anniversary-ed, the customers that had vending a year ago and 2 years ago, because we're looking at that combined group. I think if you're talking about vending being up over 100% because you're looking at the new machines and the dollars going through it, you're just -- you're taking the math and saying, \"Okay, 24% of your sales are with customers with vending, and that number is X percent bigger than it was a year ago,\" you're comparing apples and oranges.  Because we have customers that we had a year ago that didn't have vending that have vending today. So when we talk about the percentage of our sales that is vending, that includes customers that have been buying from us for years. We're just now looking at it and saying, \"How big is that pool growing, and how big was that customer base a year ago?\" and -- which I think is the best way to look at it, because it's really \"How much is it impacting your business?\" not \"What is the dollar growth going through a machine?\"  Because that's really not a meaningful number. I'm not sure if I answered your question right then [ph].  The other thing I guess I would look at and say if I look at our dollars per machine and I try to understand that dynamic, is it improving or getting worse?  It's at or a little bit better than it was a year ago. And so from that standpoint, I don't think there's any dilution going on because of the different models of machines, but there is some impact. When we report our machine count, we're reporting just our absolute count.  Here's vending [ph] machines we have out there. And in that mix, there's the traditional FAST 5000 with the locker systems. There's some hydration machines. I think that's what we call it. And there are some cutting tool machines. So there's a variety of machines, and they have different potentials as far as throughput. And the way we measure it is we look at lockers and we say, \"We think they have about 1\/2 a potential.\" So when we're looking at dollars per machine, we look at that as a half. But I don't know if I just thought out loud and did a brain dump and didn't answer the question? Maybe Will has a better answer.","Willard D. Oberton","The way I look at it, Dave, as I look at the incremental growth off this group of customers, this group of customers represented almost 60%. If you take 25 -- roughly 25% of your business grew 20 points faster than the overall company, the average of that represents the majority of our incremental growth. And we lay that against the expense of the vending program. But then from the vending program, we can also look at it at a different way and, say, we're putting expense of all these machines into our occupancy, because we really think it's just offsite storage, and our occupancy is not outgrowing our revenue, because Dan's group is doing such a great job. So we're really building this into our old P&L working model. And so it's very accretive business when you look at it that way. It's a great growth driver. But we can talk more and try and clear up. I'm a little confused, too, with the question.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's great. I appreciate the color on that. Just to follow up on that first question, though, Dan.  In terms of how you feel about it, as you're looking at the business level for next year, I'm just trying to get a read. I know you don't have a tremendous amount of visibility, but there's a lot of cross-currents here in terms of the data we're seeing out there in the marketplace, some of the economic data, and then relative to what you're saying for your June, for September. I'm just trying to get a relative read on your feeling. As you look to 2013, are you feeling pretty good? Or are you still fairly cautious about this industrial environment just as a company?","Daniel L. Florness","We're cautious. We're investing aggressively. I mean, we're putting vending machines out there. We're adding up -- we're adding sales potential into our organization every day, but we are cautious when we're looking at how we manage our expenses.","Willard D. Oberton","And one thing that we did mention on the call is that we've introduced a lot of new technologies and efficiencies into our business that have helped us lower that breakeven down to somewhere below 10%, I guess, if you look at the numbers. Those are things that will continue to benefit us for years, and it's throughout our organization, electronic billing and accounting, the automation in our warehouses. And we've introduced 2 or 3 major things to the stores from point of sale, simplifying the pricing, simplifying the process of -- processing of orders with the goal of being the most efficient distributor in the industry. These are things that have a long tail on and will continue to benefit. So where that breakeven is at any given time will depend on our view. And if we're very bullish, we'll invest heavier, and that will slide up. If we're very conservative, which we're not right now, we're cautiously conservative, we'll pull that down and be able to lower that number. We have better levers on that than we've ever had, because we're not adding the cost of the fixed overhead of the stores. That was a big thing that you couldn't do much about once you had it.","Operator","Our next question is from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","The -- a couple of questions on vending again. So specifically looking at your vending customers, what do you -- what's the growth that you're seeing from the SKUs that they're buying that don't come from the machines? I'm trying to figure out the -- parse out the actual impacts of the machines themselves on those customers versus what they're doing outside the machines.","Daniel L. Florness","Well, I guess I'm going to answer it by talking about if I look at the subset of the business that goes through the vending machine, that number is then -- if we have a $10,000 customer, $2,200 or $2,300 of that, so about 22%, 23% is actually physically going through the machine, but the products that are going through the machine, Sam, could be products that we've been -- there are 40 slots in a machine. 10 of those slots could be items that we've been selling to that customer for years. And it's just now we're selling it using the vending machine as the vehicle, and the other 30 slots or 20 slots or 10 slots are now new products. But the discussion we have with the customer is really one of economics. We're bringing this machine that we believe will help your business. And what we need is a couple of thousand dollars of incremental business with you. And let's use a worst-case scenario. Let's use a scenario where the customer is spending $3,000 a month of business but now going to -- 100% of it's going to go through the vending machine. And I know based on the value of that vending machine brings, that $3,000 spend that we've had with -- that customer had with us is probably going to go down to $1,800 or $2,000, because when it goes through a vending machine, there's more accountability to the product. And so our discussion with that customer is we need, in total, to take your business from $10,000 to $12,000.","Willard D. Oberton","Or $3,000, you see, you said $3,000.","Daniel L. Florness","$3,000 from the machine, but we're doing $10,000 for that customer.","Willard D. Oberton","$2,000 incremental.","Daniel L. Florness","I need $2,000 of incremental.  And the discussion might be, the customer says, \"Well, you know what? I've done $3,000 a month in vending -- in welding supply,\" and they turn over to welding supply stores. We're not led to the machine dynamic. We're led to the growth of the business. Lee?","LeLand J. Hein","Yes. Sam, the other thing that happens just from a branch standpoint, again, back to that local branch, is because our people are there daily or every other day, we're capturing sales because we're there. We're having customers go -- seeing the employee walk in in a blue shirt with our blue machine going, \"That's our supplier. Hey, while you're here, could you give me whatever?\" We're seeing growth because of that also, back to the local store.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Let me ask a second question, then. You've talked in the past about the average size of a customer that uses a vending solution. What is that average size now? How many more customers do you have of that size that have not yet signed up with vending solutions? And how many customers of that size do you tend to add on an annual basis?","Daniel L. Florness","When we started vending and we looked at the opportunity, and I think this is the best way to answer it, we looked at it and said, \"We have 230,000, 240,000 active customers a month, and we think about 10% of that number, 25,000 to 30,000, based on our initial definition of the vending, the FAST 5000, could have a vending machine.\" And we looked at it and said, \"If we could have 2 machines per customer in that environment, there's an opportunity here for us to put out 50,000 machines.\" That was what we thought about it 3 years ago. And so if I think of the -- I don't have the exact number in front of me, but we have, what, 17,000 machines out there now?","Willard D. Oberton","Yes, 17,000 installed.","Daniel L. Florness","And the last data I looked at, I think the relationship is about 2 or 2.2 machines per customer. So there's 8,000 customers right now that have vending.  Rough numbers. And Lee might have a better number. And so there's a big universe of customers out there that we have today that we put vending into, even based on our definition of, 3 years ago, what the FAST 5000 is. We've added the whole fleet of machines now. We've broadened the audience of customers that could have vending. We've decreased the size that we need to run through the machine and decreased the size of the customer. So I don't think there's a market limitation for us, unless you want to start talking about 2020.","Willard D. Oberton","Well, anecdotally, Sam, when you talk to store managers that had not bought into this, they'll tell you that they see 3 or 4 customers in their market that may be a potential. And when you visit stores that have done very well, stores that have 20 or 30 machines, and we have several of those now, and you ask them what their market potential is, with -- the lowest numbers I hear are 50. And most of the people say, \"Oh, I'll get well over 100 in my store.\" And so once that the store managers start to see this, the numbers become so much larger, I'm almost shaking my head, going, \"Wow.\"  But these are the guys in the field, these are the guys that understand it. And so it's really about opening the eyes, and the numbers will continue to grow, as Dan said, as we get different machines for smaller customers and larger customers. It's simply a better way to deliver our product.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Merkel of William Blair.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First, I want to start with September, which is a very good month, and you mentioned you saw an uptick. Can you just speak to how the month played out and if there were any surprises from your viewpoint by end market or geography?","Willard D. Oberton","No, there really weren't. One thing I noticed about September, Ryan, is the consistency throughout the United States. If you look at the growth region by region, it's probably the narrowest group that you -- band that you've seen in a long time. Nobody had a real bad month, and there's really no one that had a great month, which -- consistency is good for us. We did see a nice uptick, though, in our international business. Part of that was driven by currency, but overall, even the unit growth was up internationally. So it was consistent. It was, for the most part, consistent through the month. We had a little bit of a stronger finish, but we do our daily analysis and we bring the sales in, and we ended up about 200 basis points ahead of where we had estimated even before halfway through the month. Some early days into the month, we were estimating in that high 12s, and that's where we ended up just a little bit about -- or 12.9%.  So very consistent pattern, consistent across the United States and steady as the month went. So that was -- it was all positive.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","That sounds actually very positive. Okay. And then second question, I want to ask about vending, but I'll ask it a different way. If I just look at the number of vending installations and, of course, signings as well, it seems to me that the impact from vending should start to accelerate starting as early as the fourth quarter. Is that the right way to think about it? Is that how you're thinking about it?","Willard D. Oberton","I'm not sure why it would -- well...","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","In terms of impact.","Daniel L. Florness","The impact is going to continue to grow because the number of machines is growing so fast. And so that adds in layers of potential.","Willard D. Oberton","I think the other thing, and we don't know how to measure this, is there's a lot of built-up -- there's a lot of energy going into this project today. But it's really delayed, because it takes us about 90 days to install a machine after we sign it. And it really takes us, on Dan's analysis, another 60 to 90 days to get everything flowing, because what happens in most cases is the customers we sign up have a lot of inventory. Whether we sell it to them or the other guys did, they have a stock that we have to burn through. And many times, we'll actually put that in our machines and burn the inventory through whether it's ours or theirs. So the reality is if I sign a machine today, it's probably March before I see much gain. So we have a lot of energy and selling that has a delayed, positive effect, which is actually a great thing, because it will come through. The other part, you have that. The other is with all that energy, we're probably not working as hard on some other things we should, because we only have so many hours in a day. So it's where you put your time. And as Dan mentioned, fasteners, they're probably suffering because of some of this -- Lee has a comment.","LeLand J. Hein","What I'd add also, Ryan, is it's really, you've got to -- focus in on the participation.  What's going to accelerate vending or the vending sales is more stores participating.  That -- every time you look at Fastenal, whether it's Government, any of our industry specialists, you always have to hold that against how many stores are participating in this growth driver today. And that's really where we come in to drive that, that once the stores latch onto vending, we get the majority of stores participating. That is what will accelerate that.","Operator","Thank you.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to hand the meeting over to Ellen Trester, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellen Trester","Welcome to the Fastenal Company 2016 second quarter earnings conference call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Sheryl Lisowski, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, Controller, and Chief Accounting Officer. The call will last for up to 45 minutes and we\u2019ll start with a general overview of our quarterly results and operations with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers.","Today\u2019s conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal.

I've been in my role here at Fastenal as CEO and President or -- I'm in my seventh month, started in January, unofficially stepped into the role last October.","I'm a firm believer, and I have some CEOs that came before me at Fastenal that did an excellent job of doing two things; providing vision to our shareholders and to the employees at Fastenal and providing perspective periodically on what we are doing for course correction as we go through a period of time.","In the case of vision, I like to believe the vision that we laid out last November on our investor day and the vision that we believe, I believe is a correct one for Fastenal is being presented in a meaningful fashion. I think we are seeing traction on it. From the vantage point of the second item perspective, perspective is looking at the business in my mind as you go through the quarter again pointing things out as you go through the quarter you go through the year, you go through the month pointing things out and seeing a cause and effect from the standpoint of a reaction and the improvement on certain things, or you accelerate on certain things that aren't moving fast enough.","In that regard, I would have to say I let the Fastenal organisation and our shareholders down in the second quarter, there were some miss steps we made, but let's look at vision first. We talked last November about the vision of Fastenal and one thing that I think is critical to our success as we go forward in this year and into the years to follow is the momentum we are building as an organization.","One of the hallmarks of the organization that I have known for over just over 20 years, in June I hit 20 years with Fastenal, a milestone I'm particularly proud of, is the fact that we are an organization that builds momentum, whether that momentum is coming from the opening of stores, the adding of people, the signing of and installing of vending machines, we are an organization that creates momentum for ourselves and that allows us to separate in the market place our ability to grow long term. Now we operate in a large market, we have a large opportunity and it's upon us to build the momentum to go out and take that opportunity.","We didn't have great momentum coming into the year and you see that shining through on some of our numbers this quarters and I'll get into a few more specifics in a second. But on the building of momentum front, in the first six months of this year we signed 92 onsite, 48 in the first quarter, 44 in the second quarter. Our stated goal is to sign 200 for the year, firstly I want to have no quarter that doesn't start with at least a four, and it will be great to have a quarter or two that starts with a five. So far, I believe in the first two quarters of the year we've made a tremendous transition in our ability to sign on-sites.","And on-sites for those of who not familiar with it is really about us setting up a store inside the customer's facility and having an even more intimate relationship than we've had in the past. We have currently 333 I believe that's the number, on-sites that are operating of the 92 we've turned on I believe close to 50 on-sites, but we are making very good progress on changing the organization to build, start building that momentum that we'll need as we go into '17, '18 and beyond.","In regards to vending, in the first two quarters of this year we signed 9,516 devices and we signed more in the second quarter than the first quarter. Earlier in the year we added 200, roughly 230 people into our business to support vending and to drive our signing with vendings, and I'll touch on a few stats in a second of why that's important. But I'm proud to say that we are gaining some momentum there.","Part of the process with this new group of people was to go out and optimize our existing devices. In many cases that optimization involved adding products into the machines to improve the throughput of the machine. In some cases it was changing the configuration of the machines to improve the efficiency of replenishing the machine and so an optimization is an all revenue base and might be service based aspect.","But we've optimized approximately 75% of our machines in the first six months of the year, that's good news. The second set of good news that we continue to see good statistics out of the group of stores. The bad news is it also required the removal of a certain number of machines. We've removed 7,200 machines in the first six months of this year as we went through our optimization process.","Many of those machines are great decision - that we removed are great decisions because we went from 10 machines to 9. We went from 4 machines to 3, because we really rationalized the equipment we needed to support that customer and that's a great decision because it allows us to get a better return on that asset that's deployed.","Unfortunately some of the machines we removed were examples where we had the machine in an environment where either the business had changed or the business never truly justified the vending machine and we went from one to zero or two to zero. But I believe we have a much better business vending business today than we had six months ago and we continue to see great traction in our signings and every day we are doing a better job, vetting new signings than we did the day before. We are becoming a much better vending company.","If I look at the second quarter, we grew our business just under 2%. Our vending customers grew just under 3. Those customers like many of our customers especially in particular industries heavily hit by either weaker energy prices or weaker activity in the industrial market place.","Our fastener business with vending customers was down 5% in the second quarter. So a group of customers that grew 3% their fastener business with us was down 5, I think that's an indicator of what's going on in their economic circumstance.","For non-fastener business with that same group of customers grew about 6%. If I take it one step further the dollar that\u2019s going through the vending machine grew about 11. So what we are seeing is a group of customers about 45% of our revenue is with customers that have vending.","Our revenue with that group of customers is growing at about twice the rate of our overall business as a company. That group of customers is as hurt by the economy as any other group and you are seeing that shine through in the fastener business and yet our non-fastener business continues to grow very well and our business through the vending machine is growing double digit.","We believe vending is an example of engagement with our customer just like on-site and is an example of engagement with our customer we believe we are building momentum that will serve us well in the years to follow.","The third piece of momentum I believe we are building is our CSP 16, I believe we are about 1,900 stores converted. Our CSP 16 is largely in place with the revenue drivers of our business and what I mean by that is there are some stores that have yet to convert, there might be smaller stores or stores that are in the process of moving, but they but our revenue base is largely complete as it relates to CSP 2016 and that positions us to a better same day supplier to our customers, be a more efficient supplier to our customers and broaden our appeal on the range of customers that can buy from us, and I believe that will serve us well in the months and years to follow.","Finally we have very good momentum on our national account signings we highlighted that in the points raised I believe it was on the second page of the press release. That\u2019s being helped by on-site signings, on-site signings are being helped by that, they serve each other well because 75% of our on-sites are with national account customers. That's the vision and I believe the momentum we are building as we go through 2016. ","Now the perspective part, and the part where as I mentioned earlier I think frankly I could have done better it's from the standpoint provided perspective to the team at Fastenal.","Our top 10 customers in the first quarter and our top ten customers represent 8% to 10% of revenue -- the month or the quarter you are looking at. That group was growing at about 14% in the first quarter, largely buoyed by a few customers that were new to that group. The key to that group every year is what is the new blood you are bringing into it, and what are you doing with your existing group of customers that were in there -- in the past.","In the district level we refer to that as our top 25, at the regional level we refer to that as our top 300 customers, it's really what's happening with you know big customers and what new customers are you bringing into that group. The growth for that group which was double digit in the first quarter and was double digit in April went to zero in the month of May and went to negative six in the month of June. So in the second quarter that group of customers grew at about 8%.","If I look at the top 100 customers in our business and again they represent about 25% of the revenue, the top 10 I just talked about would be a subset.","In the first quarter that group of customers grew about 4.5%. In the month of April that group of customers grew 6.5%. In the month of May that group of customers contracted about 2%, in the month of June that group of customers contracted about 2.5%. For the quarter that group of customers which grew almost 5%, 4.5% in the first quarter grew 7\/10s of a percent in the second quarter.","When I look at that group of customers, I see that sudden fall of as an example not of the momentum we are building but of slowdowns with the momentum we have built in the past with customers we have had in the past where we have a large market presence and that business fell off later in the quarter.","The perspective part that we failed on is we didn't react fast enough locally and companywide to that falling revenue in the month of May and June. As it relates to gross margin, you'll notice a couple of thing omitted from our press release this quarter. One is a stated range and that stated range was not removed because I felt was accurate, it was removed because it was becoming too much noise to our conversation. I believe you owned Fastenal, because Fastenal is an organization that builds momentum and carries that momentum forward and is good enough at executing the business that we are able to capture that momentum in very attractive profit growth overtime and very attractive returns.","Therefore our focus internally is 90% on building the momentum. But in the case of gross margin, our gross margin dropped about 30 basis points during the quarter from the first quarter. About 25 basis points of that drop remain was tied to some of the activities around a very rapid CSP 2016 roll out and really more than that a number of efficiencies we introduced into our store network, inventory by location. They come under a bunch of names but we are introducing and we want to do it very rapidly maybe too rapidly, but we want to do it very rapidly to move forward.","During that process, there were some components of our inventory we decided to sell off at a lower price, there were some components of our inventory that we decided to remove from our business. There is about 10 basis points of that drop that I believe are behind us, there is about 15 to 20 basis points of that drop that I believe will remain for several quarters. I was willing to move quickly on that as we entered the second quarter because I felt there were enough other things we were doing that we could fund that if you will by other gross profit initiatives. Those didn't materialize, unfortunately and the gross margin that you see as a result.","And related to operating expenses, there's really probably two things that are noteworthy in our operating expenses and Sheryl is going to touch on a hand -- give us a little depth on these and a few more. But the two things that jump up from me, are few costs were up about $2.5 million from Q1 to Q2, that's a fact of the price of gasoline at the pump and diesel fuel at the pump where we didn't execute real well as we didn't react quickly to adjusting some of our store routes, our local routes but more importantly we didn\u2019t wrap very quickly to our propensity charge freight and therefore we largely bore that expense without sharing any of that expense.","The second one and this is a mechanical thing and it's something that I talked about with many of you over the last year on earnings call. And that is historically we have a very good flex in our operating expenses as it relates to incentive comp and what it means in the short term for our ability to absorb some worsening environments and in a little bit of the incremental margin we give back in strong periods.","And that is, as we had gone through 2015 our incentive comp was compressing dramatically. And if you take a look at our proxy, you could see that from the standpoint of the impact on the executive compensation. But it contracted dramatically and so our -- the district and regional and store leadership component of that is at a compressed level and so the ability to flex there is limited in the current environment and you sell that shine through unfortunately in the current quarter.","Finally two things I'll touch on and it really relates to the momentum items I was discussing earlier and that is and we highlighted it. We installed during the quarter approximately 3000 locker lease devices under our locker lease program that we initiated earlier in the year with Wal-Mart. Now the total roll out of that will be approximately 1,500 devices and will roll out as we go through the balance of this year and I believe a little bit into early next year. We think it's an excellent program for us long term and we entered into it.","The second one is at our investor day last year we unveiled our outdoor locker. As of today we have approximately 30 outdoor store lockers in place. We expect to have about 50 by September. And while it's not very meaningful from a revenue perspective and it won't be very meaningful from a revenue perspective when I look at 2016 or 2017. It\u2019s a step we're taking in one more means to be a much better supplier to our customers. With that, I'll it over to Sheryl.","Sheryl Lisowski","I will start by providing an overview of our operating and administrative expenses. Regarding employee related expenses we added approximately 800 people to the Fastenal organization in the last 12 months. Approximately 37% of these people were added to a store or some other type of selling location.","During the first half of 2016 our payroll related expenses increased due to the addition of personnel related to the acquisition of Fastener's Inc which occurred in November 2015, and the addition of vending specialists, information, technology, development resources and distribution personnel, and we also experienced an increased in our healthcare cost.","These increases were partially offset by contraction in our performance bonuses and commission and in our profit sharing contribution, primarily due to lower sales growth and due to lower operating income both on a dollar basis and a relative basis. The increase in the second quarter of 2013 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors as the six-month period.","Regarding occupancy expenses, the increase in the first half of 2016 when compared to the first half of 2015 was driven by an increase in industrial vending equipment and also an increase in investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years primarily related to automation, the largest impact related to the industrial vending equipment.","The increase in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors as the six months period. Selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses increase in the first half of 2016, when compared to the first half of 2015.","This was driven by an increase in the number of vehicles for sales personnel and the timing of leased vehicles sales which was partially offset by a decrease in fuel cost. The increase in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors as the six-month period.","During the second quarter of 2016, we did not repurchase any stock, however in the first quarter of 2016 we purchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $37.15 per share.","We spend approximately $396 million buying back stocks since June 30 of 2014 and we purchased approximately 3.3% of our shares outstanding from the start of this timeframe.","Regarding net capital expenditures, in the first half of 2016 our net capital expenditures expressed in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were $86 million or 33.3% of net earnings.","We expect our net capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million in 2016 and we plan to fund the portion of our planned capital expenditures with proceeds of our private placement of debt. We expect to close on this funding in late July 2016.","Regarding operational working capital, on a year-over-year basis our inventory grew by $108 million and this growth was driven by the following factors; CSP 16 was approximately 50% of the increase.","Our international inventory growth was approximately 9% of the increase, the acquisition of Fasteners Inc related to 8% of the increase, on-site and large customer impacts which were approximately 14% of the increase.","From a cash flow perspective, our operating cash flow as the percentage of net earnings contracted slight in the first half of 2016 when compared to the first half of 2015 due to our current initiative to add additional products into store inventory under our CSP 16 format. This was partially offset by a reduction in net cash used to fund accounts receivables.","Our first quarter typically has stronger cash flow characteristics due to the timing of tax payments, and this benefit reverses itself in the second, third, and fourth quarters as income tax payments go out in April, June, September, and December. Our free cash flow year to-date for 2016 is 63% of earnings which compares to year to-date 2015 at 66% of earnings.","Last night we announce the Q3 dividend of $0.30 per share. As a takeaway I'd like to share with the group that we have a strong cash flow and we're optimistic about our cash flow potential throughout the year.","And with that, I'll turn it over for questions from the group.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Robert Barry","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Daniel Florness","Good morning, Rob.","Sheryl Lisowski","Good morning.","Robert Barry","Dan, I wondered if you could just provide a little bit more color on June sales, what verticals slowed especially in light the ISM which seems to be showing improving conditions? And I wondered if you would attribute any of the pressure to things that might consider temporary or like these extended shutdowns you mentioned?","Daniel Florness","In the construction front we saw slowdown in our energy customers in both May and June. And a piece of that is we're seeing projects that were still going on from a year ago that just are not being replaced. I would not look at that as a temporary one. On the temporary front we saw quite a few customers that were shut down, I think our largest impact was actually on-site we have where the customer was shut down for three weeks of the month in doing maintenance, but the week of Memorial Day in early June we saw shutdowns, we saw some shutdowns here in the over the week of July 4th and I believe those are \u2013 while they are temporary will impact third quarter as well because of the July 4th and I would suspect there'll be some over Labor Day as well.","Robert Barry","Yes. I mean, I know it's probably hard to quantify, but any rough estimate of the extent which these temporary items weighed on June or the quarter?","Daniel Florness","Well, in the case in June I could comfortably say a point \u2013 a percentage point of revenue; going beyond that I wouldn't be as comfortable.","Robert Barry","You also mentioned pricing has an impact from deflation, can you dimension that and given steel prices have started to rise how should we think about that potentially becoming a benefit?","Daniel Florness","We were seeing probably more propensity for fastener prices to rise two and three months ago, while there still is \u2013 there still are examples of that, some of the propensity had lessened, but I won't \u2013 I'm less certain. I think that's probably more of a \u2013 we need some traction in the economy to make some of that become a little stickier.","Robert Barry","Yes. So the steel prices rises aren't yet potential tailwind, just not enough or long enough or\u2026?","Daniel Florness","There are not as pronounced. I guess, we were seeing more of that two and three months ago, and while there's still a lot of discussions both on the fasteners and the non-fasteners, I would say its probably less noise from it now than there was two or three months ago.","Robert Barry","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Chris Dankert","Hi. Morning, guys.","Daniel Florness","Good morning.","Chris Dankert","Last call you've been talking about being able to hold the gross margin flat or roughly flat kind of through the rest of the year. Just kind of given what we've seen pricing wise and demand wise, I guess, can you kind of give us some sort of size of what you do expect for the full year now as far as is 49.5 a new - better benchmark now?","Daniel Florness","I don't know that my credibility is real good on that right now, given some of the statements made in the past. What I touched on is we saw about 25 basis point, 25 to 30 basis points drop largely because of a few what I'd consider internal shorter term things that we've decided that we're moving quickly on and decided to do to be honest with you. I felt we had enough momentum of other things in place to match that in short term.","And my comments here are short term centered and short-term being 2016, because longer term our on-site business which runs in the mid 30s will become a -- as we gain traction in there will become a more meaningful piece. And so if you look at now a longer term three to five years I would expect some progression in our gross margin solely because of mix of business.","Chris Dankert","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then I guess, I don't believe I've missed it, but is there any way to quantify these ex-sales impact, you know, sales impact from CSP or some of the on-siting stuff, I know you've given us some decent progress numbers as far as how those have rolled out, but is there any kind of revenue impact you can give us?","Daniel Florness","I plan to do a little more that in the Q3 call only because the last of our CSP convergence were occurring in that early June timeframe, so we really don't have enough time under our belt because there was a lot of activity going on in the first and second quarter and a lot of in the second quarter.","In the case of the on-site, we want to get a little deeper into the year and then do some discussions on the 80 we saw in last year what we've seeing and what we're learning from it. The 92 we've signed in the first six months of this year, what we're seeing, so for the time being I'll hold off on that.","Chris Dankert","All right. Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","David Manthey","Thank you. Hey, Dan. Good morning.","Daniel Florness","Good morning.","David Manthey","When you think about the growth of the company today and the build up of sort of a secular growth rate, market growth, share gain, vending on-sites, price et cetera, how do you think about the growth of Fastenal as it stands today?","Daniel Florness","You know, give me a timeframe Dave, so I can\u2026","David Manthey","Yes, I'm talking\u2026","Daniel Florness","You're looking at multi \u2013 you're looking at kind of a multiyear thing?","David Manthey","Definitely, definitely, I'm talking three to five years, kind of either from here over the next several years?","Daniel Florness","I believe we have \u2013 we talked in the November Investor Day about the number of on-site potential, the number of vending potential, and our existing store potential outside of those two, because there's a lot of national \u2013 only a third of our national account business today goes through on on-site, two-thirds of it\u2019s outside the on-site. So there's a whole bunch of pieces to growth and I'm not even including in that the impact of international which is now getting to be a meaningful piece of our business, and a piece of our business that grew nicely both from a revenue and a profit perspective in the current quarter.","But if I look at it, let's say over multiyear period we can sign 200, 300 on-sites a year. And if they truly turned into a 1 million to 1.5 million revenue growers as we move forward. A piece of our business would migrate there, but more importantly, that would provide us, I believe five points of growth when we were looking at this three and four and five years out right there. On top of what vending would do and part of the vending I'm double counting, because some of the vending would to that group of customers and then what our store base would do. ","I really believe from a \u2013 just doing the math and assuming we can, we have the horsepower, because I know the markets there. The horsepower to pull it off, which I believe we have or can add, it\u2019s a business that over a multiyear perspective could grow in low double-digits. Now we need our store piece to execute well on that environment. We need our vending piece to execute well in that environment. But I believe that's achievable. If I'm wrong on the store piece and how much we can add there it would translate that from lower double-digits to an upper single-digit, but I think in either scenario its very attractive and profitable growth.","David Manthey","Right. And then earlier when you were talking about the growth in on-sites and the traction you're getting there and the factors that's coming through at a slightly lower margin, I guess in terms of the contribution margin I think you use to talk about 25% to 30% was a targeted range and when I look over the past five years and periods where you've grown 5% or greater its been about 25%, should we assume that maybe 20% to 25% is a better range given the importance of on-sites in that growth algorithm?","Daniel Florness","It plays into it, yes. And that might not be a bad way to think about it. The one perspective that you know the pathway to profit that's underlying in our business within our store network is still there and so that's store network will continue to see that tick up over time. But if we go from on-sites being 15% -- you know on-sites and customer sites that group we've talked about being mid-teens, 15% of our business and that effectively doubles over six to eight year horizon. It would take a little bit out of our incremental margin, yes.","David Manthey","Okay. All right. Thanks very much Dan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Graham","Hi, good morning, Dan.","Daniel Florness","Good morning.","Scott Graham","Just wondering in the \u2013 really the two questions are in the current environment where sales are tough to come by and shareholder value tough as a result. Is there any thought behind accelerating share repurchases in the second half of the year? And my second question relates more to the vending program with respect to Fastener side. Just hoping if you can give us a little bit more color on I think what you said was a minus five in that area for the company?","Daniel Florness","Well, the minus five with the customers that have vending, and that's really a function what their underlying activity is. And the reason I call that out is really want to talk about the market, you know, the market share gains we're seeing in that group, in that there is a world of difference between what our fasteners and our non-fasteners are doing and I look at those as two distinctly different businesses, but its really demonstrating how the growth potential of the latter. And so I'm not sure if I addressed your fasteners side question because fasteners and vending really don't go hand-in-hand, the reason I was talking about it is if the subset of our business with that group of customers that has vending, and I think it\u2019s a pretty good proxy to their underlying activity.","Scott Graham","Right. No, I did understand what you \u2013 how you were framing that for us, so I just kind of wondering why at a minus five you would consider that market share gain?","Daniel Florness","No, no, I'm talking about the \u2013 the minus five is what is, what I would consider the market with that group of customers that relates to fasteners. The market share gain would be the fact that, that group of customers is growing at close to 3% and their non-fastener business is growing at close to 6%, 5.9% to be exact, that's clearly a market share gain, because that is not a rising tide in that customer.","Scott Graham","I got you.","Daniel Florness","But we're taking market from other people.","Scott Graham","All right. Got you. Okay. And on the share repurchases, is there now stock a little weak today and have been below 45 more than it's been about recently, is that an opportunity?","Daniel Florness","Yes, it is. We have \u2013 I believe 1.3 million under our current authorization. I have not had discussions with my board about going deeper than that. However what I found in the past is it\u2019s a board willing to discuss it. And so I don't want to commit the board anything deeper than that, but it\u2019s a case of -- we had a debt free balance sheet two and half, three years ago. The debt we have on the balance sheet has solely been from buying back of shares and our in an environment where we continue to pay dividend at a very similar rate that we paid in the past.","And so we demonstrated willingness to do in the past \u2013 in the past, I believe the willingness would exist during the future and I'll couch it with one caveat. We are boringly Midwestern conservative and it took us some discussions to take on the first layer of debt that we did, but we also looked at it from a standpoint from a financial decision. I don't want to say it no-brainer, but it wasn't an easy decision. And I think I would had board that would be open to the conversation, but I've not had that conversation beyond the 1.3 authorization we have right now.","Scott Graham","Okay. And if you don't mind my squeezing one last question here. Is there any update that you can provide us for with on the store openings and closings for the rest of the year?","Daniel Florness","I would say the piece that you've seen in 2015 and 2016 as it relates to store closings. That remains. One of things that I believe its important to our business today is that everyday you rationalize your business with a view towards five to 10 years from now. It\u2019s a health exercise everyday are there markets where I believe we'll have more stores today than we -- five years from now we have to take absolutely, but there are markets where I believe in an environment we are adding on-sites where you are adding vending that our business might morph in certain markets. I'm not ready to you know commit to what that means, but it means that from an absolute number standpoint but from a philosophical perspective we are always looking at what is the best business model, what is the best structure to our channel to grow our business long term.","Scott Graham","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Merkel","Hey Dan, just want to go back to June, you mentioned construction was a bit slower and that might continue, but the fastener number was pretty weak. And I'm just curious, can you flush that out a little bit, what drove that weakness, is that temporary? And then just comment, you had a pretty weak May and June, is the industrial economy still stabilizing your mind or are things maybe potentially getting a bit worse here?","Daniel Florness","I think they potentially got a little bit worse. And sometimes that's a hard one to gauge Ryan because a lot of our internal information as it relates to some of the plant shutdowns is more anecdotal of talking to our regional VPs around the country and kind of getting from them a feel for what we are seeing or what the impact is, but very much a weakening.","In the case of the construction question you raised, the point I was making there is the fact that we saw it particularly weak with energy customers and I don't know that there is enough, I don't know if the overprice is such that there is a -- that there's going to be a rush back to any kind of new construction there, new activity there I think some will be ideal for a period of time.","In the case of fasteners, again that was very much related, that was amplified by the fact that with some large customers that were shut down and it really hit the radar. And that's what you really see when that shut down occurs it hits the OEM faster, because they are shutting down their production. They are still doing some maintenance, so you might not see it in the non-fastener, but you see it in the fastener number.","Ryan Merkel","It's strange I guess to hear about shutdown in June and then there is going to be yet more shutdowns in July, is this just the\u2026","Daniel Florness","Its different customers. And that June was a spell over the Memorial Day week.","Ryan Merkel","Got you, okay.","Daniel Florness","But it's different customers.","Ryan Merkel","Right, okay. And then I guess on the July commentary you already mentioned that you saw some weakness and shutdowns around the fourth. You know can you just help us I guess qualitatively I know you don't like to talk about the current months, but you know is it going to show up in the July numbers, do we need to consider it for modelling purposes, I guess should we think about normal sequential possibly missing that again in July?","Daniel Florness","The June had some big impacts and so from a sequential perspective I'm not willing to concede that enormous sequential won't be there. I honestly don't know Ryan.","Ryan Merkel","Right.","Daniel Florness","But I'm not -- necessarily willing to concede it because some of the shutdowns which were extended in June they are back in full force now, and so that will give us some lift from June to July and I don't even want to speculate on July fourth week.","Ryan Merkel","Okay, fair enough. I guess just lastly with on-sites do you have enough examples now that you could be pretty confident the store is going to replace the loss sales to on-site?","Daniel Florness","We don't have enough time yet.","Ryan Merkel","Okay.","Daniel Florness","We believe it to be true, history has said it's true but that history is on a relatively small sampling and but its enough that we think its -- if you think of what's really happening is we are taken existing relationship and we are stepping deeper into the business and we have proven history that says we can grow faster with that customer.","Let's say the part about the remaining stores, you have a $100,000 store that we pull a $30,000 customer out of it and it becomes a $70,000 store. I believe based on history a $70,000 store can grow faster than a $100,000 store and I believe with the market presence they already have, they will have the ability to stand back quickly. But that's to say we are completely wrong and that, that 70,000 residual store can't grow any faster.","I think what we are doing with that $30,000 customer is the right decision regardless of the aftermath, but that other 70,000 of business won't be harmed by carving that customer out, it can only be helped.","Ryan Merkel","Right. Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Adam Uhlman","Hi, good morning.","Daniel Florness","Hi, Adam.","Sheryl Lisowski","Good morning.","Adam Uhlman","Hi, I guess the first question is a clarification for Sheryl; you had gone through some of the cost drivers for the quarter between you know employee occupancy and transport. I guess, could you tell us what the year-over-year expense increase was for each of those categories just for the second quarter please?","Sheryl Lisowski","Yes I will. Year-over-year and the employee cost were up about $7 million. Occupancy year-over-year was up about $6 million, transportation expenses year-over-year were up about $1.2 million.","Adam Uhlman","Okay. Thank you. And then back to the gross margin question, you know from earlier historically that the second half has been a bit weaker than what we have seen in the second quarter and you guys have provided some good detail on the inventory write down headwinds that you have in the second quarter. I guess beyond that are there any other items that we should keep in mind as to being perhaps you know tailwind or additional headwinds through gross margin, just for the back half of the year.","Daniel Florness","Well I guess the primary tailwind would be the piece of the activity in the second quarter that I believe is largely left behind us which is about 10 basis points. Short of that it's about what we do is from an execution standpoint and what happens to our fastener business.","Adam Uhlman","Okay, got you. Thanks very much.","Daniel Florness","With that, I see we're at actually 46 minutes past the hour. Again want to thank everybody for taking time this morning to listen to the Fastenal earnings call, and for the vision and perspective portion and I think is important, we will do better. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference.

At a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to hand the meeting over to Ellen Trester, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellen Trester","Welcome to the Fastenal Company 2016 first quarter earnings conference call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Sheryl Lisowski, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, Controller, and Chief Accounting Officer. The call will last for up to 45 minutes and we\u2019ll start with a general overview of our quarterly results and operations with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers.","Today\u2019s conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal.

These statements are based on our current expectations and we undertake no duty to update them. It is important to note that the Company\u2019s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the Company\u2019s latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and we encourage you to review those factors carefully.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.","Daniel Florness","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody and thank you for joining in on the first quarter 2016 Fastenal Company earnings call. Press release went out first in this morning. Hopefully you all saw as well we put our press release yesterday evening announcing our dividend, our second quarter dividend. ","In the quarter, we grew our sales about 3.5%. We had the benefit of additional business day during the quarter. So on a daily basis, we grew about two. Our earnings per share grew just over 2%, primarily driven by the fact we had bought a considerable amount of our stock in the last 15 months, because our actual earnings were down slightly from a year ago.","Bit of a noisy quarter in that the calendar had some stuff going on. We \u2013 the daily number which is what we typically report can be influenced positively or negatively by the change in year-over-year and the number of business days in a calendar month. ","So, in January, it was a 20 day month versus 21, February we had an additional day, so it was a 21 versus a 20 and in March, we had an additional day, so it was a 23 versus the 22 and March also had Easter which had been in April in each of the last two years.","I throw these in to the equation because they can influence the number. So if you look at our numbers as reported, in January, we grew at 3.3, daily average, February grew at 2.6 and March we dropped to 0.0, so we basically had no growth in the final month of the quarter. ","If I factor in the day \u2013 the change in days, I think of the month as being, January we grew, between 2.5 and 3. February we probably grew closer to 3 and March we probably grew just under 1. If I add Easter into the equation that March number, probably as closer to a 2. ","And so, I start the call by saying very pleased with the fact in January and February, we started out with a nice improvement after really struggling through the fourth quarter and struggling through the fourth quarter in the latter nine months of 2015 is more of a statement of what our customers were enduring as their business weakened, particularly those involved in the oil and gas industry and those involved in export. ","But when I look at March, we\u2019re a little disappointed in the month. The month weakened as we got through it. Easter is part of it. The calendar is part of it, but the month did weaken a little bit and so, it was a soft finish to the quarter. If I \u2013 there is really no other noise in the numbers because the acquisition we did last fall added about eight tenth to a percent to our number and FX removed about eight tenths. So other than the calendar there wasn\u2019t lot of noise. ","Speaking of FX, really talking about our foreign business in general, one of the items that we touched on in the call centered on Canada. Canada has an economy that\u2019s very much influenced by commodities, particularly energy commodities, but commodities in general. That business for a lot of distributors had been struggling throughout 2015, ours included. ","In the fourth quarter, our business in Canada grew using local currencies to removing the FX impact and local days our business grew about 4%. I am pleased to say that business improved in the first quarter and grew about 7%. I think that is probably a good teller of the underlying strength that we are seeing in that business and our execution.","From a P&L perspective, and this is a lot of the comments that I share with our folks internally, sometimes you need to take a step back and look at what you\u2019ve been investing in and what it\u2019s translated into to help understand the puts and takes of your P&L. From 10,000 feet, the best way to think about the P&L was this, we added about $33 million in additional revenues in the first quarter of the last year to the first quarter of this year. ","As you see in our published statements and you saw this in our fourth quarter and you saw it quite frankly throughout 2015, with the growth drivers we have in place, particularly the large account emphasis within our growth drivers, the larger our customer gets typically the lower the gross margins, because in many cases you are supplying a concentrated offering into a business. ","It\u2019s a more competitive landscape, because it\u2019s a more efficient landscape to operate and so our gross margin in that business is typically lower, but again it\u2019s more efficient, so our operating expenses are lower as well. So as we\u2019ve seen great success in that business, we\u2019ve seen some trade-off in gross margin. ","Also as we went through 2015, our fastener business was particularly hit by the slowdown in the economy and so we had some product mix as well as customer mix impacts to our margin and with the weaker environment, a very competitive landscape. So we did lose gross margin on a year-over-year basis. ","Our gross margin was largely in line with the fourth quarter and that $33 million in additional revenue translated into about $7 million of additional gross profit because of the contraction in the gross margin. We talked a lot in 2014, the latter part of 2014 and 2015 about adding people to our store-base network. ","As we got later into the year, we also talked about slowing down the growth and we\u2019ve continued that discussion of slowing down the growth of people. We think we are to a point where our stores are well staffed and now we need the business to catch-up and quite frankly, get ahead of our headcount growth a bit. ","But in the last 12 months, we\u2019ve added about $5 million \u2013 excuse me, we\u2019ve added about $12 million in additional payroll expense because of all the people we\u2019ve added, because of lot \u2013 high percentage of our compensation is incentive-based. If I look at incentive compensation at the district, regional, national, local level, as well as profit-sharing type contributions, those are down on a year-over-year basis. ","And so, about $7 million of the $12 million was funded by our collective group of employees and our payroll expenses are up about $5 million in total against $7 million of additional gross profit. We also been heavily investing in vending, heavily investing in on-site, heavily investing in growth drivers and our operating expenses outside of payroll were up about $5 million. ","So total expenses are up about $10 million year-over-year and our earnings down about 3. We took on some debt in the last year, year-and-a-half to fund the buyback of stock options \u2013 or excuse me, stock. So our interest expense is about $1 million. So our earnings are down just under $4 million a year ago. ","When I look at the investments we made in people and the investments we made in growth drivers for our business, I believe they are great investments for our business short-term and long-term. ","However, we don\u2019t have the gross profit dollars in the short-term to pay for it and that\u2019s why we are holding tight on headcount as we go into the year and also why you\u2019ll notice that we softened a bit our store opening expectations for the year. Then in the last year we decided a range of 60 to 75. ","We\u2019ve pulled that down to a range of 40 to 60 while it\u2019s still a meaningful number of stores we opened. We really felt given the top \u2013 all the growth drivers we had in place, it was a wise decision to slow that down a little bit. ","Last November, we had an Investor Day. In that Investor Day, we really talked about more primary things, they centered on vending, our industrial vending deployment, talked about on-site where we set up a store inside the four walls of our customer. We talked about e-commerce, investments we\u2019re making to make it easier for our customers to interact with us and we talked about what we call CSP 2016 and that was expanding the merchandizing that we have locally in our store to improve our ability to fulfill on a same-day basis, to improve the spectrum of customers we would appeal to, frankly to improve our business. ","When I look at our progress on those, I am extremely pleased with what we\u2019ve done, not only in the fourth quarter, but what we\u2019ve done in the first quarter. From a vending perspective, we really talked about the team we were adding. So we added about 230 people to drive the optimization of our vending, to drive the signing of our vending, and to drive the efficiency of vending. ","When I look at where we are at the end of March, about 60% of our machines have now been optimized. When we talked about it last November at the Investor Day, we are at about 11. ","So we\u2019ve made great progress on that and really what it translates into is a better utilization of our vending platform within our customer business, but also a better value proposition for our customer, because we know products that goes through a vending machine lowers the consumption, lowers the waste, and lowers the expense for our customer and we think that\u2019s a winning combination in our business. ","About 80% of our store locations use the vending tab and what that is and we talked about this on our Investor Day that is a better integration of the vending within our own point-of-sale platform. It helps our store personnel be more efficient with the replenishment. It helps streamline the supply chain and we\u2019ve made great progress on that and that\u2019s going to serve us well as we go into 2016 and beyond.","As important to those two pieces, our pace of signings improved. In the first quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2015, we signed roughly 4000 vending devices. In the first quarter, that number improved, we signed about 4700. So I think we are off to a great start and that\u2019s an important growth driver to our business.","In the case of on-site, last year we signed about 82 on-sites. Our historical run rate, our pace of annual signings was about nine. So we took a big leap forward in 2015. In fall of 2015, at our Investor Day we talked about a lofty goal. We said our goal is 200 signings of on-sites in 2016. ","In the first quarter, we signed 48, frankly that number is better than I was expecting. I was very hopeful coming into the year, we\u2019d have a number that we\u2019d start with a four, because I knew that was a big step-up from the run rate we had in the latter half of 2015. Our team came through and worked with our customers and signed additional 48. Those will turn on as we go through the year. But I am very optimistic about our on-site program as we go through the balance of the year. ","E-commerce, as I mentioned is more about the ease of our customer ability to interact with us. There will be more updates on that in future meaning that\u2019s more of a \u2013 when I think of a late 2016, 2017, 2018 type of item. ","And then finally CSP 2016, we made a hard push late in the year. We\u2019ve continued that hard push. We currently have just under a 1000 locations converted to the CSP 2016 format. And I believe, when we get to the end of the second quarter, that number will be closer to 1700 or 1800 number that are substantially converted which position us well not only for the efficiency of our business, but our ability to appeal to a broader range of customers and fulfill their needs as we go into the summer.","With that, I am going to turn it over to Sheryl to talk a little bit more in detail about the quarter.","Sheryl Lisowski","Good morning. I am going to provide an update on our cash flow. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was 128% of net earnings, compared to 141% of net earnings during the first quarter of 2015. The operating cash flow is slightly lower in the first quarter of 2016 due to our current initiative to add additional products into our store inventory under our CSP 2016 format. ","The Q1 operating cash flow also benefited by minimal tax payments occurring in the first quarter, that will reverse itself in the second, third and fourth quarter of the year. Our operational working capital year-over-year inventory growth was approximately $97 million. The main drivers of the increase in the inventory were driven by the CSP 2016 initiative which was approximately 35% in the increase. ","International inventory growth and the acquisition of Fasteners Inc. contributed approximately another 25% of the increase and then the last main driver was the on-site and large customer impacts which were approximately an increase of 10%. ","We also disclosed in our earnings release that we had previously indicated our net capital expenditures would be approximately $120 million in 2016. We now believe, given the new vending locker lease agreement and a strong start to vending signings in the first quarter, that we will have total net capital expenditures of approximately $197 million to $200 million in 2016.","We do plan to fund this increase as well as add some of our previously planned capital expenditures with the proceeds of our proposed private placement of debt. ","During the first quarter of 2016, we purchased approximately 1.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $37.15 per share for a total of approximately $59 million and during the last seven quarters, we have purchased 8.7 million shares of our stock or approximately $396 million worth of stock, which represents about 3.3% of our outstanding shares from the start of this timeframe. ","As Dan mentioned earlier, last night we announced a dividend of $0.30 per share. This will be our second quarter dividend for the year. So we have strong cash flow and we are optimistic about our cash flow potential throughout the year. ","And with that, I will open it up to questions from the group.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","David Manthey ","Hi, good morning. ","Daniel Florness","Good morning, Dave.","Sheryl Lisowski","Good morning. ","David Manthey ","First of all, in terms of the new on-sites that you turned on last year, can you estimate how additive to growth these \u2013 the on-sites that we are operating in the first quarter of 2016 were?","Daniel Florness","Probably the way I think about it Dave \u2013 the numbers start getting a little bit double counting when you look at the vending and you look at the on-site. The best way to look at it is, when I think of the districts that are signing on-sites, districts that added on-site last year are growing double-digits right now. ","The districts that did not are growing low single-digits. We really look at the on-site business as being, when we go and sign on an on-site, what Christian talked about last fall, in our Investor Day was we really believe that when we exit a 12 months period after rolling out the on-site. ","We have on-sites that turned on throughout the year, so that\u2019s where the numbers start getting a little muddy. But we really believe based on our data that when we exit the 12 months period, we will add close to $80,000 to $120,000 of additional monthly revenue on a per on-site basis.","David Manthey ","Got it. Okay, and then second on pricing and gross margin, you mentioned that fastener pricing being lower, if you could quantify that and then if you saw anything in across the other 60% plus of your product lines and as it relates to gross margin and there is some timing issues with the FIFO inventory and so forth, but typically, first quarter gross margin is the highest of the year and then it declines from there or it\u2019s lower through the rest of the year. Is that your expectation for this year or are there other factors in 2016?","Daniel Florness","Our expectations, given where our growth is coming from is that, 50% is probably a good target number for us to have. There is \u2013 when I look at the components of our gross margins, couple of things that were going on in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter, it was in the declining mode as we were going through the fourth quarter, quite frankly declining mode throughout 2015. ","We really saw the stabilization start to occur in the February, March timeframe from a standpoint what was going on with gross margin. So, I were to believe when I look out through the balance of the year, 50% is probably a better target. ","When I look out long-term, it\u2019s really going to be a function more of how successful we are with the on-site program. So that will materially change longer-term our customer mix, but it\u2019s very attractive an ability to grow the business long-term and the operating leverage long-term.","David Manthey ","And on the pricing, Dan, the fact that price\u2026","Daniel Florness","Sorry, yes, what we were seeing through most of last year is deflation somewhere in that 1.5% to 2% neighborhood. We are still operating in that zone. As far as the cost coming through, we are starting to see some lower cost now. Our overall inventory turns about twice a year. ","The fastener piece of our inventory turns slower than that. The non-fastener piece turns faster than that and so some of the lower cost we are starting to see come through our cost of goods now. As it relates to the non-fastener product, I would say that area is pretty quiet. Any changes we have in pricing there would be solely related to customer mix and not to what\u2019s going on in the underlying product. ","David Manthey ","Got it. Thanks. Dan.","Daniel Florness","You bet, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is open. ","Robert McCarthy ","Hi, good morning, Dan. How are you doing today?","Daniel Florness","Good, good morning, Rob. ","Robert McCarthy ","So, I guess, in terms of April, I mean, I think you did take some pay-ins to kind of talk about the noise of the quarter in terms of not only the days of the Easter shift, but how should we think without commenting on April in terms of the demand trends because you haven\u2019t disclosed it yet. Just, how do we think about the impact of the normalization for Easter? Would we think about a point benefit for April, or how do we think about in terms of the days in the Easter shifts?","Daniel Florness","That\u2019s how I think about it. When I \u2013 if you walk through the math, I walk through on the March, so hey, here is the ugly part of Easter moving. I think it took a point, maybe a point two out of March, you should see the flip side of that going in April.","Robert McCarthy ","Okay. And, why don\u2019t you remind us on what the days is in April, year-over-year, in terms of the difference?","Daniel Florness","In the second quarter, Sheryl, you can correct me if I am wrong, in April, we are at 21 versus 22 a year ago.","Sheryl Lisowski","That\u2019s correct.","Daniel Florness","May, we are at 21 versus 20 a year ago and June it\u2019s a push at 22. ","Robert McCarthy ","Got it. Okay, and then, I guess, as a follow-up, in terms of what you are seeing in terms of industrial vending growth, are you still kind of committed kind of to that kind of 16,000 in deployments for the full year and I think you saw in your \u2013 your highlight is interesting statistic in association with your vending which was basically, your daily sales to customers to industrial vending grew about, 3.6 in the first quarter of 2016 and then daily sales of non-fastener products to customers of vending grew 7.4% but daily sales of fasteners to customers of vending contracted 5.5%. ","So, I guess the question is, obviously, a lot of your business goes whether vending, it\u2019s not fasteners, but what do you account for that kind of contraction? And I am referring to, I think the final paragraph on the second page of the press release. ","Daniel Florness","Yes, yes. When I think of vending, your data on with your comment or your question and comment about, vending is really about our non-fastener business. Vending really isn\u2019t used for dispensing of fasteners, now there is some extension of vending that over time are how our beanstalk for things like that will include \u2013 will incorporate essentially some of the vending type technology for replenishment cycle. ","But vending is about non-fasteners and so, we\u2019ve done a great job deploying vending to our existing customers over the last five years. And the fastener piece is about their economic activity and our ability to take market share. And I think the story, when I look at the fastener piece is about the economic activity. ","The non-fastener piece is about the activity and our ability to grow and deploy vending. So we can have a customer whose business in the fastener piece is down because we have a great market penetration already in their business off. But we can grow the non-fastener piece because of vending, because we are deploying a better supply chain to our customer, because when I think about our deal with our customer. ","And what our customer truly needs is, put yourself in the shoes of the purchasing manager, the plant manager. They live in a world where there is constant demands on them for improvement. They are working with fewer resources everyday. So what they need from their supplier isn\u2019t just great fulfillment. I think that\u2019s a starting point. ","They need a better supply chain partner and in the case of vending and in the case of beanstalk and in the case of our on-site model, we are a better supply chain partner and we highlight this point because it demonstrates that even in a weak economy, we can grow our business, because we are a better supply chain partner for our customer.","Robert McCarthy ","Thanks for your time. ","Daniel Florness","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. ","Adam Uhlman ","Hi, good morning. Thank you. ","Sheryl Lisowski","Good morning.","Adam Uhlman ","I guess, if we go just back and talk about the cash flow outlook to the year, it seems like we have been growing demands on cash from the CSP 2016 rollout, additional stores are added, the vending growth kind of unfolds through the year. Can you help me understand better I guess, how much debt do you expect to take on to fund these growth investments and at what point do you start to pull back on the other CapEx projects?","Daniel Florness","Well, I\u2019ll answer the last part and Sheryl can answer the numbers part, but as far as pulling back on the other projects, I don\u2019t really, the biggest thing that we \u2013 the only thing that we\u2019ve pulled back on kind of just is, we slowed down a bit the pace of store openings. ","But other net, I don\u2019t really see us pulling back on the initiatives that we\u2019ll have in place, as we talked about in 2015, a lot of the big, big initiatives we had from a CapEx standpoint are in our rear, I am talking about automation of our distribution of centers and the initial build of growing of vending \u2013 of creating and growing our vending business. So I don\u2019t see a lot of other pullback, but Sheryl you can touch on the exact numbers. ","Sheryl Lisowski","Sure. So we are still \u2013 as we are projecting our cash flow for the year, we feel very confident that operating cash flow will continue to exceed historical percentages of net earnings. ","Our total CapEx, it will be a little bit higher than the historical percentage of net earnings due to the increase in our vending spend for the year and our free cash flow will continue to fall within the historical percentage of net earnings throughout the year. So we are still very confident that we have adequate cash flow to continue to support our initiatives throughout the year. ","Adam Uhlman ","Okay, thanks. And then, Sheryl, could I just follow-up on the bad debt expense for the quarter, could you talk through what you guys are seeing there and the expectations going forward?","Sheryl Lisowski","Yes, we continue to see our bad debt expense trends to historical norms. We are not seeing a significant increase in bankruptcies or anything that causes us creates alarm or concern. Pretty quiet I guess quarter from that perspective and so, really no surprises from our end. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Cieslak with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ryan Cieslak ","Hi, good morning. ","Daniel Florness","Good morning.","Sheryl Lisowski","Good morning.","Ryan Cieslak ","Dan, sorry, if I missed this, but, do you have sort of an initial view of how April is trending for you right now? I know it\u2019s early or in two weeks in, maybe excluding the benefit you might get from how Easter fell in the extra day or so in the quarter. Is it gotten any better from \u2013 I think I heard you right, you said the quarter ended off soft. I guess, I would be curious to know just the sequential trend so far into April?","Daniel Florness","Yes, whenever I touch on the current month, I am always wrong and the question is how much. I don\u2019t know that was basically a weekend to the month that we had some chance to look at the data, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s meaningful not even talk and tell something about it, so I am going to defer that and tell early May when we report it. ","Ryan Cieslak ","Okay, fair enough. And then, I think last quarter, you had talked about discretionary spending being down and a headwind and in the release today, you mentioned a slight improvement. I would be curious maybe just some more color around that how the discretionary spending looked in the first quarter relative to maybe a normal first quarter or your expectations coming out of the fourth quarter? And how much of a drag on gross margins was that this quarter relative to the fourth quarter? ","Daniel Florness","Sure. The commentary on that, both in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter is as much art as it is science and the team that analyzes all of our sales data slices and dices it about 18 ways to Sunday and one of the things that John taught for them was they looked at frequency of items and stuff that\u2019s purchased in a less frequent basis, how that was performing in the fourth quarter and we did see a drop-off in that. ","We saw some of that comeback as we got into February, didn\u2019t see much of it in January and \u2013 but I\u2019d say it\u2019s still kind of tepid. I think there is a lot of organizations out there, similar to comments I started the conversation with about what we are doing with headcount, what we are doing with expenses in general, what we are doing with store openings. A lot of organizations out there have their belts really tightened down and I think you are seeing that coming into the New Year holding pretty firm. ","Ryan Cieslak ","And is there a way of things\u2026.","Daniel Florness","To quantify it, this is from the hip number but, I don\u2019t know, 10 basis points. ","Ryan Cieslak ","Okay. ","Daniel Florness","But that\u2019s more of a guess. ","Ryan Cieslak ","Gotcha. Now, that\u2019s helpful. And then, as really quick as if I may, I\u2019d just be curious to know, at the Investor Day, you had talked about, maybe a greater appetite for M&A this year in \u2013 maybe just sort of an update on what you are seeing there with regard to maybe some M&A opportunities for you guys in 2016?","Daniel Florness","Sure. Well, late in 2014, we started to take \u2013 probably a more serious look rather than stumbling upon the stuff periodically let\u2019s take a little more serious look at it. We looked at a bunch of companies last year, one of them that we met early in the year in April, be exact, that we ended up acquiring later in the year. There is a few companies we are in discussions with right now. ","And we are constantly looking both on the distribution side as well as some of the support service side that might be a manufacturing entity or some other type of support service for our stores. Only time will tell how that plays out. I think the biggest thing is that we are open to it and we are actively looking rather than just seeing what, jumps up and hits us. But nothing in the works. ","Ryan Cieslak ","Okay, thanks for the time. ","Daniel Florness","You bet. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel. Your line is open, with William & Blair.","Ryan Merkel ","Hey guys. Good morning. ","Daniel Florness","Good morning, Ryan.","Sheryl Lisowski","Good morning.","Ryan Merkel ","So, back to March, Dan, is there anything that stood out to drive the softer finish either by customer or geography?","Daniel Florness","You know, geography, only thing that stood out there is that we did continue to see weakening deeper than we probably would have expected or maybe better way to say hope for when we are looking at it back in the latter part of 2015, but the oil and gas areas did continue to weaken when I look at it on a sequential basis and time will tell if some of the recent pricing influence is that positive in the upcoming months, but it continue to weaken. ","But setting that aside, the month finished very poorly with five days, six days, seven days, eight days, less than a month, I felt we\u2019d be closer to 2% and the month really deteriorated late. And that\u2019s probably a function \u2013 that\u2019s probably described some things that we saw in the patterns of our larger account base, because they tend to be somewhat loaded little bit towards the back end of the month. But, frankly a weak finish.","Ryan Merkel ","Okay. And I mean, should this frame our thinking at all, as we think about April or would you just have us adjust March for Easter and then just you saw a normal sequential, is that sort of the best way to think about April at this point? ","Daniel Florness","That\u2019s how I am thinking about it.","Ryan Merkel ","Okay. And then, on the macro, in the press release, you said you are seeing some improvement but an economy that is still very weak. Where are seeing the improvements? And then, when you talk to customers, are they optimistic that we found a bottom for industrial demand or is that still real optimistic at this point? ","Daniel Florness","You know, on the latter part, I don\u2019t know. One thing that I will have the benefit of, this week is our National Customer Show and so we\u2019ll have little over 5000 customers over a three day period in meeting with suppliers, meeting with our employees, meeting with our on-site folks, all of our teams, our vending folks, et cetera. ","So, I\u2019ll be at more of a chance to get a pulse on that this week, this afternoon I am leaving to that show myself. But when I think of what are some of the positives, in the fourth quarter that was probably a bleak a period is you could see and I was not hesitant to share my thoughts on it during the fourth quarter, but our fasteners as an example were down about 6% in the fourth quarter. ","In the first quarter, they are down around two. Our non-fasteners were struggling in the fourth quarter and I don\u2019t have the exact stat in front of me, I am sorry. But, they improved to mid-single-digits, upper single-digits in the first quarter. And so, we saw generally speaking an improvement in our business and that\u2019s I think what we are really talking about. ","I think what we see is, the business in January, February and I can\u2019t quite say that for March, but in January, February, felt more like where we were in October and I think if I look at the last five or six months, I really think the outliers was the extreme weakness we saw in November and December and I think that was a function of companies that\u2019s shutting down around the holidays more extensively than normal. March, only April and May will start to answer for us what really happened in March. ","Ryan Merkel ","Right, very good. Okay. Thank you.","Daniel Florness","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Robert Barry ","Hey guys, good morning. ","Daniel Florness","Good morning, Rob.","Sheryl Lisowski","Good morning.","Robert Barry ","Wanted to circle back to the gross margin. So the pace of decline last year, 40, 50 basis points a quarter, now we\u2019re looking at down 100. Just curious what drove that kind of step change in the pace of decline?","Daniel Florness","You mean, down 10 on a sequential, when you talk about pace?","Robert Barry ","On a year-over-year basis?","Daniel Florness","Yes.","Robert Barry ","Like we\u2019ve been tracking down 40, 50 and now we are down 100.","Daniel Florness","Yes, you know, there is a number of things. One, our growth is primarily coming from large accounts and that deepened as we went through the year. It\u2019s primarily coming from \u2013 if I think of our sales number in the weakness, when you \u2013 we\u2019ve done a nice job of signing new customers both on-sites and traditional national account customers that aren\u2019t on-site. ","When you are doing a nice job taking market share, you are turning on a lot of new business and that\u2019s \u2013 lot of times when you are turning on a lot of new business, you do get some short-term mix issues going on in that you \u2013 a new large customer isn\u2019t at average margins for that group on day one, because it takes you time, six, nine, and 12 months to work through some of the hiccups in the system of finding the best source of supply, finding the best part match for this item when you are turning on new business and typically you have your existing business that is supporting that, because that existing business, you\u2019ve done a better job of improving your supply chain already. ","If you think of what\u2019s really hurting us right now is from a revenue and revenue growth perspective, we are doing a wonderful job signing new national accounts. We are doing a wonderful job signing on-sites. We are doing a wonderful job signing vending and growing those pieces of business. So we are taking market share at a very good cliff. What\u2019s causing us the struggle is our existing book of business, our existing customers are struggling in a weak environment. And so, the more mature component of our business is going backwards. ","And that more mature piece has a better gross margin profile, because if I\u2019ve had a customer \u2013 excuse \u2013 for two or three years, I have already in many cases established a best part, so lot of the best source of supply to serve that customers\u2019 needs and that\u2019s in my mix and that mix has weakened right now. ","So that\u2019s a piece of it. The other piece of it is, on an execution standpoint, we slipped a little bit as we went through 2015, we slipped a little bit on the freight, how good we are on our freight expense versus our freight that we charge a customer. Part of that I think it became more difficult for our stores operates effectively given that fuel prices were lower. ","Fuel price is an important part of our distribution cost, but it\u2019s not the only component, but it might make it harder for you to charge freight on this item or that. And the fact that it\u2019s a weak environment, it\u2019s a competitive marketplace. I feel we are at a point where our gross margins are stable from a sequential standpoint. But that\u2019s still has been a painful process on a year-over-year basis. There is no question about that. ","Robert Barry ","Yes, actually, I did want to just follow-up and clarify that. So it\u2019s your expectation that you can hold the gross margins stable here now at about 50?","Daniel Florness","Yes.","Robert Barry ","As we look in the next few quarters?","Daniel Florness","Yes.","Robert Barry ","And I guess, my questions would be, what\u2019s changing as we move forward because the pace of decline seems to be accelerating as you say on-sites gaining traction, national accounts gaining traction, the product and customer mix issues have been there, they\u2019ll probably continue to be there. So what\u2019s going to, kind of diminish the pace of decline in the gross margin? What are the offsets?","Daniel Florness","I think the biggest one is, well, I think the biggest one is, the offset we\u2019ve had in the last 12 months, you had dramatic weakening of our existing customer base and that\u2019s hurt our gross margin because that business where we have a very, very established efficient source of supply and so that\u2019s put a pinch on that.","Robert Barry ","Yes. ","Daniel Florness","I believe the pace of that deterioration is slowing and I think that shines through in what you are seeing what\u2019s happening in our fastener business, in our non-fastener business from a growth perspective. So I think that\u2019s the wildcard.","Robert Barry ","Yes. Just to clarify, Dan, at this point, because I think there is some confusion out there, what product lines at this point are accretive to the gross margins? Is it just the maintenance fasteners, or is it all fasteners? Or how would you describe that?","Daniel Florness","I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably, it probably leans towards the maintenance as well as the construction fasteners in many cases.","Robert Barry ","Yes. I think you said the maintenance was 40% of the business. How much of the business - of the fastener business is the construction base? ","Daniel Florness","That\u2019s a relatively small piece.","Robert Barry ","Yes. Okay.","Daniel Florness","I don\u2019t have the exact stat front of me, but relatively small, single-digits.","Robert Barry ","Got you, fair enough. Thank you, Dan. ","Daniel Florness","Thank you. With that, I see we are at 9:44. Hopefully there wasn't anybody else in queue that didn't get to ask a question. I'll finish the call the same way I started the call. Thank you for taking time this morning to listen to our first quarter earnings call. I hope you find our earnings release today as well as our 10-Q which I believe will be out later in the week to be informative of helping to understand the Fastenal story.

At a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to hand the meeting over to Ellen Trester, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellen Trester","Welcome to the Fastenal Company 2015 annual and fourth quarter earnings conference call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer. The call will last for up to 45 minutes. It will start with a general overview of our quarterly results and operations, with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers.","Today\u2019s conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal.

As the year progressed and as we reported our various quarters, we touched on how that was playing out and I think the best way to look at 2015 is to look at a subset of customers where we have a substantial market share presence with and that's our top 100 customers.","That group represents about 24% of our revenues and it isn\u2019t about that group, what's going on in that group? It's about what's going on there relative to what we've seen in the past. If I look at that top 100 group of customers and look at it over the last four years, history says at any given point in time, 75% -- 75 of those 100 customers should be growing.","And the reason that number is high as it is, is because of the growth drivers that Fastenal has at its disposal between our store operation, our vending operation and all the other things we can bring to our customer's table.","In the first quarter of this year, 72 of our top 100 customers grew. In the second quarter, that dropped to 63. In the third quarter that dropped to 56. In the fourth quarter, that dropped to 49. So in the fourth quarter, half of our top 100 customers grew and half contracted.","In the month of December to amplify that a little bit, 41 of our top 100 customers grew and 59 contracted.","The next thing I looked at is try to gauge of the customers that are contracting, how severe is their pain. And history says, of the 25 that are contracting, about half of that number, about 13 will contract more than 10%. And about half of that number again, about six are going to contract more in 25%.","And with that last group that's really a sign of the severity of their pain and what\u2019s going in their industry. We sell across the continent around the planet, most of our business is in North America and we sell to a lot of different industries. And when you start looking through the list, of lot of names that you recognize standout and you can see the pain they are feeling in their business.","In the first quarter that 13 that are down more than 10 and the six that are down more than 25, look like our numbers, we have 13 and three and have bucket. By the third quarter that had slid to 32 of our customers that were down, were down more than 10% and 17% of those were down more than 25.","After looking at that debt in the third quarter on our third quarter call in October, when Will and I went through our commentary on the quarter, you get question of wisdom of the statement but I made the statement that the industrial economy is in recession and I used this as my reference point.","Again you could question the wisdom of saying of it loud but in the fourth quarter 37 of our top 100 customers were down more than 10%. 22 of that group were down more than 25%. There is one customer in that group where we didn't lose some business because of acquisitions other than that, this has pained those customers are feeling as they progress through calendar 2015.","In the month of December -- November and December I noted in earning release, we saw some shutdowns of our customers. We really saw that in the month of December.","In the month of December, the Monday before Christmas looking at the numbers and consulting with a few of our folks internally about what they were seeing in the trends. And trends looked a lot like 2014 in that, the Monday before Christmas, I felt we had a very good chance of having sales being flat December to December.","And in the ensuing days, the balance of that week and then the week between Christmas and New Year quickly saw that erode as customers were falling off in their business activity and we produced a number we reported this morning.","The start of January and again you could question the wisdom of making this commentary with -- as of yesterday, our month of January is trending, it looks like there is a potential for us to be positive in the month of January.","A lot can change between now and the end of the month as we saw in the month of December. We don't have holidays but we do have weather. But as of the 14th, we are trending in a pattern it looks like we should be able to tread water, it would be slightly positive and time will tell how that plays out.","The next item probably I\u2019ll note in the earnings release is our gross margin. Long term trends that we talked about on previous calls that we talked about on our Investor Day in over November aren't changed.","One thing we did see in the quarter and I was most -- in November and December, as our customers were tightening their belts, we saw a layer of transactions just evaporate from our business. And the layer transactions -- if you look at our business, they are stuff that we sell every day.","Vending is a perfect example of -- examples of products we sell every day through our store operations, through our regular sales channel, through our bin stocking and our OEM stocking, those products that we sell every week and every month.","There is also a subset of products that we sell on a less frequent basis. Some of those out of our stores, some of those over distribution centers. A piece of that -- a layer of that transaction disappeared and that's higher margin business for us and our gross margin drop was largely attributed to that disappearing.","That's the bad news, the good news I believe we did not see a structural change in our gross margin. Time will tell if that layer returns and how much it returns. I am hopeful and expecting that it'll largely will.","On the expense side, this is -- I officially became CEO on January 1 of this year and from a practical standpoint after the Board informed me of the decision, mean I\u2019ll stepping in the role in mid-October. Will and I take in a bit but this quarter was largely under my watch and I think from an expense standpoint, we frankly did a mediocre job and I put that squarely on my shoulders.","Full time and part time expense trends and I am looking at -- our biggest expense on the P&L after cost of goods is people. We have just over 20,000 employees with fourth quarter and the seasonality of our business this is not secret to anybody who owns our stock and it\u2019s not secret to anybody who works at Fastenal.","In 2014, if I look at our expense trends for full time headcount from Q3 to Q4, we managed it well. There is always some attrition in the business. We try not to replace that attrition in the fourth quarter. And in the fourth quarter of last year our full time dollars paid, and this is base pay only, dropped about 0.3%.","Our part time, we can manage hours quite well and as we typically go into the post Thanksgiving season, we see our expenses falling off because there is less work to do and therefore we need fewer hours. In last year from Q3 to Q4, our expense dropped about 13.5% for our part time labor. In total, our expense was down about 2.5% -- 2.4% to be exact.","In 2015, full time headcount crept up little bit to \u2013 increased about 3.5%, our part time dropped about 4.5%. I'm throwing a lot of percentages out here and it's not about the percentages and quite frankly it's not even about the expense itself. It's about managing the business through the seasonality of the year and we could have done a better job.","In total, our labor costs were down from Q3 to Q4 but that's really more of a functional - when we don\u2019t do a good job, the leaders of our business after district, the region and to national levels as well as our supported years feel the impact of that in their bonus program.","Our bonus programs are largely mechanically produce number and so our overall expenses were down despite the fact we didn\u2019t manage the expense well but they could have been done more.","The message I have conveyed to our regional and national leadership is, right now we are in uncertain economy. We made substantial investments in calendar 2015. We added about 1700 people into our stores. We added about 2300 people into our organization in general. We are well staffed.","To that end, I would expect our headcount to not grow between now and March 31. As we see some stabilization -- just assuming we see some stabilization and we believe there is reason for that - believe to be there. As we see stabilization we\u2019ll revisit our willingness to make investments in both store and support areas as we\u2019re going to the New Year.","If I look at the rest of our SG&A expense, we did a nice job on the occupancy side. The increase in that area was solely related to vending. As I have talked about in the past, I see that as a good -- a good expense increase because we know vending what touches our business, improves our interaction, our interface, our engagement with our customer and improves our growth.","For those of you that -- I\u2019m approaching this conference call in the vein of, I've stepped out my CFO role, and I\u2019m stepping into the CEO role. So I\u2019m trying to avoid the weeds as much as possible probably got into a bit with the last few set numbers, some things try to change habits.","I will point out one thing, if you look at expense trends, our history as said from Q4 to Q1, we are going into winter and the last week here in Minnesota it's been sub zero, so winter is definitely here.","I typically expect to see our utilities increased about 2.3 million from Q4 to Q1 and that's solely related to heating locations that I throw it out there for those of you that find net of interest.","We also have an item that we highlighted or several items we highlighted in the positives and negatives of our earnings release. We made the decision -- and we'd been venting this around for a number of months -- a number of quarters.","But we made the decision to close down our joint venture manufacturing facility or to accept participating in our joint venture manufacturing facility in Brazil. We had several other disputes unrelated to that that we also resolved during the quarter.","The tally of all those items was about $4 million impact to the quarter. I thought it was worth the permit.","Finally let\u2019s talk about 2016 and some of the things we've told you to prepare for 2016. At our Investor Day in early November, we had a great participation for those of you that made it. Thank you for attending. For those of you that had the opportunity to listen to it, I hope you found it informative.","We've really focused on four day -- four items that day. The one was our FAST Solutions our Industrial Vending Program. That's not new to anybody that we\u2019ve grow that business wonderfully over the last five years.","We\u2019re very excited about that business and when I look at that business today, about 45% of our districts in the company have more than 200 machines in their business scattered across 10, 11, 12 stores.","We made the decision that at this stage in our -- in our Fastenal vending business, we wanted to place more dedicated resource within our districts to support that business and really challenged them in a two-prong attack.","The first one was what we called optimizing of our machines and that\u2019s really looking at the data across these 200 machines, 300 machines, 100 machines stay on the district that you\u2019re looking at. Looking at those machines and optimizing the machines.","The method is really quite simple when you think about our Helix machines and most of the machines our there are Helix and that is if we want a machine to do pick a number $1500 a month and every time a coil spins on average it drops $5 worth of product. That means in the course of a month, we need to spin a coil 300 times in that machine.","20 days in the month, 15 times a day a coil needs to spin and we need to look at the product that's in that machine and says can we get 15 spins a day? If we can, we know we have a home run. If we can't, we need to work to optimize the machine and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now.","When we spoke to you in early November about 11% of our machines across the company had been optimized already, as of the end of December that number is up to 18% and the team that is driving that clearly it's everybody in the organization.","It\u2019s the focus in the stores. It\u2019s our district managers. It\u2019s our regional leaders. Its focus involved in our vending program, but the actual dedicated team, we started the quarter with about 60 individuals. We added just over 130. So we have about 191.","Our goal is to get to about 230 people to support our 260 district managers in North America. And the way we pay for that group is through optimization and we\u2019re 18% all the way complete, but we have ways to go.","After they get back to these, their next prong of attack will be helping to grow our signings, helping to grow that business. It\u2019s a wonderful business. It\u2019s a business when you truly inform your customer what it's about, it sells itself.","The second half that we talked about is related to vending in our November Investor Day centered on the use of what we call our vending tab and that\u2019s really about the efficiencies behind the scene.","While 13% of our stores we're using the vending tab and it's really how we replenish the machines and how automated that process becomes. As of the end of December we\u2019re at 29% of our stores and now using the vending tab.","The second item we talked about was a relatively new concept for us to talk openly about externally and that was our onsite program. History has said we\u2019ll add about nine a year.","It\u2019s a program where we take a store and we essentially set up a store onsite inside the customer\u2019s facility and it takes an engagement one step further even deeper than vending does. It changes the relationship with the customer.","In the current year, we signed 82 onsites. Again our average was 9. Those 82 onsites came from 71 districts in the company. So it means presumably 10 people signed too.","Those districts grew double digits and it\u2019s so in 2015 the company grew 3.5% roughly for the year. The 71 districts on it if you average the group out, grew double digits in 2015 because they had a means to combat what the economy was doing to them. They grew their business. They took market share at even faster pace.","Our goal as we enter 2015 -- 2016, excuse me, is to do 200. In the first -- as of -- through Wednesday of this week, we\u2019ve signed five this month and if you\u2019d take that to the month, it would imply a run rate of about 12 or 13 for the month.","If you take that times 12, it would imply a number just under 150. We have little ways to go, but I think we\u2019re off to a good start and I\u2019m optimistic what this means for 2016, but as importantly for '17, '18, '19 and '20.","This customer -- a specific business if I take our onsites, add to it what we call our strategic account stores, which is an onsite that\u2019s just down the street or near the customer, but not physically in the building, if you add this altogether, it\u2019s about 16% of our business today.","I\u2019m very optimistic about what this can be in the future because with our low cost model, we're uniquely designed as a business to go after it.","The third item we touched on in November was eCommerce, our 2016 plans centered on our website roll out for Canada and then ultimately the U.S. That\u2019s not really a 2016 story. That\u2019s more of a 2017 story, but we wanted to provide an update on things that are in the works as it relates to the eCommerce strategy.","And finally we talked about CSV 2016. That is a remerchandising of our stores. We converted about 800 stores to this format in the fourth quarter. We intend to do a similar number in the first. And really it\u2019s about positioning our store locations to be even better equipped at same day service, at efficient replenishment for our customers and we\u2019re excited about what that means for our future.","With that, I will open it up to Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel from William Blair.","Ryan Merkel","Hey good morning. Dan, how are you?","Dan Florness","Good. Thanks.","Ryan Merkel","So starting with demand, I think you said there is reason to expect stabilization and I\u2019m wondering what signs are you seeing or is it just early January trend that makes you think we could see some stabilization?","Dan Florness","My comment Ryan is solely on the early January trends and what we were seeing in December before we saw the business just dial down.","Ryan Merkel","And that was kind of the first two weeks of December were tracking fairly good and it was really just the last two weeks that may have been impacted by the shutdowns and just the tighter spending by customers, which could be a transitory issue. Is that the summary?","Dan Florness","Yes, and time will tell if I\u2019m seeing that number -- seeing that in the data because I want to or if it\u2019s truly there, but with 10 days left in the month, our trends were looking a lot like last year.","Ryan Merkel","Right. Well then my second question is in the press release you mentioned 2015 started slow because of oil and gas, but then as the year progressed, it spread into other industries and other geographies that aren\u2019t typically driven by oil and gas.","So can you expand on this a bit? Has this broadening of the weakness may be stopped at this point based on everything you\u2019re seeing and hearing?","Dan Florness","The broadening related to everything from other industries that you don\u2019t normally associate with oil and gas that are impacted in other parts of the country, companies that are involved in export, just companies that are involved in really a weak industrial economy.","I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve seen the contingent change. One thing I have always said over the years is the history in this business, for Fastenal's business that is, the trends from January to October, the trends that really matter, November and December are months you go through, but history has said they're never really indicative of anything.","We saw some patterns in November and December. I thought they were worth noting, but I don\u2019t think there is anything that we\u2019ve learned in the last two months that tell us if it\u2019s spreading, if it\u2019s stabilized, other than what we saw with 10 days left in December and what we\u2019re seeing in the first eight days or so of January.","And again, I throw that out there only because when there is more uncertainty, I do believe and I\u2019ve always believed this that we have an obligation to maybe share a little more insight.","And so we\u2019re trying to share as much as we can, but always mindful of the fact that the month can change on a dime. One of the reasons we had never talked about January, in the January call, or we've done it very infrequently is that we\u2019re always wrong. The question is how much, but I can\u2019t say that we know anything about the contagion.","Ryan Merkel","Yeah, I think it\u2019s fair in the past extrapolating December hasn\u2019t been the right move. That month is goofy. So I think that that's fair.","I guess just lastly, you think initiatives that you announced at the Investor Day could add maybe three to six points of sales growth in 2016. So I am wondering do we see that right away in January or is that build as we go through the year?","Dan Florness","Well I think that builds. If you think about it, in that discussion we talked about the concept of what 200 new onsites mean? And you really can count them half because if they're turning on throughout the year because the 82 onsites that we signed last year, not all those are operational yet.","We have I believe 58 of the 82 are operational as of December because someone just signed in November and December and like a vending machine you sign it November, it might take you 60 days, 90 days to turn it on.","It's about -- to me, it's about momentum, but as far as what it means for the year my belief of these growth drivers and what they mean for calendar 2016 is completely unchanged from what I believed in November.","Lot of what I believe is -- I am a very practical person and what I believe is based on what I see in fact and what I see in fact is a tremendous advantage we have in the pieces we talked about in November, whether it be vending or onsite.","Fastenal is uniquely situated, to go after those businesses unlike any other company out there because one of the things that I always tell our folks internally and I try to remember myself is I am world where everybody is talking about building the last mile in this online world, we're a company that's built the last mile already.","It's a very efficient last mile and how can we take that last mile, take our employees at the store, take our employees that are supporting the store and together growth a great business and that's what we focus on.","Ryan Merkel","Right. Very helpful. Thank you.","Dan Florness","And Ryan I am going to look, I am going to keep you from working in a fourth one there.","Ryan Merkel","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry from Susquehanna.","Robert Barry","Hey Dan, good morning.","Dan Florness","Good morning.","Robert Barry","Just a quick follow-up actually on that and I really don't want to dwell on the first two weeks of January, but in assessing how to read it, there is a 500 basis point easier comp and one less selling day.","So how does that factor into how we should interpret what you're seeing in January?","Dan Florness","The one less selling day helps our number. Maybe I don't know, 0.5%. I don't know, when we consider a month, you could probably look at and say yes, we were helped slightly from a daily basis by the fact that we have one less day.","Robert Barry","Yeah, what was your commentary about daily sales or\u2026","Dan Florness","My commentary was about daily sales. So maybe that means, if I am looking at it right now and thinking we'll be nominally positive, maybe that means we're flat. If you ignored out the day, but I guess the point wasn\u2019t about getting lost and it is a 40 basis point of growth or 40 basis points contraction.","It was really about right trend we're seeing and again January and February in the northern half of the country, weather can change things dramatically, but I was trying to give a pulse on what we're seeing right now.","Robert Barry","Yeah, appreciate it. I think what I really wanted to focus was just on the gross margin commentary in the release you mentioned that substantially I think was the word all the year-over-year decline was on this lower discretionary spend.","And you also in that paragraph talked about pressures from lower rebates and mix and deflation if it's all from lower discretionary spend, it doesn\u2019t seem to leave much room for those other factors.","So I am curious like what the commentary is really kind of on gross margin and especially going forward, is there any reason to think that the trend will change in '16 versus what we saw in '15?","Dan Florness","Yeah, two hours ago, I had a call with our regional leaders to talk about what we're seeing and some things that we need to do on the gross margin front.","And our team that really challenges our gross margin and finds opportunities for us to improve it had a lengthy discussion with them over the last two weeks and I said, you know what? What really happened? Did our gross margin structurally change or is there more to it because the usual suspects are still there.","There is always a nominal impact in the fourth quarter based on what's going on with our rebates? What's going on with utilization of our trucking network? The same trucks are running in November and December that are running in October and September, but they're carrying fewer packages.","So you always have some leakage there in our gross margin and depending on the year, if it's a strong year, you get a little lift form some of your suppliers allowances. Some years you get a little drag.","So those are your suspects. The wild card in it is there were a layer of transactions that just disappeared and they disappeared. We saw them disappear in both November and December and that was shining through in our gross margin and that really was the cause of our gross margin change.","I honestly don't know if that layer comes back in January and February. I don't know if the belts are really tight and start to come back for a few months or this is stuff that was needed and people were towards the end of their fiscal year and they just turned it off [the figures] [ph] and they just closed their PO books and they didn't buy anything.","History -- I am firm believer that trends have meaning and if history says these transactions are there because the business needs them over time, I believe they\u2019ll return and I don't believe it's structural, but only time will tell.","Robert Barry","Yes, but does that mean the impact from deflation and mix and rebates was absent in the quarter?","Dan Florness","No, it means that most of the impact came from this piece. Not all of it. Most of the impact.","Robert Barry","Yeah. Okay. So it would imply that if it does rebound this discretionary spend that your best guess now is that the gross margin in '16 would be, I don't know, flattish or modestly down? Is that kind of your take?","Dan Florness","Well, my commentary really is centered on here is what we were in Q3, here is what we are in Q4 and here is the piece -- here is some of leakage, here is where it came from. I believe these transactions come back again.","Nobody knows right now, but I believe they\u2019ll come back because I think businesses need these products, but we will be working to crawl back our gross margin every month of the year on the leakage we're seeing through the year.","The long term trends are still there that we talked about. On the positive side, our ability to continue improving our trucking network, its utilization, this is over time. Our ability to drive our exclusive brands to channel spend with preferred suppliers, those positives are always there.","The drag that comes if onsite truly takes off the way I believe it can over the next five, six, seven years, that's going to lower our gross margin over time, but it's also going to lower our operating expense over time because we like the onsite business, but in the short term, I believe this business resumes and returns.","Robert Barry","Dan, thank you.","Dan Florness","You bet Rob.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert W. Baird.","David Manthey","Hey Dan, happy new year.","Dan Florness","Thanks Dave, you too.","David Manthey","So I guess, I'll stay on your favorite topic here gross margin, could you tell us in the fourth quarter were there any yearend accrual adjustments up or down that impacted the number?","And second, could you quantify for us the average gross margin differential between national account customers and the rest of the business? And then finally last quarter, you mentioned about 2% price degradation on Fastenal and I am just wondering if you can give us an update on Fastenal pricing or other product pricing as well\/","Dan Florness","Sure. The national accounts piece, the delta between that and the rest of our -- and our company average is really been unchanged for quite some time. There is a eight to ten point delta there.","If it's an onsite that delta moves down, the margin there moves down into the 30s as we talked about and it's prevalent in that 16% of our business that is onsite or onsite like business in our existing mix.","From the standpoint of the pressure on deflation, that's holding pretty steady to what we were seeing in the third quarter. I wouldn't say it's gotten worse. I wouldn't say it's gotten better. So I would say that's holding pretty steady and it was third piece sorry. I didn't jot the first one down.","David Manthey","Just any yearend accrual true-ups that impacted gross margin?","Dan Florness","Nothing outside of norm.","David Manthey","Okay.","Dan Florness","So is always little bit of noise, but nothing outside the norm.","David Manthey","All right. And then just one quick one here, the $4 million charge for this Brazil joint venture, could you tell us what that amount was after tax?","Dan Florness","Yes, the $4 million is not solely related to Brazil. We try to identify several things that were unusual in the quarter to get and again felt the need to give some insight.","The after-tax piece of Brazil, that piece of itself and I don\u2019t want to get into the details of each one, but the after-tax number was bigger than the pretax number -- was not helped by the tax because we\u2019ve been incurring losses in that business and therefore there is no tax benefit.","So further right off was looking at what we\u2019re going to net realize on that business because we're selling it to our partner for an amount. And then there is no tax benefit from that. So it actually impacted our tax slightly as well.","David Manthey","Okay. I guess we'll follow-up on the rest of that $4 million.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.","Adam Uhlman","Hi Dan, happy New Year.","Dan Florness","Happy New Year Adam.","Adam Uhlman","Just a clarification first, how much of your business would you describe as being that discretionary spend, the spotlight business that melted away?","Dan Florness","I don\u2019t have a definitive number for you. I would venture to guess and this is a little bit of guess, it's around that 10%.","Adam Uhlman","Okay. That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then, could you walk through how you\u2019re thinking about the cash flow for the year? There seems to be several moving pieces in terms of capital spending?","I think you had previously guided that down somewhat materially for the year, but then you had the CSP 16 program that\u2019s coming through. You took up the dividend. I guess I\u2019m trying to think through, how much cash generation you think you can do and if you're planning on paying down debt?","Dan Florness","The CapEx as we talked about early November, we came in on a net basis because we sold our old distribution center up in Kitchener. So we had some proceeds there, but on a net basis, we spent about $145 million on CapEx in 2015, which was about a 15% drop from what we had seen in 2014, which was about a 8%, 9% drop from what we saw in 2013.","And really what had happened is in -- back in 2011 timeframe, we had an Investor Day and we talked about how our CapEx was going to be going up. History has said our CapEx should be somewhere between 25% and 30% of our earnings. It's pretty good accurate number over a decade and we noted that for a multiyear period, that number was going to materially go up.","And the two things that were really going to drive that increase centered on we putting automation into our distribution centers and today over 80% of our picking activity occurs in automated distribution centers.","The most meaningful project we have right now we're placing -- we're adding automation into our distribution center in North Carolina. That's a 2016 project, but we were going to have about a three-year period where we're putting in a massive amount of automation and that came with a price tag and so that is largely behind us.","This year our CapEx as it relates to facilities is centered on the North Carolina facility I talked about and then investments in Indianapolis related to manufacturing and expansion of our automated warehouse.","The other piece was we were very optimistic what vending could be and we knew that we were going to be spending tremendous amount of dollars on vending over a multiyear period.","Two, we felt very good about the ability for us to grow the business and the second half of that equation is we didn\u2019t want to run out of supply. So we built an of inventory machines and so today, our spend is coming down in both of those largely because the automation is behind us.","And on a vending standpoint, our patterns are more stable today and we\u2019re able to burn in a little bit of that inventory as well. So all those pieces we identified in November and expectation that CapEx would drop probably around 12% to just under $130 million.","And the only wildcard on that centers on things that we -- the pace of what we do with vending as we go through the year. There are some things I\u2019m optimistic about and we'll see how they play out, but that\u2019s probably the only wildcard, whereas the rest of the projects are pretty well known at this advantage point.","Dividend, we just announced a $0.30 dividend last night. We had been running at $0.28. So if that were to continue throughout the year, that would imply about $344 million dividend versus the $327 last year based on where our share count is right now.","And then the wildcard is what we do in buybacks? We did fair amount of buybacks in the current year. If you look at our debt we have on the books right now, it\u2019s really about the buybacks we\u2019ve done in the last year and half. I would expect some additional buybacks as we go through 2016. How that plays out is going to be largely dependent on the marketplace.","But our distribution business by its nature throws off a lot of cash. This year, our operating cash flow as we saw last year is just over a 100% of earnings and for our distribution business to throw off operating cash that's greater than the earnings, tells me of the year you didn\u2019t grow pretty well and you didn\u2019t need that much of working capital.","So that gives us prospects for strong cash flow generation as we go into 2016. Frankly, I would prefer to see a number in the upper 90s because they're telling me we\u2019re growing there.","Adam Uhlman","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Dan Florness","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert from Longbow Research.","Chris Dankert","Hi. Good morning, Dan. Thanks for taking my question.","Dan Florness","Good morning.","Chris Dankert","Just first off thinking about the fasteners going to the vending machines and the quarter seems to kind of rough down about 8%. I was wondering just kind of given the utilization numbers and the production numbers we\u2019re seeing this morning and your optimism on the early start in January, is there any commentary you can give us on just the fasteners so far? Have you seen an uptick in those numbers?","Dan Florness","I guess I\u2019m a little confused by your question Chris only from you started it by talking about the fasteners and vending. Fasteners, there is no connection between fasteners and vending size. Maybe I just misheard your question.","Chris Dankert","I\u2019m sorry\u2026","Dan Florness","Only non-fasteners go through the vending platform.","Chris Dankert","But I guess the upshot was your fasteners, have they improved in January commensurate with kind of what you\u2019re seeing on total sales?","Dan Florness","I typically don\u2019t get too caught up in the total numbers. I don\u2019t even look at product line mix during the month because it\u2019s not a meaningful exercise. So I don\u2019t even know the number.","Chris Dankert","No. Fair enough. I guess the other question I had was as far as the IT cost, kind of the investments you\u2019re talking about back at the Analyst Day, can you break out how much of that is dollar value for the year? And then is it going to be classified OpEx, CapEx or a mix of the two?","Dan Florness","Well, our biggest investment we\u2019ve made over the last several years is we've grown and built a development team and we've over last two years I believe we now have somewhere between 75 and 80 people in India that are solely about development, a great team.","I\u2019ve not personally been over to meet with them, but everybody that has met with them, they\u2019re really impressed with the quality of the people we have there. That obviously goes through our P&L.","Historically for us most of the investments we make in IT go through the P&L in the period because they are ongoing coding investments. Obviously things like equipment or third party software, those are capitalized and would be spread out over a multiyear period is one would expect.","But most of the expense would be the cost of those 75 people and we\u2019re continuing to grow that group. I talked about some of the places we\u2019re adding or we\u2019re not adding.","I think that number will continue to grow and will probably get to the point we have about 100 people over there because we want to build up our capabilities in that area to support our business more thoroughly but you can back into a number pretty fast just with the 75 people.","Chris Dankert","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Dan Florness","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Cieslak from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ryan Cieslak","Hey Dan. Good morning.","Dan Florness","Good morning.","Ryan Cieslak","I wanted to just first maybe hit the margin question again and you took a step back and you guys clearly have some strategic growth opportunities in the top line, but clearly have some puts and takes still on the margin side.","And just directional when you think about incentive comp, the mix with onsite maybe ramping what\u2019s going on with vending, is this a year if you\u2019re able to hit your topline internal goals or grow the topline? Directionally how should operating margins trend for you guys relative to 2015?","Dan Florness","If we are able to hit our topline, to the extent we\u2019re doing that because of the onsite, that\u2019s going to be a little bit of leakage, but again we\u2019re talking a relatively small piece of the pie. Our ability to grow our earnings long term has always been centered on the fact that what we call pathway to profit and that is our stores has a mature -- the level of profits improved dramatically.","The 900 stores we had in the fourth quarter that did more than $100,000 a month in revenue, the profitability in that group is completely on a different, just in a different place and the profitability of the remaining stores that do less than $100,000 a month.","So to the extent all these programs, the vending, these initiatives cause our average store size to grow. There is no reason why that will enhance our profitability and fund any leakage what we might have as it relates to the onsite.","Now if our onsite were widely successful. Let's say our onsites were frontend loaded and we get them turned on faster than we expect such that you don't have this wave coming in during the course of the year and the wave hits us earlier and the wave keeping increasing and we do materially more than the 200 million.","I can see our growth being better than we expected and our operating margins being a little bit worse. I don't think anybody can call with a complaint about that.","Ryan Cieslak","And then Dan with the onsite onboarding, is there incremental one-time or onboarding cost that comes through initially that might weigh on the incremental EBIT contribution this year versus maybe what it looks like into the out year in '17?","Dan Florness","Oh! Sure, but that's a constant in our business. That's true of any new business turning on any new year, a new large national account. The first few months are kind of tough. First six to nine month, you're selling resources at it. You weren\u2019t as good at sourcing the products.","So your gross margin isn\u2019t where you would like. If I look at the onsites that we turned on in the -- in 2015, their performance would be materially different than the existing book and that's what we talked about in November and that would true of every year.","Again it's really about -- I think at the end of the day, the real question is does it allow us to grow our business faster? And do you have confidence that Fastenal, if we're getting the growth can manage the operating expenses?","I believe we can manage the operating expenses if we're getting the growth. I believe these growth drivers allow us to grow faster and take market share at a faster clip than our competitors. And we were at -- well I see, we were at 9.46 and so I don't have to ask you that if there is a follow-on, we'll take it offline.","One rule we've always had is we realize its earnings season and everybody has a very, very busy day and so we try to hold this call to 45 minutes.","So I guess I'll close on that note of again thank you to everybody for listening to our earnings call this morning. Hope you didn't mind hearing just my voice. In the past, it's typically been two.","Felt that was appropriate to talk a bit about the quarter, but more importantly to talk about the growth drivers we have going into 2016 because that's why we held the Investor Day back in November because we think it's really about where is our business going long term.","Thank you and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect.

Before I start, I just want to share a thought with the group. And I had the distinct pleasure over my 23 years at Fastenal to have worked with some really fine people. And two of them I mentioned are original CEO, Bob Kierlin, and his successor Will Oberton, two individuals that I think were stellar in the role, and I learned a tremendous amount from and not only were they great at their role, they\u2019re really good people.","I remember back in -- I believe it was 1998 October and our business growth dropped in one month, about a third we went from 20% some growth, we dropped 10 point. I think we went from 27% to 17%, don\u2019t quote me on that, but I think that\u2019s what it was. And we did six simple things. And if you want to -- if you are a CEO out there and you want to know six things to do in a time like this, these are really useful. The first thing you do is you take a step back, you revisit that your long-term priorities. These priorities should center on your goals or something is wrong to start with, but you take a look at your priorities. And that\u2019s step one.","Step two is you remind everybody about these priorities and you remind everybody, hey, we keep doing these things. 20 years ago that was opening branches, because we were spreading across North America. Today, it\u2019s executing on our growth drivers.","Step three, you take a step back and you identify those things that are really, really important to your long-term success, but you pull back on that a bit. And you explain to everybody why and a good example is something that we were pulling back, back in late May, I sat down with Reyne Wisecup, our Head of HR; and Peter Guidinger, our Head of our Fastenal School Business and I said, you know, what we need to pull back expenses and we need to do it in a bunch of places. We need to pull back our instructor-led programs for the second-half of the year because we need to pull back the travel expenses, so if you are in an airline right now or a hotel in Winona, Minnesota or one of our distribution centers, you will lose some business in the next six months because we pulled back on -- we pull back about 40% of our online -- excuse me, our instructor-led trainings and the team didn't react with anger, didn't react with fear. They reacted with resiliency.","Now maybe they had some fear in their stomach, maybe they had some anger in their stomach, but they didn\u2019t let that show and they immediately identified what some of the resources they would be freeing up, what could they do that help Fastenal in the short-term and long-term. They identified some courses they are going to develop because most of our courses are delivered online. There we identified an abrasives course, a metalworking course, a blueprint reading course, an ISO quality course. Several new courses relating to Lean and Six Sigma. Now my guess is there aren't anybody in this call that\u2019s signing up to take those courses, but they\u2019re really important to our employees and to our customers, and that's something that you do when you do trade-offs and you pull back expenses in the short-term. Really important thing as an organization or individual, in the case of me that believes in education more. But in the short-term you pull back because we don\u2019t have the dollars to pay for it.","Step four, you have to also identify those activities that don't support your long-term priorities or that quite frankly aren't really that necessary in the first place. Fortunately for us we\u2019re pretty frugal. So, we don't have any of those, but we are human beings, so we -- you always develop some and those you just stop and you stop today. The third thing to do is you communicate this throughout the organization. You create normalcy in your organization. You remove fear and replace it with resiliency.","And then step six, you repeat that communication to everybody, and you repeat it again and again and you build resiliency in the organization. Six really simple steps, but they\u2019re really effective in a time when all of a sudden your business has slowed down and you\u2019re not sure how long. I took comfort we are market share, but the business has slowed down. Had a call with our Regional VPs at seven this morning, actually Holden did. I chimed in at the tail end of it. I talked to them about a number of things we're doing right. I also talked about on aspects of the quarter that don\u2019t fall in the normalcy where our execution faltered and gross margin is one that stands out.","To be honest with you, last fall, we thought we had really good plan to address some of the inflation we were seeing, and there has been tariffs now in place on steel-based products for a year on fasteners since late last fall. So, we had a really good plan coming in the year how to approach it. I often encourage our team to think big about the business. Unfortunately, on that front I feel shy on where we were last fall. In that, we had a good plan coming into the year. We didn\u2019t have a great plan. And part of that where we faltered was the resiliency part. We didn\u2019t prepare our team for a bunch of things coming their way. We prepared them for that, that big wave coming in was tariffs that were direct. That\u2019s an easy one to identify. That\u2019s an easy one to go after. It's not easy to take it downstream no pun intended. But it is easier to go after.","We also prepared them for some of the things that would be coming from our suppliers in the U.S that import product and resell it to us. Though it is not as easier to identify, but relatively easy; and I think on those two fronts we did a relatively good job. We realized in the process we were going to share some of it with our customers. We were going to share some of it with ourselves. We are a supply chain partner. Our customer is not a means to an end for us. Our customer -- we are not a business that just sells products and the customer goes away and we don\u2019t really care what they do with it. We are a supply chain partner and that's what we represent to our customer.","Where we failed though is, there wasn\u2019t just a couple of waves coming in, there was once rip tides too. And those rip tides came from a bunch of different directions and we weren't ready for that. And as a result and Holden will touch on a little more detail about that, we lost some gross margin. To me that\u2019s a thing that stands out in this quarter that is troubling from the standpoint if the economy slows down, the economy slows down, the economy expands, the economy expands, you react to both.","We did not execute on gross margin. And as a result, the statement I made to this group, I believe look back on the January call where I said, when I look at Fastenal and I\u2019m describing it to our folks internally when we were a $10 billion company, I believe a 46 gross margin is a reality that we can achieve. I believe a 24% operating expense is a reality we can achieve and we should aspire to an operating margin around 20%. I believed it then I believe it now. I didn\u2019t think I would be sitting here six months later talking to you about a quarter where we just put up gross margin that\u2019s 46 and change, 46.7 I believe is the number. And in that regard we\u2019ve some work to do as we go into Q3.","I will go to now the flipbook. The sales growth slowed about 8%. It's our first sub 10% reading in nine quarters. We continue to realize double-digit growth through vending and Onsites and to our National Account customers, our growth drivers, if you will. Our fourth growth driver construction, did weaken as we got deep into the quarter. Not exactly sure what's driving all of that at this time. But overall our activity in the end markets we serve slowed as we stepped into the quarter. I don't know if it continue to slow during the quarter, but it did slow as we stepped into the quarter and I will let Holden touch more on that in a few minutes.","There were a few milestones in the quarter. And one that occurred right after the quarter that I will touch on as well. The first milestone was we installed our 100,000 -- that\u2019s a hard thing to say, vending device during the quarter. We have little over 85,000 vending machines now. We have another 15,000 that we lease to some customers where they use them for second check out, so 100,000 of them out there. I like to personally thank Oshkosh Corp and specifically their Pierce Manufacturing facility in Appleton, Wisconsin. They were an early adopter, I should say an early guinea pig, with our vending program back 11, 12 years ago continued to have a great relationship with that organization and they added machine number 100,000 in early June. And had the opportunity to go over there and thank them in person. It worked out really well because they\u2019re based in Appleton, Wisconsin, my father-in-law Gus [ph], lives about 10 miles away in Neenah, so I had a -- I didn\u2019t need to get a hotel that night. But I had a chance to learn a lot about business and what they do is pretty special, they make fire trucks, a beautiful product.","Late in the quarter we signed Onsite number 1,000. I think that\u2019s a big accomplishment. It took us quite a few years to get the branch number 1,000. It took us a lot less time to get Onsite 1,000. I\u2019m not at liberty to share with you the name of that customer right now. I believe we\u2019re announcing in a day or two. We need to get all the formalities worked out, but I would like to thank them incognito for Onsite 1,000. I think we\u2019re in a 1,026 right now.","The third milestone occurred is not in the flipbook. But yesterday and it wasn\u2019t even in the quarter, yesterday our facility in Connecticut, Wallingford, Connecticut, Holo-Krome back in 2009, we acquired Holo-Krome. They were in a business -- a process of being shutdown. Within two years of the acquisition, we moved them from a 80-year old facility that was rather tired into a newly renovated facility. And -- but Holo-Krome manufacturing started back in 1929, kind of an odd year to start given what happened in the next decade. But they celebrated nine years of operation yesterday. My congratulations to the team at Holo-Krome. They have been a great addition to the Fastenal family.","Price realization as I\u2019ve alluded to has been insufficient to fully offset the tariffs and general inflation we\u2019re seeing. We are seeing in a bunch of fronts. Obviously, the direct impact of tariffs, but the indirect through companies we buy from some pass it on in different ways, some spread it across all products, some apply it strictly to tariff related products. Nonetheless, it's created a lot of supply chain inflation. In the short-term, we\u2019ve not been able to realize the price to fully pass that along. We\u2019ve taken further price adjustments going into the third quarter. We will, as a supply chain partner, share some with our customer. We will absorb some of it, but we plan to call back the gross margin degradation that came beyond just customer mix in the current quarter.","As a result, we struggle to obtain leverage. We did get operating expense leverage. The flipbook talks about that. The only disagreement I would have with the flipbook is that\u2019s looking at operating expense to sales growth. I think the operating expense to gross profit as the growth. And in that regard we did not lever, but I think the team did a good job of managing operating expenses in the second quarter. We\u2019re dialing down as we go into the third.","On the next page, I don\u2019t need to read these all individually. What I can say as it relates to our growth drivers, the team did a great job, continuing to take market share. We just need to continue to do a great job on executing the business.","With that, I will turn it over to Holden.","Holden Lewis","Great. Thank you and good morning. Before jumping in, I just want to remind everyone that on May 22 we split our stock two-for-one. Therefore any references and the materials to per share information such as EPS will reflect this action.","Moving to Slide 5. Total sales were up 7.9%, which includes up 7% daily sales in June. Pricing in response to tariffs and general inflation contributed 72 to 100 basis point during the period. The lower range than what we saw in the first quarter that largely reflects the current period having to grow over last year's rising contribution from price. Sequentially, we believe price realization was stable.","From a macro standpoint, it's clear that activity slowed. The Purchasing Managers' Index averaged 52.2 in the first quarter, which is still suggestive of a growing market, but well off the 56.9 level recorded as recently as -- as recently as the fourth quarter. Similarly, U.S industrial production in April and May was up 1.3%, which is well below the 3.7% growth that we experienced just in the fourth quarter of 2018. There's no panic in the market and the month-to-month cadence to the quarter was mostly steady, but sentiment has become more cautious. In terms of end markets, manufacturing was up 9.1%. Oil and gas remain soft and our heavy equipment categories also slowed. Construction was up 7.2% in the second quarter with larger customers outperforming smaller ones.","From a product standpoint, fasteners were up 5.5%, with non-fasteners up 9.5%. Fasteners are the most cyclical of our product lines and we believe the relatively faster deceleration from 1Q to 2Q like to reflects the slower macro environment. From a customer standpoint, National Accounts were up 12.5% in the quarter with 72 of our top 100 accounts growing. Our non-National Account growth was less than 1% with roughly 59% of our branches growing in the second quarter.","Our two quarters of quarterly growth averaged 12.9%, our current rate is clearly disappointing. Still ebbs and flows of the cycle aside the goal every day is to capture more market share of a fragmented industrial distribution market, judging by our out growth relative to industrial production we believe the Blue Team continue to execute its growth drivers effectively.","Now to Slide 6. Our gross margin was 46.9% in the second quarter, down 180 basis points versus the second quarter of 2018, a larger decline than was expected. There were a handful of smaller drags, including the year to year comparison in transportation. But there were two primary factors behind the decline. First, customer and product mix. This remains an expected outcome of our success in driving market share gains through our current growth drivers. However, the greater deceleration in our higher-margin non-National Account customers, which grew less than 1% in the quarter serve to wide net mix drag, which was 80 to 90 basis points in the quarter.","Second was a widening in our price cost deficit to an estimated 40 to 60 basis points. As Dan alluded to, initial steps to raise price to offset tariffs were effective as far as they went, but were not expansive enough in terms of the range of products covered or their ability to offset generalized inflation above and beyond and, frankly, catalyzed by the tariffs. We continue to pursue a range of actions to mitigate these effects including a broader price increase that we've already instituted in the third quarter. Broadening our sales streams and realizing the incremental benefits of the pricing that recently introduced should improve our gross margin performance in the second-half.","Our operating margin was 20.1% in the second quarter of '19, down 110 basis points year-over-year. We leveraged operating expenses despite the slowdown in sales growth, but not sufficiently to overcome the lower gross margin. Looking at the pieces, we achieved 20 basis points of leverage over employee related costs, which were up 6.8%. This growth was largely due to a 6.6% increase in absolute and FTE growth in the period. We realized 25 basis points of leverage over occupancy related costs, which were up 2.5%, comprised of higher vending expenses as we expand the installed base and flattish occupancy expenses.","We generated 20 basis points of leverage over other operating and administrative expenses, which were actually down slightly in the period. In light of the slower top line growth, we will seek to reduce our own spending. We will continue to add resources as necessary to finance our growth drivers and support our ability to take market share, but cost and investments that do not support those growth drivers will be more tightly managed. Putting it all together, we reported second quarter '19 EPS of $0.36, which was down 3.2% from the $0.37 in the second quarter of '18. Recall, however, that last year's quarter did benefit by two pennies from a one-time tax gain if we adjust this out, our EPS were up 1.5% in the second quarter.","Turning to Slide 7. Looking at the cash flow statement. We generated $128 million in operating cash in the second quarter, which was 63% of net income. Remember the cash generation in the second quarters are typically seasonally lower. The conversion rate in the current quarters below last year's 72%, the last year we would have been close to 66% absent one-time benefits deriving from the Tax Act. Overall, we view the current quarter's conversion rate to be consistent with the typical 2Q conversion rate.","Net capital spending in the second quarter was $67 million, up from $25 million in the second quarter of 2018, but consistent with our expectations. This reflects investments in hub property and equipment and vehicles that are necessary to support our high levels of service as well as investments in vending equipment to support growth in our installed base. Our 2019 range for total net capital spending is unchanged between $195 million and $225 million with the same factors driving the second quarter increase impacting the full-year.","We increased funds paid out in dividends by 16% to $123 million. We finished the quarter with debt at 16.6% of total capital above last year's 16%, but down sequentially and from year-end and at a level that we believe provides ample liquidity to invest in our business and pay our dividend. The working capital picture remains challenging. Inventories were up 15.7% in the second quarter, almost 40% of this increase relates to inventory added to support Onsites.","We believe we can reduce overall inventory even while making these investments. And as a result began to reduce our overseas purchasing in the fourth quarter of 2018. This can be difficult to discern both because of the lag between such an action and its impacting our balance sheet and because of the slower sales growth this quarter, which lowered our inventory burn rate. However, we would expect these actions to become more visible to the second half of 2019.","Our accounts receivable grew 11.7% in the second quarter. Customers continue to aggressively push payments out past quarter end and as a result of 2.9 day increase in our receivable days is unsatisfactory. Still, the rate of increase has moderated versus last year and there are signs that we are reacting more effectively to our customer's actions as its been the case in recent quarters we are not seeing any meaningful change in hard to collect balances.","That is all for our formal presentation. So with that, operator, we will take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.","Ryan Merkel","Hey, thanks. So, a couple questions on gross margins to start here. So, first, what exactly is the issue with recapturing product inflation? I recall you thought you\u2019d recapture the 20-basis-point price cost deficit last quarter, this quarter, but it in fact got worse. So what exactly is going on?","Holden Lewis","The -- I mean, the goal coming into the year was to eliminate the price cost deficit that we had. The -- that was the goal the prior year as well, but we still wound up with one, and so it comes down to execution. And the issue was, we put in place a plan to address tariffs in particular and that resulted in our getting incremental price to offset those tariffs. What I think we underestimated Ryan was the degree to which there was general inflation in the marketplace, including general inflation that was being sort of caused and following on the tariffs that were going into place. And on top of that, the pricing improvements that we put in affected a significant amount of product within our overall portfolio, but didn\u2019t necessarily affect all of it. And we had assumed that we would get enough price to sort of make up for what we didn't address in terms of the product categories, but we didn't quite get there. Again, a lot of the reason for that is simply the incremental inflation above and beyond tariffs that we saw in the marketplace. So we looked at the situation, we\u2019ve sort of evaluated the issues that were in place and we\u2019ve taken additional pricing actions at the beginning of Q3, the end of Q2 really to address both the gap that we had for the inflation that we didn't build into the original expectations so to catch up, if you will, as well as the new tariffs that are beginning to come through the system that we will experience in our COGS and the -- in the latter half of the year.","Ryan Merkel","So just a follow-up, if I understood what you said correctly, it sounds like your systems aren't capturing inflation appropriately for you to be able to pass it on because you're not saying that you\u2019re -- you\u2019ve been unable to pass on the price inflation to your customers or that they\u2019re pushing back too hard? Am I hearing that right?","Holden Lewis","No, that\u2019s correct. The pricing that we put through, we captured. The -- what we didn't capture is the pricing that we didn't put through that we should have. And so the new pricing is intended to address the gap between what we did capture and the price increases that we've seen, and what -- and sort of what we didn't wind up putting through the first time around.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. And then presumably you\u2019ve improved the systems and you have a better handle on what more inflation is coming. So how much price do you estimate you\u2019re going to need in the second half of '19, and maybe into 2020 to offset rising product inflation?","Daniel Florness","You know, I think we've looked at it and we're expecting -- we are putting into place a couple of percentage points of price.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. And you\u2019re confident that will cover or at least offset most of the price cost deficit?","Daniel Florness","Yes, we are.","Ryan Merkel","Okay.I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks.","Daniel Florness","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions.","David Manthey","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Daniel Florness","Hi, David. Good morning.","David Manthey","First question on gross margin. Holden, I think you gave some data on this, but could you just disaggregate the gross margin decline of 180 basis points into mix factors versus pricing factors? And then, along with that, Dan, I\u2019m wondering if you can address this, the 46%. I\u2019m wondering why is 46% a line in the sand when you\u2019re at 47% and change today and your gross margin has been declining, I don't know, 70, 80 basis points annually for the last 5 plus years. Can you talk about that issue as well?","Holden Lewis","I will handle the mechanical side of it first and then we will pass it over. But the mix piece was about an 80 to 90 basis point drag, which was probably about 20 basis points more than I would've expected, frankly. The price cost piece was a 40 to 60 basis point drag, which again was a widening versus what we saw in the first quarter. There was about a 20-basis-point drag from freight than there's a couple other sort of organizational elements that make up the difference.","David Manthey","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Daniel Florness","David, I\u2019d think about it this way. Think about it as it's a desired outcome. If we desire over the next $5 billion of growth to expand our operating margin, there\u2019s two ways to do it. Either you do it by how much you allow your gross margin to move or how much you allow your operating expense to move or force the operating expense to move. Could you make the math work by it going to 44% and operating expenses going to 22%, that\u2019s conceivable, but that's really difficult to do because you really have to -- you\u2019ve to understand how much of your business is going to be going through our Onsite model versus our branch model, what our average branch is going to do. The old pathway to profit that we talked about years ago was really about as that branch population matures, it becomes much more profitable because you run away from a lag of fixed costs. And so, it's really a case of putting a line in the sand, tells your team because this is about a message for internal as much as it\u2019s a message for external. It tells your team that if we want to be able to afford these things in the future, we have to clawback on this piece, this piece, this piece, and this piece. Sometimes that\u2019s clawing back on gross margin and some of price. Sometimes it's about cost, sometimes it's about mix. Sometimes, it's about how much freight you put on your own truck versus somebody else's, how much you charge for freight? It's looking at all those pieces and saying if we can be a $10 billion company at 46%, we can afford to be at 24 and hit 22. If we can't and that goes to 45% or 44%, which is conceivably possible. I mean, in January I talked about that. If -- then we either need to decide is 24 the number and we're willing to be at 20 or 21 or do we squeeze that down to 23 and 22. So, the line in the sand is more about the desired outcome and what you\u2019re going to challenge your business internally to do to achieve that outcome.","David Manthey","Okay. That makes sense. Thanks, Dan. I appreciate it.","Daniel Florness","And one thing I would also mention is recall when we sort of had that initial conversation about those aspirations, we also noted that the impact of mix and stuff might pull the margin down to 45% and then improvements we make in the business would actually add another 100 basis points or what have you now. That\u2019s from $5 billion to $10 billion. Obviously, we haven't had the time to get that additional 100 basis points of improvement just from the things we do to improve our supply chain, right. So, when you think about the baseline, don't forget that always inherent in that guidance was the suggestion that over that period we would also make process improvements on our own business that would offset some of that mix drag.","David Manthey","Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then just quickly on the SG&A. I think you\u2019ve only been growing it at a 5% or 6% rate in the first half before you\u2019ve taken any actions relative to the slowing market. But -- and obviously if things slowdown you will get a little natural flex in OpEx lower. Where can you take that set point in the back half of this year? I mean, are you prepping this for sort of mid single-digit top line and you can set that at 3% or can take it a flat, I don\u2019t know. I mean, you\u2019ve done a good job to this point. I'm just wondering how much further you can work down on that?","Holden Lewis","Yes, I will answer it, Dave, in this context where my -- where our thinking is right now, based on what our business is doing right now. We are closing some branches every quarter. That frees up some expense every quarter. Based on our run rate we\u2019re going to do about a 100 branches that we close. So that gives us some flexibility. There are some branches that we need to expand that existing footprint and expand the cost. But we are able to fund all that through the branches that we\u2019re closing and some of our Onsites the customer might not have sufficient room and we might have a low-cost storage within a mile or two of our customer and while it's a lot cheaper than a branch it's still an expense. And so that's funding that piece and so our branch occupancy, onset occupancy, net net is not growing. That has been contracting slightly. The growth in occupancy is coming from the fact we put more vending machines out there. If you look at expenses, other operating -- other non-labor operating expenses that we've done a really nice job which is raining that in and we will -- we have some pieces -- triggers we are pulling right now, for example, the travel component, because we've reduced our training in the second half of the year. The real dollars is in labor if you think about our operating expenses. So there we\u2019ve some flex points from the standpoint of how our incentive comp works, I can tell you that. The incentive comp for a number of folks within Fastenal is materially different in July of 2019 that was in July of 2018. And that -- what that does and you\u2019ve described it aptly in the past as the shock absorbers, it gives us the luxury of not having to get crazy with expenses right today in the last 90 days, because you\u2019re not sure what\u2019s happening. And -- but we are pulling back headcount growth rapidly and because that expense can't be growing at 6% or 7% in an environment where sales are growing 8% and gross profits growing 4%. So that's really where you\u2019re going to see that the toggle because the other two components which are 30% of SG&A, those are managed really well and we\u2019ve been managing the first one labor really well, but that was for a different environment and we need to change our tact.","Holden Lewis","Yes, if you think, David, our -- if you look at our headcount adds whether it be full-time or FTE, I mean they\u2019re up 6.5% and just to zip back to May, go back one month and if I look at the absolute headcount it was up 7%, that\u2019s actually the highest rate of growth in our headcount that we\u2019ve seen through this cycle, right? And so, obviously, we need to take that rate down and there's room to do so. Certainly outside of the selling functions we all need to look at sort of where we have opportunities to be more conservative, but even within the selling organization, we're going to continue to invest in people to support the Onsite growth. We need to do that because it drives our market share gains, but if you look at where headcounts are getting added, payrolls are getting added there, you\u2019re seeing growth outside of the Onsite environment as well, even in environment we\u2019re closing some branches. And so whether it's in the selling organization outside of the Onsites to support growth or whether it's in the non-selling organization, we -- we're coming off a quarter where we had pretty good growth in heads that\u2019s simply that rate needs to come down given the reality of the growth in the marketplace and should be able to.","Daniel Florness","A good example over the last few years as we ramped up our Onsites, our implementation team that we\u2019ve in the field, I believe we took the number over the last two years from about a 140-ish, 130-ish to about 230 to handle all these implementing of National Accounts and Onsite, so it's not just Onsite, but National Accounts in general. That team we\u2019re not having to grow as rapidly now attracted it's relatively stable because we\u2019re not going from signing Evian sites 280 to 300 to 400, we are kind of in that zone of around 400. We think that\u2019s a good cadence for our customers and for our business. So it doesn\u2019t require us to expand that group. So that group has been, I think were up 5% in the last 12 months. So it's things like that that we can do in the short-term.","David Manthey","Great color, guys. Thanks.","Daniel Florness","You bet.","Holden Lewis","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Daniel Florness","Good morning.","Nigel Coe","Thanks for the detail. Just going back to the price increases and I think Holden you mentioned 2%. Is that across the whole boats or that be the non-National Accounts? And certainly the spirit of the question is, are you able to get price for National Accounts, so is that so contractually locked in at this point?","Holden Lewis","We are not looking at our business differently in that sense as it relates to the impact of cost increases and the price we\u2019re putting in place, right? We can't go after the 50% of our business that is non-National Accounts and not address the 50% of the business that is National Account. Now National Account has certain mechanisms that are build into the contracts that that make that process perhaps a little bit more mechanical, but the intention is to work through that process and get price increases there where necessary as well because we are selling the same products into National Accounts as we are non-National Accounts and the costs are behaving the same. So we're not taking half of our business and setting it aside as we are not going to touch this. We can do that and be successful what we\u2019re trying to achieve.","Nigel Coe","Okay.","Daniel Florness","One thing I will just add for a little color is Holden cited an average. Average sometimes can be dangerous. We have -- if you think about China as an industrial producer, I believe 52% of the steel that\u2019s produced on the planet Earth is produced inside of China. I might be off of a point or two, but I\u2019m in the ballpark. Our fastener product, which is roughly a third of our business was made of steel. And a high percentage -- most of the -- they\u2019re are the Holo-Kromes of the world, the company I started earlier, but they represent a minority of the fasteners that are consumed in North America. So most of the fasteners regardless of where you\u2019re getting them, I mean, who is the distributor or who is the importer, most of the fasteners on this planet are made in China. And we\u2019ve moved some production out, actually we've moved. If you look at the amount we've moved in the last nine months out of China and compare it to what the U.S economy is moving, we've actually moved more than the U.S economy has, if you look at the statistics. And -- but the reality is even in a 10% or a 25% tariff environment, they oftentimes are still the lowest-cost producer of an item. And so there's -- while Holden like said, an average across a whole bunch of products, there's a lot of different parts in there. There's four lists of items that have been identified by the U.S government. List one and list two didn\u2019t really impact us that much. We don\u2019t import raw steel. List three hit last September, hit us quite hard and that list went from 10% to 25% here in the second quarter. That hits squarely into our fastener product. List four, nothing has happened yet, it's on hold. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen there. We do have products on list four and most of those will be in the non-fastener area. And so there are parts for we\u2019re raising materially higher than 2% and there are parts we\u2019re not touching. And -- but be mindful of that.","Nigel Coe","Okay.","Holden Lewis","And as it relates to National Accounts versus non-National Accounts specifically, so yes, 2% is an average. Difficult to say whether National Accounts will be more or less given -- in any given quarter or what have you, but again the intention we're not setting aside 50% of our business and saying this is not something we think that we can impact. We think we can.","Nigel Coe","Understood. Understood. And then, Holden, very quickly, I mean, can you maybe just address the gross margin cadence over the balance of the year because we tend to have a seasonally lower gross margin in the second half versus first half 2Q. How does the price increase that you\u2019re implementing, how does that impact that normal seasonal pattern?","Holden Lewis","Yes, so the price increases are already -- have already been installed. So I would expect it would begin the season benefit in July and that we would see a greater benefit in August or September and then heading into the fourth quarter, right? So that will ramp up. The cost from the new tariffs, of course, we\u2019re already behind on cost and generalize inflation, but costs from new tariffs would begin to impact us probably in the middle part of Q4. So think about that cadence on cost. If I think about the pieces that affected our gross margin this quarter, how that plays out. I -- seasonally, I think Q2 would typically be down, 10 to 20 basis points, maybe flat to down 20 basis points from Q2. So I think that\u2019s probably the typical seasonal pattern. But I think that some of the drag from freight, I think we might be able to get 10 basis points back from freight that we saw this quarter. I think that there may be a path to 40 basis points give or take on price cost in the third quarter. And when you lay that all out, I think that there's a path in the third quarter to have a gross margin, that\u2019s a little bit North of 47%, which would cut the 180 basis point drag we had this quarter and half. And I think that we can expect something like that, maybe a little bit less of a decline in the fourth quarter as well given the things that we're seeing. So that\u2019s kind of the cadence that that we see. Obviously, it relies on our executing effectively, which we expect. But should we do so, I think that there's the seasonality, then I think you add a little bit from price cost gain and you could add a little bit from freight gain.","Nigel Coe","All right. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Holden Lewis","Yes.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Robert Barry with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Robert Barry","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Daniel Florness","Good morning.","Robert Barry","Maybe actually we just to pick up where you\u2019ve left off there, Holden. So it sounds like you think you can kind of call back into the call it low to mid 47s on the gross margin, but then I think you also said that the impact of the new tariffs are going to start to you in the fourth quarter. So does that mean you need to go back then, again and get more price or will be then kind of start moving back down in the other direction there?","Holden Lewis","Well, first, I think what I said was a little -- I think what I said was a little over 47. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve said mid 40s, first off. I will just throw off \u2026","Robert Barry","[Indiscernible] 47.5.","Holden Lewis","Yes, I will just throw something in the latest round of tariffs came into play in the Q2. So there's product that we\u2019re -- but in stuff that was on the water was not impacted, but if it hadn't shift it is impacted. So we\u2019ve cost that are coming in right now that are from that latest wave. Some of those costs will turn in July and then updated piece will turn in August. A bigger piece returned September based on our faster inventory does turn at a certain cadence. But there's customer specific product that we might bring in that turns in 60 days. So the price moves we\u2019re doing and the costs, while that comes in, in waves, we are putting in place, right now. And some will go in place in August, some will go in place in September, but they\u2019re both moving now. It isnt the case of it. There's multiple waves. There is -- what the message I\u2019ve given to our team is we\u2019re not doing a price increase on every part, you are doing some stuff every month based on what\u2019s happening in that month, working with your customer and their individual supply chain because keep in mind, a big piece of what we sell is stuff that\u2019s unique to a customer. That\u2019s it, makes it more difficult to manage. Systematically and -- but our team can be response to locally.","Robert Barry","Right.","Daniel Florness","And then, when I talk about 40 or 50 basis points of clawback in the back half of the year. I\u2019m assuming you get both a little bit more price and a little bit more cost in Q4 versus where you are in Q3. So we\u2019re -- that\u2019s how we see that playing out. I do think costs will be higher in Q3. There will be a little bit higher than Q4, but I think the price side of it will also escalate a little bit.","Robert Barry","Right. So given the mention of the waves, I mean, waves is the full impact of the list three at 25% volume to the P&L.","Daniel Florness","You start seeing the puller impact of it by the time you get into those middle part of Q4. That\u2019s that.","Robert Barry","Got it. And then I guess just to circle back to an earlier question about achievability. I mean, given the slowing demand environment impacted, these are now much bigger numbers than 10%. I mean, what\u2019s the confidence on getting to price costs neutral or is that even the goal? Because I think you mentioned earlier planning to share some of the burden with the customers.","Holden Lewis","I don't believe getting cost price to be neutral is realistic. With that said, we have to work to get -- you have to work to get close of it and some of that as I said on prior calls, some involves having a challenging conversation with your customer, sometimes its price substitution. Sometimes it's looking and saying the cost of this is up, here's a different alternative that\u2019s a cheaper price to start with. For whatever reason, maybe it's a more standard product, maybe what the customers using is actually a nonstandard item and there is a more standard substitute. And Henry what requires in some cases some engineering support to get it approved for use in that process. Those are the challenging aspects, but that\u2019s in times like this, you cradle-more friction to create those challenges, because then it allows both Fastenal and our customer to win. Neither one of us takes the whole branch because you changed the math, but it takes a lot of work. And then bear in mind as well that while I think the environment today might be a little bit more challenging than it would have been six months ago. We also are better at executing this than we were the first time we did it. We\u2019ve learned more about the systems that we have, we made tweet to the systems that we have, so that fewer things, won't be covered in that sort of thing. So I think you\u2019re right that the environment perhaps is little bit more difficult and we\u2019re through six months ago. I think that our knowledge of how to manage the process is also better. And so now we just need to go and execute it.","Robert Barry","All right. Thanks, guys.","Daniel Florness","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Daniel Florness","Morning.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Just want to follow-up on the deceleration you guys saw in non-resi in June. Holden any color or Holden or Dan, can any color on maybe some pockets or verticals there. Anything you\u2019ve heard from the regions that may give little bit more of an indication how persistent that is versus maybe one bad month?","Holden Lewis","Not as much color as I wish I could give you. Our larger customers did pretty well. The customers that we\u2019ve a lot of volume with, they tend to be National Accounts grew fairly well within the construction side. What did not grow as well was the smaller customer base. Now some of the RVPs commented about weather and things like that, but that was scattered. It wasn\u2019t a consensus by any means. And so, I\u2019m not sure exactly why that piece of the market was slower for us than was true of the larger customers, which I had more color for you. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve a lot.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got it. And then, just on the kind of, directionally some more National Account deceleration. I couldn\u2019t help but notice in the press release as well some comments around monitoring investment. How much of that is directed to National Accounts or Onsite programs versus the general concept of investment or cost containment. Just trying to think about if there's a trend to be had here on National Accounts as some of those dollars get caught.","Daniel Florness","Well, our intention is to continue to invest in those things that allow us to gain market share. We believe that we continue to gain market share in the marketplace that are pretty good clip. And that\u2019s ultimately the goal. The -- whatever happens in the market -- it happens in the market. But what we can control is how we -- how much we gain market share. And so our intension is with Onsites, we have all the staff on sites and we\u2019re going to continue to add personal to be able to deliver that model to the customers that are entrusting more of their supply chain with us. With vending we\u2019re going to continue to invest in what we need to pursue that 23,000 to 25,000 unit gold this year. So there was nothing in there that was intended to convey that we were going to be tighter on gross drivers, because we\u2019re not. We need to invest in those to continue to gain market share. It's really resources outside of the growth drivers where we have to look at it, and we have to say, where can we save ourselves to some expense. And headcount was one thing that we talked about that. And again, I think I emphasized there that we\u2019re going to continue to staff the Onsite. That\u2019s not where we are going to be going after the headcount, but there's other areas whether it would be the hubs, whether it would be the branches, whether it would be the Winona headquarters, etcetera. There is when growth slows there's an opportunity to slow the rate of headcount in the areas like that. And those are types of things we need to look at, but when we talk about monitoring, investment monitoring spending, that really is more of a message outside of the growth drivers provided we're doing the right things on the growth drivers, by the way. If we find that we're doing something we need to in a growth level, we will address that as well. We are not looking to spend where we don\u2019t have to anywhere. But this is the real scrutiny has to occur outside of the growth drivers because we are not -- our goal is to gain market share and the growth drivers are key to that.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got it. And I guess just a corollary to that inventory and that\u2019s coming in the release. Yes, I would imagine that given some of the advance purchases last year, they weren't much, but there were some and the cutting of purchases this year. Should we expect something to show up in terms of the rebate structure looking like a little bit more of a headwind than you would have contemplated before?","Daniel Florness","Well, the -- with regards to the inventory, I think we are sort of past that sort of accelerated purchase that we made in Q4. I think between Q4 and Q1 that kind of adjusted itself out. I think more meaningful for the inventory as you go into the second half of this year is our purchasing teams, our supply chain teams they really reduce their spend. Starting in Q3, Q4 last year through Q2 of this year and fairly meaningfully so because we have enough products in the hub today for the level demand that we're currently seeing and that allows us to be a little bit more cautious with that spend. And so we have seen a reduction in spend, particularly of imported products currently versus where we were three quarters ago, two quarters ago. And I think that will begin to flow through in lower inventory as we go through the third quarter and fourth quarter. Now interestingly rebates are actually a heavier component on domestic spend and they are in the imported spend. And so I would necessarily assume that a reduction in import is you\u2019re going to have a terribly dyer impact on the rebate piece. The rebate is going to be more affected by the domestic spend and right now we\u2019ve really gone after that imported spend as much than anything else. Makes sense.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Okay, got it. Yes. Appreciate the color. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Adam Uhlman","Hi. Good morning.","Daniel Florness","Hey, Adam.","Adam Uhlman","Hey, Dan, you made an interest comment a little bit ago that the company has moved more suppliers out of China than the broader economy. I kind of missed what exactly you were getting at there. Could you just share with us in more detail kind of the actions that the company has taken on moving activity out of China? And then maybe to share with us today where do we stand and in terms of your total purchases that are coming out of that country.","Daniel Florness","Yes, I prefer not to get into specifics from a standpoint of percentages, just from the standpoint. And I\u2019d honestly want to share that information publicly, and that\u2019s for competitive reasons, quite frankly. But we always have multiple sources of supply for product. In the case of fasteners and non-fasteners they include a variety of suppliers and sometimes that can include a variety of countries, but the universe of countries is not that large, but the university supplier is quite large. And you do that because our covenant with our customers will have product available for them when they needed. And the other reason to have it is you -- the one challenging thing from the standpoint of how many you have and how fast you can move it, it's not only due, it have tail, confidence in your supply, you need to have conference and your quality of supply. Because at the end of the day we're selling a product that hold stuff together or is used by people. Half of our revenue is either a fastener or a safety item. And so you have a important quality consideration in all the products, but especially in those. And -- but if you look at the statistics and the statistics are out there for me to look at. The mono product that has been resourced. As far as what\u2019s coming through and as measured by U.S customs. The percentage that\u2019s been resourced is actually fairly small. And a lot of it is, there's sophisticated supply chains out there that are difficult to change that has been set up not in the last five years, but in the last 25 years. In the case of us, where we head a cost ability early on. The other challenging thing is we might have the resource to supply, they might be 20% more expensive, in different places. You don\u2019t move the 5%. The 5% stuff you move, if you can, and you try to get ahead of everybody else, we what to do the same thing when there is tariffs at 10%. But the 12% you might not or you might, depending on what you think is going to happen next. And so we moved on some of that fairly aggressively last -- late last fall. And so we moved a chunk of our product out of China. Most of that, that we moved went to other Asian countries, Taiwan primarily and so there's inflation introduced because of that because you\u2019re probably buying it for more, but you\u2019re paying less or equal to the tariff. And it's really because of the supply chain relationship we have for our customer. But percentage wise, we\u2019ve moved more than what the U.S economy has looking at import data.","Adam Uhlman","Okay, got you. And then a clarification. You had mentioned that the incentive comp was reduced a lot, and I\u2019m just wondering if that came through the P&L in the second quarter or if that\u2019s the third quarter event and if it was material for the quarter? Thanks.","Daniel Florness","It would have come through on the second quarter. It's a piece of the equation, because if you think about what\u2019s going on with labor expense, there's two dynamics there. I mean, one is the sheer headcount -- or three dynamics. One is the sheer headcount growth. The other is there's inflation, particularly in the part-time areas, but there's inflation in general, in payrolls across the U.S economy because we have very low unemployment. And so those two dynamics are adding or pushing it up this actually pulled it down a little bit, yes.","Adam Uhlman","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, there are no additional questions. Would you like to make some closing comments, Mr. Florness?","Daniel Florness","Just want to thank everybody for the time this morning and hope you found this call and our disclosures useful and understanding what\u2019s happening in our business selling into industrial in North America and the rest of planet.

I will start the discussion with \u2013 before I get to the flipbook, just recap a few things going on in our business and to add some transparency to some things that are going on in the business, had a call early this morning with our regional leadership and around the planet. Holden ran through a bunch of the financial aspects and discussed the release in general, talked about some of the points that we will be focusing on in the earnings call today to have that group be really well-informed of what\u2019s happening in the business and that\u2019s something we do every quarter.","I started my comments with a simple message to the group. September was a big month. Coming into the month, we had an aggressive goal. And January caused us to just miss our internal sales goal earlier in the year. Since then we have been in excess of goal every month, very similar to what we experienced in 2017 from the standpoint of good solid top line growth hitting our internal goals, which gives us the confidence to invest in the business. Year-to-date, we are at 100.7% of goal. When I looked at the numbers on last Saturday, a week ago Saturday, we were at 99.9%, not all the numbers were in yet. So I thought okay, we have a good shot of hitting goal. We came in at 100.0% of goal in September. Proud of what we accomplished as an organization from the standpoint of establishing the goal and going out and getting it.","In the last 2 days, we had our typical board meetings and the evening before our board meeting is typically a session where we introduce a topic that we delve deeper into. In past quarters, we have talked about some of the acquisitions we have done, we have talked about some business development opportunities, we will talk specifically about our Onsite business, our vending business, our e-commerce business, our construction business, just to shed additional insight for our Board of Directors for their own knowledge and engagement as a Director of our organization, but also to solicit input from a very talented group. Our meeting on Monday evening, I typically don\u2019t cover that session, I covered that session and talked a bit about the company and I just want to share some of the things we talked about.","As we did at last year\u2019s annual meeting, we talk about Fastenal, what we looked like when we were a $2 billion company, which was roughly 11 years ago in 2007. We talked a bit at that time about what we will look like as a $4 billion company. And this year as we prepare for our internal discussions in December and our annual meeting next year, we will get to talk about Fastenal as a $5 billion company and we\u2019ll talk about how we have morphed, how we have evolved over the last 10, 11 years.","We also had a pretty lengthy discussion about what we look like when we are a $10 billion company. And we focused on four aspects of the business. One was the products we sell. If you look at it fasteners and now safety products combined make up roughly half of our business. Fasteners made up half our business a decade ago, but as the other businesses have grown, especially safety has grown, it\u2019s morphed a little bit. We talked about our selling channels, our branch, our Onsite integrated supply, a relatively small business that\u2019s kind of tucked away into the Onsite business. And our channel extender in everything that we do, a little thing called vending and in-stock. We talked about the definition of our customer, who it was 10 years ago, who it is today, who do we believe it\u2019s going to be 10 years \u2013 excuse me when we are a $10 billion company, and there we talked about the manufacturing customer, little bit of some of the subsets, the construction customer, a government customer and all the others.","We talked at length about the request mode. And what I mean by that is how that\u2019s changed over time in how our customers are ordering. A big swathe, our request mode is vending, where the customer doesn\u2019t request it. Our supply chain delivers it to them at point of use, at time of use, and we measure our fulfillment in the context of minutes, not hours, not days, but minutes. In our branch network, we measure it in the context of minutes and hours. In our distribution network, we measure it in the context of 8 hours away, but impressive supply chain in how -- customers ordering patterns and how that\u2019s morphing can play really into the strengths of Fastenal.","Four things I highlighted just for additional discussion, some that were tangential to this discussion was our branch economics. We started talking about what we call pathway to profit, 10, 12 years ago. Pathway to profit is still alive and well within Fastenal when I think of our branch network and understanding how that branch network funds our ability to migrate the business into a more Onsite world. The continuing traction we are seeing in the e-commerce, web, I mentioned to the board that night. I said last quarter was kind of fun to casually mention on the call that we now have a $100 million web business within Fastenal. That\u2019s ignoring EDI, that\u2019s ignoring the electronic orders that are coming in from vending. That\u2019s just looking at where people hop on the web and we have re-branded that mostly to what we call Fastenal Express, but it\u2019s a $100 million business within Fastenal, growing handsomely. To that extent, 3 months later, I can look at that and say that $100 million business is now $110 million business, you can do the math on what that means as far as growth, but it\u2019s seeing substantial growth.","And interestingly enough, we are seeing the growth not just in our branch network, we are actually seeing faster growth in our Onsite network, it\u2019s a more efficient way of ordering. So not only does it help us grow faster, it helps us be more efficient. And a critical part of our success as we morph from a $5 billion to a $10 billion company is managing the operating expense within the organization, and you are seeing some of that shine through as we go quarter-to-quarter. We did a bit of a recap on how we communicate and learn internally, how we define the message and our focus and how our emphasis is always on what is special about Fastenal and how does that something special benefit our customer. And let\u2019s make investments to grow there and differentiate ourselves in the market, be something special for the customer. We also touched on people development and some leader development aspects we have in place for 2018 and how that\u2019s changing us going into 2019. That transitioned from Monday night into Tuesday and we had a pretty lengthy discussion on tariffs and inflation in general. We started that discussion to make sure everybody is on the same page, is awareness to what we are talking about, because there is lot of terms that get thrown around in the media, there is lot of terms that get thrown around in the press in general, lot of terms that get thrown around in our organization. Since they emanate from a government source terminology, you know darn well, they are never going to be intuitive.","So, we walked through and tried to make some intuitiveness to it. We talked at length about the 232 steel tariffs. It took place early in the year, a 25% tariff that frankly had limited impact, direct impact on Fastenal, but does create a step up in the introduction of inflation in the marketplace. We talked about the 232 auto tariffs, a minimal impact. First off, they have been implemented, but secondly, even when they are, the focus for us is really understanding what that means to demand aspects of the North American marketplace, we also operate a pretty sizable fleet, we have about 6,500 Dodge Ram pickups parked in front of our branches, delivering product and making sales calls every day. We have a distribution infrastructure about 500 vehicles between semis and straight trucks, supporting our customers every day, and anything that impacts that category of our cost pool, we\u2019d be mindful of.","We talked at length about Section 301, because here is what it starts to change. Back in July, for lack of a better definition, our folks described it as List 1, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s an official name or just our name, but List 1 came out in July, and it involved about $34 billion in North American spend going into China, 25% tariff on that. As we\u2019ve talked about in previous discussions, that\u2019s pretty limited for us. There were some impacts. Again, it's about the element of inflation it\u2019s introducing into the economy. On August 23, a second list, list number two came out, that impacted about $16 billion worth of imports, again, there was a 25% tariff. While there were some impacts for Fastenal, it was relatively limited in and how it played out in our business. List 3 was announced on September 17, became effective September 24, so starting a number of weeks ago, it's directly impacting the North American supply chain for our customers. We are an important component of that North American supply chain for our customers in the marketplace in general, therefore, it has an impact on our business.","If I \u2013 an added piece to that is that meaningful impact that kicked in place a number of weeks ago is scheduled to go from 10% to 25% on January 1. Only time will tell what actually happens? It wasn't too long ago, it looked like NAFTA could easily fall apart into sort of a trilateral relationship, couple of bilateral relationships to 11th-hour, calmer heads prevailed. And while everything isn\u2019t a done deal yet, it appears that the differences that existed between the respective governments, respective countries have been largely resolved, and time will tell if the two sides of the Pacific Ocean will have a similar coming of the minds and anybody's guess on this call is as good as if not better than mine on how that will play out.","Our commitment is to our customer and our employee. Every day we balance this commitment with four overriding aspects of our covenant with our customer. One is a reliable supply to support their business, whether that is OEM fasteners, MRO fasteners, MRO non-fasteners, product going through our branch, our Onsite or vending, it doesn't matter. A reliable supply that consists of quantity and quality. One of the challenges with redirecting your supply chain or making changes to your supply chain, you can interrupt both of those and it impedes the ability to move quickly.","The second is value. We\u2019re all about total cost of ownership for our customer, that means time, that means price. We are managing through this. The third is ideas, solutions and alternatives. One aspect of our approach with our customer is suggesting alternatives to their supply chain to minimize the impact, again, that\u2019s our covenant with our customer. Finally, the health of our supply chain. That dictates everyday where we push and how hard we push on our supplier base because ultimately supplier that is not able to invest in their business is not a great long-term supplier in our supply chain. Our steps started three to four months ago, an active re-sourcing effort. The reality of it is \u2013 and this is that unique to Fastenal\u2019s business, this is true of the North American supply chain. A lot of categories are directly impacted by the Section 301, and they\u2019re meaningful spend if I look at the business in North America. Some categories of ours that really jump out that have big impacts, power transmission, electronics and batteries, plumbing, machinery, welding, paint supplies, material handling. These are items that actually have a really big impact. For us they are relatively small part of our business. So that's more of a issue for a supply chain that\u2019s going through other sources generally speaking than Fastenal because they are all as a percentage of our business, single-digits.","Number 11 on my list here of categories that are impacted is that the thing that\u2019s near and dear to our heart called fasteners. It\u2019s a meaningful impact for that group and that group is a big percentage of our spend. And as we have talked in the past, a large part of the North American supply chain and Fastenal supply chain comes through sources outside the United States or sources outside North America. And a high percentage of that source and this data is publicly available as far as where we import from, a good piece of that is coming from China and that\u2019s true in our business as well.","If I go a little deeper down the list, I see safety products, another one that\u2019s a meaningful component of our business because of our vending platform. One of the things that we have to help manage through it better than in the past is we have a great national account team and a great Onsite team, a great implementation team, a great engineering team and a great supply chain support infrastructure for that piece of our business. Those discussions have been going on in earnest. They continue to go on in earnest and we are shedding light to the supply chain of those customers and having discussions about prices and options.","Another piece is and we talked about this, not in great detail, in the July call, but we talked about it in meaningful detail in the April call about on our local pricing. Our tools for managing that weren\u2019t as sophisticated and frankly a lot of the tools we had for managing that disappeared over the last 3, 4, 5 years as we were plugging up backdoors to our point-of-sale system for changing prices in an effort to improve our security. In July, we rolled out a new means to manage local contract pricing or local pricing. Holden mentioned in our release that we got some improvement in our price cost inflation during the third quarter and we kept pace with the third quarter. That is a true and accurate statement for the third quarter.","One point I would make is we started this in July and really got traction in August. While at the third quarter we kept pace with the current inflation and we didn\u2019t get back any of the inflation we lost in the first two quarters of the year, in the month of September, if I look at our local pricing, we did achieve a very good claw back into that first and second quarter. And so we exit the quarter at a much better position than we entered the quarter or in what the quarter experienced and that\u2019s a positive from our business, from our standpoint, to be an efficient supply chain to manage that inflation dynamics in the marketplace and to manage the relative gross margin of each component of our business, but it was really shining through in September, not in July, August and September.","With that I am going to switch over to the flipbook and then I will transition over to Holden. If I look at the quarter, very good quarter, 13% sales growth in the third quarter of \u201818, that\u2019s our sixth straight quarter of sales growth greater than 10%, excellent leverage in the business. As we have talked about in the past, our big challenge as our growth was expanding was the incentive compensation component of our cost pool, at the branch, at the district, at the region, at the distribution center and the support functions throughout the organization as our growth came back in 2017 and 2018 and our earnings growth improved. We reloaded up on the incentive comp and we saw meaningful inflation, because the incentive comp was expanding, a very typical thing I would expect to see in the Fastenal business. We have anniversaried that now and you see it shining through in our ability to get operating leverage at the operating expense line.","The earnings per share grew 38.3% obviously aided by tax reform. Absent this, on 13% sales growth, we grew our earnings 15%. That\u2019s the fastest rate so far in the cycle. We are very pleased with that and we are proud of what our teams did. As Holden\u2019s point here, incremental pricing was realized in the third quarter, largely offset incremental cost increases in the period. We exited the quarter in a much different place.","Flipping over to Page 2, we signed 88 Onsites in the third quarter. We have talked in the past about participation and the importance of participation in our business. Last year through 9 months of the year, 64% of our district managers had signed in Onsite. We hang out for our district managers, if we can get to 80% participation on anything we do, we will be successful. Our goal is to hit 80% for the year. Through 9 months of 2018 that 64% has grown to 72%. Onsite is part of Fastenal. It\u2019s not a subset within Fastenal it\u2019s part of our business now and you are seeing it shine through in the numbers. We have signed 269 Onsites year-to-date. Last year, we signed 270 for the year.","Switching to vending, also part of our business now, like Onsite, we signed 5,877 vending devices in the quarter. There is 63 days in the quarter. We are signing 93 devices per day, not too far from hitting 100 devices signed each and every business day of the year. Our revenue in that is growing well. Our installed base is growing well. And we feel very good about in both of those, Onsite is probably going to be at the lower end of that range based on our run-rate and well into the range in case of vending signings. We are taking market share here and there is something special about Fastenal that our competitors cannot bring to the marketplace in the same way we can.","Total in-market locations, 3,089, if you look at it, we are up 116 year-over-year, which is about 4% increase. Branches are down 157, which is about a 6.5% decrease, but Onsites are up 273, almost a 50% increase, lot of numbers flying around here. What it means is as our business is morphing, our need for people is always important, because we are a service organization and that\u2019s what we represent for our customer, but it allows us to manage the business a little bit more efficiently from a headcount perspective and you are seeing that shine through in our numbers. National accounts grew 18% in the quarter, impressive team, both the sales team, the implementation team, as well as our service teams in our branches in Onsite. Non-U.S. daily sales, which are about 15% of our business, grew 20% in the quarter despite some pretty extensive foreign exchange headwinds and that shined through in our gross margin a bit as well.","With that, I am going to turn over to Holden.","Holden Lewis","Great. Thanks, Dan. Flipping over to Slide 5, as covered, total and daily sales were up 13% in the third quarter, which is consistent with the growth of the first half. This runs our monthly streak of 10% plus growth to 16 months, but perhaps as notable to say that adjusting for our acquisitions and foreign exchange, our August and September daily sales rate actually hit 14%. What that means is that nearly one and three quarters into the current year\u2019s \u2013 into the current expansionary cycle, we are still posting new highs for organic growth. We also estimate that pricing contributed between 120 and 170 basis points in the period, an increase from the first half when we did 50 to 100 basis points.","In addition to contribution from our growth drivers, as Dan discussed, this growth is supported by healthy macro conditions. The PMI averaged 59.7 in the third quarter and industrial production continues to expand at a low to mid single-digit rate. From a market standpoint, non-residential construction grew 16.2% and manufacturing grew 13%, in both cases, consistent with the prior quarter\u2019s growth. From a product standpoint, fasteners were up 10.8% and non-fasteners were up 14.9%, again in both cases in line with the second quarter levels. Lastly, from a customer standpoint, national accounts were up 18% in the quarter, with 79 of our top 100 accounts growing and non-national accounts grew mid to high single-digits, with nearly 67% of our branches growing. In terms of market tone, sentiment in the field remains constructive and we would characterize conditions being stable at high levels.","Now, sliding over to Slide 6, our gross margin was 48.1% in the third quarter, down 100 basis points from the third quarter last year. This was a larger decline than we expected, especially as the improved price realization largely neutralized incremental product cost increases we continued to experience in the quarter, roughly 80 basis points of this decline was from product and customer mix, higher branch freight expenses and higher growth allowances that are attributable to the sustained strong growth we are experiencing with our largest customers. The remainder is a function of foreign exchange and other organizational factors. Sequentially, we believe the lion\u2019s share of our 60 basis points decline is due to seasonality, foreign exchange and branch freight costs. As it relates to the outlook for price costs, we think that being able to neutralize the impact of inflation in the third quarter speaks to our rebuilding of pricing muscle memory in the organization and the effectiveness of the tools we have introduced. These will be helpful as the situation with tariffs play out. Still, the latter likely means we have not seen the end of product cost increases and until greater clarity comes to the market, it\u2019s difficult to know how price costs will play out in the upcoming quarters.","Our operating margin was 20.5% in the third quarter, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Strong volumes drove 130 basis points of cost leverage and generated an incremental margin of 23.1%. Looking at the pieces, we achieved 50 basis points of leverage over employee-related costs, growth in incentive compensation outpaced sales and profits, but it did moderate versus where we were last year. Occupancy-related costs were up 2.3% generating 50 basis points of leverage. Lower branch costs were offset by higher costs related to non-branch facilities with the increase deriving from higher vending expenses to support the growth in our installed base. We realized an additional 40 basis points of leverage from general corporate expenses. Putting it all together, the third quarter of 2018 EPS were $0.69, excluding a discrete tax item, this would have been $0.68 or up 37% from the third quarter of 2017. In the absence of tax reform and the lower rate that it provides to us, EPS would have been $0.57 and growth would have been 15%. We continue to anticipate a tax rate of 24.5% to 25% absent refinements in the application of or discrete events arising from the recent tax reform.","Flipping to Page 7, we generated $185 million in operating cash in the third quarter, which is 93% of net income. This is a lower conversion rate than we might typically see in third quarters, which relates to working capital that I will cover that in a moment. Net capital spending in the third quarter was $35 million bringing our year-to-date outlays to $89 million, an increase of 16% over the first 9 months to 2017. The timing of outlays is such that we do expect higher spending in the fourth quarter for expansions and upgrades at our properties as well as IT assets than we have seen in any of the first three quarters of 2018. However, given the rate of spending to this point in the year, we are reducing our 2018 capital spending projection to $152 million for our previous $158 million. We increased funds paid out in dividends to shareholders by 25% to $115 million and we finished the quarter with debt at 14.4% of total capital below last year and last quarter and at levels that provide ample liquidity to take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business.","The picture of our working capital grew more challenging in the third quarter. Inventories were up 14.1% in the period. Representing the first quarter were growth in inventory has outpaced growth in sales to the fourth quarter of 2016 and that\u2019s largely due to inflation beginning to ripple through our balance sheet. Receivables grew 22.2% in the third quarter. This continued to be affected by growth in our national accounts and international businesses both of which tend to have longer terms than our business as a whole, but the biggest factor continues to be customers pushing payments past quarter end, a trend that we have seen since the fourth quarter of 2017. After that moderated last quarter, it intensified again in the third quarter, but we have not seen any meaningful change in hard-to-collect balances, the quality of our receivables remains solid.","That\u2019s all for our formal presentation. And with that operator, we will move to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Cieslak with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Ryan Cieslak","Hey, good morning guys.","Dan Florness","Good morning.","Holden Lewis","Good morning.","Ryan Cieslak","Yes. I guess the first question I just wanted to go back to the gross margin comments weaker than expected versus our model, it seemed like maybe below what you guys were expecting as well. Holden, maybe sequentially, it sounds like the freight component once again it creeped up and it was a big factor there. Could you just discuss what changed this quarter versus last quarter, and do you view this more as transitory or how do we think about freight costs certainly for the balance of the year, but even as we get into next year?","Holden Lewis","Yes, I think that costs continue to go up from a freight standpoint, and I think we have talked about how we did a nice job offsetting some of those issues in the second quarter, we talked a little bit about moving more product on to our own trucks, doing a better job sort of finding means of generating additional revenue and we still worked through that in Q3, but pricing is still a challenge. And I would say that, that is a part of the equation still. Now, the impact from freight was more meaningful on a year-over-year basis than it was on a sequential basis, make no mistake right, but I think if you look from a sequential standpoint, I think that you are looking at seasonality played a role, I think foreign exchange certainly played a role. And then you do get into some drag from branch freight and some of the customer allowances, but they are relatively smaller. So, I think that the impact from freight was more annual than it was sequential.","Dan Florness","Sequential, one thing we are seeing and this has been our mantra all year is fuel prices are what they are whether whether that is diesel going into our semi fleet or gasoline going into our pick-up fleet. The real mantra is charge freight where it\u2019s appropriate, and we\u2019ve been a \u2013 we\u2019ve seen a pretty consistent level of that. And use our trucks, the challenge to our branch employees, our Onsite employees -- use our trucks, a challenge to our supply chain, use our trucks because it\u2019s a lower cost and we\u2019ve seen some success in that as we\u2019ve gone through the year.","Ryan Cieslak","Okay. So, it doesn\u2019t sound like there is anything unusual or one-time in nature as it relates to freight here in the quarter. So, I know you guys aren\u2019t big on giving your quarterly guidance on gross margins, but directionally is the 48.1% that you put up, good starting point and should we be thinking about just normal sequential progression into the fourth quarter or is there something that we should be thinking about where you see it maybe playing out better than that going into the fourth quarter?","Holden Lewis","Yes. As it relates to the freight side of it, no, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unusual there. Honestly, I have to say it\u2019s been fairly impressive the degree to which the field has been able to move some product off of third-parties on to our own fleet and other things of that nature, as Dan said fuel is a big issue. So, as it relates to branch \u2013 to branch freight or freight generally, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unusual there. As it relates to gross margin more broadly, yes, I think thinking about typical seasonality is not unreasonable here. There are certainly some comp give and takes as we move into Q4, freight being one of those. It is in Q4 last year that we began to see a lot of these costs really beginning to move up, right. So, I mean, that\u2019s one where there might be some easier comps, but there are some other items in there that might be less favorable comps. So, I think if you think about the gives or takes, I feel like you should probably think about the seasonality. And the one perhaps caution I\u2019ll give there is, seasonality is usually maybe 20 basis points to 40 basis points lower in fourth quarter than third quarter. It also tends to be a much more volatile quarter than is typical in terms of where that comes through. I think that we can find some gives and takes that move us to the high end of that and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to strive to do, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to think in terms of normal seasonality at this point.","Dan Florness","I\u2019ll just \u2013 I\u2019ll chime in with a couple positives when I think about going into the fourth quarter. We exited the quarter in a better position than we entered the quarter from the standpoint of our pricing in general because of things we\u2019ve put in place in July and August, point number one. Point number two, one of our hard presses on our folks as it relates to all the noise, the turmoils going on right now is be engaged with your customer from the standpoint of product substitution. That tends over historically to help us from a gross margin perspective. And so, when I look at that, there\u2019s some built-in enlist to it and \u2013 but we\u2019ll continue to have the impact that we\u2019ve seen in the mix of our business, and that\u2019s not a new thing. The last piece is, one component of our gross margin centers on the volume allowances that either go to customers or come from suppliers. When I look at that, some years you will have a bias towards what direction one or the other might go depending on the relative strength of that of our overall growth for the year because a lot of those programs are calendar-based. As we\u2019ve been seeing as we\u2019ve gone through the year, the customer side, strong growth in national accounts, so there\u2019s a piece there but nothing new as far as any kind of change sequentially. If I look at it on the supplier side, sometimes you can get an uptick or a downtick in the fourth quarter depending on where the programs come out. With our strong growth this year, the bias is toward up not down. So, I would look at that and say on the ledger there\u2019s more things that are \u2013 ignoring seasonality, more things that are biased up versus down.","Ryan Cieslak","Okay, that\u2019s helpful, and then just for my follow-up. Last quarter you guys gave sort of an initial estimate of what you think the direct exposure was to China from a sourcing standpoint as a percentage of your COGS. Any update there certainly as you\u2019ve gone through, there\u2019s some additional lists have come out, I\u2019m sure you guys have done some additional work around that. And then just how do we think about maybe just directionally going into next year, I know you guys have always talked about mix always being a net negative to your gross margins. Should we think about the tariff situation also being a net negative to your gross margins next year or they are \u2013 is it too early to tell at this point? Thanks.","Dan Florness","I think it\u2019s \u2013 on that \u2013 there is a number of things punched into that question. So, as you unwind it from a tariff perspective, it\u2019s way too early to gauge because we don\u2019t know what the next leg is going to be, is there going to be a next leg. We don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to be sitting here in March and 10 is at 25 or 10 is at 10 or 10 is at zero, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s on the SKUs it\u2019s on today, if it\u2019s on expanded list or a contracted list. So I don\u2019t think anybody can intelligently predict that today. I do know we have a really good plan for how we are approaching it. If I look at historically, we have talked about and I am a big believer in transparency, I might be a little opaque here, because I don\u2019t want to put our field team in a bad position from the standpoint. If I sat down with 10 different customers, the percentage of what they are buying that\u2019s sourced in one country to another or in different parts of the world in general can vary dramatically depending on if it is a fastener. Fastener products have a very high content of imported products and a lot of that is coming out of China. So if you think about that third of our business, a big piece of that is sourced globally and most of that had moved outside of North America before we even started in business back in the late 60s. And so that 35% is a pretty big piece. On the non-fasteners, it\u2019s also a quite large piece. And this isn\u2019t just a comment about Fastenal this is a comment about supply chains in general. So, I would expect most companies you will find is that you are going to have over half of their business is sourced outside of North America and a meaningful piece of that out of China and you would see the same, but I don\u2019t want to get into specifics beyond that, because one customer and might impact what they are spending 10%, another customer might be 30%.","Holden Lewis","But Ryan, I think yes, just to touch on last call, you are right, I mean, I had indicated at that call that we were looking at basically roughly 10% of our products sourced from China and that there was a chunk of that, where it was just a guess right, just a guess because one quarter of our total buys across the company are bought by the field rather than corporately. And this local capability to buy is a big reason for our industry outgrowth, but it also reduces the visibility. And as you said, we have sharpened our pencils on this and we are trying not to be overly specific about it, but I think it is fair to say that our number is north of that 10% range that I had indicated earlier. So that is definitely a larger number that comes directly from China.","Dan Florness","In fairness to Holden, I felt he was answering a different question on that call or I would correct him on the spot. I know he was talking about the first rounds being a single digit, a low percentage impact and that realized the intent of his answer. And not all that 30% \u2013 not all that amount is going to be captured in this first round, so we will see what happens going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning. Thank you. My first question is \u2013 just the first question is around working capital, it seems like it\u2019s a much bigger source of cash the first three quarters this year than the last number of years. Clearly, some of that is inventory, but a lot of that is AR, so maybe just walk us through our customers just being later or just walk us through sort of how you think about that be as that normalize or just any color there would be great?","Dan Florness","So I will throw in a few pieces because I have been a few years on my belt that Holden didn\u2019t have yet. If you think about our business, our local, if you go back years ago, our days on \u2013 our days to collect would have been better, because our business was primarily a local business. And if I look at our local business, which is roughly half our revenue, you would see that our stats for that business is largely unchanged from what it would have been 10, 15, 20 years ago. In the last 20 years, we have gone from 2%, 3% from our revenue be in national account, so 52% of our revenue being national account and we have gone from international being two locations in Southern Ontario to 15% of our revenue. Two things I can tell you what national customers and international customers in general, they pay slower than our local customers. And so they have been attributing to 70% of our growth between Onsites and lot of things we do Onsite spending etcetera really go towards a larger key account in that local market, whether it\u2019s a national account or not, but a larger customer and oftentimes their ability to negotiate terms that are linked to growing the business occur and so there is some structural aspects to it. The offset to that is that they also drive volume through our branch network and over time allow us to continually drive down the days of inventory on hand, because we are leveraging it across the bigger revenue base. So it\u2019s finding that balance, but it creates some challenges in near-term.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. And then just a follow-up question is sort of how do you think about sort of headcount growth going forward? I realize your sales are growing a lot faster, but at the same time your business mix has shifted more to Onsite. So, is historically the relationship between sales growth and headcount growth different now that the model is changed or just any thoughts on how you think about that piece would be great? Thank you.","Holden Lewis","Yes, Hamzah. So, I think it\u2019s fair to say I believe that the source of our headcount growth has diversified over the past few years, right. There was a time when we were heavily branch oriented, where most of our headcount was going into the branches and we are adding branches and filling those out. As we have become as reliant on the Onsites and vending, national account growth, then a lot of the headcount that we add is coming outside of the branches, perhaps to a degree that was not true 10 years ago, let\u2019s say. And we should be able to build a fairly significant revenue base off of that headcount relative to what we have been able to achieve before. I think it\u2019s fair to say that in the past, we would have had to throw a lot of bodies and heads into growing the revenues. And today, I think that there is more leverage in the model for headcount growth than it has been the case in the past. That said, growing 13% does require investment in the business and that investment is in the form of headcount both in the branches as well as outside of the branches and we began to see in August and September those numbers begin to tick up and we would expect to continue to add branches to support our growth going forward.","Dan Florness","What I might add, if you look at the table in the press release, we talk about absolute employee headcount and I am talking about the in-market locations and then the FTE employee headcount in-market locations and you see the FTE growing a bit faster than the absolute. I have challenged our team to add a little bit more absolute, but to build to our recruiting pool and the way we build staff in our branch is we aggressively go into 4-year state colleges, 2-year technical colleges and recruit and ask you to come work for us part time while they are still in school. And those numbers need to be built a little bit. But if you add 1% to that number, for example, it doesn\u2019t translate into 1% FTE, because it translates into about a half and it\u2019s a less expensive FTE and you don\u2019t do it for the cost, you do it for the recruiting pool of the future. And so you will see that pickup a little bit, but will be very I believe efficient at managing the expense of that component.","Hamzah Mazari","Okay. And then just lastly I will turn it over, just to make sure we are consistent with how you are thinking about tariffs. At this moment, you are sort of not quantifying how much of your business is directly sourced in China or you are sort of not quantifying how much of the business is sourced in China that is impacted by tariffs, because I realized those are two different numbers?","Dan Florness","There is a subset of SKUs that we do import from China that are impacted. That subset is much larger in some of those categories I touched about earlier. In fasteners, it\u2019s about, it\u2019s 10, 11 down the list as far as subcategories. And so it hasn\u2019t been fully impacted. If you look at it on a lot of things that I have been looking at, the fact that it\u2019s about half of the imports coming in are of that $500 billion are now tariffed, that\u2019s not too far off the mark of what we are seeing in our business too.","Hamzah Mazari","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Adam Uhlman","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Dan Florness","Good morning.","Adam Uhlman","Sticking with that theme I guess, when you think about the strategy here in the medium term of your purchasing strategy, I guess should we expect the company to be pre-buying ahead of what potentially could be bigger price increases for those tariff-related products from China or are you looking to resource items from other countries more aggressively and not pre-buy? I guess I am just trying to think through the inventory cadence here through the next quarter or two?","Dan Florness","I\u2019d say \u2013 I\u2019d say yes to each and every one of those to a certain degree and no to another, and that is we started some months ago in earnest looking at where we\u2019re sourcing, and \u2013 but you also have to look at it from the standpoint of what\u2019s the alternative source, is there capacity available, is the quality the same and what\u2019s the price point. We could boost some stuff out of China to another source, if you add 5%, 6%, 7% and that 10% is there for the next three years, that\u2019s a good decision. If you add \u2013 if you do that and you add 15% or 20% or 30% to the cost, it\u2019s a really bad idea. It becomes a less bad idea if 10% goes to 25% and it sticks. So, in an environment where there\u2019s political variability as opposed to economic variability, makes it very challenging to plan. And the biggest thing is having a good open dialog with your customer, but also understanding for a lot of our customers what we spend is a relatively small part of their spend or what we sell is a relatively small part of their spend, so, it\u2019s creating the least amount of disruption to their supply chain, but we have redirected some already. As far as buying ahead, the problem with that is the \u2013 predicting exactly what\u2019s going to be needed and where and for some items you can do it. But again, depending on what\u2019s going to happen because supply chains \u2013 when we order stuff today it\u2019s not coming in next week or next month, it\u2019s coming in three, four months from now. So, you have some limited ability to do that, but to the extent we can redirect some, absolutely we\u2019ve been doing that. But Adam, just to sort of flesh out the question, the inventory I would not expect it to move meaningfully based on pre-bought volumes. Again, we\u2019ve looked into it, there is tight capacity for products in a lot of places and we didn\u2019t have the ability to meaningfully ramp up the amount that we pre-purchased based on what is pre-existing tight capacity.","Adam Uhlman","Okay, thanks for that. And then just related to that, I guess, historically, what do you think the lag has been for your national account customer price realization relative to your cost inflation and the efforts that you put into place recently, it\u2019s good to see in September price cost is covering what you\u2019d done with earlier in the year. I guess, should we expect that there is any difference as we start to think about 2019 in terms of your ability to pass along those higher cost to those big customers that push back so hard?","Dan Florness","Well the \u2013 it\u2019s always going to be an intimate discussion with every customer and some it\u2019s a willingness to peer into the supply chain, flexibility on source supply. OEM fasteners has a different dynamic to it than MRO fasteners for example. But historically, the pricing we saw in September that\u2019s more on our local customer where timeframe is different, and because it\u2019s so diffused that was challenging us earlier in the year because we didn\u2019t have great tools to manage it. If I think of our national account relationships, most of that is historically on a \u2013 kind of a six-month window that we can move pricing. And obviously extreme \u2013 certain commodities don\u2019t fall into that if it\u2019s things like stainless, which has much more variability, we tightened that window up. In the case of something like this, where it\u2019s a political event, you do have the ability to accelerate that as does our supply base to accelerate that window because the stuff we\u2019re buying last summer that or last fall that came in on September 20, doesn\u2019t have a tariff, if it came in four days later, it does. So, it\u2019s not about when you ordered, it\u2019s about when it crossed the border. And so it\u2019s being very mindful of that, and sometimes \u2013 and that can change the timing window, but historically it would have been about a six-month window.","Adam Uhlman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Evelyn Chow with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Evelyn Chow","Hi, good morning, Dan and Holden.","Dan Florness","Good morning.","Holden Lewis","Good morning.","Evelyn Chow","So, I guess first question I have for you is just kind of thinking about inflationary impact on your inventory. Is there any meaningful difference in your turn on the fastener versus non-fastener pieces of your portfolio? And then how do we start thinking about the impact of some of this inflation on your buy noting that pre-buy has been challenging for you?","Dan Florness","The terms on the fasteners will be somewhat slower than the turns on the non-fasteners, simply because we source a much greater proportion of fasteners from overseas than we do non-fasteners, not just from China, but from other countries as well. I don\u2019t think it would be unexpected to suggest that the vast majority of our fasteners spend is from outside the U.S. and significantly in Asia. And so you are going to have a longer turn on fasteners than you will on non-fasteners. Our non-fasteners also carry more of a branded component to them. That lends itself too. We are sourcing it domestically. Now, it might have been manufactured offshore, but we are sourcing it domestically and therefore you have a tighter window too as far as turns.","Evelyn Chow","Right. Makes sense, yes. And then I guess maybe on a sort of related point to this, appreciate that it\u2019s challenging to quantify right now exactly what the impact to your COGS might be from List 3 in particular, but just thinking sort of lot of your fastener buy is from outside the U.S., some proportion of your buy that\u2019s non-fasteners is also outside the U.S. Is there any thought as to maybe pulling back on how much the field is sort of permitted to dictate the buy and make that sort of more top down in this challenging inflationary backdrop?","Dan Florness","I don\u2019t know if I would phrase it as permitted to buy. I think ultimately our customer decides what supply channel is best for their business from the standpoint of their end customer what they expect. We have domestic capabilities too, where from a distribution perspective, we have the largest \u2013 when I look at our peers we have the largest manufacturing of fasteners capability in our industry. And so we manufacture \u2013 35% of our revenue is fasteners. We manufacture about 5% of what we sell. So, 5% of that 35%, we manufacture domestically for the most part. Look, we have some operations in Europe and Asia as well, but most of our operations are domestic. And there is a customer base that wants that. The reality of it is for fasteners and for non-fasteners there is not capacity to handle it domestically, even if we wanted to move more domestically, the capacity doesn\u2019t exist, because the fastener capacity that\u2019s retained in this country, we are a meaningful piece of it, because of what we have done, but much of it has moved offshore, again, lot of that back in the \u201850s, \u201860s and \u201870s.","Holden Lewis","Yes, Evelyn, you have to also remember that the ability of our folks in the field to make decisions about what their customers need is a real important piece to how we service the customer and how we achieve the kind of outgrowth that we do. Now, we have obviously encouraged the field to wherever possible, maybe to use exclusive brands as sort of a product substitution, look for product within our network as opposed to having to go outside of our network, because obviously where we have scale in purchasing we can do \u2013 we can address the issues of inflation more greatly, but I think it would be a mistake to take something which has served us so well culturally and in terms of growth over such a long period of time and begin to uproot those kinds of things. I think we are far better off taking the relationships that those local sales folks have, have those conversations, use the tools that have never been better, use the experience they have in sort of having these conversations which again has never been better and continue to service the customer in that way.","Evelyn Chow","Understood. And then maybe if I can just sneak in one on Onsites, I think you noted that you are tracking a little closer to the lower end of the range for the year. I guess what are some of the drivers of that expectation and then do we still think about a 360 to 385 type run-rate into next year?","Holden Lewis","Well, I think the expectation is if we look at the first three quarters, we divide by three, multiply by four and it gets you to the math, right. How fourth quarter plays out, we will see. It\u2019s entirely possible that we will sign enough to be inside that range. And so it\u2019s really just math, Evelyn. I will say this, if we come in at the low end of the range, around the low end of the range that will be as an effective job that we have done in any year of actually hitting that range. And let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that whether it\u2019s 360 or 355 or 365, that\u2019s up from 270 last year and represents significant sort of buy-in and execution on the part of the organization. So, I would perhaps put that perspective. With respect to what our expectations are for next year, frankly, we haven\u2019t addressed that yet. I think we will have more to say about that as we get into the fourth quarter, but we haven\u2019t set that range at this point.","Evelyn Chow","Alright. Thanks, guys.","Dan Florness","Thank you. We will take one last question and then we will wrap up the call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning. This is Bhupender sitting in for Nigel here.","Dan Florness","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","So I just wanted to go through the third quarter, pretty nice average daily sales growth here in the quarter, especially for September. And Holden, like you mentioned about the tariffs which became effective September 24, just wanted to see if we can get some color did you see any kind of pre-buy in the quarter before that deadline actually for the tariff went into effect?","Holden Lewis","Are you talking about from a customer perspective or supply perspective?","Unidentified Analyst","I mean if you can give color from a customer perspective that will be good too.","Dan Florness","Yes. I will chime in on that. If you think of what we do, we provide real time supply chain for our customers and that\u2019s our value. When the customer needs something they walk over and they push a button on a vending machine and they instantly have what they need, their safety glasses, a pair of gloves, etcetera. When they are producing something, they reach over and they grab in a bin and grab the fastener they need to assemble the item they are producing. If they are doing maintenance, they go to a bin and grab it. So the value we bring is the sourcing of products we supply. There is no sourcing cost. It\u2019s available when I need it. So, it doesn\u2019t really lend itself to pre-buying. So I would say there is no pre-buying in our numbers from the context of any of our revenue numbers in the third quarter or earlier in the year for that matter.","Holden Lewis","And I have asked that question specifically of the RVPs every month in the last couple of quarters and the feedback from them is very much the same. They have not seen any indication that our products are being pre-bought and stockpiled if you will ahead of these sorts of things. Now, I can\u2019t tell you that\u2019s not happening somewhere else in the supply chain, but as it relates to our products and our supply chain, it\u2019s not something that any of our RVPs or corporation is seeing.","Dan Florness","I am going to close up the call with just two quick thoughts. In the last two quarters, I have touched on something that we have never touched on as a company and that is the traction we are seeing in the ease of ordering for our customer through what we call Fastenal Express or Web. I personally have been making use of the system. And I have been probably wearing our team a little bit with things to make it easier, to make it more intuitive as a buy. And I was sharing with our board the other day, I said, yes, a couple of weeks ago I bought a case of filters, I sent the order in, a little after two, little after three I got a reply, order is ready to pickup and I stopped over there a little after 4 and picked it up. Last night, as I was leaving, after 5 o\u2019clock, I ordered a couple of rolls of Talon duct tape, that\u2019s our brand, in case anybody is curious, as well as Fastenal Jobber drill bit set, I ordered that late in the day. At 8:02 this morning, I had an e-mail from Fastenal. My order is ready to pickup. That\u2019s measuring fulfillment of any type of order, whether it\u2019s a vending machine, a bin, an e-commerce order in minutes and hours, not in days. And that transaction is a more efficient transaction for us. And that freight is part of our normal shipping network. What we are finding is between 93% and 94% of the time our customers buy online, they are picking it up at the Onsite or at the branch. They want certainty of supply and they want great availability.","Second item I will touch on is we recently had Hurricane Florence hit the Southeastern part of the United States. I am thankful to say that Fastenal and our Fastenal employees and our customers came through it largely undamaged. I love hearing the stories from customers and employees alike about fellow Fastenal Blue Team members stepping into support them. We are hours away from Hurricane Michael hitting the panhandle of Florida. I believe Panama City is dead in its sites. Our best wishes and thoughts and prayers are with our team and our customers and the folks in that area. Thanks everybody. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thanks for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Ellen Trester of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.","Ellen Trester","Welcome to the Fastenal Company 2013 Annual and Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call will be hosted by Will Oberton, our Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Florness, our Chief Financial Officer. Also present is Lee Hein, our President. The call will last for up to 45 minutes.","The call will start with a general overview of our quarterly results and operations by Will and Dan, with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers.","Today's conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal.

Go ahead, Mr. Oberton.","Willard D. Oberton","Thank you, Ellen, thank you for joining us today. As all of you have seen, the fourth quarter 2013 was not a good quarter for Fastenal.","Starting out with the sales. December was slow, but overall, we felt pretty good about the quarter from a sales standpoint. Both October and November were on track, and December is always a difficult month with the way the holidays falls. We kind of throw that out. So overall, we think we're moving in the right direction from a sales standpoint.","The big disappointment in the quarter was obviously the margin. Going into the quarter, the trend was going in the wrong direction, but we thought we could change that. And as it turned out, the trend actually went further down. I've spent a lot of time in the last month looking at the margin, trying to understand and breaking it down the things caused by lower -- excuse me, lower volume, freight issues and things like that, will come back in the first quarter and we believe that, that'll get us somewhere in our 51% to 53% range. Dan will cover that better.","I've also spent a lot of time looking at other things, other opportunities that we have: improving our freight program, looking at very low-margin business and other opportunities, buying product better. And we have a lot of momentum within the company in improving the margin right now because, as you probably know, this a big part of our pay program for all the people in the field, so there's a lot of energy there. They're less happy about it than you are.","So I'm very confident that with the snap -- or the jump back of the mechanical parts of the margin and the energy that we have in, we should see nice improvement in the first quarter.","One bright spot in the quarter was our expense control. We added hundreds of people in the stores, and we were still able to manage our expenses. Our SG&A expense is about where we thought they would be, actually a little lower than we had earlier thought they would be with the additional labor. So I want to give a shout out to the Fastenal team that's on. They really worked hard in controlling the expenses. As the sales come back, if we can continue to control our expenses, I think we'll be in a very good position.","Another area that I am very positive on are the vending numbers. Although the signings dropped considerably, more than we thought they would, we really have been focusing on quality versus quantity. And when you look at the numbers, the customers that have -- that are using or deploying our vending systems now make up over 36% of our revenue. That group of customers in the third quarter grew at about, I believe, it was 15.2% or 15.3%. That jumped up to 18.7% growth in the quarter. So if you annualize that business, it's a greater than $1 billion business that's growing close to 20% in this environment. We're very, very positive on that, and we're going to continue to work hard at signing machines.","We've lost a little momentum on that. So what I would look at for the 2014 calendar year, it'll be a little bit -- be the opposite of last year. We'll probably start slow and end strong because there's a lot of momentum, a lot of people are working on trying to move the machines and pick up that pace. Looking at a similar year to 2014 is what we're predicting -- or, excuse me, 2013.","'Pathway to profit.' Again, the progress was slow, but that's a simple story. Without sales and margin, you can't grow your pretax earnings as a percentage of sales. But Dan, Lee and I have spent some time talking about that and we're all very confident that our goals are correct and that they're very achievable goals.","So just looking at the quarter, or more importantly, looking forward, what is the direction? I'm feeling good about this quarter and the rest of 2014. The biggest reason for that is we have our people in place. We've added about 900 people in the stores, we've added another 100 people outside the stores in selling capacities, National Accounts sales specialists. We've done a nice job of putting our leadership people in place. We've added 3 regional vice presidents. We've added more than 50 district managers. Those people are now in place and they're working hard and we're seeing good results from that.","Another positive is I believe, and even if the economy doesn't come roaring back, it does feel like the environment is getting better. And I know Dan has some numbers he's going to cover on that. So we have the people in place. We have the leadership. We have a lot of motivated people because it hasn't been a good quarter financially for the team, not just the high-level team, but all the way down to the district managers. There are a lot of people that are working very hard to drive the business in the right direction.","With that, I'll turn it over to Dan and then take questions later. Thank you.","Daniel L. Florness","Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call today. Before I start with some of the comments, I thought I'd start out -- I think what's best is to get something on the table. First off, want to apologize for the quarter, and probably as importantly, apologize for the need to put out an early announcement and not being 100% accurate on that early announcement. We are optimists. That's never going to change. We expect much of our organization and of ourselves and that, as well, is never going to change.","The story is really about one of gross margin. That was what prompted us to put out the early announcement. It afforded us the opportunity to talk frankly and openly and aggressively internally to fix some things that were going in the wrong direction.","We're always conscious of the fact that we're -- being a public company with a meaningful multiple, we are careful what we say and what we don't say, internally and externally, because things can get out and we wanted to be upfront with everybody on that.","Gross margin dropped 109 basis points, as Will touched on. Utilization was a piece of that, as well as vendor allowances. Those pieces are mechanical. Those pieces will correct themselves and that's what I believe pushes us back into that 51% to 53% range. But the time that we had in the last several weeks of December, the first several weeks of this month, have afforded us the opportunity to go aggressively internally. There are some things that stand out, and I think this speaks to our ability to fix some of the issues. All things are not created equal. Margin didn't deteriorate equally in all stores. Like anything else, there's a subset. Our folks have tools to use for how to price products. Some use them very well and some need work on it. Some need more involvement from the district manager. We've been expanding our district manager pool as we've gone through the year, which I believe gives us the oversight to be able to fix some of these pieces quicker. And I believe we can improve our gross margin as we go into Q1, outside of the mechanical things that are there.","End market mix continues to be a struggle point for us, as you can see, is the fastener, as a percentage of our business, continues to whittle down. I thought I'd share some numbers here, and I'm always a little cautious to share these numbers because I don't want a dizzying commentary coming out but -- so it might make sense for the analysts on the call to grab a pen and paper right now and jot down a few notes.","We've talked in the past about manufacturing and how big a piece of our business manufacturing is. It's about half our business. The other half is about -- half of the remaining half, so about 25% of our business, is construction-centered and the other 1\/4 of our business is a whole bunch of things that add up to that number. But when I -- because we're a fastener company, a lot of our manufacturing is in the NAICS category that's known as heavy manufacturing. And the way our data is laid out, the way the NAICS information is laid out, NAICS is North American Industry Classification System, I believe, there's a heavy manufacturing group, there's a medium manufacturing group and there's a light manufacturing group. We don't do -- as a percentage of our sales, the light manufacturing is relatively small. And a lot of that comes from the fact that starting out as a fastener company, a lot of our business, because we weren't more of an MRO supplier, lends itself to people that use a lot of metal. Medium manufacturing, the light and medium, combined, is about 10% of our business. The heavy manufacturing group is about 40% of our overall company business, so it's about 80% of our manufacturing business. And again, I looked at it and that makes sense to me because, again, a high percentage of our business is fasteners and you have a lot of OEM fasteners being used in that business.","If I look at our manufacturing business in total. Over the course of this year, that business grew about 7% in the first quarter. It grew about 6% in the second quarter. It grew about 5% in the third. In the numbers we just reported this morning, it grew 7.2% in the fourth quarter. So it did see an uptick. If I look at the -- and clearly, for that to have an uptick, it has to be driven by some things that are going on in the heavy manufacturing subset. The heavy manufacturing subset grew about 7% in the first quarter, grew about 5% in the second quarter, so it was weighing down that 6% overall manufacturing number. It grew about 3% in the third quarter, so it was weighing down even more the overall manufacturing group. In the fourth quarter, that group grew, depending on the month, between 6% and 7%, so we did see a marked change in the growth pattern and that's what drove our overall manufacturing to be up just over 7% for the quarter.","Some of that is comp because last year -- later in the year, that piece of business was slowing down. So I thought I'd -- just to confuse the discussion, I thought I'd take a look at it from one more perspective and that is what happened from Q3 to Q4? What's going on? Is there anything going on in the trends of that business? Last year, that business dropped, consistent with the company, from Q3 to Q4, of about 5.5%. And that drop off to our business from Q3 to Q4 is not a new phenomenon because 2 things happen in the fourth quarter that impact our business: one is you have a lot of holidays going on that provide for periods where you have shutdowns in plants and facilities, whether that be over Thanksgiving weekend or around the Christmas, New Year time -- holiday period. And that could be influenced in the Christmas, New Year time frame by timing within the week.","Heavy manufacturing in the company this year -- well, the company was down 5.2%, I believe, from Q3 to Q4. The heavy manufacturing was only down 4%, and so there was a change in the trend of our -- of the biggest piece of our manufacturing from Q3 to Q4. On the flip side of that coin, we did see our construction business fall off more than normal from Q3 to Q4. And I believe that has more to do with the timing of the holidays in December than it does with anything else. And so I do believe we've seen a change in our heavy manufacturing from Q3 to Q4. We'll see how that plays out. It's no secret, on earlier calls, I've expressed skepticism to the ISM and I still do, but I do believe there are some improvements in the patterns and we'll see how that plays out as we go into 2014.","As it relates to -- again, historically, we've shied away from any kind of commentary on the current month and the real reason being whenever we do it, we're wrong. Whenever we do it, we're wrong. And so I'm not going to explicitly go into, here's what I think we're going to do for growth in the first quarter -- well, excuse me, in the month of January. We published within the confines of our releases what we think are normal sequential patterns, and we hold to those normal sequential patterns. We think they have meaning. Clearly, the weight -- the impact of our heavy manufacturing and the subset of that, that is heavy equipment manufacturing, weighed heavily on our numbers in 2013. But I asked our technology folks to take a look at how we -- when we communicate with our stores, in any given day, we have 2,700 points of contact out there that we're talking to electronically every day and we're gathering information from. And in any given day -- business day, in any given business month, you have some stores that for whatever reason either don't connect for one -- on a particular day or they have -- they connect but their sales are incredibly low and so there appears to be something impacting that business that day. And so we looked at it not from trying to quantify dollars, not from trying to gauge dollars, but just saying based on our 2,700 points of contact and the number of stores in that group that have some type of impact that we see just in the transmission information, either the connected or a minimum level of sales, what we saw in the first -- and this is through Friday of last week in January, we saw about a 16% impairment in the level of activity. So we are getting off to a slower start in January. With that said, the last 3 days have -- we have been seeing much stronger sales patterns. Some of that is normalcy coming back in our business. Some of that is, last week, Indianapolis, our distribution center in Indianapolis was shut down for several days. The trucking network was shut down due to very, very severe weather in the state of Indiana. Certain counties, it's my understanding the state of Indiana had a state of emergency and so that did impact our business. So we've had 3 very strong days. Part of that is product getting through our -- Indianapolis is kind of our center point, if you will, of trucks transferring between different geographic areas of the country. Those trucks are getting through, and those sales that had been slid off early part of the week are coming through in the last 3 days and we're seeing strong patterns. So we are internally optimistic on our ability to have a strong January. We did get off to a slow start because of the weather.","That is all the commentary I have. I think the earnings release is self-explanatory in its detail. At this point, we would open up for call -- for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First, Dan, if you can just clarify the comment, the 16% impairment, I'm just not sure what that means or how to read that. Are you implying that, that's related to sales trends?","Daniel L. Florness","No, not at all. There's no weighting in that number, Dave. So we have 2,700 point-of-sale locations out there. And those locations, you have a store here that's doing $700,000 a month, a store over here that's doing $30,000 a month. There is no weighting to that number. What it's really doing and it's saying, looking across that -- the one thing I always want to be -- we want to be careful of is that we don't skew our commentary based on who we've talked to or who speaks the loudest. So if -- we live in Minnesota here. We're on the border with Wisconsin. If we're talking to some district managers in Wisconsin and Minnesota because southern half of Wisconsin is belted with snow, that isn't necessarily indicative of our business nationwide or across the continent or around the planet. So merely try to look at it from the standpoint of looking at those points of contact. And if you expect X number to be with a substandard level of sales in any given day, is there a difference between what we've seen in the last -- actually, the last 3 years? And through last Friday, we saw about a 16% increase in the number of locations that had a weird day, either they didn't hook -- set up for communicating at all or they set up for communicating but they did $12 in sales. That tells me there's -- maybe there's a store manager that's logging in from home and doing some work or that they've made it into the office, but the store is essentially closed or their customers are essentially closed and they're just -- they did some minimal activity that day. And merely trying to gauge the impact across 2,700 locations, the subset -- and the subset is quite small. So it doesn't take a lot to move it 5 points or 10 points. It's saying -- so there is an impact from weather, but that's not -- don't read that as a direct correlation to sales.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. Okay, I just wanted clarification on that. And I guess the other thing that people are wrestling with today is that you pre-released on the 20th and then you effectively missed that guidance by $0.01 to $0.02 over the next 2 weeks. And I think to some extent, you addressed it. It doesn't seem like it's a sales issue. It seems like it's more a GP issue. Could you talk about or quantify the impact from lower rebates in the fourth quarter? I mean, was there a reversal of previously accrued rebates, and if so, how much? Could you just talk about that impact? And was that the condition that led to the shortfall relative to the December 20 announcement?","Daniel L. Florness","Well, the quantification is we dropped about 109 basis points from Q2 to Q3 -- Q3 to Q4, excuse me. About 30% of that number related to either vendor allowances, rebates, or to volume incentives. And that was split pretty evenly between the 2. It isn't a case of you're reversing than you've booked in the past. It's a case of you just -- you didn't earn as much as you thought and what you're booking for the quarter is less. Most of those programs are calendar year basis. And those numbers really didn't change. When you release on the 20th -- we indicated we thought we'd have earnings per share growth over the $0.33 from last year. I honestly thought we'd do $0.34. And the gross margin was slightly worse than I expected, but not meaningfully. The sales were -- it's a number of factors. The sales were a little bit weaker than I expected. But again, whenever we predict it midmonth through, you're going to be wrong. It's just a degree of -- it's an issue of degree and an issue of direction. And the sales came in slightly weaker than I expected. The gross margin was slightly weaker than I expected. The operating expenses were about where I expected. And we came in at $0.33 -- a very strong $0.33. We're on the north side of $0.33, but it didn't come up to $0.34. And I guess that's the answer.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Couple of questions here. I wanted to piggyback Dave's last question there. Dan, it looks like you had -- of the sequential gross margin decline, Q3 to Q4, 70 basis points or so was mix and pricing. And I guess, the inference that you're assuming a 51% to 53% gross margin for the year, for 2014, suggests that, that is going to alleviate. Now a little bit of the pricing you talked about, but I'm concerned about why mix would not be even a greater headwind in '14 than it might be in '13 because of the re-acceleration of vending and some other factors. Could you help as to why the headwinds from mix might dissipate going forward?","Daniel L. Florness","Well, to me -- I don't necessarily think the headwinds from mix are going to dissipate. I think the component that relates to our execution to our -- just our day-to-day pricing, we talked about why we released the -- put the announcement out early. We've had some pretty frank discussions internally at the region and district level about gross margin and some habits and some habits we were seeing in stores, in a subset group of stores. What prompts me to not believe the mix is going to get worse -- because one of our issues during 2013 is our mix has been deteriorating throughout the year. One of the reasons for making the -- sharing the commentary about the subset for our business because giving you a lot more information than we normally give about how much is heavy manufacturing. There's a big subset of that, that is heavy equipment that we've talked a bit about on prior calls. What we're seeing in that business for the first time that I could say in the last 4 quarters -- 5 quarters, is stabilization in that business with some improvement because the -- if you take that 40% that's heavy manufacturing, about half of that is heavy equipment and the other half is everything else. It's a variety of end markets. The heavy equipment has stabilized, which means if the overall pool has improved, the non-heavy equipment piece is expand -- is growing closer to 10% in the quarter. And that's got a lot of fasteners in it and that isn't necessarily as much production fasteners. So there's some mix things there that, I believe, will help us, and at the worst, won't hurt us as we go forward, because that's what we've been fighting all year, Sam.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","The 51% to 53% comment, I guess one can infer that the midpoint of the bell curve would be 52%. Is that realistic to assume for '14? Or is it just -- if you are in the low part of that, you're still within the range and therefore still okay? I mean, how should we look at that range realistically?","Daniel L. Florness","We continue to look at that range over not a quarter-to-quarter basis, but year-to-year basis. Clearly, coming into the year below the range with mechanical changes in Q1 to get us to the bottom of the range does not imply a 52%. We're going to be looking back into it. We believe some of the things we can do to get us north of just being on that razor's edge of 51% it can move us north of that. But the mechanics right now of our business, whether it be utilization or how the vendor allowances work, we believe gets us to the low end of that range and where we move beyond that is a function of execution and mix.","Willard D. Oberton","And Sam, the long-term margin story of Fastenal has always been about our execution and that's why no one's really ever understood it, how has Fastenal operated at such a higher point than everyone else? And we did not execute well in the second half of 2013 and we're very focused on correcting that in the first half of 2014. So we have to prove that we understand that, and mix and economy and everything plays in. But the biggest thing that plays in is our people doing disciplined pricing.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","If I can sneak one more in, if at all possible, you had a lot of moving parts around labor and occupancy in '13. How would you project those expense lines to grow in '14, at least directionally, if you could help us with that?","Willard D. Oberton","Well, we haven't opened a lot of stores, so occupancy will probably grow in the mid- to upper-single digits. Utilities are higher. It's been, as you know, it's been cold out and so utilities...","Daniel L. Florness","And the vending machines.","Willard D. Oberton","And the vending machines. So we have 2 things driving that. So we have 5% to 8%, I would say. Occupancy, we're adding 15% more hours.","Daniel L. Florness","Labor.","Willard D. Oberton","Labor -- excuse me, labor. Sorry. Labor will grow this year, but we've done a nice job of adding part-time labor. We're controlling our support labor well. We do not expect labor to outgrow sales, so the overall labor number for the year should not outgrow sales and we should have earnings leverage as we go into the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Just to start with that clarification on your commentary about the heavy manufacturing customers, because if I remember correctly in the prerelease, we were talking about that subset of customers seeing weakness intensifying. And now it sounds like you're saying that stabilized and actually getting better. What exactly is the message there?","Daniel L. Florness","The message in the prerelease, and I wish when they name these categories, they'd have names that were distinctly different, you have heavy manufacturing and a subset of that is heavy equipment. The prerelease was talking about heavy equipment through -- if we looked at what we were trending, that business was -- that business grew about 1.5% in the fourth quarter. And that's about half of our heavy manufacturing. And to give you a frame of how that worked, that was growing north of 7% -- that was growing upper-single digits at the start of the year. It was growing -- by second quarter, it was growing mid-single digits. In Q3, it had dropped below 2% growth. And in Q4, it was there -- it was slightly below it, but it was essentially the same. That's really the piece that continues -- that continued to hurt us. And that's about half of -- that's about 20% of our business. So it's about -- of that 40% that is heavy manufacturing, half of that is heavy equipment. That's the piece that we've been talking more about over the course of the year, because that's the folks that makes the big wheeled -- the things that are going into mining, into construction, into agriculture, into defense, big, big pieces of equipment that we've been talking about in prior quarters, as opposed to expanding that to look at just heavy manufacturing in general.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, got it. And then flipping over to the gross margin, I guess. We put the price guidance system into place earlier this year and there seemed to be some traction on getting pricing and then the back half of the year things started to fall apart. And I guess I'm just wondering conceptually if the system's telling your guys that they should be selling at lower prices, or the transaction gross margins are different than what the goals are, I guess can you just walk us through how well that's being put into place? Or people just ignoring what the computers are saying?","Daniel L. Florness","Well, first off, the system isn't telling us to sell at a lower price. If you look at the measurements of the system, it shows clear deterioration in the last 5 months of the year. I think there's -- and this is a little philosophical point of view and take that for what it's worth when it comes from an accountant. I think July created a sense of urgency in our organization because our sales growth -- we had a really tough July. Part of that was amplified by the placement of July 4th and you can rationalize all you want, but bottom line is we had a tough July. And really, we're pushing hard on grow our business, grow our business, grow our business. And I think the pendulum swung a little bit to the point of it's more important to grow than it is to have managed -- than it is to focus on your margin. And life's about both. Our secret is you grow, but you grow profitably. And I believe we lost some energy on that. We made some changes in our leadership. We expanded our leadership pool in the second half of the year. We added about 27% more district managers. We contracted the average size of the district. We added several, I think, it was 3 regionals in the second half of the year, really to provide more leadership on a store-by-store basis. And part of that was focused on things that we had seen with our -- we had done some stuff early in the year for performance improvement. And so you have a lot of moving pieces. You have some store managers that are stepping into district roles. You have some district managers that are new in the role. You have some -- so you have some stores -- change creates a little chaos. And I think a combination of pushing really hard to grow, pulling back a little bit on the push as it relates to freight and our price guidance system, I think those 3 things coming together, plus some change in leadership internally, caused collectively our organization to take our eye off the ball a little bit on gross margin. We thought coming into the fourth quarter, we had stabilized what was deteriorating as we went through the third quarter. We didn't get there. We saw the weakness and that's what prompted a pre-announcement. But it isn't the price guidance system that's telling us to sell at price A and we're selling at that and it's lowering our margin. That's not the case at all.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Holden Lewis from BB&T.","Holden Lewis - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Just wanted -- you're talking a lot about sort of hopefully getting the macro and the heavy equipment starting to move better and the impact that could have on the model. And I guess I'm sort of curious about maybe a little more color on the progress of your internal efforts in the sense that, well, I think the idea here has been to continue to drive vending while adding heads to sort shore up the sales infrastructure and maybe get fasteners going. And all that's sort of initiative-driven. This quarter, we saw, I think, the vending contracted, like the lowest level in 9 quarters. Obviously, heads are way up above revenues. And fasteners grew a little bit better, but against a much easier comp. I didn't think it looked that impressive. So I mean, all of those, I guess, initiatives didn't seem to have much bearing in Q4, not sure we expected it to. But I still wanted to get your feel about how you feel you're executing on those initiatives and how you expect that to proceed as we go through the upcoming year?","Willard D. Oberton","You mean the fastener initiative, Holden?","Holden Lewis - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Well, yes, I mean, are we getting vending contracts up again, getting the heads to start producing, getting the vendor -- getting the fastener growth going again? All just sort of the internal stuff there.","Willard D. Oberton","On the fastener side, I think we're making good progress. We're doing a lot of things just working with the stores and working very hard on picking up OEM fastener accounts. And I think we're making progress there. On the vending, as I said earlier in the call, we are -- the contract number was lower, but we had talked about it in both the second and third quarter that we are less focused on that and far more focused on the quantity -- or the quality, and going back to the machines we already have, and driving more revenue. And if you look at the numbers, I think we did a very nice job there driving that growth up to almost 19% and expanding it as a percentage of the overall business. So the vending is working well and we're going to continue to focus on that as heavily as the signings. But as that goes up, I think it's going to motivate the team to sign even more because it's great business for the stores. So in 2014, we should have a good both signing and install year with vending. And there's was a third one you mentioned, oh, the headcount. We're making nice progress. But if you look at the heads, most of them or the vast majority were added after September in the fourth quarter. And our information shows us that they'll start producing revenue, helping the individual stores, in 90 to 120 days and we're going to be in that zone starting in February. So we should see some improvement in January and then continue to improve throughout the year. Our goal is real simple: we need to get into the double-digit growth as soon as possible and then move up from there. And we believe we're making the right investments to get that done.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel from William Blair.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just following up on the last question, I guess. Based on some of the trends you talked about today with heavy manufacturing getting a bit better and then all the sales energy you've added, it doesn't sound like anything's changed about your confidence in double-digit growth in 2014. Is that a fair statement?","Willard D. Oberton","Absolutely.","Daniel L. Florness","Absolutely.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And so what do we need to assume about the macro or any of those specific end markets or anything about the initiatives in order to hit that target?","Willard D. Oberton","We need economic growth across-the-board. I mean, if the U.S. economy, and it's mainly the U.S. economy, but Canada also, Canada is struggling right now and the economy isn't very good. But 80% -- or 90% of our business is in United States. If the United States economy grows in the 2% to 3% and we don't grow in the teens, then it's about Fastenal, it's not about anything else. If the U.S. economy slows down a little bit, and we're getting 1% GDP, then it's going to be harder to break out of it. But we're not predicting the 1%. We think that it will be a sluggish but a decent economy right now is what our view is. And with that, we plan to break out of it -- break out of the single digits and continue to improve our growth throughout the year. We're very, very focused on hitting our goals and Lee and his team have done a very good job of working on good growth goals or sales goals and communicating that very well. And I've been on the phone for 1.5 weeks with regionals and DMs and everybody understands what the mission is. There's no murkiness in what we're trying to do: hit goal and do it profitably.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then is there anything to glean from December in terms of how sales tracked the first 2 weeks versus how they tracked the last 2 weeks? Was there a meaningful difference?","Daniel L. Florness","Yes, there is, but there's always a meaningful difference in the last 10 days of December versus the first half of December just because of the holidays. The question is, was it worse than normal? I thought for the quarter and for the -- I thought for the month of December when we put out our release, we'd be closer to 8% than 6.7%. And so that was a piece of the delta. Is that a function of sales fell off? Or is it a function of our ability to predict the sales through the month? It's probably a little bit of each. But there's no question that this year, the impact of the holidays was worse than the past several years. Past several years, Christmas and New Year's have hugged the weekend, so either they've been on the weekend or they've touched the weekend. This year, it was in the middle of the week. And in some regard, some of that weakness might have been folks moving on to January. I'm not making excuse for that, but if I'm in a store, if I'm in a district and my December is -- I'm moving on for the next year.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. It just seemed that -- the month is pretty good at, I think, 6.7% and it just seems that based on what we've heard from everyone else, the last 2 weeks were really, really rough. So it kind of felt to me like you might have been running at that kind of 9%, 8% rate that first 2 weeks of December, which maybe could bode well for next year, but doesn't sound like you're really willing to go there.","Daniel L. Florness","Well, I mean, we thought we'd be at 8%.","Willard D. Oberton","This is for everyone on the call. We're disappointed that we put out not the best information a few weeks ago, so we're not going to go anywhere. We have to put the numbers up. I mean, as far as predicting where it's going to go with sales and margin, it's up to us to produce the numbers going forward. And so we don't want to -- we don't want to lay anything out that's going to mislead anybody. We're working very, very hard to grow the business profitably. And I think we can do that, but we'll see a little bit at the end of January, February and then really the drill story is what happens, what we put out in April.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tom Hayes from Thompson Research.","Thomas L. Hayes - Thompson Research Group, LLC","I was just wondering back to the headcount issue, have we gone through the bulk of the expansion of the headcount that we had been talking about for the back half of this year? Or should we expect more additions at this rate going into the first quarter?","Willard D. Oberton","We won't be adding at this rate, but our long-term goal is to try and add 15% more hours into our stores on an ongoing basis because all of the -- looking at history, it shows that if we want to grow our business in the high teens or the low 20s, we need to add our headcount or we need to add energy into the store at that rate. We'll get about 5 points from inflation and from just productivity gains. And so if we don't add any people, probably 5% growth is what we could expect over a long period of time. If we had 15% more hours, we should be able to grow the business in that high teens to low 20s. But understand, 15% more hours does not translate into dollars because we're adding part-time people, which come in at a much lower rate. And so that's why I say we can -- we should be able to grow our business faster than we grow our headcount. But even though we had a bad quarter, we're not going to pull back on the throttle and get real -- freak out on that, because if we do that, we'll go back to where we were with not enough people to grow our business. We have to have a steady hand, work very hard at controlling the labor, but also getting the growth in the labor hours and managing the rest of the expenses so we get earnings leverage as our growth picks up. And although we haven't done a good job this quarter growing our earnings, over a long period of time, we have proven that if we grow our business, we can make money and show leverage.","Thomas L. Hayes - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay. And Dan, just one follow-up, just your thoughts on CapEx levels for 2014?","Daniel L. Florness","CapEx, it'll be in our annual report we put out here in a few weeks. But we're looking in that $180 million to $190 million neighborhood. Hopefully, it's on the lower end of that range. We had a lot of dollars in 2013, a good chunk of that's from all the automation we're doing and we'll see some tapering off on that.","Operator","And we have time for one final question. Our last question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but just a question on whether you folks are actively looking to change some of your mix of business, specifically maybe getting larger on some of the MRO side of the business. I realize you have a lot going on execution-wise internally, on gross margin, currently. But maybe talk about how you're looking at changing mix of business longer term?","Willard D. Oberton","Really, the way that we handle that is here in Winona at the leadership role, we're not determining that. We try and set our store managers up to be the local experts and the district managers support them, and their goal is to grow their business profitably. So whether they sell it through OEM fasteners, MRO, construction, whatever they're strong in, if they are able to go out and hit their sales goals and do it profitably, we really aren't concerned whether it's construction, equipment or MRO. We do things in the background, things like vending and fastener initiatives to try and make it easier for them.","Daniel L. Florness","[indiscernible] to help them grow.","Willard D. Oberton","Exactly. But I mean, we're not trying to run it from a central position. We're trying to -- we really believe -- when I talk about market intelligence, I call -- I described that as intelligent people in the market and that's what Fastenal has. We have a lot of bright people out there working hard and we don't want to tell them how to do it for the most part. We want to tell them what's expected and then support them to get there.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And just a last follow-up. You spoke about gross margins a lot. Are there new tools and processes you need to put in place to get to the improvement we're talking about on gross margins? Or are existing processes and tools sort of enough to get there?","Willard D. Oberton","We have the tools in place to get there. We just have to make sure that the people are using the tools that we've given them.","Daniel L. Florness","Thanks, again, everybody, for participating in our call today, and we're moving on to 2014.

This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer. The call will last for up to 45 minutes, and we\u2019ll start with a general overview of our quarterly results and operations, with the remainder of the time being opened for questions and answers.","Today\u2019s conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal.

Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings call.","Holden\u2019s asked me to stay pretty tight to the script. So, I\u2019m going to be going through the slide deck, first couple of slides of that. But I will preface my comments with a few thoughts, and this is as much a shout out to our Fastenal team as it is to our Fastenal shareholders. My first comment to the team is, job well done in the quarter. For nine consecutive months in 2017, we have exceeded our internal goals for sales growth. I\u2019m proud of the team and I\u2019m happy for the team.","Last December, I challenged them at our annual gathering of the leadership of Fastenal with three simple messages as we close 2017. One is let\u2019s go out and grow our sales, let\u2019s get the business growing. We have a lot of growth drivers, let\u2019s execute and grow our sales. Secondly, let\u2019s manage the business well and grow our earnings because long-term the rewards we can create for our customer, our employees, our shareholders and ourselves are centered on our ability to grow our earnings and our returns long-term. And if we grow it faster than other companies that you can choose to invest in, the market will reward us from the standpoint of valuation and our employees will benefit from that because a fair number of our employees are also shareholders of the Company. Finally, I challenged them to think big about the business. We are going through a massive transformation in the business right now. We have talked about it in previous investor days; we have talked about it in our filings. In the last 10 years, we have grown tremendously, supportive business within Fastenal home vending. In the last three years, we have grown tremendously supportive business to Fastenal and to our customers called Onsite. They are complementary to each other. They are also businesses that Fastenal is uniquely qualified to be successful, and to think big about our future and how the business is going to grow more.","As you noticed in the release, our sales growth accelerated in the third quarter 2017. Year-to-date, our daily sales growth is 10.1%. That\u2019s the first double digits we have seen since 2014. And as I called out in the quote in release, we ended the quarter with 15.3% daily sales growth in the month of September, again very pleased with top-line performance in the quarter.","Our growth drivers continue to gain traction. We have record signings in the third quarter as it relates to Onsite, putting us on track for a very aggressive goal of 275 to 300 signings. Recall if you go back four years ago, five years ago, six years ago, on average we were signing about 10 a year. In 2015, we began to move the needle and we began to challenge our team to sign more, and we improved the number to about 75, about 175 the next year, and our goal this year was to add another 100 again and do at least 275. I feel very good about us being on pace to accomplish that. Year-to-date, we have signed 213; 64, 68 and now 81.","In all that, we have been investing behind the scenes in additional infrastructure to support the Onsite business that includes IT infrastructure; that includes implementation infrastructure. Despite those investments, we have continued to obtain operating expense leverage in our business. Our incremental margin was 21% in the quarter.","And one thing about the quarter, it\u2019s a 63-day quarter versus a 64 last year. For us to lose a day in a quarter is kind of unusual. We do just over $18 million a day in business. If we would had a more normal quarter, 64 to 64, most of that incremental gross profit dollars would have gone to the bottom-line and our incremental margin on that business would have been about 25%. So, we feel very good about the expense management we are exercising as we grow and invest in the future of our business.","Finally, if I look at it from the standpoint of how much of that converted into cash, our operating cash flow in the third quarter was a record for any third quarter in the history of Fastenal, both from the standpoint of absolute dollars and as relative to our earnings. Very pleased with the team, and that requires a big effort from both our supply chain folks as well as our branch and Onsite personnel because -- managing the inventory growth because that is the biggest wildcard when it comes to our working capital needs.","Touching on the Onsites again going to the second slide. 81 Onsites Signed. We have about 555 active sites, that\u2019s up almost 48% from a year ago. And again, I reiterate, our goal is 275 to 300 signings. A sidebar I\u2019ll throw in as it relates to Onsite, as we\u2019ve ramped up our Onsite in the last several years, it\u2019s translated into our ability to grow and take market share faster.","In yesterday\u2019s meeting I had with our Board of Directors, I was walking through with them the concept of the growing sales component. Last year, in the third quarter, about 25% of our district leaders, so we have about 250 district leaders in our business, about 25% of them grew their business double-digit. It\u2019s no coincidence, or it is a coincidence that in the prior year in 2015, about 25% of our district managers signed an Onsite and that translate into 75 signings.","Last year -- and I\u2019ve shared this on calls before, last year, we more than doubled our signings because roughly 54% of our district managers signed an Onsite in 2016. Interestingly enough, in the third quarter of 2017, 54% of our district managers grew their business double-digit. Year-to-date in 2017 -- and our goal for the year in establishing the 275 to 300 Onsite signings, our goal was to keep improving the participation of our leaders in this growth driver. And I challenged the team, can we get to 80%. So, we\u2019ve gone from 25 to just over 50, can we add another 30 and get to 80.","Year-to-date 64% of our district managers have signed an Onsite. Success for us in vending five and six and seven years ago came from more participation across the organization. Success for us in Onsite followed the same path, a greater portion of our business engaged with the customer and the manifestation for us is vending in Onsite signings. Year-to-date it\u2019s 64%. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll accomplish 80% by year-end but I\u2019m really impressed with what we\u2019ve done in the first nine months of the year.","Total in-market sites today, 2,973, a year ago we were at 2,921. So that continues to grow, as we morph a piece of our business closer to the customer. As you\u2019ve seen from our filings, we\u2019ve closed some branches in the last 12 months as we\u2019ve done in the last five years. Think of it as not a closing, but think of it as a consolidation. We\u2019ve consolidated two branches because part of the business of one has moved Onsite but our local presence continues to grow.","We\u2019ve signed 4,771 bending devices, basically on par with what we did in the third quarter of last year. To me, the most meaningful thing is our business there continues to grow double digits, just over 20% growth, 21% on daily basis, just under 20 on absolute basis because one less day. But our number of devices we\u2019re removing inched down as we\u2019ve gone through the year and inched down in the third quarter. So, very pleased from the standpoint, it feels like our signings are better and our performance on the existing base is better.","Finally, our national accounts business grew about 17% in the quarter, which means our non-national business grew just over double digits for the first time in quite some quarters, to give us our combined growth. So, very pleased with the quarter. Our growth drivers are moving the needle. We\u2019re managing our operating expenses through that. And one thing you\u2019ll notice, I\u2019ve been completely silent about our gross margin. Holden is going to touch on a few points of that. I\u2019m sure there will be a question or two on gross margin, but I\u2019ll throw one piece out to the group in the for what\u2019s it\u2019s worth category.","If you look at Onsite, if you look at vending and if you look at our Mansco acquisition, add these three components of our business up, and they account for about two thirds of our growth from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year. We\u2019ve previously said, all three of these operate at a gross margin below our Company average, but have very attractive operating margin and return characteristics. And at the end of the day, that\u2019s what you pay us for.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Holden.","Holden Lewis","Thank you, Dan, and good morning.","So, before jumping back into the slide deck, I did want to call out a few items that made the third quarter 2017 unique. The first is, I just want to call your attention to last page of the supplemental deck. This quarter, we did take a fresh look at the market exposure of our business and made certain adjustments that affected our end-market mix and slightly altered the growth rates versus what we reported in the past months and quarters. So, please feel free to take a look at that last page.","Secondly, as Dan has indicated, we did have one less selling day in the third quarter than was through the prior year. Based on our September daily sales rate, that cost us more than $18 million in sales during the period. That was known of course, but keep in mind that many of our costs, notably the employee-related expenses are not day dependant and that does affect leverage.","Third, we estimate that the hurricane that hit the Gulf, the southeast and Puerto Rico saved 20 to 30 basis points from revenue during the quarter. It is hard to estimate the impact of post storm recovery on our volumes, but we do believe that some of that was present in September, particularly in the Gulf, though not at a level to magnitude -- or not at a magnitude to offset the original loss sales. In addition to the top-line impacts, the hurricanes also were a very slight drag to gross margin due to the write off of damaged assets and an increase in sales of low margin storm related products like water and generators.","Now with that said, let\u2019s look back at slide five. And as Dan indicated, total sales were up 11.8% in the third quarter, but on a daily sales basis, they were up 13.6%, which is an acceleration from up 10.6% in the second quarter. Mansco contributed 130 basis points to this growth, which is consistent with the prior year. The third quarter finished strongly with September\u2019s daily sales growth coming in at up 15.3% or up 14%, excluding the impact of Mansco. In terms of end-market tone, the third quarter felt a lot like the second quarter. Macro data remain favorable with the PMI averaging at healthy 58.6 and industrial production continuing to grow at a low single digit rate. As a result, we saw broad strength and further acceleration on our manufacturing markets, while constructing sustained a mid-single digit growth rate.","From a product standpoint, we experienced acceleration in both fastener and non-fastener lines. And from a customer standpoint, national accounts accelerated again, up 17.3% in the quarter with 71 of our top 100 accounts growing. Growth of the smaller customers also accelerated in the quarter and it\u2019s notable that our non-national account customers grew better than 10% in September. This contributed 64% of our branches growing in the third quarter, which is up from 62% in the second quarter and 58% in the first. So, based on sustained strength in most of our end markets and strong momentum in the growth drivers that Dan covered on slide four, we feel good about our top-line momentum entering the fourth quarter.","Now to slide six. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin was 49.1%, down 20 basis points versus the third quarter of 2016. If I look at our organic fastener and non- fastener categories, there really was very little change in the gross margin. The very driver of the annual decline was the effective product and customer mix, the inclusion of Mansco and a very slight drag afforded by the hurricanes. We think that these combined probably provide about 30 to 40 basis points of drag to the annual gross margin for the year.","On a sequential basis, our gross margin was down about 70 basis points. Again, the organic margin for our fastener and non- fastener categories were mostly unchanged and the price cost dynamic was mostly stable. Seasonality and storm effects did play a role but the single largest cause of the sequential drop in the period was the behavior of what we call the organizational variables. In the quarter, this includes things such as more third-party shipping, foreign exchange adjustments, lower vendor freight credits as a result of really good inventory control in the period and other items of that sort.","Which of these variables move in which directions can be hard to predict in any single period and in most quarters it winds up being a series of pluses and minuses that even out. But in the second quarter, these skewed heavily in favor of gross margin; and in the third that favorable skewing completely reversed. Given these movements over the last two quarters, frankly, we look at the best representation of our gross margin, probably being the fact that our year-to-date 2017 gross margin of 49.4% is broadly comparable to our year-to-date 2016 level of 49.5%. So, year-to-date, we\u2019re down about 10 basis points despite the mix effects, the acquisition and those sort of factors that we\u2019ve talked about in the past.","Our operating margin was 20.2% in the third quarter, up 20 basis points year-over-year. The 20 basis-point decline in gross margin was more than offset by the 40 basis-point of leverage over operating expenses. Consistent with how our model works, we\u2019ve leveraged operating expenses every quarter of 2017 and that\u2019s resulted in our year-to-date operating margin expanding to 20.5% from 20.3% in the third quarter -- I\u2019m sorry, year-to-date in 2016. Employee-related costs were up 12.3%, 130 basis points of this increase relates to Mansco\u2019s headcount, plus the incremental expenses related to implementation of last year\u2019s rules. [Ph] Having one fewer selling day also had a slight negative impact. The remaining increase is a function of the reset of incentive comp throughout the organization, given our return to strong growth in 2017 and an increase in overall staffing.","Total headcount growth remained modest to up 1.9% or up 3% on an FTE basis, but we have added personnel in 8 of 9 months this year. It does remain a goal of ours to leverage the employee related expenses over time. Occupancy related expenses were up 1.5%, branch costs are slightly lower reflecting closures over the past 12 months, more than offset by growth in our vending install based. Selling transportation related expenses were up 2.7%, reflecting our ability to leverage our vehicle moving activities, even while we support the growth of our business. Total incremental operating margin in the third quarter was 21.3%; if you exclude Mansco, that incremental margin was 22.1%. And frankly, we think that that value will likely reduce by more than 200 basis points by having one fewer selling day in the period.","Turning to slide seven, we generated $163 million in operating cash in the third quarter; that\u2019s a record amount for any third quarter and it\u2019s 114% of net income. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve generated $456 million, which represents 107% of net income, an improvement on the 100% in the first nine months of 2016. These improvements are primarily a function of better earnings. Net CapEx in the third quarter was $24 million, down 67% due in large part to the absence of spending on vending machines related to the leased locker program. Our anticipated capital spending target of 2017 is unchanged at $127 million.","In the third quarter, we spent $92 million on dividends and $26 million to repurchase shares of stock. Our level of debt was mostly stable at $440 million. And at 17.8% of total capital, we view our balance sheet as conservatively capitalized with ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business and pay our dividend.","In terms of working capital, we are particularly pleased with the inventories. If you exclude Mansco, our inventories were up 7%, which significantly trails the growth in sales. This reflected the ability of the field to leverage the heavy investment branch inventory in 2016 and just more energy enterprise wide on this line. Receivables growth excluding Mansco is up 15% in the quarter as in the second quarter that it grew faster than sales reflects the acceleration in growth that we saw as the quarter progressed as well as the relative growth of national accounts.","Payables excluding Mansco were up 23%. Last year\u2019s third quarter was unusually low in the wake of high CSP 16 related purchases in the prior quarter, a dynamic that\u2019s likely to repeat in the fourth quarter this year.","That\u2019s all we have for our formal presentation. And with that, we\u2019ll turn it over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Robert Barry","Hey, guys, good morning. So, I just wanted to understand what\u2019s happening with the price cost. I know you\u2019ve talked in the past about benefits of the long supply chain but I think the inflation would be upon you. Are you getting price to kind of fully offset the inflation? ","Holden Lewis","Yes, I would answer that in a couple of ways. In terms of the price that we referred to in the second quarter, we felt like in the second quarter that resulted in a positive price cost dynamics. As you roll into 3Q, we feel like we got a little bit of incremental price but we also began to see a little bit of the incremental cost flowing through. And frankly, those probably balanced out relative to where we were in Q2. So, yes, we feel like the price that we envisioned getting, we got. The costs have begun to come through. We talked about that, perhaps hitting in Q4 that will certainly be the case but we saw some of that hit in Q3 as well to result in sort of stability in that dynamic, if you will.","There is still inflation; that hasn\u2019t changed. And I think I would probably answer the question of how we address that the same way I have answered in the past which is that if at some point we determine that we can\u2019t protect our level of profitability without resorting to some sort of price action, then we will take that step, and we believe that we would be successful in that. But we didn\u2019t do anything along those lines in the third quarter.","Robert Barry","Got you. And just as a follow-up, I think 4Q gross margin is typically down quarter-over-quarter, right? And you also have a tough comp this year. So, should we expect that sequential pattern to hold, maybe something in the high [Technical Difficulty] ballpark, is that kind of how we should calibrate 4Q?","Holden Lewis","We try not to predict, obviously. I do think you are right that we have a very difficult comp versus the gross margin that we put up last year. And I think that that\u2019s certainly going to be a feature of the fourth quarter. In terms of what we expect for gross margin in the fourth quarter, there is typically seasonality; on the other hand, we did have some minor drag related to the hurricanes in this particular quarter. It\u2019s difficult for me to kind of give you a number, but we\u2019re not going to go towards the number. I think that there are some puts and takes that at the end of the day that the seasonality is usually fairly minor -- fairly modest and we\u2019ll see the degree to which there are some things that offset that.","Robert Barry","Was the hurricane\u2026","Dan Florness","Hey, Rob.","10 bps? Yes, I just wanted to clarify what the hurricane impact was on the gross margin?","Holden Lewis","Yes, it was probably 5 to 10 basis points. ","Robert Barry","Got you. All right. Thank you.","Dan Florness","This is Dan. I\u2019m going to chime in, a quick comment. This is part of the call that I always drive Holden probably little crazy, but he\u2019s getting used to it. If I think about the comments he made earlier and I think about our July call, there were quite a few questions that really were asking, what lifted gross margin because Holden\u2019s message over time has been one of, when you think about the growth drivers, the math of the growth drivers should lower our gross margin each year to optimistically 20 basis points, pessimistically 25 to 30. And that\u2019s just the fact that the growth drivers of vending and in the case of this year acquisition, tend to weigh down. And then over time the growth of our non-fasteners relative to fasteners which are obviously influenced by the growth drivers, weighted down a little bit, and organizationally what can we do to work back, to grab back some margin and in our sourcing, our logistics, our selection of products, everything. ","So, in the second quarter, we stumbled ourselves a little bit, trying to explain to you all and your questions why we weren\u2019t confident that gross margin was a new normal because we talked about a lot of the puts and takes and everything was a put. This quarter, as Holden mentioned a lot of the puts and takes lean towards takes, not puts. Our fastener gross margin was down about 10 basis points, our non- fastener gross margin was completely unchanged from Q2 to Q3. And I think that\u2019s an important component. So, it was really the organizational -- the other stuff all worked against us this quarter.","History has told me and my history perspective is 20 years, four quarters a year, that\u2019s about 80 quarters. History has told me that you don\u2019t get things that go all your way or mostly against your way typically in a quarter. So, going into the fourth quarter and I don\u2019t like making predictions, but going in the fourth quarter, I\u2019m not looking for our gross margin to be below 49 from a standpoint of sequential weakening. We\u2019ll get a little bit benefit from the hurricane number. Now, in all honesty, there could be 5 basis points of hurricane in the fourth quarter because in Puerto Rico we don\u2019t know all the answers. We do know that all of our employees are safe in the Gulf coast, in Florida and in Puerto Rico; and in Houston we had two branches that were destroyed by the hurricane. What we know initially about Puerto Rico is we had no branches damaged. It sounds like we came through it reasonably well. Our business suffered but our assets did not and more importantly, our employees came through it safely.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Merkel","Thank you. First question is on incremental margins. Just given the 12% topline, I was expected incremental margin to 25% plus. So, my question is, is this still an achievable target if we adjust for restoring incentive compensation, hurricanes and one less day?","Holden Lewis","Yes. I mean, we -- organically, the incremental margin came in around 22%. And we believe that the day itself probably cost us the rest of the gap between that number and about 25% in the quarter. If you think about it, that extra day cost us about $18 million in revenues. Now bear in mind of course, we know about that in advance of course, the day is not a surprise. But it still does cost us year-over-year $18 million in revenues. We don\u2019t get a discount on our base salaries, which are a significant portion of our total employee-related expense, and there are other elements within the operating expense category. Now, we don\u2019t get a discount on just because we have one fewer day. And so, we do believe that the organic incremental was around 22%. And if you -- if it were for that extra day, not being there, we think that it would have been in that 25% range.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. So, no change really long-term to high single digit sales growth, you can get 25% or so incremental margin?","Dan Florness","In the short-term, I would agree with that. The real question, Ryan, is when you look out to the future, what percentage of our growth is coming from the Onsite model. And again, in the quarter, it was about 30% of our growth. What percent of the growth is coming from Onsite and what is that due to weigh down at incremental margin. But, we\u2019re very mindful of managing the expenses around that. And I don\u2019t know if Holden touched on this. Sometimes -- the discussion at the Board meeting yesterday and discussion on the conference call get muddy from me. But I don\u2019t know if he touched on it, so if I repeat I apologize. But right now, we\u2019re anticipating Q4 branch level occupancy. By occupancy, I\u2019m talking about rent; utilities change with the season, but I\u2019m talking about rent expenses. Right now, we\u2019re expecting Q4 will be lower than Q1. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s ever happened in the history of Fastenal. And so, we\u2019re being very mindful in managing that expenses because we do believe we can get in the short-term incremental margins in that mid-20s. I can\u2019t speak to four and five years from now, if they\u2019re mid-20s or if they\u2019re close to mid-20s. But I know we\u2019ll be growing our returns and our cash flow handsomely at that time.","Holden Lewis","Yes. I will just chip in two things. One, that math is basically correct. Bear in mind again, the difficult gross margin comp in the fourth quarter however will make it difficult on a single quarter way, basis to do that. But, to Dan\u2019s point, I mean, we\u2019re trying to grow this business, we\u2019re doing a fairly successful job of it given where our revenue growth rates are compared to the marketplace and things of that nature. And we are going to continue to grow and outgrow the market and gain market share. And so, whereas we are going to manage our expenses to be able to achieve a very healthy incremental margin and we do think about that double-digit growth in that 25% type of incremental, sometimes we get questions about why it can\u2019t be more, why it can\u2019t be more, and the answer is because we not only manage our expenses but we also manage our expenses to be able to grow. And so, I think the math that you\u2019re talking about makes some sense to us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Scott Graham","So, earlier this year, we were talking about how we sort of wake up in the morning with 20 to 30 basis-point gross margin drag that you were -- at that time you said, you were confident in being able to backfill, owing to mix and what have you. It sounded to me and maybe I\u2019m just reading to deeply into this, but the growth drivers now do seem to be that 20 to 30 basis points and that does not include what would seem to be product mix, which has been running negative. And I\u2019m wondering if the growth drivers include customer mix. So, is it still 20 to 30 or maybe is it now higher than that?","Holden Lewis","Yes. So, couple of things. First, I don\u2019t think we ever said we\u2019re confident that we backfill. I think what we said is that we\u2019re going to have 20 to 30 basis-point headwind, just as you say waking up in the morning at the beginning of the year. And that will certainly work very hard to try to backfill that, but over an extended period of time, we would not be surprised, if our gross margins are lower. But that is on the back of significant growth and market share gains. So, I never said confident, but we certainly do wake up every day, knowing we\u2019re at a hole and making an effort to try to fill it up, but there is certainly never any guarantee that we would do that year-after-year.","With respect to the mix question. No, the mix is not different. When we talk about the 20 to 30 basis-point drag, that really does fill in the product. It fills in the customer. That is really trying to take into account all the variables. And the reason it does that is because, I look at that mix relative to how our margins are performing across the product set, which would encompass everything that we\u2019re doing from a growth standpoint. So, I think that 20 to 30 basis points that we wake up through every year, I think that\u2019s the number.","Now, we talk about how three quarters of our revenues, our fasteners and Onsites and national accounts and vending that we believe that we have a significant mode in, and those also happen to be our growth drivers. They are going to become a bigger part of the mix and they also have even the lower gross margin. If in a year or two that 75% becomes 80% or 85%, does that 20 to 30 become 30 to 40, maybe, but that\u2019s a function of very defensible revenue and market share gains. And we\u2019ll try to fill in that hole too, but we certainly would not guarantee it.","Scott Graham","I apologize if I misquoted you there. So, it does stay 20 to 30\u2026","Holden Lewis","Hey, Scott, hold down a second. Dan will\u2026","Dan Florness ","I\u2019m going to just chime in. If your definition of backfill is at the gross margin line, the answer is different; and if your definition of backfill is at the operating margin line or operating income line, because in the last 12 months, I look at Q3 to Q3, we gave up 20 basis points of gross margin, we picked up 20 basis points of operating income. And so, I read that as we backfill the 20 with 40 basis points of operating expense leverage from a backfill perspective, because at the end of day, the numbers that really matter on the income statement are further south than the gross margin line, and we backfill that two times over. And that\u2019s the key to the business and that was done in an environment where, as you know from reading our proxy or if you read through proxy, you\u2019d see that our incentive comp is really centered on paying out a piece of our profit dollar growth, in the case of our leadership team and that\u2019s true of many of our support areas, as well as our logistics, costs in the case of distribution and gross profit dollar growth or sales in gross profit dollar growth at the branch and Onsite location.","So, in the current quarter, our incentive comp is up between 25% and 30% because we\u2019re reloading incentive comp, so that in that environment, we picked up 40 basis points of expense leverage. When we get through 2006 -- 2017 excuse me, that reload is largely complete. We have a little bit of reload in the first quarter but in the second quarter our incentive comp had dramatically expanded. So, we have the benefit of that when we get into the second quarter of 2018 and partially there in the first quarter of 2018.","Scott Graham","Got you. That\u2019s great color. Thank you, both. My follow-up is a little simpler. The acceleration in sales in September was impressive. I was just sort of wondering if you maybe could parse out the piece of let\u2019s say of sales that you recaptured from Harvey, my guess is that that would be a smaller piece of it and instead I am hoping that you can answer sort of which end markets look like they accelerated in September?","Dan Florness","Yes. So, to take the first question about the Harvey, it was fairly modest and it was primarily in Houston that we would have regained some of what we lost in August but that regain was probably about a third. I mean, we\u2019re probably talking about $0.5 million, maybe a little more than that in terms of what we recaptured.","I will tell you, going forward, it\u2019s a difficult number for us to really understand. So, we will do our best but it\u2019s a hard number to refine. But, I am fairly comfortable at this point that we actually lost more in revenue in September from Irma and Maria than we gained in recovery in Houston. So, the hurricanes were a net negative in both August and September. That\u2019s I would say with regards to that.","And then, in terms of end markets, it really -- it gets down to the manufacturing end markets, right? If you look at our heavy equipment, it accelerated; if you look at heavy manufacturing but honestly our manufacturing business as a whole accelerated across the board. And you talk to the RVPs and they still talk about oil and gas is still doing fairly well and all the flow through that comes with that. So the manufacturing complex in general I think continues to accelerate. The transportation complex for us which doesn\u2019t include a lot of automotive, bear in mind but that continues to expand for us. So, it\u2019s -- there weren\u2019t a lot of areas I could point to that were soft or weren\u2019t getting better. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Luke Junk of Baird. Your line is now open.","Luke Junk","First question on Onsites. Really, we are still early stage here relative to when you really put your foot down on the accelerator in terms of signings. But what I was wondering is how is the revenue run rate tracking on average relative to the numbers that you laid out at the 2015 Analyst Day. That is about $1 million of year one market share gains and $1.8 million in average annual spend over time. The reason I ask is that the pace of signings we\u2019re seeing right now, just doing the math on those numbers alone, I would certainly speak to some single top-line momentum coming from that business.","Dan Florness","Luke, if I look at what we\u2019re seeing, I have a few observations. One is we\u2019re continuing to see really good trends in the numbers. Averages are in line with what you are seeing. Averages can be deceiving; you have some that are well above it, some that are below it. That\u2019s the nature of the averages I guess. But very pleased with the run rates we are seeing from the standpoint of what we would have expected.","One thing that\u2019s a tremendous positive for me, when I look at the layers of Onsites for signing, we\u2019re actually seeing better performance out of the 2016 signings that we\u2019ve been implementing in the latter half of 2016 and early half of 2017 than we saw in the 2015 signings that we were signings 12 months earlier. Now, how much of that is a rising tide is as you all know the ISM has continued to inch up; that\u2019s usually leading indicator. So, I\u2019m optimistic that\u2019s a sign of things to come but we\u2019re definitely seeing strength in our end markets. But we\u2019re also seeing underlying better performance in the Onsites we\u2019ve signed again in 2016 versus what we did in 2015, which is really positive from the standpoint of the quality versus our historical perspective. So, I feel very good about that. I hope that answered your question. ","Holden Lewis","The only thing I\u2019ll add to that is, we continue to see the Onsites contribute more and more to our growth rate. I think this quarter, if you take out what moved from branches to Onsite and if you remove that element of it, the Onsites contributed close to 3.5% of our growth year-over-year. And that is an increase from where we were in Q2 which itself was an increase from where we were in Q1. So it continues to contribute more.","Luke Junk","And then, follow-up question, just as it relates to the operating leverage looking into next year. Dan, you\u2019ve already touched on this to some extent, but I was just wondering if you could put a finer point on the benefit to your growth and pretax income as growth in the incentive comp normalizes to get into the second quarter next year beyond. I think in the past you maybe put this in terms of how much pretax earnings growth the growth incentive comp is consuming say right now where we\u2019re in this adjustment period versus a period next year where that\u2019s going to normalize to some extent.","Holden Lewis","Yes, I\u2019ll let Dan provide some historical perspective on these numbers since he has it, given he is 80 quarters I think he counted. But, I think if you think about it, in the first year of the reset year if you will, it probably consumes 25 to 30% of our pretax dollar growth can sort of go to incentive. When you get into the second year that can perhaps get cut close to in half in terms of how much of your pretax it consumes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Hamzah Mazari","Could you give us some sense on what you\u2019re hearing on section 232 and the duties on semi-finished steel products, whether that\u2019s going to have an impact on margins?","Holden Lewis","We don\u2019t know yet. I think a decision on that keeps getting\u2026","Dan Florness","It might be helpful to explain everybody else on the call what he\u2019s asking.","Holden Lewis","Yes. So, this is basically a question about tariffs on Asian steel, I believe, which could encompass some of our products. And effectively a decision on whether or not to enact those sort of tariffs continues to get punted, and I think at this point the expectations is maybe the decision comes next year early next year. What I would tell you is I think that if the costs to procure steel products and fasteners go up because of an act like that, then they will go up for everybody Fastenal as well as our competitors and given that it\u2019s difficult to procure a lot of product domestically at this point. And so, the typical response would be to try to pass that through the customers and we expect that the industry would probably take that action if something like that were to occur. But we\u2019re watching it, nothing has been decided on it to our knowledge, and if something is, then we\u2019ll react appropriately.","Hamzah Mazari","All right. Thank you. And just quick follow-up, could you give us a sense of how much your current business is government and how trending including any exposure to state versus federal?","Holden Lewis","Our government business is probably about 4% of our total revenue. It\u2019s almost entirely state and local, we really don\u2019t do a lot with federal. By the way, that\u2019s one reason when people want to talk about sort of the recovery element after a storm. We don\u2019t necessarily have that sort of theme in federal government connection that perhaps some other distributors may have. But ours is primarily state and local. It\u2019s growing well for us. What I would tell you is, it\u2019s probably a small enough piece of our business that we wouldn\u2019t be a proxy for the market. But the last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve had some nice wins, we have some energy that we\u2019re putting into the state and local government business, and we think that\u2019s providing some benefit to us. But yes, about 4% of our revenue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Duncan of Stephens. Your line is now open.","Matt Duncan","First question I\u2019ve got is just, Holden, if you look at -- or Dan, either one, if you look at the top 100 customers, you\u2019ve got some where you\u2019re not growing and some are declining double digits. Just curious, what end-markets those customers are serving. Is this there are common theme among them and do you see an opportunity to maybe see growth pickup even further if some of those customers do return to growth here?","Holden Lewis","Yes. If I look particularly at sort of where September was, there is -- within that top 100, I\u2019ll tell you, there are not many categories that are declining; and the one or two that are, there is only one or two companies in each. And so, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s particularly indicative. So, as I said I think that the performance for the most part has been pretty uniform across our end-markets. Now, obviously, the largest piece of those 100 is going to be manufacturing and that\u2019s doing really well, but it\u2019s relatively -- there is growth across our landscape frankly. I would say, if I look at trends I think that the E&C, the engineering and construction business has gotten [Technical Difficulty]","Dan Florness","[Technical Difficulty] but I see we are at 9.45. I have a [Technical Difficulty] incremental margin because we\u2019re expanding our team, we\u2019re expanding our distribution capabilities, we\u2019re expanding the expenses of the business, but generally speaking, a high piece of the gross profit dollars flow through.","If I look at the expansion incentive comp and Holden was taking a little broader brush when he was looking at his 25% number. If I look at the expansion of incentive comp at the branch, support and leadership levels across the company, our expansion of incentive comp consumed above 11% of our incremental margin. History has shown that number is probably in a more typical year -- it\u2019s probably not 5%, but probably in the 7% to 8% neighborhood. So, to Ryan Merkel\u2019s earlier question, there is probably about 3 points of incremental margin that are absent this year because of the expansion of incentive comp that wouldn\u2019t be there next year, because it\u2019s already reloaded. I hope that clarified that point. I see we\u2019re at 9:45. So, again, I want to thank you everybody for participating the call today. I hope you find this exchange useful in understanding Fastenal business. And again to the Fastenal team, nice quarter everybody. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. That does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect.

I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Ms. Ellen Trester. You may begin.","Ellen Trester","Welcome to the Fastenal Company 2016 annual and fourth quarter earnings conference call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer. The call will last for up to 45 minutes and we will start with a general overview of our quarterly results and operations, with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers.","Today\u2019s conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal.

These statements are based on our current expectations and we undertake no duty to update them. It is important to note that the company\u2019s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company\u2019s latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and we encourage you to review those factors carefully.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.","Dan Florness","Good morning, everybody and thank you for joining our call today. And I'll start by just Apologizing for the state of my voice on today's call. I am recovering from a bit of a cold, so I'll try to speak clearly. My comments this morning will be relatively brief. I just want to touch on five points.","First off we had an upbeat finish to a tough year. Secondly, I believe we've changed the trends of our business. Third, I believe we've improved the health of our business. The fourth and fifth aren\u2019t comments so much on 2016, but I think they are comments that we should always remind ourselves of, one is we have great people close to the customer and we have great people behind the scenes to support our local business. Both are structurally important components to the success of our business today historically and I believe going forward.","In regards to the upbeat finish our sales trends and our gross profit stabilized and\/or improved depending on if you look at that in comparison to Q3 or comparison to Q4 of a year ago and we grew our earnings. For a new CEO you can appreciate the importance that comes with having a release that doesn\u2019t have some either parenthesis or dashes in front of a number or two after we've come through quite frankly a pretty tough 2015 and 2016 period.","Secondly, our trends have improved in both, in the last several years, primarily 2014 and 2015 we had significantly added people cost to our organization as we grew our headcount primarily at the store, but throughout the organization. These costs, when I look at the trends that come with it had about peaked in the second quarter of 2016 and as we have gone through the year those costs helped cycle down a bit and I believe we are poised quite well to manage that expense as we go into the new year.","We also have added occupancy costs quite dramatically in the last several years. A piece of it relates to our vending platform, a piece of it relates to the automation we put into our distribution centers and a piece of it relates to our store network. There is always some built in inflation in the store network and our job everyday is to manage that well, but whether it might be property taxes or some other or some CAM charges or some inflation in the lease we have to be very mindful of how we manage that in the long term, especially as the business is evolving.","And again, similar to the people cost, I believe we exit the year in a much better spot, but we still have some work ahead of us on the occupancy side of the equation, because we want to plan for and allow for growth there that comes from continued expansion of our vending platform.","In regards to the business health, we upgraded around 2100 stores to our CSP 16 format and while we haven\u2019t talked about a lot on our calls, that's a tremendous undertaking when you look at our store based business and this 2100 upgrade was primarily in our U.S. based business. We have some upgrades for our Canadian business as we enter 2017.","We also upgraded \u2013 excuse me, upgraded or optimized if you will, over 50,000 vending machines and that's more about improving our cost to serve than that is about our revenue enhance. So there is some revenue improvements because of it. So we had rapidly rolled out those 50,000 plus machines over the last five years. And in 2016 we took the opportunity to go and visit each and every machine and to challenge how we could be more efficient with that machine and I believe that improves the health of that vending business and improves our ability to serve and grow the business in the future.","We also changed our mindset over the last several years as it relates to onsite. We've been \u2013 our first onsite occurred in 1992 and at the end of 2014 we had around 200 onsites that we've slowly grown in our business. If I think of 2014 just under 5% of our district leaders and we have today roughly 255 district managers across the company. Just under 5% of them signed in onsite, we signed, I don\u2019t know the exact number it was around 14 onsites that year.","In 2015 we took a big step forward and around 25% of our district leaders signed in onsites that year and we signed around 80 onsites. In 2016 Fastenal has a hallmark of finding great people, challenging them to be successful but not micromanaging. In 2016 over 50%, I believe 54 is the exact number, but over 50% of our district leaders had an onsite signed in their business and that translated into 176 signings during the year. Our goal going into 2017 is quite simple. The key to moving that participation up and for 80% of our district managers, our district leaders to have an onsite signed in their districts.","If we are able to accomplish that we believe we could sign somewhere between 275 and 300 onsites. We believe that's an achievable number from a signing perspective. It is an absorbable number from an execution standpoint because very much of the work is spread across 255 business units, 2600 stores, not concentrated in one small support group, so we're very excited about that.","And we also believe with the CSP 16 in place the team that helped roll that out is there to also help with the implementation of our onsite, so we believe we're \u2013 we have improved our capacity to implement.","Finally we talked about, oh, excuse me, fourth, we talked about great people closer to the customer. 75% of our employees know our customers on a first name basis and yet we have a very efficient cost structure. I don\u2019t believe any other nationwide distributor can lay claim to that and we're proud of that fact. Finally, the team behind the scenes, our team is strong. We are wired for change and will [indiscernible] all of these things help us serve our customer well.","I'll close with one thought, we believe in our people, we challenge each other to improve and we challenge each other to grow each day.","With that, I'm going to turn it over to Holden, but before Holden starts in I just want to, so this is Holden's second earnings call. Many of you know Holden Lewis from his previous career as a sell side analyst. He has covered us for quite a few years. We knew Holden well. We're not quick to bring in somebody from the outside into our organization in this senior of a role, but we've really liked Holden's ability we felt to culturally fit with us and the fact that he could bring a new set of eyes, a new [critique] [ph] and a tremendous skill set to our organization.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Holden.","Holden Lewis","All right thank you Dan and good morning and thanks for joining the Fastenal's fourth quarter call. I'm going to begin with a quick recap of our full year 2016 results and then I'll move on to a discussion of the quarterly performance. So, in 2016 Fastenal generated $3.96 billion in sales, that's up 2.4% from 2015. We did have an extra day in the year, so on a day's basis we were up about 2%.","I'm not going to belabor the tough conditions that persisted through the year and I feel like that's well understood by you, but I would like to highlight some of the drivers that allowed us to grow despite it.","First, on vending, we finished 2016 with 62,822 machines, that's about up 7300 units or 13% over 2015. So at this point 46.1% of our sales now go to customers that use vending. So it is a fairly well represented in the field. Revenues to our machines increased by more than 10% in the fourth quarter. Signings of 18,059 machines were up 1% year-over-year. Note that these figures exclude the nearly 15,000 units that we installed related to our leased locker program.","Despite all those successes, vending did not quite reach the goals we'd set for it in 2016, but note that signings were a three year high and we think that with the distractions related to our optimization efforts and the leased locker initiative now past us, we're targeting more than 20,000 signings in 2017.","Secondly on our onsites we signed 176 new agreements in 2016 a little shy of our goal of 200, but substantially above the 80 that we signed last year and this frankly contributed to driving sales through these sites up at a better than 25% rate for the year. We're gaining momentum here and we are targeting 275 to 300 signings in 2017.","With respect to national accounts, we signed 190 new agreements that's up 14% from 2015. Even with softness among our largest 100 customers these signings contributed to our total national accounts revenues being up by a bit more than 4% on the year, we still see significant opportunity with new and existing customers and even with national accounts now being about 47% of our total sales.","Lastly, the SKUs related to our CSP 16 initiative, they also grew at a little bit better than a 4% rate in 2016 and so we feel good overall about the strides that we're making in our growth drivers, we remain convinced of their effectiveness in driving share gains and we look forward to further progress in 2017.","Margins in 2016 were a challenge. Our gross margins finished the year at 49.6% that's down 80 basis points which is primarily from mix and pressure on product margins, the latter being particularly early in the year. Our operating margins finished 2016 at 20.1 and that was down about 130 basis points. In addition to the gross margin decline, occupancy was up as we continued to invest in our vending initiative. We are likely to remain challenged by mix and vending related occupancy, but some of the product pressures that we experienced in the first half of this year have eased at this point. We've been tighter with cost in the second half of 2016 and some of the minor expenses for things like store closures or CSP 16 rollout hopefully don\u2019t recur. So as a result we think we're better equipped to defend our margin in a slow growth environment. We'll even expand it if growth accelerates from here than with the case in 2016.","Our interest expense on the year roughly doubled while our average share count was down 1%. Both those fact reflect our share buyback activity over the last eight quarters. Our tax rate was down from 37.5% to 36.8% in the year which really just was some jurisdictional shifts as well as the resolution of certain state tax matters. It all blended into a 2016 EPS figure of $1.73 which was down about 2.3% for the year.","Now moving on to the fourth quarter results. Total and daily sales in the fourth quarter were up 2.7%, that's a modest acceleration from the prior nine months. We can't ignore the easier comparison relative to last year's fourth quarter when our daily sales rates was actually down 2%. Still the December daily sales were up 3.2% and that was likely understated because of holiday timing. So in contrast to a poor November, frankly we consider December to have been as expected.","Now the details of the quarter remained a bit of a mixed bag. Growth from our top 100 accounts remained flattish on weakness among general industrial companies. The proportion of stores and national accounts that were growing in the fourth quarter was largely unchanged from the third quarter and construction fasteners actually weakened in the period. So in the end, growth of 1.6% in North America really wasn\u2019t much changed from the prior period.","On the other hand it is notable that heavy manufacturing was up 2.3% in the fourth quarter. That's the first time that's been up since the second quarter 2015. Similarly OEM fasteners were weak but the down 2.8% was also the narrowest decline we've seen since the second quarter of 2015. Further, I would note that there is a more favorable tone surrounding process industries as we enter 2017. We are going to continue to assume the sluggish business conditions that have prevailed through 2016 are going to continue into 2017, but there does remain and there remains a great deal of uncertainty on a number of fronts, but that said, the environment has become more optimistic.","Our gross margin was 49.8% in the fourth quarter, that's down 10 basis points versus the prior year, but it is up 50 basis points against the third quarter. With respect to the year-over-year change, mix continues to weigh as the fasteners fell 180 basis points to now represent 35.6% of our sales. Given this we view the stability in the period favorably. There was no single meaningful offset, rather there was small improvements in areas like purchase discounts and freight that benefited the quarter relative to the prior year.","As it relates to the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see the marginal rebound from the third quarter 2016. Similar to the annual results this is less than a single item than it is from the accumulation of many small but favorable improvements including better margins on non fasteners or higher mix of exclusive brands building revenue associated with our lease locker program, better purchasing on the other variables like that.","A lot of these things worked in our favor at the gross margin in the fourth quarter, but there is nothing in this improvement that strikes us as one time or temporary in nature and at this point we would characterize the margin environment as stable.","Our operating margin was 19.3% in the fourth quarter also down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis. SG&A as a percentage of sales was unchanged at 30.6% of revenues. Payroll which is 65% to 70% of our SG&A was down 30 basis points as a percentage of sales persistently sluggish demands had two effects here. First, they continued to temper the incentive pay in the fourth quarter. Second, we spent much of 2016 letting attrition unwind the raise staffing we experienced in 2015. We finished 2016 with headcount being down 5.4% were down 4.1% on an FTE basis. These variables more than offset the effect of higher health insurance costs.","Occupancy which is 15% to 20% of total SG&A was up 30 basis points as a percentage of sales. Vending was the primary catalyst behind this. We don\u2019t expect that dynamics to change in 2017. We did expect efforts to rationalize our store base in the second half of 2016 will provide a larger benefit and wound up being the case and that\u2019s going to be a point of emphasis to our company in 2017.","In 2016 we trimmed staffing in stores, we invested in growth drivers and technology and used our balance sheet to invest strategically in inventory. We like where our cost structure shift is as we exit the fourth quarter. We're going to continue to invest in our growth drivers, but given the investments and rationalizations already made we believe that with the lower fastener growth we can leverage the income statement 2017.","Finally, we generated $133 million in operating cash in the fourth quarter that's down 8.5% versus last year. It also represents 116% of the quarter's net income which is below last year. This decline year-over-year reflects three things. First, in the fourth quarter 2016 we took advantage of favorable year end buys. Second, variables were much higher in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to adding CSP 16 inventory in that period and then third, our receivables fell at a faster rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the relatively sharper pull back in demand in that period. These factors all served to inflate the cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2015 relative to fourth quarter 2016.","That said, we generated free cash flow after dividends of $18.5 million. Our capital expenditures are down 23% year-over-year and down 63% sequentially as we wind up the rollout of our lease locker program. As a result we've reduced our net debt by roughly $21 million and retained flexible, leverage of net debt being 12.5% of total capital.","We expect cash generation to be improved and free cash flow after dividends to be positive in 2017. We don't anticipate a CSP program of the sort that we had in 16 and we expect capital spending to come in around $120 million.","With that, I will turn it over to Kevin to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna.","Robert Barry","Hey guys, good morning.","Dan Florness","Hey Rob, good morning.","Robert Barry","So I guess the broader question is just to provide a little bit more color about what you're seeing in some of the key end markets in particular heavy and light manufacturing in oil and gas, but also more specifically, I noticed you updated the monthly sequentials and I think if you plug those into the model it implies 1Q growth would be just over 5%. I know that's not meant as an outlook, but is that how you're thinking that growth could track in 1Q?","Holden Lewis","Sure. So, to address your second question first. We all know how the math works. Yes, we've updated the sequentials. As we go into 2017 we're going to begin discussing those sequential rates of change in terms of the prior five year averages as opposed to what we've done historically with 98 going from 1998 forward. So the numbers are what the numbers are. I'll let you plug them in and kind of figure out where it is, but I think that you're on the right track in terms of how that should fall out given those sequential rates to change.","On the second question, where we saw the most encouraging signs I would say would have been in the process industries and we go about this a couple of ways. We listen to our Regional Vice Presidents and what they're seeing in the marketplace and then we look at our top 100 accounts to get a sense of which areas are doing well, which ones are not and what I would tell you is, the general industrial companies on our lists, they're still challenged.","That's been the case most of the year and I'm not sure that I saw or have heard any meaningful difference in the fourth quarter as it relates to general industrial firms. As it relates to the process industries, I would tell you that a lot of those including oil and gas looked better among our top 100 and then if you sort of listen to some of our RVPs talk about energy there definitely is more of an enthusiasm and some more encouraging facts on the ground in those regions that are heavier in oil and gas. So what I would tell you is, I don't feel like the fourth quarter felt a lot different in a lot of places than what we saw in the third quarter, but the notable exception would have been in those process industries and that oil and gas space.","As you know, we were surprised by how impactful the decline in oil and gas was to us when it began to head south couple years ago. We would consider it a positive if in fact oil and gas had some legs and did better from here, but we'll see how that plays out.","Robert Barry","Right, right. Maybe just for my second question just on the gross margin, nice sequential rise, you listed a number of reasons for the improvement, but one of them was not price and I was just wondering if you can comment on what's happening in the pricing environment and in particular given we've started to see some inflation and in fact, I think we've seen inflation for several quarters now, how do you feel about the ability to start getting price, especially if some of these end markets are still a little sluggish?","Holden Lewis","Sure. We've seen the same thing that you have with respect to commodity prices. I would tell you that those increases are relatively new. We've seen it happen before, only to sort of retrace if you will. So I think it's probably premature to be saying that we have clearly entered a re-flation period, if you will, but that said, we're watching it and we believe that if, if those raw material increases prove to be durable we believe that as we have in the past, we will be able to pass that through, through price increases. Yes, we don't have any reason at this point to think that that would not be a part of the equation. However, we have not at this point taken significant strides to begin that process yet.","Robert Barry","Yes, I mean how much of a lag historically would there be, like several quarters or how do you think about...","Dan Florness","Hey Rob, yes. I'm going to chime in so we can keep going through the roster - your questions, sorry.","Robert Barry","Okay. Yes, of course, sorry. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse.","Andrew Buscaglia","Hey guys. Congrats on a good quarter.","Dan Florness","Thank you.","Holden Lewis","Thank you.","Andrew Buscaglia","Yes, can you and can you touch on, it sounds like, you didn\u2019t have a ton of commentary, I guess in the press release or your prepared remarks just on trends improving. Can you comment maybe what you're seeing through January and just it sounds like December was a little bit muddled with timing and stuff like that, but just any recent update would be great?","Dan Florness","I'm going to just interject one thing and then I'll shut up and let Holden talk. In regards to January we've learned over the years there are certain places you don't go because invariably what we talk about we're always wrong and the question is how wrong. So I'll stop Holden before he starts [indiscernible]. With that, I'll let Holden have his say.","Holden Lewis","Yes, I don't think there's a whole lot to add. We're not going to comment on January. I mean we put out the sequential rate of change that we're sort of looking at and beyond that, we're not going to go there, but I'll just reiterate again, fourth quarter was a lot richer on optimism than it was real progress. But you have to, we listen to the people in the field, we look at the same data that you guys tend to look at, and it's, it hopefully will translate into better results as we go through 2017.","But I'll just leave it as in fourth quarter, general industrial companies were still fairly slow and if there was a favourable inflection it is in the process of the oil and gas industries and that's very early, so let\u2019s see how that plays out and I don't think that I noted anything that inflected negatively.","Andrew Buscaglia","Okay. Got it and then just switching on to the gross margins. Some of the things you had been experiencing with regards to customer negative customer mix, product mix, how are you feeling about gross margins in 2017 versus 2016 just relative to some of those sort of longer term headwinds we have been experiencing?","Dan Florness ","If you think of the growth drivers we've talked about for a number of years and again growth drivers are, I just want to caution, our sales plan at the local level is what drives our business. The growth drivers that we talk about serves as the means to the end of how you serve your customer. The impact of, we had, I believe we had a very successful year taking some first steps, steps that started one and two years ago of expanding our onsite presence, all those things continue a pattern that's been in place for 20 years and that is our mix of customers are continually changing.","Our product mix continues to move a bit away from fasteners. Perhaps we can slow that down a little bit if there is some recovery that helps our fastener business in calendar 2017, but the underlying long term pattern is still what it is. And what we need to be smart about every day is identifying those pieces we can grab on to and make a little better \u2013 a decade ago a piece we grabbed onto was freight.","In the last five to seven years a piece we've grabbed on to is our exclusive brands, our private labels and making sure we have a great strategy to support our supplier base and our product mix in serving our customers. And, but the underlying trends are still there. We just need to defend the position every day and I think we gained some footing on that as we went through 2016. It was still a tough year to go through 2015 and 2016 I should say, because the trend has been going on for several years.","Andrew Buscaglia","Right, okay, alright. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning. Thank you. Just had a big - I just had a big picture question around the store network. How should we be thinking about the store network longer term given the aggressive push on onsite? Does onsite cannibalize any other store revenues? Just any color on that piece. And then you talked about participation rate going up with district managers on onsite, but could you give some color on the sales cycle as well, does it take a year or six months, any color around the onsite business would be helpful?","Holden Lewis","Sure. Probably the best way to think about the big picture from a store network standpoint is, is over the last 20 years we've been quietly growing onsite in some of our Mid-Western business units. So last week I was in Southern Wisconsin, all of our general managers were in and in that discussion one of the things that stands out when I think of our business in Wisconsin and Illinois, over a third of our revenue in that business unit above 35% comes through the onsite type of strategy where we've been incredibly successful over time and developing our business in a broader fashion. But if I think of that business over the last 20 years we continued to open stores.","We continued to grow our footprint and some of that, stem from the fact that we had things going on. We had non-fasteners growing in our business. So lot of markets that traditionally weren\u2019t viable became viable. In more recent years we made improvements from the vending side of the equation, but we believe long term it's a huge market out there number one, and we espouse that often.","We're not wed to one strategy, we're wed to getting close to our customer where it economically works in providing them a level of service that our competitors either can't or are unwilling to do and we believe it's a compliment of both. Only time will tell if structurally the fact patterns of our industry change and it prompts our ultimate store count to go up or go down, but the market is still there and we need to, of all to serve that market, but history has shown they're very complementary to each other onsite and store.","In relation to onsite, it's typically a multi-year endeavour. Part of it is us getting, it's like anything it's incremental. So, we move, when we move in if you will, in the case for an onsite, it depends sometimes on the product lines we're starting with. It might move faster if we're moving in with an OEM relationship or a broad bending platform relationship. It might move a little slower if it's a broader mix of products and we're picking up particular commodities as we go along.","I believe it's probably in many cases two to four year endeavour to get in deeper, maybe it's one to five, but it takes time and that's one of the points that we stressed earlier in the year as we want to build momentum back into our business and getting traction to the onsite is a big piece of that.","Holden Lewis","Hamzah, you also asked something about cannibalization and in fact we do generally speaking take some sales out of the store and that becomes the seed revenue for that onsite and what we find is that inside of 12 to 24 months that seed revenue has grown dramatically from its original number.","As it relates to the store, our expectation generally is that that store, which now note doesn't have to provide a disproportionate service to a single customer can sort of have, it's sort of selling energy reinvigorated and then they can go out and from a bit of the lower base begin to grow that business again. And we've sort of all through the compensation with the onsite business to make it neutral from that standpoint, but the expectation is that the store, sort of no longer responsible for that piece of revenue will go on to find new active accounts and just begin to grow that business again from that new level.","Dan Florness","One additional piece in when I think of the cannibalization that comment would have been true of store openings for the last 30 years as well and so onsite isn\u2019t new piece of the equation. Really what we're doing and I think Holden described it best, we're taking some seed dollars where we have a great relationship and we're going after business that historically, our store network wound not go after because it wasn't geared to service that business given the profile of the gross margin in that business and we need to structurally change our cost components to go after that business.","Hamzah Mazari","That's very helpful color, I appreciate it. Just a followup and I'll turn it over. How much of your cost of goods sold is foreign sourcing? A competitor of yours mentioned, there is just 15%, just trying to get a sense of what you guys are on at? Thank you.","Holden Lewis","So what we have said is that we think that 40% to 45% of our COGS are probably derived from overseas. I don't know what the competitor, how he is defining the number. I will tell you that of that 40% to 45% not all of that is directly sourced, obviously have a significant operation with passcode that directly sources product, but that does not rise to near the level of 40% to 45%. So the number that we use includes not only the directly sourced, but also that product that we may buy domestically, but ultimately is sourced from an overseas customer. But we talk about it in terms of 40% to 45% of our COGS and that's, that's kind of how we've discussed it.","Hamzah Mazari","Got it. It makes sense. Thank you.","Dan Florness","I'll add on one piece there as well. The fastener production moved offshore of North America. So, Fastener on in 2017 we're celebrating our 50th year in business largely the trends within fasteners were moving offshore well became we even became a company and a lot of that was driven by the automotive sector back in the late '50s and early '60s. So our percentage is a little bit higher because of the Fastener concentration in our business.","With that said, our concentration won\u2019t be any different than any of our peers in the industry given some of the product mix. And so I see us as being in a similar boat if you will, with everybody else with a lower cost structure in our underlying business.","Hamzah Mazari","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair.","Ryan Merkel","Hey thanks. Good morning guys.","Dan Florness","Good morning.","Holden Lewis","Good morning.","Ryan Merkel","So first Holden, you said with a little faster growth you could leverage the income statement in 2017. So two questions, what level of sales growth do you think they need to see SG&A leverage and then secondly is SG&A growing half the rate of sales a reasonable goal in 2017?","Holden Lewis","So I don't think that our original guidance was changed. I think we said that at sort of low to mid-type of revenue growth that we will look to sustain the margin and if we can get mid to high-type of growth we can expand it. I still think that that is, generally speaking, where we see the model.","In terms of the rate of growth of SG&A, bear in mind that if we do in fact get better growth then we would expect to see our incentive comp go up. We're going to continue to invest in vending. And so, we have talked about achieving 20% to 25% type incremental in sort of a low to mid-type single-digit growth environment and maybe 25% to 30% type incrementals, if you get to mid to high sort of where we were I think in the third quarter and we haven't seen anything that sort of changes that.","Ryan Merkel","Perfect . Got it, okay. And then second back to the onsites how are the installations you've done working and how much did onsite add to growth in 2016, if you have that number handy, because I think you were hoping for maybe 300, 400 basis points to grow from onsite this year?","Holden Lewis","The onsites grew as a category about 25% for the year.","Dan Florness","That's including the transferred, came like dollars.","Holden Lewis","Correct. Yes, that\u2019s the challenge. Right, so we\u2019re up 120.","Dan Florness","Let me, Ryan why don\u2019t we talk about the specific numbers offline. We have them, but I'm not going to do the math on this forum. So when we touch base on it offline.","Ryan Merkel","No worries. But just you've sign up a lot of onsites, are they working as you expected out of stores starting to add new active accounts with the freed up selling energy.","Dan Florness","Yes, I'll answer that from the standpoint, we took a deep dive look at the onsites that had been turned on and had sufficient history and for us sufficient history meant they had to be operating at least nine months. And so we looked at that to see what\u2019s happening in that group and we liked what we saw and we weren't surprised by what we saw.","We saw a group of accounts and the numbers that we really analyzed it was just over 50 of our onsites that have been operating long after we could really get a feel for it. And the trends were solid and it wasn't driven by a few that were pulling it up or pulling it down and which is good to see. It was a good performance generally speaking across the group.","We saw that the gross margin of the store that\u2019s spawned, I don\u2019t know if that's the right word, but that on the onsite business their gross margin went up post separating the business, which is what we would expect because typically you're taking a larger customer you might be at 10 to 20, $30,000 month customer and you\u2019re extracting it from $100 to $120, $150 store and the remaining business actually have slightly higher gross margin.","So we saw that as we expected, we saw that business with , with a little bit with a lower gross margin than our average onsite, but that is very typical, because often times when you are stepping into a new onsite you are stepping into products that you might be not sourcing half mil yet.","You might not truly understand some of the products from the standpoint of I think is back to that optimal sourcing component. You might have product where you know the optimal source, but you're going to get the product in for three, four, five, six months, and so you have some lower margin sales that are going out.","You might have some product that the customer had a meaningful supply on and you don\u2019t pick up that business for a period of time. But when I look at those onsites that we've studied again we were pleased with the results and we're surprised by the results. I suspect when Holden runs his numbers he is going to find a low single digit probably of one to two kind of number given the fact that so, much of our business was ramping up in the latter half of the year, but I'll hand it back to Holden.","Holden Lewis","Yes, so the incremental revenues through onsite would have increased our revenue, probably a little bit over 3% for the year, do you remember that does include some cannibalization. That would take that down a little bit, that's a total number, but the onsite revenue did in fact contribute a little more than 3% of our growth.","Dan Florness","I would suspect it would probably cut it by a third to half.","Ryan Merkel","Yes, okay. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, everybody.","Dan Florness","Hi Rob.","Robert McCarthy","Just following up on a couple issues, I suppose first, just maybe Holden you could talk about the process industries and oil and gas and maybe give us some sense of what you think the exposure is, just maybe walk us through the number of stores in the right regions, give us a sense beyond kind of the SIC codes of how big the overall exposure could be to your network for sales?","Holden Lewis","Yes. So the direct impact is fairly light; I think we've talked about sort of low, mid-single digit direct impact from the oil and gas industry. So you're right to say that the impact is really more indirect. I'm not sure that we've really sort of come down exactly on a sort of a number we think it is. It clearly does matter and Dan can give more historical perspective, in terms of what the full-year impact is. But bear in mind that where that full year impact comes from companies like Flowserve or Wear Group that are not oil and gas companies, if you will. They are pump companies or engineering companies, but they have significant exposure to the oil and gas within their overall customer mix, that's where our exposure comes from. So there is a challenge in figuring out the full exposure comes from that fact.","Dan, do you know kind of what our little full year indirect impact might be?","Dan Florness","I don't, in the past I think we've talked about a number somewhere between 10% and 12%, but we, it's really difficult to pinpoint it because there is so much indirect impact. The example I\u2019ve often cited is, if I travel an hour and a half to visit my mom, there is a sand mine up, two sand mines within two miles of the pharma Groupon. One was they both were operating, two years ago, one was operating 24 hours a day, the other one was operating 16 hours a day. One of the shut down and the other one has one shift. Our Red Wing store was impacted by oil and gas, but I went to sort of our Red Wing, Minnesota stores having an impact of oil and gas. So it's very hard to list it out.","Robert McCarthy","Okay and Holden perhaps we'll table that for a little probing offline. The second major question for this call is maybe you just talk about onsite. I mean, obviously people have been talking about the opportunities there in terms of what's going on, but maybe just talk about really how important is from an optimization of network potential?","I mean, I think you cited in the past at least anecdotally, how high the margin is in your legacy stores and kind of your book [ph] Gaiden, which is the upper peninsula of the Midwest and Minnesota in terms of where the margins are and could you just talk about, really what you think the margin opportunity long term could be for the company at least qualitatively given onsite?","Dan Florness","Well, I\u2019ll throw out a few pieces, and then we'll wrap the call, so running up against 45 minutes. For us profitability on the day really stems from where is our average store size in that region and how well are we doing managing the growth of our business over time. So if I look at the Midwest where we have a greater concentration of onsite. It is also an area or the country where we have the largest average store site because it has grown over time.","Our West Coast started opening up 20 years. Our Midwest started opening up 50 years ago. So we have a 20 to 30 year head start. And our highest operating margin business is in the Midwest. With that said, one thing Bob Kierlin has always reminded us and in the 20 years that I've been here and probably in the50 years if he has been here is that at the end of the day gross margin marker we look at to understand our business.","Operating margin is a marker we look at to understand our business, but great organizations long-term focus on where they can provide their shareholders with their employees with an opportunity, their customer with the service and their shareholders with a return on investment. And we like the various businesses within Fastenal, because they all provide a very attractive return and that is at the end of the day the ultimate test of a business. And if you're providing opportunities to employees, you have a great organization to serve your customer long term; we believe we have all those components in our store network and in onsite.","With that, I see we're at 45 minutes and similar prior quarters, we realized we're in the thick of earning season and everybody has a pretty busy plate. We\u2019ll sign off for now again. Thank you for your support of Fastenal and thank you for welcoming Holden to the team.","Holden Lewis","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"9075":["Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 11, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Ellen Stolts - Financial Reporting and Regulatory Compliance Manager","Daniel Florness - President and Chief Executive Officer","Holden Lewis - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Robert Barry - The Buckingham Research Group","Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","David Manthey - Robert W.

I\u2019m going to \u2013 before I step into Holden\u2019s flipbook, just going to touch on a few comments that I had with our leadership in our normal call at 7 o\u2019clock this morning to talk about the quarter to give them a little insight about some things we\u2019ll be focusing on in the call as well as just some off-the-cuff comments I made to them.","My first comment to them this morning was a sincere thank you for a job well done. I think, this is a really nice start to the year and I\u2019m pleased with the performance we\u2019re seeing across our business units throughout the planet and a very positive start to the year.","Also mentioned to them about the challenge that comes when you get into the \u2013 a multi-year improvement in business. So, when I think back to stepping into this role back in 2000 \u2013 late in 2015, we\u2019ve had a tough year. The economy had not been our friend that year. And when you\u2019re exposed to the industrial marketplace and it flips on you, it can cause some pain in the short-term, but we kept focusing on what we focused on, that\u2019s our customer.","We kept focusing on things to make our business better, and we really started the transition to a much more focused approach on some of our growth drivers, particularly breathing some new life into vending and challenging ourselves to look at Onsites as a \u2013 as not a solution when there\u2019s not an alternative, but as a means to grow faster and a new growth driver within our business because it\u2019s a wonderful way to extend what is the traditional Fastenal relationship, but lower your cost structure at the same time, and . And I hope these numbers are all correct.","I haven\u2019t proofed them through our screening process. This is just me jotting down some numbers. But what I shared with them was, if I stack together multiple years, five of the last seven months, if I look at it taking three years added together and again I hope I calculated it correctly, I believe five of the last seven months, we\u2019ve been 30%-plus when you look at the cumulative impact of the last three years. And November and January, the only two months that didn\u2019t break that 30% and they were at 29%, so a good number.","And I believe for the last 14 months, if you looked at that on a two-year basis and combined year one and year two growth, you\u2019re at a number that starts with two, so north of 20%. But since August, I believe that number is north of 25%. So not only are we \u2013 do we have great local plans to engage with our customer and grow our business, but we\u2019re able to stack that on top of some comps that are frankly challenging and really pleased with what the group is doing, and we\u2019re really proud of the group and proud to be associated with them.","The \u2013 I also shared with them one of the blessings and curses of the Internet age is, it\u2019s easy for people to make comments. Sometimes you read through a newspaper and some of the comments you see you\u2019re kind of like boy, that person just seems angry about something. It\u2019s not this article, but they\u2019re just angry or you can tell that person\u2019s, maybe political view is driving their commentary they\u2019re putting into an article.","But at 10 o\u2019clock last night, I was reading a comment that came in from a customer. And every comment that comes into Fastenal, I\u2019m on an e-mail distribution list, and I read through them. Sometimes I do it late at night before I go to bed. Sometimes I do it early in the morning. And I\u2019m reading one last night, it was a fellow, he said, I\u2019m an older gentleman and I\u2019m 61 years old. That pained me a little bit, because I\u2019m 55. And I hear somebody at 61 refers themselves that old was a little troubling, but that\u2019s a different issue.","But this individual was talking about where our branch, San Antonio, Texas branch, but where our branch went above and beyond the call and really helped him solve a problem. And I floated it out to our regional leadership last night, and I said, you know, what folks, this is what we\u2019re about.","We\u2019re about solving people\u2019s problems, because in today\u2019s world, sometimes it\u2019s hard to find people to help you solve the problem. And it was a fun one to share, because sometimes you get in a few here and there that aren\u2019t as positive and you assess them to understand what we can do to be better. But now I\u2019ll flip the Holden\u2019s book here.","We grew 6 \u2013 we had 68% \u2013 $0.68 of earnings, nice start there, almost 12% earnings per share growth, bottom line is we grew our earnings faster than our sales. And that\u2019s not an easy act in a quarter where weather was very impactful and with one less selling day, we \u2013 we\u2019re in a situation of \u2013 with $20 million a day in revenue, there\u2019s chunk of revenue or chunk of gross profit dollars that aren\u2019t there, but the expenses typically are, so to pull off what we did when we\u2019re down a day is a pretty positive thing.","Despite the challenging weather, our demand continued to be healthy. Our daily sales growth was 12.2% in the quarter, and I think as Holden said, well 2019 has started where 2018 left off. Operating margin expanded 20 basis points and our incremental margin was 21.7.","As we\u2019ve talked about in prior calls, our growth drivers are changing the mix of our business. If we\u2019re successful with it, it\u2019s going to pull gross margins down. If we\u2019re successful with it, we should be able to leverage our operating expenses, and it should result in a great win for our customer, for our employee, for our supplier, and for you our shareholders, and I think you saw that in the first quarter here.","But sequentially, we did hold gross margin flat, which was really a sign of some of the price increases we put in late last year in the wake of tariffs and inflations allowed us a little breathing room in the short-term, but Holden will touch on that a little bit more in his comments.","We\u2019ve talked about this in the past. Our business as it continues to grow with larger customers and with international customers, sometimes we get caught in a situation where you have a customer that\u2019s doing some window dressing at the end of a year, end of a quarter, and they frankly stop paying with two, three, four weeks left in the quarter, and it makes for a challenging situation.","Our solution here is to constantly be engaged in discussion with our customer about our value proposition to you is a better supply chain. We take inventory off your balance sheet, don\u2019t do this to us at the end of the quarter, because what it ultimately does, it puts us in a position where we can\u2019t fund inventory, because there\u2019s trade-offs.","If we know if we\u2019re going to have an extra $5 million of receivable, we have to squeeze that somewhere else and that doesn\u2019t serve our customer and we need to be engaged in that dialogue and challenge. If you want to do window dressing, do it with somebody else\u2019s payable, not with ours. And \u2013 but we did produce a stronger cash flow in the quarter and allowed us to pay a higher dividend and reduced that a little bit.","Onsite, I remember when \u2013 years ago when we did CSP, and we really went through a change in our branch network. And \u2013 but at some point in time, we stopped talking about CSP, because CSP became part of us. Now we\u2019re going to keep talking about Onsite from the standpoint of sharing with you our location count and our penetration in the market and where we\u2019re finding success.","But I \u2013 but we\u2019re going to break a 1,000 Onsite sometime here in the second quarter. I guess, that\u2019s a forward-looking statement, but one I\u2019m pretty safe in saying. But it\u2019s truly part of Fastenal. We have Onsites throughout our region, throughout our districts. And so it\u2019s not something we\u2019re experimenting with or pushing people to change or even pushing customers to consider and change.","We\u2019re doing all that, but we\u2019re doing that from a base of knowledge similar to a \u2013 not too many years ago, when we were talking to the industry about vending machines. But on Onsites, our goals are pretty simple this year. Let\u2019s sign 375 to 400. There\u2019s 52 weeks in the year. You got to take out a couple of those weeks, because it\u2019s the holidays and they are not a lot happens those weeks.","But if we can do eight signings per week and do it 50 weeks of the year, that\u2019s 400. And so in the first quarter, we got up to a really nice start. We hit that number and we signed 105, so very pleased.","Our sales growth removing the transferred sales. So if I have an existing customer when we go Onsite, we probably pull some revenue out of a branch and move it over there. But ignoring that, that business is growing north of 20%, really pleased with what the team is doing.","On vending, our goal is to do 23,000 to 25,000, so there\u2019s 254 business days in the year. We need it \u2013 we need to sign roughly 100 every day to get at the high-end of that number. If we sign 90 everyday, we\u2019re at the low-end of that number. We were just shy of 90 in the first quarter, but in the month of March, we rounded up to 100. We were at 99.6 per day. So we \u2013 we\u2019re off to, I think, a nice start. And again, it\u2019s just part of our extension into our customers\u2019 facilities.","Speaking of vending, I had a new experience yesterday. So one of the things that we\u2019ve struggled with is, we\u2019ve had a member a few years ago at an Investor Day talked about the idea of having outdoor lockers or having lockers, where we can do deliveries into.","Frankly, we struggled to make the technology easy to use. And so we didn\u2019t get really much traction with it, and we have very few branches that have outdoor lockers. We have now built the interface between our point-of-sale system in our vending platform, which is a third-party software. And yesterday morning, I ordered something. We had turned on our Winona branch on Monday.","So yesterday morning I ordered something. I immediately had a confirmation of that order. And a couple of hours later, I got an e-mail, you order is ready to pick up. And I went over and I punched in my six digit code and I pulled a \u2013 an item out of the locker. It was a really easy and seamless transaction. Now that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to be getting into the retail business anytime soon.","But if I think of our Onsites, if I think of our customers that need something and they want to get in and out quickly, or they are coming in after hours, it provides a great extension of our \u2013 of the hours of our day and our ability to serve our customers. And I\u2019m really excited about what that means, but really also proud of our technology team for developing that and it worked really easily.","And I\u2019ve gotten in the habit in recent months of buying a lot of stuff online. And one of the companies I\u2019m really impressed with, and I buy from them once a week to understand what they\u2019re changing and I keep bringing comments to our folks as a result. I don\u2019t know any of you have ever bought on Walmart online. They do a really nice job. Now again, we\u2019re not a retailer, but making it easy and making it efficient for your customer is an important part of the equation and we finally have that working.","National accounts grew 17% in the first quarter. The team continues do a great job of making promises to customers in our branch and an Onsite network of \u2013 along with everybody else that supports them does a great job of honoring those promises. So good quarter.","Outside the U.S., exchange rate is a full right now. International is about 14% of our revenue, and we grew in the mid-teens, I believe the number was about 17%, and so continued to be really impressed with our teams there and our ability to extend the U.S. and Canadian relationships broadly around the planet. So excellent job to the team.","With that, I\u2019m going to turn over to Holden. But before I do that, when I read through his notes, one thing jumped out at me and that was the PMI at 55.4. And I almost \u2013 when I read stuff or even read his notes, it almost felt like that was kind of an eee number. And I\u2019ve been here for 23 years, and I\u2019ve never thought of 55.4 as an eee number, and I have seen that in some of the external reporting.","So we\u2019re seeing a good tone in the marketplace. Holden is going to touch on some oil and gas concerns. And being a farm kid, I know the agricultural side has had some tough time in the last year with commodity prices and I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some weakness there, but we\u2019re pretty bullish on what we\u2019re seeing. Holden?","Holden Lewis","Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. So let\u2019s just jump on to Slide 5. Total sales, as Dan indicated, were up 10.4%. There was one fewer sales day in the first quarter versus last year\u2019s. On a same day\u2019s basis, sales were up 12.2%. We estimate the severe weather in the Northern U.S. and Central Canada reduced sales by between 60 and 90 basis points. Though remember, last year there was a weather issue as well, so net of last year\u2019s weather impact. The total effect is probably 20 to 30 basis points.","In March, our daily sales growth was 12.7%. Pricing in response to tariffs and general inflation contributed 90 to 120 basis points in the period. This is below the level of the fourth quarter of 2018, but incremental progress is being masked by the current \u2013 in the current period by having to grow over the price increases that began to benefit last year\u2019s 1Q. We do look at it and believe that sequentially our price realize \u2013 realization was slightly higher.","From a macro standpoint, as Dan said, the PMI averaged 55.4 in the first quarter of 2019. This is the lowest level in nine quarters, which is what is getting a lot of the print, but it does still constitute a healthy level as reflected in continued low to mid single-digit growth in industrial production.","Relatedly, our manufacturing end markets were up 13.4%, with recent trends remaining in force. Most sub verticals that we track are healthy. The main exception being oil and gas, which remain soft. Construction was up 13.1% in the first quarter of 2019. The January comparison was easy, but February and March also continue to grow double digits as a result of healthy markets and strong internal selling energy.","From a product standpoint, on a daily sales basis, fasteners were up 11.8% and non-fasteners were up 12.7%. In March, fasteners outgrew non-fasteners. Fastener growth has been sustained at high levels, while safety growth moderated to a mid-teens rate following what were two years of 20%-plus of growth in that product vertical. This has served to narrow the growth gap between fasteners and other products. But overall, we remain pleased with the growth of our main product categories.","From a customer standpoint, national accounts were up 16.9% in the quarter, with 81 of our top 100 accounts growing. Growth to non-national accounts was mid single digits, nearly 65% of our branches grew in the first quarter.","In terms of market tone, regional leadership remains constructive on demand with the caution that was evident last November largely gone. The exception, as I mentioned, was oil and gas. We haven\u2019t seen the weakness in that market deepen, but we have seen it broaden across more of our regions. Still on the whole, 2019 seems to be starting much as 2018 finished.","Now to Slide 6. Our gross margin was 47.7% in the first quarter of 2019, down 100 basis points from first quarter of 2018, but flat on a sequential basis something we haven\u2019t seen since the first quarter of 2015.","On a year-over-year basis, the familiar variables played out. Customer and product mix pulled the margin down, which is expected given that the national accounts and Onsite continue to drive our growth. Trade remained a drag though not to the same degree we experienced in 2018. Net rebates were a slight negative as well as a result of efforts to limit inventory growth.","Our price cost deficit in the first quarter of 2019 was 20 basis points, which is half of the deficit that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018 as a result of incremental progress with pricing in the period to address inflation and tariffs. We expect to make further progress towards eliminating this deficit in the second quarter of 2019 and over the course of the full-year.","Our operating margin was 20% in the first quarter 2019, up 20 basis points year-over-year. Continued healthy growth drove a 110 basis points of cost leverage and generated an incremental margin of 21.7%.","Looking at the pieces. We achieved 60 basis points of leverage over employee-related costs, which were up 7.1%. This leverage was generated, because FTE headcount growth lag sales at up 6.2% and due to our incentive compensation growing at a healthy, but moderated level versus last year.","Occupancy-related costs were up 2.3%, generating 35 basis points of leverage, a decline in branch expense as we continue to rationalize sites and only modest increases in non-branch occupancy costs mitigated what was double-digit growth in vending costs as we continue to expand the installed base.","We generated 20 basis points of leverage over other operating administrative expenses. The benefits of higher sales on this line was partly offset by a relatively active quarter for legal settlements and a large net debt write-off. These generated probably $2 million to $2.5 million more in cost in this period than we would have otherwise expected.","As described in the past, success with our growth drivers is likely to reduce gross margin over time, but also provides the platform and volume that generates good operating expense leverage. That played out in the first quarter of 2019, and we expect it to continue to play out over time. So putting it all together, we reported first quarter 2019 EPS of $0.68 versus $0.61 in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 11.9%.","Turning to Slide 7. Before jumping into the numbers, I just wanted to call your attention, a change in our balance sheet. This quarter, we adopted FASB\u2019s new standard for accounting for leases, which requires us to move operating leases on to the balance sheet. You\u2019ll see these values on separate lines identified as right of use assets and current long-term liabilities. The impact of adopting this standard on our income statement and cash flow was immaterial.","Now looking at the cash flow statement. We generated $205 million in operating cash in the first quarter 2019, or 106% of net income. This remains below the historical rates of conversion that we have experienced in first quarters, but is meaningfully above last year\u2019s 92% figure. The challenge remains working capital, which I\u2019ll cover in a moment.","Net capital spending in the first quarter was $53 million, up from $29 million in the first quarter 2018. But consistent with expectations, this reflects investments in hub property and equipment that are necessary to support our high service levels, as well as investments in vending equipment to support growth in our installed base.","Our 2018 range for total net capital spending is unchanged between $195 million and $225 million to invest in hub property and equipment and vehicles to support our growth and vending devices to support our rising success in this initiative. We increased funds paid out in dividends by 16% to $123 million and reduced debt.","We finished the quarter with debt at 16.9% of total capital above last year\u2019s 15.7%, but down sequentially and at a level that we believe provides ample liquidity to invest in our business and pay our dividend.","The working capital picture remains challenging, but improved. Inventories were up 14% in the first quarter of 2019, with days on hand flat year-over-year. We continue to experience inflationary pressure on our inventories. However, during the period, we worked off the foreign sourced inventory that was accelerated into the U.S. in the fourth quarter 2018 and advanced several initiatives aimed at making us more efficient with inventory.","AR grew 15.2% in the first quarter of 2019, with customers continuing to aggressively push payments out past quarter-end. As has been the case in past quarters, we are not seeing any meaningful change in hard-to-collect balances. Reducing these annual growth rates will be an area on which to improve over the balance of the year.","That is all for our formal presentation. So with that, operator, we\u2019ll take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Barry of Buckingham. Your line is open.","Robert Barry","Hey, guys, good morning.","Daniel Florness","Good morning.","Holden Lewis","Good morning.","Robert Barry","Congrats solid start to the year.","Daniel Florness","Thank you.","Robert Barry","So, you mentioned in the slide deck that reminded us that Good Friday is in April this year versus in March last year. How much did that impact the March number? And adjusting for that is your read that things may be decelerated a little bit in March?","Holden Lewis","Yes. So, I think it\u2019s difficult to really burrow into what that number meant. I mean, last year, Good Friday felt on \u2013 fell on the last day of the month and it fell on a Friday. And so we have a lot of sort of month-end payments coming through. So was there a modest impact as a result of the timing of the holidays in the month, there probably was.","But look, I guess, the perspective that I would give to you, Rob, is this, if we\u2019re going to try to parse out the impact of a holiday, the impact of a \u2013 of days in the month, et cetera, we also should probably be talking about variables such as foreign exchange and weather and all these other things that impact our month.","And if I look at \u2013 if I try to adjust for all of these things, the fact is the growth that we experienced in the first quarter, if I adjust for acquisitions over the past 22 months, if I adjust for foreign exchange, if I adjust for weather events that we call out, we grew north of 13% adjusting for all of those things.","If I look at the six-month growth rate, it was a little over 13%. If I look at the 12-month growth rate, it was a little over 13%. So the question that you\u2019re trying to get at, at the end of the day is, if you take out one piece, does that suggest that we\u2019re growing more slowly? And the answer I would give you is, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re experiencing in the market through March.","I would say that if you try to adjust for all the pieces, our growth rate has been remarkably stable at a fairly high level. And I think that with the exception of oil and gas, it\u2019s reflective of a business environment that remains fairly healthy through March. So that\u2019s probably how I\u2019d characterize it. So no, I think, you\u2019re right. But let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that foreign exchange was as big of a drag on this quarter as we\u2019ve seen since we began to grow. There\u2019s a lot of moving pieces that go into it, but generally speaking, the environment feels healthy to us.","Daniel Florness","Rob, I want to throw a little add on, Holden\u2019s dead on right. And he comes at it, I can always tell, he worked in your world for many years. He thinks about stuff. I enjoy our conversations because he thinks about things fundamentally different. My answer probably would have been a little briefer, Rob. I probably have said, \"You know what? I honestly don\u2019t know.\" If I ask 10 people, I would get 14 answers.","Historically, internally, I\u2019ve always said to our team, you know what, when we pick up a day or lose a day or Good Friday comes into play, I usually throw in the joke that Easter is on a Sunday this year and a Good Friday is on Friday. But I\u2019ve always had in my head, it\u2019s probably half a point.","And when Holden asked me earlier about this question, I said, yeah, I said it helped us. Weather hurt us. This morning, my kids are at home driving my dog is crazy, because we have a snowstorm in Winona, and it was thunder and lightning all night long. Weather impacted us. Good Friday impacted us. Good Friday will hurt us here in April. And if I were to put a number on it, probably 0.5%. But your underlying question is, did the tone change, and I honestly don\u2019t think it did.","Robert Barry","All right, great. I guess, my other question was just on seeing the FTEs grow just over six and kind of looking at data from the BLF, it looks like wage inflation in manufacturing is running 2%, 3%. So to see your employee-related expense up only 7, seems like a pretty noteworthy performance. And I was just wondering if you can comment on kind of what\u2019s driving that and kind of how sustainable you think the ability to kind of leverage that line at this level is as we kind of look out over the next several quarters?","Daniel Florness","I\u2019ll chime in on that and Holden can add some nuance and some things that I might not be sharing or appreciating. And if you think of what was going on the last couple of years, we were seeing massive inflation in our numbers, not because of the marketplace, but because of our performance.","We pay a lot of incentive comp, and so this morning as an example, I was talking \u2013 when I was \u2013 when we were talking to the RVPs, our Regional Vice Presidents, one of the things I said to them, I said, \u201cHey folks, congratulations on a nice first quarter.\u201d But I gave them a little bit of a cautious tone going in the second quarter. I said \u201cSecond quarter this year is our most challenging year from a comp stand \u2013from a comparison standpoint and earnings, the incremental margin standpoint.\u201d Because last year in the first quarter, we grew our earnings, I believe, it was. $21 million.","And then from Q1 to Q2 that number \u2013 that earnings growth number went to $30 million. And so our incentive comp expanded dramatically. And if you look in our proxy, you could see from a leadership standpoint and that proportion works out throughout the organization. We pay off earnings growth. And so, I gave them a caution for Q2.","But an answer to your question, are we seeing underlying inflation in labor rates if I think people that are working in our distribution centers that are throughout the organization, yes, we\u2019re seeing inflation rates of the economy.","One of the thing that\u2019s masking a bit right now is the fact that our incentive comp isn\u2019t expanding at the pace it was the last couple of years, and that\u2019s why our incremental margin is shining through things we talked about in the past. But it gives a buffer, and one of your peers described it really well years ago when he talked about the shock absorbers in our system.","When we\u2019re getting great earnings growth, we share a chunk up with our employees and we take the little leverage out in a weaker environment, everybody steps up to the plate and loses a little bit of pay, because the incentive comp contracts. And so that\u2019s part of the dynamic you\u2019re going on there is, yes, is there underlying inflation in wage rates? Yes. We\u2019re employing the same base of people everybody else is from the standpoint, where we draw from. But our incentive comp is at a high watermark a year ago and it\u2019s at a high watermark now, but incrementally it\u2019s not growing the same way.","Holden Lewis","That\u2019s right. And \u2013 but yes, Rob, there definitely was a little bit of inflation as it relates to just sort of our base pay to our full timers and our part timers. But when you marry that up with the increase that we had in FTEs and headcount, we were still able to leverage that piece of our business. And then what do you throw on top of that that the incentive pay piece, we actually didn\u2019t leverage that, because the good news is, we\u2019re growing like we\u2019re growing. Incentive pay is a big piece that shock absorber, if you will, when we\u2019re growing.","We didn\u2019t leverage the incentive pay, because we\u2019re \u2013 the folks are driving our business are being fairly successful. But that dynamic has been in place. I would expect a very similar dynamic going forward. We\u2019ll continue to expand our headcount. We\u2019ll probably could see some wage inflation in the market that\u2019s out there today.","But this isn\u2019t the first quarter that dynamics has been in place. It existed for much or all of last year as well. And I think that the first quarter labor dynamics are very similar to what we experienced all last year, too. And I would anticipate experiencing much of the rest of this year as well. If we grow double digits, we should be able to leverage that.","Robert Barry","Got it. All right. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks, guys.","Daniel Florness","You bet. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Evelyn Chow with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Evelyn Chow","Hi, good morning, Dan and Holden. Maybe just starting on price realization this quarter, fantastic job and encouraging to see that price cost gap narrow. I noticed on pricing specifically. I think your comps on a standalone basis continue to get even harder throughout the year. So would it be your expectation that though the price cost gap turns positive, the actual standalone pricing level maybe is \u2013 at its highest point in 1Q?","Holden Lewis","Well, you\u2019re right that in 1Q what began to happen relative to 4Q was that, we had to grow over price increases that we put in essentially at the beginning of last year. And we\u2019ll have that dynamic in Q2, Q3, Q4 as well, where we\u2019ll have to grow with our same price increases. And in Q2, they probably got a little bit better.","So, from a sequential standpoint, would I expect the fact that we grew pricing at 1%, little better than 1% in the quarter. Do I expect that necessarily to meaningfully increase? Perhaps not given the comps. But all that said, we do believe that there is incremental sequential pricing to be had in the business over the next \u2013 certainly, over the next quarter or two, as we continue to adjust to what the marketplace \u2013 to the marketplace realities.","And regardless of what sort of the year-over-year comp number looks like, as I said, I still believe there is opportunity for us to be constructive on pricing sequentially in the next quarter or two, and that should allow us to continue to mitigate and eliminate the deficit.","So, I think what you\u2019re describing is kind of a comp issue and I get it. But I think, if you get the substance of the matter, I don\u2019t see our ability to pursue prices being worse today than it was in first quarter. And I don\u2019t see our ability to narrow that deficit on price cost as being any more difficult today than it was in the first quarter or fourth quarter. So I guess, hopefully that answers the question, Evelyn.","Evelyn Chow","That\u2019s very helpful, Holden. And then maybe just on Onsites. Obviously, nice to see the pace of signings and the continued commitment there. I noticed you called out you had 66 activations and 15 closures this quarter. So is that about the level of attrition you would expect going forward?","Holden Lewis","Attrition regarding the closures you\u2019re talking about?","Evelyn Chow","Yes, exactly.","Holden Lewis","So it does a little bit higher this quarter than what we typically see. We will typically see some attrition, right? Looking into the reason behind those 15 closures, there was nothing unusual there. I would say that about half of them were simply because a plant closed or moved. I think that there was probably an equal number where frankly, we went Onsite. We didn\u2019t get the kind of revenue that we anticipated getting.","So we decided to leave or their business was off right, or their business was off. But one way or the other what made sense at the time didn\u2019t make sense today. And so we closed up that Onsite and we\u2019ll service them from the branches we always have. And there\u2019s, I think, there might be one or two in there, where maybe we didn\u2019t deliver the performance we told them we would or another competitor sort of made some inroads and we left. And \u2013 but those things do happen every quarter. It was a little bit higher this quarter than normal. But I don\u2019t see that as a trend necessarily, and we didn\u2019t see any unusual reasons for the number, seem to be the usual stuff.","Daniel Florness","The \u2013 I\u2019ll just throw a little tidbit in there and I\u2019ll use vending as my example. When we started vending and it really was ramping up by six, seven years ago. We didn\u2019t know what type of attrition there, because there\u2019s a new industry. And what we found when we got into 2014 and 2015, that a lot of those machines that we had signed in 2011 and 2012 and 2013 were extremely successful. But there was a handful that we signed that were just either, oops, maybe we shouldn\u2019t put this one in there. And we were pulling out on going to a given year. I looked at what we had for installed base and we were pulling out about, and I don\u2019t step in front of you, but my recollection is about 15% a year. But when we really look at the underlying data, we saw that five of those \u2013 probably a third of those were ones where you know what, we need to continue to get better at how we make it easy for our branches to serve these machines, because we thought we could lower that number 10.","What we\u2019ve done in the last three years is, we\u2019ve lowered that number to about 11. And we think we still believe we can get it to 10, so if we have 80,000 machines out there and tell me we\u2019re probably going to pull out in a good year 8,000 and less than a good year 9,000 or 10,000. And the bottom line is, we think a reasonable proposition, because it helps us grow faster.","In Onsite, if I look at historically, we pull out about 10 a year, but we had 200 of them. And so we didn\u2019t really know what it would be and we still don\u2019t frankly know, because it\u2019s still a newer animal. But signing those Onsites, we want to be mindful. We\u2019re really cautious about where we do it and where we don\u2019t do it, because it\u2019s more expensive to pull out an Onsite than it id to pull out a vending machine.","But I love the fact that we\u2019re engaging with our customers and growing faster. But it\u2019s going to take sometime to figure out what that number is. When we\u2019re at 1,000 Onsites, how many do we pull out a year, because either the customer closed its facility or \u2013 I mean, the customer gets acquired, and acquiring company doesn\u2019t use Fastenal. There are few of those out there and we\u2019re trying to reduce that number every day.","Holden Lewis","Yes. And then with regards to the new actives, new actives is a little bit lower in the quarter. We would expect to have a greater rate of active growth as you go through the rest of the year.","Evelyn Chow","All right. Well, thanks, again, for the time today, guys.","Daniel Florness","Thanks, Evelyn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Manthey with Baird. Your line is open.","David Manthey","Hey, guys, good morning. First off, could you talk about the cost structure of the business today? I\u2019m wondering if you think that the model is more or less variable than it was 10 years ago in terms of costs getting \u2013 what I\u2019m getting at here is if growth does moderate slightly, are you still going to be able to sustain 20% contribution margins in that environment?","Holden Lewis","The first in your underlying, when I think back to a decade ago when we started what we call the pathway to profit. One of the things that we were truly doing is, we were slowly making the model more variable in that by not opening branches as fast. That added to the fixed cost infrastructure of the business. We\u2019re making it more variable.","One of the things that hurt our ability to leverage as we kind of picking up is, a, I personally felt, we needed to make some additional investments and some people resources to support Onsite to our vending, but also we made significant advancements in our infrastructure to do great things from a technology standpoint and we talked about those dollars that we are willing to spend and consume some of the leverage. But also the variable nature consume some of the leverage and incentive comp is a good example.","To the extent we\u2019re talking about incentive comp and the people energy. The model is more variable today than it was in the past. The question about incremental margin really becomes challenging in the short-term, because it really falls back to how much do you want to dial back on certain growth drivers. Because the deleverage comes from \u2013 if we were to branch out, they\u2019re doing 200,000 and that market softens and they go to 180. That\u2019s a painful downhill, because that\u2019s a highly profitable branch that\u2019s levered like crazy and there it\u2019s going to delever and it\u2019s not very and it\u2019s more fixed than variable.","The incentive comp piece obviously comes into play. So it\u2019s probably a long \u2013 not very \u2013 a long, long answer to your question, Dave, but it depends on the timeframe. In the short-term, we could \u2013 incentive comp pulls back automatically and you\u2019re the one that use the historical reference of the shock absorbers, which I think is a great descriptor.","And in the shorter-term, it\u2019s not as difficult. In the longer-term, it really comes down to do you want to start cutting away on some of the flesh when the economy we sell into is huge. The opportunity is huge, but our installed base has contracted, because we have all these customer spend, but their spend is down 20%.","And so what makes it really challenging to do that, because I\u2019m a firm believer. I\u2019m more interested in the going after the $100 billion-plus market than I\u2019m about reigning everything in, in the short-term.","David Manthey","Yes. Okay. Sounds like different, but it\u2019s still manageable, so that\u2019s fair. second question. In previous quarters, you\u2019ve talked about the customer conversations you\u2019re having around tariff-related price increases. And Holden, you answered this question to some extent. But I guess to refine it, have those sort of negotiated price changes been reflected already in the first quarter results? And also on the inventory side, you\u2019re now seeing the the tariff cost increases flow through FIFO, or do those two things continued to evolve with a glide path from first quarter into second quarter?","Holden Lewis","Well, yes, on all of it first off. Yes. So the conversations were aggressive through Q4 and frankly, fairly constructive. When we said we were encouraged, I see no reason to sort of step away from the fact that we thought the conversations with our customers went fairly well. And I think there\u2019s a lot of reasons why that has been the case. One was simply the plan that was put together to address the issue of tariffs.","We feel that was fairly open and fair. And I think our customers responded in \u2013 as we would have hoped they would have given that. We also put a lot of energy into having those conversations face to face with our customers. And so, yes, they went fairly well. Now our expectation at the time and I think it\u2019s played out this way is that, we would begin to see those costs flow through the business in Q1. And so we had to be timed to start getting some of the pricing flowing through the business in Q1. And I believe that happened.","And when we talk about seeing some sequential increase in pricing, I think, that some of that is increases coming as a result of tariffs in that February\/March period. And we talk about being able to see some sequential increases in pricing, I think, there\u2019s going to be some additional relationships and that come online as we go through the early part of the second quarter and third quarter.","So, but at this point, I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019ve been able to narrow the deficit with those things happening. The timing has worked out like we had planned for it to work out and the dialogue with the customers has been positive around it. So, I guess, that\u2019s where I\u2019d leave that.","Daniel Florness","Dave, the only thing I\u2019d throw in as an adder is sudden jolts are disruptive as heck. And what it really requires is all of us. Our suppliers, Fastenal, our customers having a really informed frank discussion about what\u2019s happening, because it\u2019s been incredibly disruptive in the last four months. In fact, it probably took away some growth because you\u2019re having \u2013 a lot of our sales teams are having discussions about pricing when I\u2019d rather have discussions about growing the business. And \u2013 but it\u2019s going to be disruptive.","If anybody on the call has a crystal ball and can tell me what\u2019s going to happen with the tariff six and 12 months from now and do they get bigger? Do they get smaller? Do they unwind? Is it messy? It\u2019s going to be disruptive? Just disruptive on the unwind is \u2013 was on the wind and only time will tell how that works.","Fortunately, on an unwind whenever it occurs, while it might be disruptive to pricing. It\u2019s probably going to be helpful to the underlying economy. So there\u2019d be a lot of noise to our numbers, but in disruptive times and times of radical change, the best cure is just good, open, honest dialogue with your customer and you manage through it.","David Manthey","Yes. Okay. Thanks very much.","Daniel Florness","Thanks, Dave.","Holden Lewis","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Merkel","Thanks. Hey, everyone, nice quarter.","Daniel Florness","Thanks. Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Merkel","Yes. So first question I had was on oil and gas. I recall going back to maybe February that the RVPs were saying this was just a pull back in spending. It was just a pause. Is this still the case? And what are you hearing today?","Holden Lewis","Yes. Well, and so the RVPs obviously respond to what their customers are telling them. And the \u2013 what we\u2019re hearing is that, it\u2019s a challenging marketplace. We\u2019re not seeing wholesale sort of layoffs and cutting of capital spending and things like that. Frankly, the weakness that we\u2019re seeing seems to be fairly measured in temper which doesn\u2019t always sound like what oil and gas has been like historically, right?","And so if I think about the RVP tone around oil and gas, some of them are more encouraged about what the second-half looks like than what the first-half looks like. But all of them say, what oil price is going to do, right? And so I think if I think about the tone around oil and gas, like I said, it began to weaken. I think, we\u2019ve begun talking about this probably November\/December last year.","And the degree of weakness hasn\u2019t necessarily gotten more severe. Over that period of time, it has persisted, but it\u2019s also broadened. So what something which began in Houston and Dallas has spread to other regions, right, in terms of commentary. And like I said, some of them feel like this is going to clear itself out by the second-half. Some of them feel like they don\u2019t know. And all of them understand that it\u2019s about what happens to the price of oil and how their customers feel and we just don\u2019t have a great answer to it. But that\u2019s where we have oil and gas today.","Ryan Merkel","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then second question on Onsite margin inflection, I recall 2020 could be the year where more mature Onsites at higher margins start to offset the newer Onsites. Is this still the case based on what we know today? And then how much do you think you could lift overall company margin?","Holden Lewis","Yes. So we haven\u2019t seen any real change in kind of the pacing of how we expect that to play out. And so what I\u2019ve said before is, today, where we\u2019ve got so many new Onsites, you don\u2019t have sort of an equal ratio between how they\u2019re aging versus how we\u2019re adding them. But over time, that\u2019s going to change. And I think the proxy for that will be when does the average size for Onsite stop declining, right?","And my feeling is that, that is probably the late 2019, but probably more in 2020, which means by the time you get to 2021, 2022, instead of this continuing to work against our overall level of gross profitability that, it\u2019ll begin to diminish in terms of the impact on the mix. We still feel like that is the case.","Now what we\u2019ve said before is and I think Dan laid this out last time, right? I mean, when we\u2019re \u2013 when we double our revenues, we want to be a 22% operating margin company thereabouts. And in order for that to happen from 20% today, we need to see some of those Onsites begin to mature and become more profitable. And we think that, that will happen.","And so what is the impact? I would tell you today, the overall impact is a drag more so on the gross margin, the operating margin, but it\u2019s in both. But over the next, let\u2019s call it, 18 months, I think, you\u2019re going to begin to see that drag really flatten out and then it begins to contribute more towards our goal of being a 22% operating margin company.","Daniel Florness","And one thing to keep in mind, it\u2019s a two-pronged drag in the short \u2013 in \u2013 or the last few years. The one drag is the mix of Onsites and the average revenue per Onsite going down. The other drag is, we went from not really signing Onsites to 80 and then 180 and then 280 and, of course, to 400. And every time we sign an Onsite, I actually shouldn\u2019t say that. Most of the times that when we sign an Onsite, we\u2019re taking a customer relationship out of the branch, highly profitable branch and we\u2019re delevering it.","So you kind of have a two for going on. Not only are you pulling down the average of your Onsites, you\u2019re actually hurting the probability of your branch network a little bit in the short-term. And when you get to a steady state of how many are coming in and going out, that\u2019s when life becomes a little easier. No different than think about how the math changed decade ago and when we slowed down opening branches to the pathway to profit. All of a sudden, your mix of branch has changed.","Holden Lewis","So it\u2019s kind of the trajectory. And frankly, what\u2019s been great is that really has been playing out largely as we would have modeled it out a year ago, two years ago.","Ryan Merkel","Perfect. That\u2019s good to hear. That\u2019s kind of what I was getting at. Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Daniel Florness","Thanks, Ryan.","Holden Lewis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Mario Cortellacci","Hi, guys, this is actually Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. I know there has been questions about pricing already. But I mean, do you think it\u2019s harder for distributors in general to get pricing during the cycle versus prior cycles, or maybe as a different way, I mean, given where the demand environment is and where commodity inflation is? Should pricing be higher than where it is?","Daniel Florness","Yes. Since I\u2019ve been here longer, I\u2019ll take a shot at that and Holden, I can say, can chime in and correct me on some things he disagrees with. But pricing is always hard. People talk about transparency in today\u2019s world and it is greater.","But frankly, our customers knew what they were spending for product, what product costs were around 10 and 20 and 30 years ago, so it\u2019s always been hard. It\u2019s about are you bringing a great value to a customer and their willingness to pay for that value. And if you think of it that way, I think that probably the toughest one right now on a pricing front is pricing is always hard. But I think the one that\u2019s got a little harder is the freight one.","Now for us, it\u2019s twofold. One, the freight dynamic is a little bit different, because Onsites are a different dynamic for freight than the branch network. And so we almost have to understand the two pieces individually. But in today\u2019s world, there\u2019s a lot of examples of where freights included and freights this or freights flatten. It\u2019s fundamentally different models. And it\u2019s always just having a good discussion about your freight \u2013 the freight side of your picture, and that\u2019s probably the more challenging element in today\u2019s world setting mix aside.","Holden Lewis","Yes, and I would say, I mean, I don\u2019t know what it should be compared to history. I would say this. I mean, every quarter going back to the beginning of 2018, we have made sequential progress in raising price. We\u2019ve done that, because there has also been sequential increase in cost. And so we don\u2019t love obviously that we have a deficit on the price cost dynamic, but part of that is perhaps we needed to be more aggressive than we were.","But that shouldn\u2019t be read to mean that we weren\u2019t doing what we had to do to protect the margins, because as I said, pricing has gone up every quarter. But we also have to acknowledge that, we\u2019ve had some pretty significant increases in cost. If I look at how much our cost has increased in the first quarter? It\u2019s more than twice what that same increase was in the first quarter of last year. And so we\u2019re kind of chasing \u2013 we\u2019re chasing that piece of it as well.","But I don\u2019t want to give the impression that because we have a price cost deficit that, that doesn\u2019t mean that we haven\u2019t been able to pass price through, because we\u2019ve passed more price through every quarter in response to marketplace. But if you give us a flattening in the cost environment, we\u2019ll catch up. But the \u2013 I don\u2019t want to give the impression that we haven\u2019t been able to pass price through, because we have.","Mario Cortellacci","Great. And just one more and I\u2019ll turn it over. And you actually mentioned freight and just want to see if the benefit essentially running your own captive fleet, it has been fully optimized, or do you think there\u2019s more room to go there? I guess, if there is anymore room for improvement, I guess, how much do you think that could be?","Daniel Florness","Well, first off, the advantage of having our captive fleet, it\u2019s indescribable from the standpoint of \u2013 set the cost aside for a second. Our ability to provide service is night and day different from all our competitors. Earlier, I used the example of that outdoor locker.","A year from now, I fully expect us to be able to take an order from a customer that comes in late in a day, may be in the evening. And let\u2019s say one-time in a hundred that customers in a jam and they need it like two hours ago.","Our competitors are going to be providing that. They\u2019re probably going to freight that in using small parcel and it\u2019s not getting there till 10 o\u2019clock tomorrow morning, and that\u2019s a really expensive trip. Our driver gets to that branch at 4:00 in the morning or 2:00 in the morning or 6:00 in the morning.","You pick enough of the time, because it\u2019s different for each branch. But let\u2019s say, this branch is 4:00 in the morning. Our driver could throw that item in an outdoor locker and that customer get a text at 4:00 in the morning to the item you ordered at 5 o\u2019clock last night is here, and nobody else in that market can do that. So to me, the value of a captive trucking is you can provide a level of service that\u2019s \u2013 that just separates you in the marketplace.","From a cost standpoint, we have a great cost structure compared to our peers. And we\u2019re able to use that cost structure part of our gross margin difference in our industry is because of that freight advantage. Our cost structure is lower. But it puts you in a position to challenge it everyday. It also puts you in a position of conversations with your customer and maybe move some product for them on the backhaul.","So one of the reasons that we\u2019ve always been successful as we do a nice job with backhauls from our suppliers and more recently from some customers. That\u2019s where I think we have some more legs to, especially on the Onsite piece of saying to customers get some pallets you need moved? We\u2019ll move it for you and maybe we can freight that way to quantify the potential, I\u2019m not going to \u2013 I\u2019m not ready to go there right now, because I don\u2019t know if we know it.","Holden Lewis","Yes. And the only thing I would add is, I mean, I think one direction you\u2019re going is, it is more cost effective to move product on our trucks than on third parties. And from the fourth quarter of 2017, we really begin to see the field utilizing our truck network at a greater rate because of what was going on outside of our truck network. That kind of hit a level in Q3 of 2018 that we sustained, a very high level.","So, the question is, what can you ship more and more onto your trucks? Yes, there\u2019s always good reasons to use a third-party, whether it\u2019s a customer required or what have you. So we\u2019re probably at a good level for that. But I can\u2019t emphasize enough that in a period like this of inflation, third-party inflation is going up at a far greater rate than the cost that we\u2019re experiencing at our own captive fleet. And what that means is, we have a huge advantage in the marketplace that is only getting wider by having that fleet.","So, what we can never tell you is, how much of an advantage are we getting in winning business, because we have our captive fleet even in an environment where there\u2019s inflation, especially in an environment where there\u2019s inflation. I can\u2019t answer that question for you, but it goes into our calculations and it\u2019s a reason why we went.","So I guess, the tenor of the question is, when are they going to stop impacting gross margin? I wanted to take the answer a little bit more broadly, because we\u2019ve done things to sort of minimize the impact. But you can\u2019t underestimate the value of that trucking fleet and our ability to manage cost and our ability to win business.","Mario Cortellacci","Got it. Thanks for the time, guys.","Holden Lewis","Thank you.","Daniel Florness","So I show in my watch 9:57 and very mindful that we\u2019re in earnings season and everybody on this call has a busy schedule and so I don\u2019t want to go long. Just want to close out with a few thoughts. I mentioned earlier in the question and I thought I\u2019d just touch on it again to make sure I didn\u2019t freak anybody out with my kind of off-the-cuff comment.","The message I have to our team is as we go forward, just like it\u2019s more challenging to grow when you start stacking years together, it\u2019s more challenging for incremental margin. And that means we need to work harder at every day to achieve it. It doesn\u2019t mean if this is \u2013 that is a cautionary tale, that\u2019s just a statement of fact. And I feel great about the team we have and their ability to manage this business and to grow this business.","The second item, we talked about the weather impact and you see discussion centers on impact to sales and the impact to our customers. One thing I\u2019m really proud of is the \u2013 because the biggest impact quite frankly is to the folks that drive our semis down the road. We were talking about freight. Picture you\u2019re driving through the middle of night and they\u2019re in the middle of a snowstorm, that\u2019s a tough thing.","And I think I mentioned on last call or I may have mentioned it to our team internally about it, a semi driver who was stranded outside of Chicago, because their fuel line jelled up, because it was so cold and our branch manager on the last day of the month went and rescued that person and got him into a warm environment, because it was 30 below zero.","And one thing I\u2019m really proud of is the way our branches and our district \u2013 and our distribution managers treat our drivers from the standpoint of, hey, make sure your back dock is \u2013 snows are removed and it\u2019s a safe environment for your driver, because that driver is the lifeblood of your business. And really pleased to say we came through it with a very safe circumstance for our semi drivers.","Last thing, great people pursuing a common goal can do great things. Learned that from Bob 23 years ago and it\u2019s as true today as it was then. Thanks, everybody. Have a good day.","Holden Lewis","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"9533":["Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 12, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Ellen Trester - ","Willard D.

Go ahead, Mr. Oberton.","Willard D. Oberton","Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us on our first quarter conference call. Starting out, I'd like to say that I believe it was a -- or I feel it was a good quarter. Our sales growth was right on plan. ","Looking at our internal sales goals. In January, we're at 100.6% of goal; February, 98.8% of goal; and March, 101.3% of goal. So for the quarter, we're at 100.3% of goal. I'm not sure if it's good sales growth or good forecasting. But whatever, we're right on target this far into the year. I also take a look at the 2-year growth numbers because as we look at the sequential numbers, trying to understand what the patterns are, but sometimes it's easier to look at the 2-year. And if you look at the 2-year growth numbers that we put in the report and combine 2010 and 2011, there was 40.1% growth in January, 41.5% in February and 42.1% in March. So we continue to march forward and also show a very consistent growth. ","The other reason I feel pretty good about the sales growth is if you look at the purchasing index that was also in the release, last year through the first 3 months, the average for the country, the U.S. market is at 59.8%, a very high rating. This year, still a good reading but it's down to 53.3%, so it's really 6.5 points lower. And we had similar -- our growth was off a little bit but very similar. So I think the initiatives we're putting in place are working well. ","This week, I had the opportunity to visit -- this week, we're holding our customer show down in Indianapolis, where we bring in about 4,000 to 5,000 customers and 200 suppliers, and we let our customers visit our suppliers and the product. But anyway, that gave me the opportunity to visit with dozens of companies, both suppliers and our customers, also to speak with many of our managers. And the mood is very upbeat. So I was optimistic about that. Many of our customers believe they're going to have a good year, continue to have a good year. And many of the suppliers are hearing that not only from the Fastenal people, but also from other customers. So it was a very upbeat show and gave us a good feel for the next couple months.","In the report, there was, I believe -- moving on, there's only one negative in our report this quarter, one major negative, and that was the margin. Spend a lot of time looking at the margin, trying to analyze what we're doing and what we need to do. And after spending a time analyzing it and discussing it with most of our sales leaders down in Indianapolis this week, the conclusion I came to, and I hate to say this, but my conclusion is that we've basically taken our eye off the ball a little bit working on other things. But after the discussions I had with the regionals, with our sales leader and our National Accounts sales leaders, I'm very confident that we know what we need to do, and we will see improvement in the second quarter. So we're going to work very hard on that. ","We're not off a long ways. We're still on our range of between 51% and 53%. But as the competitive people that we are, we'd rather be in the high end of the range rather than the low end. So we're going to work very hard to move that up over the next 2 to 3 quarters and get into the upper end of our margin range.","On the expense control side, I have to say the Fastenal team, the Blue Team, did a great job. Our expenses grew about 6 percentage points below sales, exactly what we needed to do. Labor grew a little faster than the other expenses, but that's -- some of that is planned. We did a lot of things, changing some pay programs, trying to make sure that we're taking care of our people, and it's working very well. So not a lot to say on expense control. Dan will probably touch more on that, but I'm really proud of what we were able to do on expense control.","One other area that you may have noticed we had a little drop-off was the store profitability that we show on Page 7, where some of the store groups had lower profitability per size than they had in the previous year. And that's all explained in one word: margin. As we look at that, because margin was a little lower, the profitability per store size was a little lower. So if we can correct the margin or as we correct the margin problem, we'll also correct that problem. But overall, our pretax profit at 21%, I'm proud of the number. We only picked up 90 basis points from last year with our goal as 100, so we missed it by 1\/10, but I'm very confident we'll get that back. ","And the most positive thing on that chart on Page 7 is the number of stores that moved up a category. So we continue to do what we have laid out in 'pathway to profit', grow -- move the average store size up, the profitability goes up and the system continues to work. One area on the report that I'm also very happy about was the inventory control. We had stated in the fourth quarter call that we thought we could improve our turns. Through the quarter, we only added -- or we added less than $2 million in inventory. And so we've done a nice job both quarter to -- or sequentially through the quarter, but also year-over-year, a very nice job on inventory growth or controlling our inventory growth, deploying our assets in better ways.","Talking -- switching gears a little bit, talking about the initiatives that we have, our sales initiatives. All of the initiatives -- I'm happy to report that all of our initiatives are going well. Our Government project that we started 2 years ago is ahead of plan from a standpoint of sales growth. We are fully staffed or, I mean, very few openings. We have the people in place that we need. We have the coverage in the states. Our WSCA contract, which is our big state contract, is going very well. It's at or ahead of plan, and some states are doing better than others. But overall, it's doing very well. And we feel very good about the knowledge that we're gaining through the people in the field. ","5 years ago, we probably had 2 or 3 people in the company that had a real good knowledge of how to do this. Now we have a team of about 40. And I think we're just going to continue to gain traction on the Government business, mainly in the state areas where we're looking at other pieces of Government business as well. ","Our Web sales continue to grow. That's been an initiative since really the end of 2010. We did well in 2011, but we continue to see traction in 2012. Buying off the Web is good for our customers. It's good for our stores also because it's more efficient; that continues to do well. ","Metalworking. We're very happy with the results in metalworking. And at the show this week, I had the opportunity to visit with several of our large suppliers that just came on. And on a very positive note, they're happy with the results because that's one of the keys to making this work. We have to be able to sell -- grow fast enough to make the suppliers happy with the results, and that's going well. Our sales people that we've been hiring and training in the field are doing a nice job. We have about 52 people that are sales specialists just in metalworking. Our plan is to add another 10 as the year goes on or as we can find the right people to do that. But also the opportunity to speak with many customers who are looking at us for metalworking. And it appears or the theme was now there's another national player, there's another company I can look at to provide my metalworking supplies. And so we've had some very nice opportunities. It fits in well with our vending program, and so we're very optimistic about that for the future. It's a large market and there's good, tough competition in it, but we think we can continue to take share. And the main reason is because of the relationships we've developed with these customers over the years. We're not taking it out to new customers per se. It's really developed relationships that are looking for a possible alternative. ","And our biggest initiative that we talked about is vending. And as you saw in the results, we had a great quarter. As I've been stating for the last 4 quarters, our goal would be to hit 2,500 machines for the quarter. We exceeded that by more than 2,000 at 4,500 machines. We installed more than 2,300 machines. And so we're moving along nicely. I am more convinced than ever that it's a long-term change in industrial distribution. Again, I keep talking about the show, but I just got back last night. I had the opportunity to speak with probably 20 to 30 customers that have deployed vending, and not one of them is disappointed with the results. They're all talking about the savings. ","There's really 2 themes that come up from the customers. One is inventory control and how much time it saves them to not have to distribute the product, and the other is the consumption -- or the savings. But I think the biggest theme really is about the inventory control more than the savings. And it's just, it's there when we need it, and it's just out of sight, out of mind in a positive way. So we're working very hard on that and believe we'll continue to see good results going forward. ","So overall, looking at the quarter, looking at the information, I'll put it down as a good quarter. If we had improved the margin, I would say it was a great quarter because everything else looks good. So we have some things to work on. We're focused on that. And hopefully, we'll see improvement this quarter. ","With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan, and he'll give you some more detailed color on other things in the quarter. Thank you.","Daniel L. Florness","Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody. And thanks again for listening in on our call today. So one thing I wanted to touch on, most of you have probably noticed, changed the format of the earnings release a bit this quarter. I felt there was pieces of it that were getting a bit stale, removed out the explicit discussion of 'pathway to profit' and more integrated it just into the general layout of the earnings release. I know reading through a document written by an accountant can be painful. Hopefully, this makes it a little less painful this quarter. ","One item on Page 3 that I thought was worthwhile to point out, and that's looking at the sequential trends of the business. And Will talked a bit about the year-over-year information. But one thing I think is worthwhile to note and added actually 3 years' worth of data rather than the typical 2 years' worth of data that we cover is a similar trend that we've seen the last several years, and that trend played out again this year in the first quarter, is actually from my perspective a little bit of softness in the January, February timeframe followed by a huge leap forward from February to March. We saw it in 2010, we saw it in 2011 and we saw it again here in 2012. And hopefully, that sets us up for continued nice performance as we go into the future, but it's an interesting dynamic to our business. ","The March timeframe in each of the last 3 years, we've more than doubled the sequential norm of February to March gains in daily average. And I think it's worthwhile to note, especially when you look at the month of March because one thing that is noteworthy in our numbers as well is our construction numbers. And construction is roughly 20% of our business. Our construction numbers were actually a little bit weak in March. And my perception looking at the data is really that with the very mild winter, there was some work that moved into January and February that normally would have been in February and March. And I think it softened February a little bit, I think it softened March a little bit. ","And I have some first-hand knowledge of this, only from the standpoint my wife and I had some work done on our home here last year. And I told the contractor, which -- this is always a dangerous thing to tell a contractor. I told the contractor, \"I'm in no particular rush. So when you get a chance to fit it in, come back and finish the work.\" Because there were some stuff on our outside garage. Well, in early March, I got a call from my contractor, and he says, \"Dan, I'm running a little low on work. I've got some time to finish that project up.\" I didn't think he'd get to it until late summer. So  that tells me there's probably some truth to the fact some work got pushed up into the early part of the quarter and made the latter half a little bit softer. ","As Will mentioned, ISM index, I think, continues to hold up well for us. It came in at 53.4% in March. When I look at the growth drivers that I talked about on Page 5, as Will mentioned, all of our areas are operating above plan. And when I look at the FAST Solutions in particular, we touched on it in our February sales release that we had exceeded our 2,500 number. As you see, we exceeded it soundly.  But the other thing that jumped out for me was, it was the case of it was solid in all 3 months of the quarter. It wasn't a case of January was big because of a weaker December. It was solid in January, February and March and building. So very nice performance when I look at the vending for the quarter.","The profit drivers on Pages 6 and 7. I don't recall us ever having a first quarter with 21% pretax, so it's a nice milestone mark for the organization. As Will touched on earlier, we did lose some of the, what I refer to as amplification effect on 'pathway to profit' with weaker gross margin, but it was \u2013 and so our relative profitability per group fell up a little bit from last year. It's still nicely above where it was in 2010. But our $150,000 store group did hold up and actually improved nicely. I believe they improved by about 90 basis points year-over-year, so continued to see some nice performance. ","The other thing I think is worthwhile to note, when we started the 'pathway to profit' back in 2007, if you'd have told me that at some time in the future with an average store size of just over 86,000 that we'd be at 21% pretax, I would have given you a pretty skeptical look because I wouldn't have thought it was possible. And I think we've done a nice job with lowering our operating expenses during that timeframe and moving the mix but having nice profits with an average store size, which is still relatively small in the scheme of 'pathway to profit'.","As Will touched on a few minutes ago, our only wart in this release from my perspective is our gross margin. We just aren't executing really well, very well in this regard, and -- but we've always said gross margin is all attitude, and we just need to develop some attitude. And I believe we have opportunity. ","With that said, there are some positives when I look at components. Our exclusive brands, our private label, if you will, brands that we talked about in the past, a year ago that was at about 8.5% of our sales. Today, that is at 9.3%, so we continue to inch forward on that. Not moving as fast as we'd like, but still moving forward and improving the mix. ","Operating and administrative expenses on Page 11. I'll just cut to the chase and say I think we did a -- we managed that well as we went into the first quarter, and I think we're poised well to go into second and third with a good position on operating expenses, get some lift in gross margin and we'll have some nice numbers. ","The final item I'll point out is relating to working capital and cash flow on Page 13. Nice numbers. We did a nice job with both accounts receivable and inventory growth year-over-year. The challenging thing we've had the last several years on all fronts is the expansion of our large account business, the expansion of our international business, which is challenging with working capital because, especially on the international, we don't have the same distribution support that we have domestically or in North America, in general. ","And finally, from a cash flow perspective, operating cash flow was 132% of earnings. About 40% of that comes from the fact we don't have any tax payments. So a 90%-plus number in the first quarter is extremely unusual because of the growth we need in accounts receivable because of the sequential increase in sales. So I think a great number from the standpoint of cash flow. We spent about 27% of earnings for CapEx, right in line with what we'd expected, so free cash flow of over 100% in the first quarter versus 68% a year ago. ","With that, I will turn it over to the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Manthey of Robert W. Baird.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First off, are you currently taking orders for that half-sized vending unit? And if you could tell us what your vending installation capacity is today, I think initially it was about 3,000 units?","Willard D. Oberton","The answer to the first question is, yes, it's the Fast 3000, if anyone wants one. It's actually about 2\/3 the size. And we're taking orders, it's going actually very well so far. And our capacity for installs is actually very scalable. I would say it's probably about 1,000 a month right now. But with the centers we put in, it's really just a matter of adding more people. And that's not been an issue because there's a lot of pretty basic workaround that we have good leaders in all the center. We can probably double that very quickly.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then quickly, I was wondering, just so we can get an understanding of these growth drivers and sort of the scale of them, could you give us what percentage of revenues approximately today are attributable to Government, cutting tools, international and Internet?","Willard D. Oberton","I can do some -- I have 3 out of 4 of those in my head and give you a good number. The metalworking, I'm not going to go in the order that you're in, is roughly 8% of our revenue today. The Internet business is at about -- also about the same. But understand the Internet business isn't different business, it's the same -- well, sometimes. It's a different channel for receiving business.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","For receiving the order. Got it.","Willard D. Oberton","Receiving the order, so many of the same customers. So I guess, that's always a clarification point, but about 8% of our orders. And that does not include our EDI, which if we added all the other electronic interchange on top of that, it would almost double. We look at it a little different than our competitors. So the one I don't have on the top of my head is Government because that's moving rapidly. I believe it's about 4%.","Daniel L. Florness","I was going to say, between 3.5% and 4%.","Willard D. Oberton","4%. And what was the last one, Dave? I missed the fourth one.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","International sales?","Willard D. Oberton","International sales, yes, is running just over -- about 10.5% to 12%, 11% depending on the month.","David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And the vast majority of that Canada, anything \u2013 any number outside of North America?","Willard D. Oberton","Outside of North America -- well, outside of Canada, because Mexico we kind of look at as more truly international business, about 3% to 3.5% of our revenue comes outside of U.S. and Canada.","Daniel L. Florness","Actually in the quarter, it was almost 4%.","Willard D. Oberton","Almost 4%.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Just a follow-up on the vending question and the capacity to install the units. I guess, we're looking at the total cumulative contracts signed for just over 17,000 machines, and you've only installed like 9,800. And so there's always been somewhat of a lag. But I guess this is somewhat of a bigger lag than we've see in the past. And I'm just wondering, one, when should we start to see a catch-up of the contract signings? When will that get closer to the installs? And then secondly, the revenue that you're asking customers to step up with the extra couple thousand bucks a month, is that coming through as you had expected it? Or what have been the trends there?","Willard D. Oberton","I'll take the second question. I'll give Dan the first because he has better -- yes, the revenue is coming through. The trends have been that it's been running just above -- most of our machines is a FAST 5000. Our requirement on that is $2,000 a month. We've been running just above that number for the last 1.5 years. I was hoping it would be a little higher than that, it's in the 2,000 to 2,200, depending on any month that you look at.","Daniel L. Florness","The other part about the cumulative. It's probably worthwhile to point out, and we mentioned this last May at our investor conference, but I think it's worthwhile to point out. The data we disclosed -- keep in mind when we started disclosing this data, this is a new animal for us. And with a lot of information that we disclose, we have a very time-tested intuitive feel about how things will play out. When we look at that first number, the contracts signed during the period, and we look at 2 years ago, we're at 257. And that grew a year ago, we were at 1,400. Now we're at about 4,500. That is the raw number. That is the gross number of contracts signed. And there is always things that happen downstream that cause some of those not to be installed. It might be a case of the -- it gets delayed because the customer changes their mind or maybe the person that signed for it wasn't sure what they wanted and they pull back and maybe -- and it expires, and we don't actually install it. Over time, when I look at that first statistic, about 90% of those signings turn into a vending machine. And about 10% that contract signing expires, it might be subsequently signed as a new contract or maybe we get inertia going again 4 months later or 6 months later. But what we're trying to do on that first number is we're trying to just give you, \"Here's a raw number of the contracts we signed that quarter.\" So when you add up all those raw numbers and compare that to what's actually installed, you're kind of comparing apples and oranges.","Willard D. Oberton","And to your question of when we will catch up, we'd like to say it should be a 60-day backlog. It's probably going to take 90 to 100 days on the average. And so if we continue to ramp up our signings, there's always going to be -- you can basically take the last 90 to 100 days of signings off of the cumulative number of installs and come with a pretty decent match, less than what Dan just described. But our goal -- so that being said, we really need to have installs this quarter and the second quarter well above 3,000, more in the 3,500 to 4,000 range to keep up with that track. So that's something you should pay attention, see if we can do that. But we do have the people in place to do it. It's really about the paperwork and moving it forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Merkel of William Blair.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So let me start with the growth rate to customers with vending, which moderated to 34% this quarter, although still a healthy number. How should we think about that moderation? And then what should we expect going forward?","Willard D. Oberton","Well, I think the first thing to think about it is more of those customers are in their second and third year because that's cumulative customers. If we were to separate it out and say growth in customers that had vending for 12 months or less, it would be a much higher number. So that number will probably continue to moderate at some level. But without having experience in this, because this is a new initiative for us, it's really hard to say how it will play out. But we knew, and I think I've stated in other conference calls, that we were at 50%, we're not going to maintain that number as the tail gets longer.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","All right, that makes sense. Okay. And then second on the vending install number, which was incredibly strong, is this a level that we can extrapolate for the next few quarters? Or was there something unique this quarter that drove such a strong result?","Willard D. Oberton","On the install rate?","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes.","Willard D. Oberton","The install rate should go up. The install rate should...","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Oh, I'm sorry, the signings rate, Will. Sorry.","Willard D. Oberton","The signing rate?","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes.","Willard D. Oberton","Well, we did put some incentives in place with our managers and our district managers. I think we explained that in the past. But those incentives are still in place, and they're still going strong. I don't know if we'll keep at this level, but we should be well above previous levels, meaning somewhere in between the 25% and the 45%, I guess, if I had to guess. But there's a lot of energy out there, and the customers that I had the opportunity to speak with, it was all positive. And so we're doing a lot of things well. So our goal for the year starting out was 10,000 machines, 2,500 a quarter. But right now, I feel very confident that we're going to exceed that probably pretty handily.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question is from Hamzah Mazari of Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A question on vending again. Could you maybe talk about, as vending becomes a bigger part of your mix, what kind of margin dilution should one expect in the short term? And then also longer term, as you get up to speed on the learning curve, how should one think about the impact on margins longer term, both gross and operating margin?","Willard D. Oberton","Yes, on the gross margin, we really aren't seeing a deterioration from vending. Our vending business does run at a lower margin, but it's because it's running through larger customers. If you match the vending customers up -- well, actually what I do is I look at the customers' pre-vending and post-vending, and the margin really doesn't change. And so there's no change in the margin. If all of the vending -- we get a very high growth that's going to large customers, then we have to work on that. But that's actually a positive problem. As far as operating expense, the vending is going to be a more efficient business to serve. It's easier to -- there's just a lot less work in supplying the product through the vending machines.","Daniel L. Florness","Gives better visibility to need.","Willard D. Oberton","Well, the simple thing is for years, we've been out doing bin stocks at customers, where we drive out, we look at their supplies and we write down what they need or scan it with a handheld scanner. We go back to the store, spending thousands of hours every week and month doing that. With the vending machine, the Internet or -- the machine is doing that for us, sending it back over. All that time disappears, and we get better information. And that's just an example of how it works. So the more we get out there, the less labor it will take, the higher service level we will provide for our customers. So vending, from an operating profit standpoint, is a very positive. From a gross margin, it's neutral based on the same customer, same size.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up question. On the gross margin coming in lower than expectations, do you guys have a rough breakdown as to what the contributors were? How much was vendor incentive? How much was transactional or organizational in terms of negative contribution?","Daniel L. Florness","The drag was in the transactional side. On a sequential basis, our gross margin from a vendor incentive standpoint was up about 10 basis points. A little bit of improvement on our freight side, but that was offset somewhat because of fuel. I would have expected a little bit better improvement on the transportation side, absent the fuel situation. But our issue on a year-over-year basis that we continue to struggle with is just the day-to-day transactional side. It's pricing attitude.","Willard D. Oberton","Well, it's pricing attitude, and probably the biggest part is not keeping up with inflation. And there hasn't been a lot of inflation. But when you have a small amount of inflation, you don't keep up with the pricing. And it's funny to say, but it almost is easier when there's a lot of inflation because everybody jumps and goes. When it creeps in, a nickel at a time, and if you look at the margin, it's not like we're off 3 points, it's more like creep. And that's what we've identified as the biggest problem is we're taking 1% and 2% price increases and not passing those along here and there. But we've addressed it as I said and everyone is completely aware of what we need to do. We just have to get it done.","Operator","Your next question is from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Wanted to hit on the occupancy cost, which was a very pleasant surprise, particularly based on the amount of machines that you're looking at on the vending side. Can you give a sense of what the utility savings were in the quarter and how sustainable that leverage on the occupancy side might be over the next few quarters?","Daniel L. Florness","First off, if you look at it from the quarter, a meaningful impact because we are in the midst of heating season. And so from Q4 to Q1, there was about $1 million increase in occupancy. It should have been more like $2.5 million. If I look at it from the standpoint of vending, that number has increased meaningfully. But it's still a smaller component of overall occupancy. And then the final piece, as it relates to locations, we are -- our growth in occupancy related to locations is half the rate of growth from store openings. So we continue to find ways to improve our leverage there from both a percentage of sales standpoint and just an absolute dollar standpoint. And that piece is sustainable as we go through the year. Some of the benefit that we had -- we're not heating in April and March. So the fact that natural gas prices are lower becomes much less meaningful because we use some propane in our forklifts, but that's a relatively small dollar.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then if I could just follow up on the gross margin question from the last questioner, you mentioned the pricing attitude, Dan. Was pricing off on a year-on-year basis? Or was pricing up but not nearly to the extent that your own costs were rising?","Willard D. Oberton","It was the second. Our pricing is up but not as much as our own cost. And if pricing isn't up a lot and our costs aren't up a lot, like I said, that's the difficult part is it's not coming in, in big chunks. It kind of just slides in. That's 1%, let it go. Well, that adds up. So pricing is up, just didn't cover the costs.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Is there a particular either line of products or end market where the pricing discipline needs to be firmed up a little bit more?","Willard D. Oberton","No, there really isn't. It's somewhat across the boards. And we've done a lot of -- we've spent basically the last 2 weeks analyzing it or last month actually. We really have a good handle on where it is. And I had an opportunity, as I said, to speak with our regional vice presidents. They're really the ones in the field who handle it and our National Account leads. So I've been with both of them the last week. And everyone's very clear on what we need to do and how important it is. And you have to understand we have one big thing going for us, and that's pay programs. Margin is a big part, our gross profit is a big part of how we get paid, all of us. And most of the people were disciplined, no matter -- even though we had a good quarter, many of us, our bonuses were down; many of our regionals, their bonuses there down.","Daniel L. Florness","And district managers.","Willard D. Oberton","And district managers. And so there are a bunch of people going, \"Man, I worked very hard. I grew my business 20% and the company paid me less.\" They're not mad at the company. They're kicking themselves in the butt, the same as Dan and I are. And so that's a -- most people don't understand of what a motivator that is, but it really works in our system. And I made a point this week of asking everyone how happy they were with their bonus, and there weren't many positives in that conversation. So we're pointing that out, and I think we'll see some results.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And so there's absolutely no relation between the need for more discipline and the amount of machines that are getting signed up, meaning that you're not looking to give discounts to incentivize customers to take on the extra machine?","Daniel L. Florness","You mean the vending side?","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Daniel L. Florness","The vending business and its impact on our overall numbers and what it means to our gross margin at this stage of the game is negligible. This has absolutely nothing to do with vending signings. This is our business outside of vending. And we're not keeping up with where we need to be at in managing our sale price and our cost. And that's where we're getting the squeeze. Vending is absolutely no part of this.","Willard D. Oberton","And the vending is neutral on our margin. The customers' margin today that have deployed vending, if you take the entire list and add it up, there's been no change in those customers' margin. There's been great growth, as we showed, 34%. But the margin hasn't changed in that group of customers over that period.","Daniel L. Florness","And keep in mind the vending business, it's 18% -- the customer is representing 18% of our sales and it's about 20% of those sales that are actually going through the vending machine.","Willard D. Oberton","3% to 4%.","Daniel L. Florness","Yes, it's 3.5%. And that doesn't move the needle on the other 96%, 97%.","Operator","And your next question is from Robert Barry of UBS.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple things. One is I wanted to follow up on your commentary on the sales trends. And I hear you, Dan, on potential for some redistribution of the nonres activity within the quarter. But I think if you look at October versus the growth rate through the first 3 months, it looks like you're still a little softer this year than you have been over the past few years despite the resurgence in March. So I'm just wondering if you can comment on the end markets. I mean, you did mention that the ISM is a little bit lower than last year. But just in general, I mean do you think things are a little softer in the underlying end markets?","Daniel L. Florness","I think if you looked at the -- kind of an October -- and hopefully, the facts don't refute what I'm saying here, I'm \u2013 this is a little bit from the hip. But I think if you look at the October to March timeframe and look at sequential patterns, I think you see in all the years in question, this year, last year, year before, that a general softness that was there through February and then you saw a big pickup in March. So I guess, I don't know that I agree with the comment that from October of last year to March it's weaker. Now maybe the facts, if you actually laid it out in front of you, maybe it is nominally weaker. But I guess, in my mind, that doesn't really stand out too dramatically.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. Yes, I think it is nominally. Fair enough. I was just wondering if you were actually seeing anything in the end markets.","Daniel L. Florness","I don't think so.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then I just wanted to follow up on this market size number that you put in the release of $160 billion. I've actually been getting a fair number of questions about it recently, maybe you have as well. I'm just curious what your confidence is around that number, kind of where it comes from, how you derive it. These numbers have gotten tossed around among the distributors for a little while, I think in the past, they've been more like $140 billion to $150 billion. So just any comments on that, I'd be curious to hear.","Daniel L. Florness","No, I mean, that's a number that we've used in a somewhat generic fashion for the better part of the decade. And in fact, if you went back 8, 10 years ago and you looked at discussions or presentations of Fastenal and some of its peers, we were usually the low number for sizing the market with our $160 billion number. A lot of our competitors used numbers that were more in the $250 billion to $300 billion neighborhood, maybe even a little bit higher than that. And I think generally speaking, when you see presentations today or heard discussions, the market is typically sized to that. Now with that said, there's a piece of that market that we don't believe is readily addressable to us today. And I think the piece that we think is readily addressable that we're highly confident goes through distribution and represents products that we have a very good knowledge of\u2026","Willard D. Oberton","And we can make margin on them.","Daniel L. Florness","And we can make margin on them, that number's probably closer to $110 billion, $120 billion because there's some business that -- as Will mentioned, there's some business we're not interested in because the marketplace doesn't pay for a level of service or even a level of distribution. And that's business that probably should go direct or be sold by somebody other than Fastenal.","Willard D. Oberton","And I've used the $140 billion to $160 billion number for years. But to be honest with you, considering we're at roughly $3 billion, there's so much in front of us. We don't spend a tremendous amount of time looking at even thinking about that because the next $10 billion we find is there. And there's so much headroom in our business. And I keep referring back to the show, but when you go and you have the opportunity to see the customers and listen to them, foreseeably in our lifetime, there's a lot ahead of us.","Daniel L. Florness","And I think that's true if you sat down and looked at some of our more established regions and look at the rate at which they grow. Our Winona region, which is Minnesota, Wisconsin, Dakotas, Iowa, Northern Illinois, that grows very attractively year-over-year mid- to upper-teens or better, depending on the quarter. So when you look at that and say, a business that's been established now for 40-plus years and continues to grow at that kind of rate. And I think it's evident also when you look at the stats we put out on our 5-plus-year-old stores and quarterly on our 10-plus-year-old stores. The fact that we have 5-year-old stores that grow at mid-teens, 5-year-plus stores growing at mid-teens tells me there's a ton of market out there.","Operator","There are no more questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.","Daniel L. Florness","Again, we'd like to thank everybody for participating in today's call. Hope this, combined with the release, is informative of how our business is progressing. And we're very optimistic as we look forward into 2012. Have a good day, everybody.","Willard D.

Good morning and welcome to our Q1 2015 call. The quarter was when you look at it's really two stories. One of things we can control and things we cannot control. Obviously the things outside our control are the currency, weather, oil and gas and the port situation in California. But the things we can control, I think when I look at the Fastenal team I think it was a solid quarter. But that being said I will always say this that when we see single digit revenue growth, we are not satisfied nor are we happy. But with 8.8% growth we did some things and I think hats off to the Fastenal team when you look at some different areas. When I look at the fact that we stabilized our gross margins and I know there has been questions there but I look at the fact that we were able to do some things there. And a lot of that is truly execution when you really look at what our people are doing at the point of transaction. The second thing is we challenged our Fastenal team to really live within our means. And what I mean by that, that's an old school BK philosophy that if we don't need it, don't buy it. And you saw that play out in the first quarter when you look at meal, travel and entertainment. We made a conscious decision to spend our money on labor and the stores. We said no to things that may sound nice and may actually help us long term in some regards but today we made a decision to invest in our store to fuel our growth to drive profits and that's what you saw play out on the expense side even when you take out the tailwind on the fuel. ","The other thing, some other highlights, we grew our earnings 14%, that's a nice leverage when you consider we are at 8.8% on daily average growth. More importantly and more impressive I think is the team was able to put up 32.2% incremental margin growth. Again a number that I think most companies would just -- would be thrilled with. When you look at the added energy in the store, I want to -- this is where we really got to get down to what's truly happenings boots on the ground. From the end of Q3, 2014 up until the end of Q1, 2015, we've added 1,000 people into our stores. Now most of those heads came in the last half of Q1. January, folks I got to tell you, January coupled with the weather, the fact that the kids aren't back to school. It's a rough month for recruiting. But in the second half of February and in the month of March, that's when you started to see the team really start to bring people into the stores. And we will continue that. Going forward, we are committed to energy in the stores. We are committed also to looking at a few of our stores. When I look I talk about that our large stores, our stores with the high number of customer, we would just say a lot of traffic. We are looking at adding products into some of those stores to also build invoice, build customer satisfaction all the things that we try to do everyday. ","The other thing and lastly I think a shout out really to Nick's team on the inventory side coming at 867 with inventory at 869 a year ago really is again a testament to the Fastenal team and what we can do when we put our minds to it. ","With that I will turn it over to Dan.","Dan Florness ","Thanks, Lee. And good morning, everybody. And for those of you that are wondering he is referring to Nick Lundquist and the team on the supply chain and a really nice job of managing the inventory in a tough environment. ","I'm going to -- typical to prior quarters I\u2019m going to reiterate few of the points made and then touch on a few additional. I have the opportunity to talk to a lot of folks in the Wall Street community over the course of the month. And one confusion there has been and what we talked about in the January call, I just want to reiterate here. And that is Lee touched on it and we really are focused on adding energy into the store to free up the time of our sales people to get out and sell more. And as Lee mentioned in the last 12 months, we've added more than 1,000 people 1,067 to be exact. And we intend to keep adding people to the store level and internally the way we've described to our folks is we have just under 300 district managers in the organization. And we would like to be in a position for each of those district managers to on a net basis add an employee into their business each month. And most of that hiring is going to be part time, we continue to want beef up our ranks on the part time. It's really a means for us to recruit long term because we go into two and four year -- two year technical colleges, four year state colleges, we recruit people with a year or two years left to school with the hopes that when they graduate, they can come work for us full time and we can really hit the ground running. And we have the dollars to put a lot of training into them during their entire cycle with Fastenal. So if we added 300 people a month and say did it for a hopefully nine months or 10 months of the year, maybe nine months, but you would be adding about 15% to your FTE base in the business. So you add 3,000 people, they work about little less than 20 hours a week. You start with a group of 10,000 FTE, you add 1,500 on to that it is 15%. I don't know when the dust settles at the end of the year if we\u2019ll hit that 15% number or if it will be closer to 12% to 13%. The economy is going to dictate a little bit how hard we push on that. But that's our intention to invest heavily into time in the store and free up our sales people who are quite frankly the best in the industry. Free up their time to get out and sell. And as Lee touched on, quite a few of those came in the last really two months. In the first quarter here we added about 614 people into our store locations.","Little bit in the release starting on Page 5, talk about the environment; tough environment out there. Our sales growth softened as we got deeper into the quarter. Weather hit us hard in the January, February timeframe. Oil and gas and some of our customers that are involved with export markets, the currencies \u2013 the US - strong US dollar is not helping export. So our business did weaken as we went through the quarter. You really see it showing up in the industrial, the production side of our business and as we talked about in the release, the best way to think about that is on the fastener side. Our fasteners grew about 6% for the quarter. They were growing 10% and 11% in the third and fourth quarter of last year. So that business really slowed down. We didn't lose any customers but those customers are producing fewer widgets and therefore they need fewer fasteners. ","The non-fastener business still maintains double digit growth. It did weaken, it will move directionally with the other business. But that is a much -- it's a more resilient piece of business for us. And part of it really stems to the fact that it's heavily influenced by our vending initiative of the last five years. ","Starting on Page 10, we talk about the earnings and probably the things that jump out for me when I look at it personally are, and frankly I think it is pretty impressive report. And I am the first one to let our folks know when we had a weak quarter. I am also the first one let them know we had a strong quarter. And I think from an execution standpoint we put out a nice report because we actually hit it well. I mean we added in the last 12 months over a 1,000 people into our stores. We managed our labor expenses well. We managed our non labor expenses even better. We were helped obviously by the fuel and gas prices in our business but that was known item for everybody. But even outside of that we did a wonderful job managing our business. ","Finally, cash flow. Cash flow was very strong. Partly as Lee touched on, we did nice job with our inventory but a strong performance looking at all aspects of the cash flow statements, some things that might be worth pointing out. Late yesterday we announced our second quarter dividend, the $0.28 a share. That is consistent with our dividend in the first quarter. Late March we announced that our Board had increased repurchase authorization for buying back stock to 4 million shares. Just to give you a brief history on that. In January, they established a 2 million share authorization. From mid February till the latter part of the March, we spent and bought back 2 million shares. We spent roughly $82 million. We bought back stock at -- just under $41 a share. This depleted that authority, therefore we asked our Board and they agreed to establish a 4 million authorization to use going forward. We have been in the process of increasing our credit facility. So we are in a position to exercise that if the market sees fit. And we will see how that plays out. I think the report is pretty straight forward this quarter. So not let noise to it. Obviously, the top line weakening is probably the most noteworthy thing again everywhere it seem generating February numbers. So no surprises there. And I have one item I'll throw out as a reminder and then we will switch over to question and answer. And that reminder is just you remind you focus our annual meeting is next Tuesday at 10 AM. ","With that we will turn it over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Robert Barry ","Hi, guys, good morning. I did I wanted to start by asking about gross margin because you mentioned that you had stabilized it in the quarter and it's positive. But it sounds like the language in the release sharpened a little bit this quarter and now seems to call for ongoing decline as average store size grows and since you are not adding stores it sounds like essentially same gross margin decline as the business grows. So can you clarify what the expectation is for the gross margin going forward? ","Dan Florness ","Yes. I will take that one. I don't recall if it was the January call or the October call. But in that previous call -- one of the things that I don't know the people always appreciate, we've talked about our pathway to profit table for years. And in that pathway to profit, as our stores mature they become more profitable because we dramatically leverage the fixed cost structure of our business. The flip side of that coin is you know if you are visiting $50,000 store, you don't have very many $20,000 and $30,000 a month customers in that store. I would be surprised if you have one. You visit a $150,000 store and you could have several. You could have three customers doing $20,000 and $30,000 a month. And those customers first off they have more ability to negotiate pricing. But more importantly than that we have the ability to go after that business in a different way because that market is little different. And so you go after that business because you have more predictability of what your need is and you can be a little sharper with your pencil. Because you know that those revenue dollars and more importantly those gross profit dollars while there are some added expenses of serving them, you are still in the same building. You are still the same semi delivering product. And so when we move from $100,000 store, if you look at all of our stores over $100,000, our average store in that group is about $165,000 a month. Our gross margin in that group and I am just reiterating what we talked about earlier, our gross margin in that group is about 90 to 100 basis points lower than the rest of our stores. However, our operating expenses drop off around 450 basis points. So that $165,000 store has profit relative to the sales dollar that\u2019s 350 basis points higher but there is some trade off, you have given up little bit a gross margin, you are picking up at operating leverage. We like that trade off and so as we move -- once we popped above $100,000 a month in sales, as we move further away from $100,000 a month, I would expect our gross margin to decline. And I'll take that trade off of $1 here for $4.5 over there. ","Robert Barry ","Yes. So it sounds like the outlook for gross margin is essentially a secular decline but you expect more than make up for it at the operating margin level through SG&A leverage. ","Dan Florness ","Yes. 3.5:1","Robert Barry ","And I noticed you took the table out of the release this quarter that shows how the margins are progressing in the various store buckets. I don't know if that will be in the Q but maybe you can just share some thoughts on what has been happening with the margin in the largest bucket because it look like it had been declining.","Dan Florness ","Well, the operating margin improved and you see that shine through, if you look at our stores that do over $100,000 a month, that's about half of our revenue. And so our overall profits were up 100 basis points from last year. That group was a big piece of that equation. I removed it for a couple of reasons. I think one thing when we started the pathway to profit back in 2007, we dramatically expanded some of the information we disclosed really because it was a big change for Fastenal. Five years ago when we introduced the industrial vending, we expanded a bunch of our disclosures because again that was a big change for Fastenal. And one thing we like to be in a position to do always with our shareholders is to be able to think out loud openly and honestly feel what we are doing. I kind of got -- I started to signal last year that I was going to pull back some of the disclosures. Not because we want to disclose less but we want to make sure that all the stuff we disclose doesn't create noise and take away from the message. And it's really -- because you want to focus on here the major things and here the minor things. And so we are trying to pare it back a little bit so we have little bit more concise report. And I am firm believer after 7-8 years of showing pathway to profit for the people that believe it you don't need to see it every quarter. For the people that don't believe it after eight years, I don't know how to convince anybody. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Flavio Campos with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Flavio Campos","Hi, there. Thank you for taking my questions. Just focusing on gross margin just very quickly on Q1. It looks like fuel helped you about a 10 bps right little bit of reduction to that $8.8 million this quarter. And you guys talked a little bit about seasonality as well. So if you can just help us bridge that and if you can also talk a little bit about the fact that on the fastener business you had a lot of cost deflation on the supplier side and now we are seeing a little bit of that price pressure on your customer side as you called out on the release. And if that mismatch in timing has also helped gross margin right now or if you are actually passing through a lot of the savings? ","Dan Florness ","Yes, no, the gross margin really hasn't been helping any timing. Where we do have contracts that are tied to a CRU or some other type of index, it usually mirrors the turn of our inventory. So really when I look at the gross margin and I try to touch on that in the release, the improvement in gross margin, there is always a seasonal lift that occurs. And the real impact is we have a fixed cost with our trucking network. That truck is going, \u2013[inaudible] from Winona is Redwing, Minnesota. There is a truck that stops there every morning. Whether that truck is carrying 10 packages or 20 packages, cost of the truck is the same. And from October to November, December, our volumes will drop off meaningfully because of the seasonality of the business. And so that fixed cost of that truck weighs little heavily -- more heavily on the sales. When our sales snap up in the first quarter that truck still cost us the same, I am ignoring fuel here for a second, that truck still cost us the same but we are delivering 10% more boxes. And so that lift is always there and drag is always there in the fourth quarter. ","I think what's more important about our gross margin is we did more than that. We got the lift that's there. It was [inaudible] a little bit as you mentioned because our fuel cost came in less than say a year ago, less than even fourth quarter although that delta is smaller. But more importantly we did a better job pricing our product and sourcing our product. A lot of our sourcing is done at the store level which is fairly unique for industrial distributors in general because we are very entrepreneurial in our nature. And it's really you know looking at everybody square in the eye and challenging everybody, what we need to stop this and stabilize. And we did a little bit better than that. ","Flavio Campos","Perfect, that's very helpful color. Thank you for that. And if I can just have a quick follow up on the non-res side of the business, that slowdown a lot in March end, that seems a little less levered to the headwinds of oil and gas and exports, I am not sure if that's accurate but if you just could comment on a little bit on the health of that end market.","Dan Florness ","Yes. That business did slowdown for us. One item just keeps in mind, a chunk of our non-res construction is directly tied to energy. Its infrastructure because where we operate and the infrastructure is being built to support the production as well as downstream refining and the transmission in between. We are involved in those three stages of oil and gas. So oil and gas does have an impact on our non-res. But that business was little weaker, part of that was weather standard, but it did soft a little bit. I think there is a lot of tentativeness in the marketplace right now. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Merkel","Hey, guys, good morning. So first question, when I look at your March growth rate and I look at the IFM index, it looks like demand is slowing sort of beyond oil and gas and beyond exports. Are you seeing this is well and what do you think is driving this? ","Dan Florness ","Well, I think, yes, we are but I think what you really have is those two you mentioned export and oil and gas. That casts one heck of a shadow; it is not just the folks that are directly involved in that business. If you are in the same geographic area and the manufacturing pace, the manufacturing heartbeat of that area is weaker, everything else is kind of takes a step down. If you are working at industrial business and you are kind of worried about what's going on your business, people aren't as quick to other things to buy a car, to buy a thing to make a renovation to their home. People just say let's wait and hold because I don't need to replace this television set today. Stuffs like that, you just become a little bit more conservative because everybody is little nervous. ","Lee Hein ","Ryan, I jump in and the other thing on the oil and gas, last call we talked about it being 10% to 12% from a geographic standpoint. But even when you start to consider the steel mill that's making the frac pipe, we didn't even -- that's not in part of our discussion last quarter but there is a ripple effect that I think as Dan said that is greater than I think most people really understand. ","Ryan Merkel","Okay. And asking at a different way. Do you have the growth rate in the quarter for the energy state, the non energy state; was there a big difference there? ","Dan Florness ","I don't have that right in front of me, Ryan. But if I was looking at the energy in general, in case of March, that's probably about 3% impact. ","Ryan Merkel","Okay. And then incremental margins were very strong as you pointed out. But I am just wondering if growth store stays at 6% -7% ranges and then you are going to ramp the FTEs, if it sounds like, what's the reasonable incremental margin range in your mind if you look at 2Q, 3Q, 4Q?","Dan Florness ","Well, one thing to keep in mind, once second quarter and third quarter last year our gross margin was at 50.8, fourth quarter it took little dip down now we are back at 50.8, we could be in a position to invest well and if the noise of gross margin is silent, it's really about our operating expenses. And I see no reason why -- yes, I don't know if it will stay north of 30 but I feel very good about staying north to 25.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Luke Junk with Robert W Baird. Your line now is open.","Luke Junk","Yes, just building off your last comment there on the gross margin line, Dan, Just kind of way out in terms of the outlook for the rest of the year, things that you can't control and some of the things say you have been working on a pricing side. First is maybe some of the headwinds we might face this year especially in the fastener product line, just how this -- in your act and maybe better understanding as we are seeing the drop in steel prices right now and piece of your business that you are probably turning less than two times per year just how would you expect some lower steel prices to work its way into the P&L as we go forward here. ","Dan Florness ","Well, that the lower steel prices, any time you have deflation it creates a challenging environment and we have been in a situation having deflation now for a few years. And so it makes challenging as we go through the year. At the end of the day though I really looked at it in a little longer term perspective than just that. As I try to understand what are the long-term drivers of our gross margin. Because that's really the things that you are focus on. And the long-term drivers of our gross margin are really gets down to business and product mix. So customer mix, how much of our business is coming through stores of different sizes that we touched on earlier in the call. How much is coming with customer of different sizes. One thing that we've done a nice job in recent years and by recent years I am saying the last 15, but we've done nice job of leveraging this infrastructure that is Fastenal, the store base as Fastenal and growing our larger counter national comp business quite aggressively. That continues to outgrow the rest of the business. Not because that we are losing opportunities in the smaller customer base, is because we are under represented in large customer base. So we continue to grow little bit faster there. To me long term the growth in that large customer base as well as the residual impact to our product mix that ultimately drives our gross margin. And as we see as our revenue base grows and our gross margin does decline a bit, we do a very nice job of our business model leveraging that cost. And do a nice job with a pretax which really at the end of the day is the of all the numbers in the P&L, really don't they want matters is the one at the bottom of the page. Everything else above that is just discussion point. But it's still healthy to appreciate the point and understand how that differs from business but ultimately it gets down to what our customer mix and what's our product mixes within those customers. ","Luke Junk","And then just follow up. Lee you mentioned that the port situation was something that did impacted during the quarter. Just curious at a high level what impact it may have had on your supply chain, on product pricing, need to source any product domestically you typically import et cetera.","Lee Hein ","We kind of try to get a message to our folks that we thought this thing would get rectified and to really try to take care of our customers but really we took I think fairly tough stands and we are not going to go out and find something or secure parts domestically and eat the difference. So we did a nice job there to put a number on I can do that. But it cause I think for maybe a few months or month, a little bit of problems here and there but nothing to the degree that it really move the needle for us on the margin side. ","Dan Florness ","One thing that helps us in situations like this is the fact that we have -- with inventories turns roughly two times a year. So we have more resiliency than our peers really do when it comes to this matter because we have 2,600 -2,700 store locations and 14 distribution centers. We have a lot of inventory stored around the country. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Redding with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Charles Redding","Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. I wondered if you could just drill on a little more on Canada. I realized your exposure certainly more heavily weighted towards the eastern markets. Have you seen a weakness there advantage to direct oil and gas exposure? Are you seeing that really bleed over into and some of the more ancillary markets? ","Dan Florness ","For a Western Canada, obviously our business there has been impacted pretty dramatically. And yes it bleeds over into everything in that geographic area as you noted in your question. When we originally entered Canada, we entered from essentially Southern Ontario and grew through Ontario and then from there expanding East and West. So the core of our business is really in the province of Ontario. That business there is held up reasonably well. If I am looking at in Canadian dollar. Obviously, the Canadian currency is very much tied to the fact that their economy is tied to extractive industries. And the weakness in oil and gas, weakness in energy in general is not helped their currency. So we are in a local currency basis we are growing reasonably well. But when compared to the USD, that's what we report in, picture isn't quite so good but the -- underline, and business is sound. ","Charles Redding","Okay, thanks. And then on heavy manufacturing and Ag, I know your exposure there is relatively limited as well. But if you could just color, provide a little more color on heavy manufacturing right now and trends, where you are seeing now you are seeing that shaping up over the next quarter or two?","Dan Florness ","That piece is pretty weak right now. A chunk of our heavy manufacturing is tied to -- easy way to describe it big wheel pieces of equipment and those and that's mining equipment type, agricultural equipment, it might be military equipment. We have a good focus there because those end markets really value what we can bring to their table from the standpoint of fastener expertise and fastener availability as well and everything else that goes with it. Although that is a pretty weak right now. You folks know as well as we do what's going on in some of those end markets as far as with some of those large customers are experiencing right now. It's not a pretty picture. And so that's impacting our fastener business because it is impacting our heavy manufacturing. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is open.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter in a tough operating environment. Yes, I guess one -- this question has been asked prior but could you just walk through, do you think there was any kind of benefits from kind of the rollover and steel just from a contract perspective and those contracts get reset, how are you thinking about kind of more of normalized gross margin at the back half of the year, it is a bit of leading question so you can argue with the partners, so that's fine but I just wanted to ask it. ","Dan Florness ","Yes. I'll answer this way. Deflation in steel never helps our reported margin. If the steel based products that-- are the slowest turning for us. If there is some deflation in non-steel product that we sell so the non fasteners that inventory turns little faster. There you can realize some impact. For us what we are always endeavoring to do is manage the noise of timing. In other words manage where you are giving price concession, where you are not. And really the only time you ever really can get an impact as if you go back to I think it was 2008 timeframe, there was a lot of inflation going on in steel. And we actually saw some short-term gross margin improvement because of it. That was a little unusual because it was so extreme. But generally speaking we-- the lift-- the improvement we had in gross margin is, if there is any impact from steel pricing in there it's negligible, -- not it is measurable. ","Robert McCarthy","Really -- immaterial","Dan Florness ","No.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. Then the second question is I mean and I know you are reluctant to pull out your crystal ball the last year, I mean just looking at the comparison in the back half of the year and some of your comments about non-residence construction in terms of the fact that oil and gas, I mean its number the emanation from oil and gas that we -- is going to affect more markets than we would like and we would think. How do you think about the -- if you saw a commercial construction recovery or some strike in the back half of this year and the comparison, are the prospects there that you could still see kind of mid to the high single digit organic growth in terms of sales given the acceleration in non-res.","Dan Florness ","We believe so. That the business really weakened in this three months period. We don't know where we are in the weakening cycle. We don't know if it is 90% behind us or 50% behind us. We don't know. ","Lee Hein ","Where oils going in","Dan Florness ","Yes. What we do know is that, I think we've demonstrated an incredible resiliency to managing through it. And I think the selling energy we've added into our stores gives us a great means to defend, anything that markets going to deliver to us. But our folks have always been on and Lee touched on really well at the beginning. And being the farm kid I appreciate that perspective really well. You worry about the things you can affect. I don't worry about the weather when I am grown up on the farm because I can't affect it. I worry about how I react to it. Same thing here. I don't worry about the economy. But we do focus our energy and how we can react to it. And I know that's not a real satisfying answer to your question. It is but largely because we don't frankly know what the economies going to deliver in the next 9 to 12 months. ","Robert McCarthy","Has a one more question, I am sorry. But I mean is there any data point you are seeing in terms of your order book, your sales that has been particularly troubling or that you are really monitoring closely versus just a normal slowdown versus pronounced cyclical rollover. Is there any evidence on side or the other? ","Dan Florness ","No. There is not. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kwame Webb from Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Kwame Webb","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my call today. So there has been a lot of talk about adding support people to the stores. Maybe you can just kind of bring us up to date on what you have done in terms of headcount additions for the national sales initiative? Just in terms of adding extra bodies, adding extra IT resources, just to help we understand a little bit better why that business seems to be growing a lot faster than historically was. ","Dan Florness ","I think it is a case of all the things that we've done, it is a combination. It is not about what we did in the last three months or six months or twelve months. It is a combination. Our store footprint puts us in a position. Picture yourself you have -- last week we had our annual customer show down in Nashville, Tennessee. I had the opportunity over the course of three days to talk to probably more customers than I had ever talked to in a three day period which was a wonderful event because what it demonstrated to me is how much opportunity there is out there. And I think that's what really drives for us long term is maybe sometimes the realization of how big the opportunity really is. And what that means for our ability to grow our business. And so the fact that we positioned ourselves with a great store network, staff with great people, a distribution and support infrastructure behind the scene to support day to day activities. Last five years we've built the basically $0.5 billion a year business, selling products through vending machines. And all those things support a multi location customer who wants to have product available for their employees but doesn't want to have voice, that's where vending comes in, who wants to have a supplier base that can support him not in one location or five location but all 20 locations. ","Lee Hein ","Yes. They want consistency. ","Lee Hein ","Yes. And so that's a really important thing. And I think we just over the years have gotten better at realizing what we bring to the table. And probably, at least I can speak for myself, realizing just how massive the opportunity is out there. And that's why I am a firm believer that business is growing faster because we are under represented there. Not because the small comp business isn't growing, is because we are under represented in one and we are really poised to sell into that and demonstrate what we can do. And take advantage of growth there. ","Kwame Webb","And I want to say about a year ago I had a conversation with you guys in terms of just making sure all the incentives were there. I believe there were some commentary saying that you are comfortable paying double commissions both at the store level end and at the national accounts level, just to make sure that people want to compete against each other for business, is that still true? ","Dan Florness ","We believe it is harder to grow than it is to maintain. We pay a higher commission on growth. Just like we pay a higher bonus to our non sales personnel on profit growth than on profit. Because status quo is easier than change. And we reward for change. ","Lee Hein ","Your question I believe are we stacking commissions both at the -- on a national account rep percent, yeah, we pay both but is much like the national account folks are the hunter but our stores do the work, day to day to support the accounts. We pay both and that's factored into our decision and it is great move. We are lined up but that's a company. If the company wins, our employees, our leadership wins, our support folks win. We don't, we move on. ","Dan Florness ","And our shareholders with","Lee Hein ","Yes","Kwame Webb","And just before I hop, when we talk about this big national account wins, who exactly is this business coming from? Is it still mom and pop or is it more sort of national top 15, top 20 type industrial distributors? ","Dan Florness ","It is coming from -- it is come from everywhere. There are a lot of very, very good local and regional distributors out there. And they have probably 70% of the market. And so just to add let say they should be getting impacted 70% of the time. And so it's both but it is a mix.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Rakers with Thomson Research Group. Your line is n now open. ","Brent Rakers ","Yes, good morning. I want to follow up on the implications. I guess the cost application of some of the employee additions you are talking about, if -- Dan, if you hit the targets by the time the fourth quarter comes around, do you have a sense for what the impact would be on overall compensation? Are we talking about an $8 million to $10 million a quarter type of number? ","Dan Florness ","The real driver is looking at that those 300 people we are adding every month. And the way to think about it is we are adding 300 people. They are working let just say for discussion sake 20 hours a week. And depending on what the geography is our average hourly rate is $5 or $11, so that probably the best way to think about the math, Brent is kind of those three pieces and that's kind of the layering effect we have on each month going forward as far as the expense. ","Brent Rakers ","Then I guess Dan or Lee, the related question is how you look at the -- that the payback from that. I mean you are adding -- you are talking about adding basically about 15% FTEs, how productive does that make the other store sellers to get that revenue growth and gross profit dollar to offset or even to get a decent return on the those part time additions? ","Dan Florness ","It doesn't take a lot of business to get pay back on that type of expense especially when you are spread it across 100 and some thousand dollar store, but what it does provide is the employee based that we have in that store, I am really talking about the sales people that we have in that store, the season sales people, that's A, it is an inexpensive population but more importantly it is a very productive population but if they are come in everyday to help receive in the truck or to make deliveries, it's just -- it removes from their day, from their window, that the pure amount of time they get out and sell and again as I touched on in the earlier question about opportunity. Opportunity is staggering. I still visit a lot of stores and I am always amazed by just when I asked people in the store what are some of the customers, or what are some of the opportunities in this market, the opportunity is staggering and we want to be able to unleash that because this cost at the end of the day on a store by store basis, because if you look at it we have around 2,600 and 2,700 stores. We are talking about really adding one person per store over the course of 12 months. Doesn't take a lot of revenue dollars, gross profit dollars to pay for that and get a pretty attractive return because all your other expenses in the store are fixed.","Lee Hein ","And Brent, I would just jump in, when you add a part-timer and now I am going back to my days in the store, when you add a part timer into a store, or you have a general manager and OSP and a team that understands the value they bring to the market then they can actually present that more often, the return on that part timer is hard to measure. The Dan is really touching on a lot of things. We have opportunity within current customers. We saw that last week in Nashville. But we need to be out in the market daily, taking market share and that's what this part time employee brings not only but it is the other side of the coin is the part timer gets to understand our company and our culture to make a decision long term for them.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Ellen Stolts. Please go ahead.","Ellen Stolts","Welcome to the Fastenal Company 2018 first quarter earnings conference call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer. The call will last for up to 45 minutes, and we\u2019ll start with a general overview of our quarterly results and operations, with the remainder of the time being opened for questions and answers.","Today\u2019s conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal. No recording, reproduction, transmission or distribution of today\u2019s call is permitted without Fastenal\u2019s consent. This call is being audio simulcast on the internet via the Fastenal Investor Relations homepage, investor.fastenal.com. A replay of the webcast will be available on the website until June 1, 2018, at midnight Central Time.","As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call may include statements regarding the Company\u2019s future plans and prospects. These statements are based on our current expectations, and we undertake no duty to update them. It is important to note that the Company\u2019s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the Company\u2019s latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we encourage you to review those factors carefully.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.","Dan Florness","Good morning everybody and thank you for joining our first quarter conference call.","To sum up the quarter, I believe we had a good quarter in the first quarter 2018. We had some unusual weather as the quarter laid out and we had the distinction of ending the quarter on Good Friday, which while a business day is often a muted business day. Last year, if you recall, Good Friday was in the month of April.","Weather hit us hard in the quarter. And probably the best way to convey the impact of weather is to think about it from standpoint of what my kids endure during the winter, and that is days that school is closed because there is no bus running and to think about it from the context of our semi [ph] fleet and the number of routes we run and the impact of those routes.","So, we run about 4,800 routes per month. So, in the quarter, we ran about 14,500 routes across our branch and Onsite network throughout North America. In the first quarter of 2017, we had about 200 routes that were cancelled. So, just under 1.5% of our routes were canceled due to weather impacts. In the first quarter of 2018, the number of cancelled routes increased by 65% to 332. So, about 2.3% cancelled. Much of that product ends up getting to the branch on a different route or maybe through a third party; unfortunately, it\u2019s usually a more expensive trip. Some of that product ends up not being sold, because the customer was shut down that day or the business was impacted in some way.","Three geographic areas jump off [ph] I think of the first quarter. First one, this probably doesn\u2019t surprise anybody on the call. Scranton, Pennsylvania which services basically from Pittsburg up through New England and down into the Maryland, D.C. area, they had a 50% -- excuse me, they represented 50% of our cancelations in the quarter. And their cancelation rate was about three times what it was a year ago. And for those of you who live on the East Coast, you\u2019re probably not surprised what I comment. Interestingly enough, about 7% of our cancellations occurred in the Atlanta [ph] Georgia, routes covering down in the Florida, west towards Mississippi and Alabama and north into the Southern part of the Carolinas. Normally that area has no cancellations, so 7% of the cancellation was there.","Probably the only area that had improved weather from a year ago was Seattle, Washington D.C. or the Pacific Northwest. Their cancellations were 1%. Unfortunately, we do a lot more business in the other areas than we do in the Pacific Northwest. So, I feel the 13.2% to be solid growth.","Our pre-tax growth and I\u2019ll talk about pre-tax more than net earnings because of the noise of the tax reform act. Pre-tax earnings grew about 10%. Frankly, not horribly [ph] and perhaps is in the context of a 13% sales growth. Similar to -- speaking of tax reform, similar to the fourth quarter of 2017, we realized a P&L benefit of the tax reform act. About 85% of our business occurs in the United States. So, it means that changes to tax rates in United States, it\u2019s incredibly meaningful to our business. That lifted our quarter, provided about a 10% benefit to our quarter and our earnings per share grew about 31% on that 10% pre-tax growth.","Growth drivers, despite the fact that I\u2019m not overly impressed with our 10% earnings growth, I\u2019m incredibly impressed with our growth drivers in the quarter, but more to that when I get to slide number four. I\u2019m still on slide number three.","Leverage, it\u2019s all about gross profit. I think, we\u2019re doing respectful job managing our operating expenses, things we can improve upon. But it\u2019s about gross profit. And this quarter, despite the fact that our gross profit is down roughly 70 basis points from a year ago, I think there is some really good stories within the number and there are some things we need to fix. When I think of our growth drivers, and I look at Onsite, we\u2019re doing a very nice job of managing our gross margin within that business within Fastenal, despite the fact there is inflation going on and despite the fact we\u2019re rapidly ramping up that business. I think, we\u2019re managing that very well and our gross profit was pretty steady from Q1 to Q1.","Within our vending business, about a 12-year old business for us, again similar to the story on Onsite, we\u2019re doing a nice job managing our gross margin there. In fact, we saw a slight uptick in our vending in the local business offset little bit by the national accounts, but very nice job there. I think, we\u2019re doing a nice job managing our gross margin in the national accounts. Again, I say that in the context as you all know, there is a meaningful inflation going on in our business. And if we don\u2019t stay ahead of it, we can run into some problems on the gross margin line.","The two things that stand out for me, which in my estimation cost us about $3 million this quarter, center on habits at the local level and that's habits within our fastener business. So, as you all know, about 50% of our business is national account. And if you add large regional accounts on to that that number moves closer to 60. ","Within our local book of business, we do a fair amount of fastener business, about 15% of our revenue that's completely priced and driven locally. And then, we have a sizable number in non-fasteners as well. In the non-fasteners, our margin there is pretty [ph] moderate and we're doing a nice job managing that component.","In the local fastener business, we are seeing inflation in that product. Unfortunately, in that business, we're not matching the inflation in our sale price. And we gave up about 130 basis points of gross margin, 130 to 140 in that 15% of our revenue. That's disappointing and that's a habit. And that\u2019s a habit we need to fix. The good news about it is it's something that's very fixable in our business; it takes our attention. So, this morning I had a call with our leaders throughout the business. I congratulate them on a nice quarter. I also congratulate them on hitting goal for the quarter in 2 out of 3 months in the quarter; month of January, we were just shy of goal because of weather. But, we did nice job growing the business. I challenged them on our fastener pricing at the local level. I challenged them on our freight that we charge at the local level. Fuel prices, as you all know are going up, and that impacts us like it does everybody else. We're losing a little bit of ground on the freight component. I also challenged them on accounts receivable. We added about two days of accounts receivable during the quarter. It impacted our cash flow, the last point of the page three. But, all in all, I am pleased with the results of the quarter, except a couple of components within gross margin.","Flipping to slide four. If you are an investor in Fastenal, slide four is a pretty darn encouraging page. I think, it speaks a lot to the potential that is Fastenal and our strengths as far as being distributor [ph] within our marketplace. In the first quarter, we signed 100 Onsites. If I give back context, back in 2015 -- these are rounded numbers, we signed about 75; 2016 we signed about 175; 2017, we signed 275; in 2018, number I have in my head is 375. I think Holden stated range is 360 to 385 to give us bookings. But, I'm pleased to say, three months into the year, our 2000 goal is intact on our challenge to sign 360 to 385 on sites in the year. And I feel really good about that.","In-market locations, we just talked about 3,000, 3,007 to be exact. What I like about that is we're growing our capabilities, we're growing our footprint. We had number of years where we were contracting our footprints. And I talked about that in the President's Letter to this year's Annual Report. Very excited of what we're seeing there. And that's really obviously been driven by our Onsite expansion.","We signed 5,679 vending devices in the quarter, a nice way to start the year. Equally impressive, the number of our removals is declining. We removed 18% fewer devices in the first quarter than we did in the first quarter of last year. So, we're signing more, we\u2019re pulling fewer out; it's a nice combination. Similar to my comments on the Onsite goal, our 2000 goal is intact. Our is to sign 21,000 to 23,000 devices during the calendar year.","Product sales through vending, not surprisingly, grew north of 20% in the quarter, driven by improvements in the existing devices out there as well as the new ones we\u2019ve added. National account sales grew 17% in the quarter. Well done to national account team and growing our relationships with customers around the planet, well done to our branch and Onsite network to serve that business, and everybody else for supporting them in their efforts.","Speaking of around the globe, if I look outside the United States -- inside the U.S. and in Canada, we had some weather impacts during the quarter. But, if I look at rest of world and this includes Canada, we grew our business 25% in the first quarter of 2018. We leveraged it and grew our earnings even faster. Canada grew its business in the 20s, Mexico grew its business in 20s and the rest of the world grew even higher. So, really impressive performance throughout our international operations.","When I think about the business, as you all know, starting several years ago, we really began to invest heavily in what are now the growth drivers of our business. And there is price to that. You see it and Holden will touch on it. We looked at operating expenses. Our labor costs continue to rise. Some of that because of adding resources, some of that because of inflation, some of that because of incentive comp expansion. But, what I am really excited about is the resources we\u2019ve added into our growth drivers in the last two years. So, we\u2019ve added roughly 160 people into our national accounts team. Half of that dedicated solely to implementing new business including Onsites. We added 15% -- 15% of that number is selling resources, most of that what we call the TSR, territory sales rep, a quarter back for the national account business for a given geography. 15% of that increase was for construction centered personnel. We are seeing double-digit growth in our construction these days; 15% of that in our safety personnel. We are seeing great growth in our safety products.","If I look outside of national accounts, we added 225 people roughly in the last two years to support our vending initiatives, most of those in the district business units but quite a few as we took over hosting operations and continue to expand our footprint into deploying devices.","We added resources into Onsite, e-comm, about 15% in the both. We added resources into our government business. E-comm, which we\u2019ll touch on a bit, next week at our Investor Day, seeing great -- it\u2019s a small piece of our business but we are really seeing impressive results within that component as well because of our local and same day delivery capabilities that puts us in a unique spot. We also added roughly 50 people into IT. Those resources are dedicated to being able to roll out new products for our branch network, our Onsite network, and our customers faster, increase the bandwidth and a handful folks to improve the security within our systems.","So, I think we\u2019re making investments in the right places, really impressive what the team is doing. We seem [ph] to execute a bit better on our local faster business and our freight.","With that, I will turn over to Holden.","Holden Lewis","Great. Thank you, Dan, and good morning to everybody. Jumping over to slide five. As Dan stated, total and daily sales were up 13.2% in the first quarter, the deceleration from up 14.8% daily sales growth in the fourth quarter but it is a third straight quarter of at least low teens growth for the Company. We believe that pricing contributed between 50 and 100 basis points in the period; Mansco added another 120 basis points.","Bear in mind that this quarter represents the completion of Mansco\u2019s first full year as a member of Fastenal\u2019s family. In that period, it did achieve the revenue and earnings that we\u2019d originally anticipated it would. We plan to build on that performance for the next 12 months, but be aware that with the transaction anniversarying the second quarter, we\u2019ll no longer be breaking out its contribution specifically.","From a macro standpoint, the PMI averaged 59.7 in the first quarter and industrial production continued to expand at a low to mid single-digit rate. Manufacturing end markets continued to lead our growth with strength in heavy and general manufacturing as well as manufacturing going into transportation and building verticals. Construction was up 9.6% in the first quarter, but after a weather impacted January, we saw growth return to the 10% to 11% range. From a product standpoint, we sustained recent quarter\u2019s growth levels in both fasteners and non-fasteners. Though in the last two quarters, we have seen meaningful acceleration in safety, which grew nearly 20% in the first quarter.","From a customer standpoint, national accounts were up 17.3% with 78 of our top 100 accounts growing. Growth to non-national accounts was steady with mid to high single-digit growth. And nearly 66% of our branches grew in the first quarter; that\u2019s a new high for this cycle.","In terms of market tone, the quarter started with weather disruption and finished with Good Friday moving up from April of last year, but in between conditions remained healthy, sentiment in the field remains constructive and the good demand of the past few quarters appears to be carrying into the second quarter of 2018.","Now, over to slide six. Our gross margin was 48.7% in the first quarter that\u2019s down 70 basis points versus the first quarter of last year. Usual factors that we talked about were present here, relative growth in national accounts in non-fasteners certainly affects the mix; Mansco tends to operate at a lower gross margin; and as Dan touched on, freight remains a challenge. We begin to realize pricing in the period to offset the inflation we\u2019ve discussed. And while that effort continued to gain traction through the quarter, it was uneven and not yet where it needs to be to offset the various elements of pressure in the marketplace. However, we would expect additional gains in the second quarter in our pricing actions.","Our operating margin was 19.8% in the first quarter that\u2019s down 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The 70 basis-point decline in gross margin was partially offset by 20 basis points of operating expense leverage. If I look at those pieces, we achieved 50 basis points of leverage over general corporate expenses and occupancy-related cost, the latter was up 7.7% with the largest variables being growth in vending and non-branch occupancy expenses.","Selling transportation related expenses were up 12.3, which was equally attributable to higher fuel costs and related to an increase in our branch fleet during the period. Our employee-related costs were up 14.4%; that reduced our leverage by 20 basis points. This continued to reflect Mansco\u2019s headcount and increase in our total FTE headcount of up 6% and up 7.4% respectively and that excludes Mansco and significantly higher incentive compensation across the organization, reflecting our better growth.","The incremental margin in the first quarter was 16%, while the second quarter incremental margin will likely be challenged by a difficult gross margin comparison. The anniversarying in 2Q 2018 of the Mansco acquisition and the incentive compensation reset should generate better leverage for us in the second half.","Putting it all together, the first quarter earnings were $0.61, up 31% from the first quarter of 2017. In the absence of tax reform and the lower rate it provides us, EPS would have been $0.51 and the growth would have been 10%.","To give you a quick update on tax reform, having had more time to evaluate the impact, we now expect our ongoing tax rate will be between 24.5% and 25%, absent any discrete events that may arise from changes in the application of the law or other ongoing activities.","Flipping over to page seven, slide seven. We generated a $160 million in operating cash in the first quarter, which is 92% of net income. This is a lower conversion rate than we typically see in the first quarter. Part of this is just math as our lower tax rate benefited the P&L in the first quarter but has not yet flowed through the cash flow statement. The other piece however relates primarily to those accounts receivables which I\u2019ll cover in a moment. We continue to anticipate good cash flow in 2018, based on good earnings growth and the cash flow benefits from tax reform that will begin in second quarter of \u201818.","Net capital spending of $32 million increased in the first quarter of 2017 on expansion and upgrades at our hubs and corporate property. Our 2018 target for total net capital spending is unchanged at $149 million. We increased funds paid out in dividends by 15% to $106 million and reduced our debt by $10 million.","We finished the quarter with debt at 15.7% of total capital, consistent with last year and a level that provides ample liquidity to invest in our business and pay our dividend. The picture of working capital\u2019s mixed. The inventories were up 12.7% in the quarter. Inventory on hand fell 5 days, which we view favorably in light of inflationary pressures and plans for additional inventory investments in the field through 2018. Receivables grew 19.8% in the first quarter and days their expanded by 3.5. Days outstanding naturally expands as we experience relative growth from our national accounts to international businesses. However, in the last two quarters, this has been compounded by customer payments being pushed out past the quarter end. We have seen no meaningful change in hard to collect balances and so this is an area that we will work to improve upon the balance of the year.","That\u2019s all for our formal presentation. And with that operator, we\u2019ll take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Robert Barry","So, you mentioned price only partially offsetting freight and product cost inflation. Is that dynamic only in the local fastener business or is it broader? And when do you think you can get to at least neutral on that price cost dynamic?","Holden Lewis","I\u2019ll handle that one. In the case of the fastener business, that\u2019s local. And keep in mind, when I talk about local, I\u2019m talking about where the pricing decision is made as far as what level of price. And so, this is local business. When I talk about freight, that includes both local business and national account business. So, includes all aspects of our business. But the decision of whether or not charge freight is typically made locally. There might be some contractual limitations on certain sales. But generally speaking, that\u2019s a local made decision. So, I would put both in that bucket.","In regards to how quickly we can click upon on it. The freight one is a challenge, because in many of our growth drivers, and vending is an example of growth driver, Onsite example of growth driver, our propensity to charge freight is typically lower, especially in the case of vending, it\u2019s not-existent for the most part.","There are challenges to engage with the customer or doing backhauls of freight. And I often see examples of that. On a recent trip, I saw interestingly enough down Indianapolis, 3 pallets, large pallets, and each had a truck cab on it from a vintage truck that was being shipped from a scrap yard in Minnesota out to the East Coast. And that\u2019s example of backhauls we do in our system to offset. The freight one is going to be challenging in the short term. The fastener one, that's about habits and we can change habits tomorrow.","And I'll just -- to give you a little bit of color. If I think about the RVP commentary that came through to us over the course of the quarter, it improved as the quarter went on from January to February to March. So, I think that the confidence in the field grew and the achievement in the field grew as we went along, which is what we would have expected to see. And I would also say that if I think about the month-to-month contribution of pricing, it also grew as we went through the quarter. So, we've talked before about having to rebuild that muscle memory. Obviously for us in our model, these conversations are very much sort of customer to employee. And I think there are signs that we are building up that muscle memory through the quarter and we just need to make sure that we continue to bulk up as we go into the second quarter and that's the expectation.","Robert Barry","Got it. I guess just a follow-on to that given there is a lot of talk about tariffs, raising product cost, in particular on some of your products. Just given what sounds like a pretty tough pricing environment, I mean, what's the thought on the ability to pass those through or fully being able to pass those through?","Holden Lewis","To be clear, I don't think that it's a pretty tough pricing environment. We are getting pricing, it's just the rate at which we're getting it. Again, I think that the sentiment around how the RVPs are feeling about that environment has only gotten better as the quarter has gone on. So, I don't think that would characterize the pricing environment today is tough. It's just a matter of at what pace we're going to be able to put it through.","As it relates to tariffs, however, if you think about 232, the increase in steel and aluminum, that would primarily have a direct impact on our manufacturing business, which does source that. If I think about the section 301s -- which is 4% or 5% of our revenue on the manufacturing, if I think about the section 301 tariffs, we looked into what products are captured in that. And there are some. I think we've identified about $11 million or $12 million in annual COGS that would be affected directly by that. There no doubt be some others that come through in -- through masters. But we're talking about metal nuts; we're talking about pallet jacks and a few other items. And so, there really was no impact on tariffs in Q1 in our business. Most of what would be affected directly seems fairly modest. I think, our bigger question is what impacts does it have on our customers at the end of the day. And as I said, in Q1, there really was nothing there. To the extent that it contributes to either a more inflationary environment, we'll have to respond to that as we\u2019ve talked about. To the extent that it creates issues for our customers, we have to respond to that. But no impact yet, and I think it\u2019s sort of a wait and see kind of situation.","Dan Florness","I\u2019ll chime in a little bit as well to support Holden\u2019s answer. And that is historically, our ability to pass on things like this, a tariff, a duty et cetera, the marketplace gets that and it\u2019s able to pass that through. The wildcard in all of it is what impact that has, not to our ability to price but to volumes. What impact does it have with the customer? Does it impact their ability to export product? Does it impact the profitability within their business on what products they sell? That's the unanswerable question. But the marketplace gets the fact that the costs are going up.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Robert McCarthy","I have two questions because that's all we\u2019re allowed and time we\u2019re allowed. So, thank you for taking that. I guess, following up the tariffs, you mentioned 301. Could you just confirm, you think it\u2019s a very limited set of SKU and product that is going to be affected by this? And could you just let us know broadly how much you do source from China in terms of your underlined COGS or general sourcing?","Dan Florness","First off, to touch on that, we have identified what we know so far. Keep in mind that the number Holden sighted looks at product we\u2019re directly sourcing that we believe is impacted. But on top of that is product that we\u2019re sourcing from others that would be impacted. That ones are more difficult ones to quantify because with many of our suppliers, if I think of both branded and some of the non-branded products, many of our suppliers, their source of origin can fluctuate, so they might -- a lot of fasteners come out of Taiwan and China and a lot of that production has moved into China over the last 15, 20 years. No different than 40 and 50 years ago a lot of that production had moved from Japan into Taiwan and in other parts of Southeast China -- or Southeast Asia, excuse me. So, there are other sources of supply but the issue we run into is see that what you can change. Other factors that might be going on in other countries within the Pacific Rim, most of the fasteners sold in this country are made outside in North America. So, it\u2019s not an issue that\u2019s unique to us; it\u2019s an issue that\u2019s unique to that product line.","Within our non-fastener product, the percentage would be lower but still a sizable piece is made. But again it can -- I hesitate to quantify it because there are multiple sources of supply and we aren\u2019t always privileged to upstream those sorts of supply when we order [ph] product. But the other dynamic is this thing moves rapidly. Sometimes you have to try to follow it by the latest tweet and we prefer not our business that way.","Holden Lewis","But Robert, we actually have seen the list of things that we understand to be affected now. So, we have something on which to sort of make a judgment, if you will. And if I look at that list there is probably 25 things on it, iron or steel nuts is 85% of that. And so, there is a list of things out there that are supposed to be affected by that. That\u2019s what we\u2019re able to give some judgment based upon.","Robert McCarthy","Yes. No, I have the documentation right here in terms of the list. But, the essence of the question, I don\u2019t want to preclude my second question, so this a follow-up to the first question is -- very briefly is, yes, that\u2019s a Section 301 that was kind of enumerated. But, the fact of the matter is it sounds like it could be a greater effect kind of similar to oil and gas in \u201814 where you had headline exposure of mid single-digits but the number of the effect would be to greater I guess is my point.","Dan Florness","Time will this. There are still plenty unknowns.","Robert McCarthy","Yes. Number two is, just very simple question. I mean, obviously, gross margin, you sighted, enumerated the various -- growth is good but the challenge is the mix in gross margin and that structural mix. Given last couple of years, you\u2019ve been -- the first quarter gross margin typically is one of the higher gross margins of the year and then typically above the average gross margin for the year. Do you think that\u2019s going to continue according to whole year or do you think there\u2019s opportunity for you to expand sequentially gross margin this year or have we put in the high for gross margin for this year or particularly versus the average?","Holden Lewis","The question of expanding gross margin, I mean, we build the whole in Q1. Q2, I can tell you is going to be a very difficult comparison based on how we performed last year, but -- o that would difficult. But, if we\u2019re talking just sequentially, there is a path to be able to achieve a gross margin that is comparable to slightly below where we are in Q1. So, I think if you look at the history, it\u2019s not uncommon to see 30 basis points or what have you sort of down from Q1 or -- to Q2 et cetera. There is a path to do somewhat better than that. But that path does rely significantly on our ability to continue to build up our pricing momentum and that\u2019s kind of the wildcard that we are going to be playing through in Q2. Again, we like the signals, we certainly give it a clear message as to what we need to do going forward. And if we can deliver and execute on that as we fully expect to do so, there is a path to have margins that are comparable to maybe modestly below where we faced in Q1 and perhaps do a little bit better than the normal seasonal pattern, if you will.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Your line is now open.","David Manthey","Hey, guys. Good morning. First question, Dan, you said you are happy with the return on the investment and your growth drivers but you are disappointed by the profit growth in the first quarter. When you look at the core expense leverage in addition to the changing secular mix of the business and gross margin pressure you just mentioned, are we at an inflection here where we\u2019ll get back to 20% to 25% contribution margin or are you happy with faster sales growth and maybe a contribution margin in the teens? It seems like we have been leading that way in the last couple of quarters.","Dan Florness","As our business was ramping up in 2017, our willingness to invest in our growth drivers expanded. And that\u2019s why I touched on some of the headcount we\u2019re adding behind the scenes to really support this. And knowing full well that I frankly didn\u2019t expect coming into the first half of this year, and I\u2019m operating margin when I talk about this and removing the noise of tax reform. I fully expected our operating -- our incremental margins to drop below 20% and into the upper teens. And ironically enough, we have been -- if we went [ph] to have this fastener issue in the quarter, would, could, should, but we would have been in the low 20s. I still firmly believe when I look at this business over period of years -- and we are in transition period of really investing heavily in a fundamentally different growth driver in our business.","As we\u2019re in that, if you look at it over time, there\u2019s no reason why gross margin can\u2019t be in that -- the incremental margin within the gross margin line can\u2019t be in that lower half of the 40s, so 43 to 45, and our incremental spend can\u2019t be closer to 20, which would put us into optimistically 25, pessimistically lower half of 20s incremental margin. And if we are growing 6, 7 ,8 points faster than anybody else out there and we are taking market share and we are doing things that are natural for our business and that create a more defensive of a business from the standpoint of conversations from others, I think that\u2019s a win for our shareholders. Right now, like I say, we\u2019re investing heavily in that transition. And unfortunately, we stubbed our toe on local pricing this quarter. But, I think that\u2019s fixable, I know it\u2019s fixable fast. ","Holden Lewis","And David, just so you know, the gross margin is certainly part of it. But the other piece, if I look at our operating expenses. Bear in mind that through Q1, the blending in of Mansco, that obviously has an impact on the incremental margins. The reset of incentive comp, I know it seems like, we started talking about that a year ago, we did. The good news is, you get into Q2, Q3, Q4 and that reset begins to anniversary as well. I take some encouragement from the fact that we\u2019ve got 50 basis points of leverage over corporate and occupancy. We did not get much over the headcount side. But as we do begin to anniversary that reset in Q2 and beyond, I think that there is potential there to get more leverage out of the SG&A than what you\u2019ve seen to this point. And so, the growth drivers will -- we\u2019re going to continue to invest in those. But there are pieces of our P&L that we should leverage out at greater -- to a greater degree certainly into the second half of this year than we have at this point as our growth matures.","David Manthey","Second question is on the freight impact on gross margin. I went back and looked and this has been an issue for you at least back to the end of 2016 and here. When does this get fixed, can you fix it, and can you just describe what the source of the issue is? Is it that you\u2019re using third party and not internal logistics or what\u2019s going on there and can it be fixed?","Dan Florness","Number of things there. It\u2019s not external versus internal. We\u2019ve got a little bit of that in the quarter because of the weather. But that\u2019s not fundamental issue, Dave. If I look at it, we lost about 20 basis points of gross margin strictly on the pricing aspect of where we\u2019re charging it. I\u2019d say a third of that is because of our growth drivers pulling it down, the other two-thirds is our propensity to execute. And I think it\u2019s something we fall victim to. We convince ourselves that the marketplace doesn\u2019t allow people to charge freight anymore, because that\u2019s you read in the headlines every day. That\u2019s not true. The marketplace will allow you to charge freight, when you break, when you\u2019re providing a value. I believe your propensity to charge freight in this environment goes up because every time I turnaround, I read an article about folks can\u2019t add trucks and drivers and capacity fast enough. And so, freight is becoming more expensive and we were structural advantage there and we need to price for that.","So I believe, it\u2019s fixable, but the challenging aspect is our growth drivers aren\u2019t are true friend. And so, when it comes to this aspect, they are great friend when it comes to growing our business, but they do hurt it on the face of it. And there we need to challenge ourselves and say, okay, we don\u2019t charge freight here, let this customer shipping product out, can we ship some pallets of product out? And that\u2019s why, when I go to our big [indiscernible] facility down in Indianapolis, I am always curious what I see when I\u2019m down there. Because it tells me if we\u2019re engaging and doing that because if our customers are having a hard time finding capacity to ship pallets, and we have capacity to ship pallets, I think we can marry that up and fix piece of the problem there. But, it\u2019s a component of where Holden\u2019s talked about the gross margin impact of our growth drivers and the drop, the natural drop we\u2019re going to see each year in our gross profit, that\u2019s a component of it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Adam Uhlman","Hi, guys. Good morning. Dan you just mentioned 20 basis points of the impact on gross margin. Could you walk through the remainder of that, the decline in gross margin between mix and Mansco and the rest of it?","Dan Florness","Yes. Mansco was probably about 10 to 20 basis points impact right down the middle there. I would say mix this quarter was also sort of in that 10 to 20 basis-point impact. I think, the transportation was about 20 basis points of impact. And those would give you the biggest pieces of the sort of the 70 basis-point decline year-over-year.","Holden Lewis","And local pricing of fasteners.","Dan Florness","And so -- and then obviously local pricing of fasteners and this general product inflation play role and the fact that we didn\u2019t get as much as we needed to begin to offset that.","Adam, I\u2019ll add one pivot there. So, I sighted when I was talking to Dave the fact that we\u2019ve given up 20 basis points on our propensity charge. We got about half of that back in leveraging of our network itself. So, the gross margin impact was about 10 basis points for freight, 20 of it, pricing, 10 of it we got back because we still run a great fleet and we continue to utilize that fleet for moving products around the country; even though our costs are up there, we are moving more tons of product.","Adam Uhlman","Okay, got you. And then, just secondly, how should we think about working capital for the rest of the year? I guess, I was a little confused on exactly what\u2019s happening with receivables and why customers are pushing it into the next quarter. Do you anything you can share with us or other process improvements that you are putting into place to get to get the conversion improve?","Holden Lewis","Yes. To some extent, you don\u2019t want to overreact to something because again at the end of the day what we are looking for is are we seeing issues with hard to collect product, and the fact is we are simply not. And so, in the fourth quarter, we obviously called out receivables being a bit of a challenge. And I may have sort of believed that that was primarily a function of the calendar and true that may have simply been -- our customers are sighting to push out beyond the quarter. I don\u2019t know what the reason is for what looks to us to be a recent somewhat change in behavior. It\u2019s something that we will have to kind of go back and check on and get our arms around. But, I think the important element of it is, we don\u2019t have an increase in hard to collect receivables out there. Those numbers have remained lean and healthy. And so, all we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re seeing a pushback, which if it\u2019s about being able to report a clean quarter, as many of our customers are public and do so, you could be talking about dates. At the end of Q4, we saw an inflow of payments at the beginning of January. I haven\u2019t had a chance to sort of look at how the beginning of the first quarter has played out yet and look at that statistics, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it\u2019s there.","So, it\u2019s something that\u2019s worth calling out because obviously it impacts those numbers. But, I don\u2019t think that there is anything particularly worrisome from there from a -- in terms of a corporate health standpoint I guess how I\u2019ll put it.","Dan Florness","I will throw the ladder on to that, and we\u2019re coming up on 45 minutes past the hour, so this would be the last question. When I think of it and putting my old hat on, you customers that are growing faster than they have experienced in recent years, that growth in their businesses takes working capital; you have interest rates that are rising. It\u2019s probably not an unreasonable thing to see of people pushing, especially, they do a little window dressing at the end of the quarter to see patterns slowdown.","My challenge to our team is, guys no, have a challenge your customer. We\u2019re business partners here. And to cut off your payments from the 22nd through 25th of March creates a lot of pain for us too. And there is three assets in our business. There is fixed capital of which vending is typically is place inside their facility; there is inventory of which with Onsite we\u2019re placing dollars inside their facility and there is accounts receivable. If I think of the value, we bring to their business of those three things, the first two add value, the third one doesn\u2019t. So don\u2019t do that to us. And let\u2019s push back a little bit using that, because every dollar we have there is a dollar can have in inventory and fixed capital long term. And we don\u2019t think that\u2019s good for our customers. So, if they want to push some other suppliers, they can do that, but can\u2019t do with us. Because we have inventory and fixed capital inside your facilities to support your business, we can\u2019t do all three.","With that, we are at 45 minutes past the hour. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s earnings call. Holden is hosting an Investor Day next week. I believe that\u2019s being broadcast on the Internet.","Holden Lewis","That will be webcast.","Dan Florness","Webcast. And again, thank you for support of Fastenal. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect.

Go ahead, Mr. Oberton.","Willard D. Oberton","Thank you, Ellen, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Most of the comments that I am going to make this morning are going to be based on the quarter, not the annual numbers. Starting out with the quarter, as you can see, sales were slow for the quarter. There's -- I don't believe there's any surprise in that because we announced the monthly numbers. We did see a little bit of an uptick in December, which was positive.","A little color on the numbers. The sales growth was consistent throughout our business. Geographies, end markets, everything has been a step-down from where we were earlier in the year. We're not seeing any areas that are far slower or more positive, so it's interesting watching it, but it just looks to be a general slowdown across the markets that we served.","One exemption from a customer grouping, and you'll note that -- or you'll see that on Page 7. If you look at our vending customers, they grew about 34% in the first quarter and dropped to about 28% in the fourth quarter, a drop of about 5% to 6%. And at the same time period, our company's growth dropped by almost 12%. It's too early for us to really understand what happened there, but it's a positive because it's a growing part of our business. We take that as a real positive.","Switching to the margin. Year-over-year, for the entire year, our margin was down 30 basis points, which is disappointing because we work very hard on that. On a quarterly basis, this is the first or the only quarter of the year that we actually showed an improvement year-over-year, picking up 40 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2011. So directionally, we're very upbeat about margin. We have a lot of projects that we're working on, and our goal is to be in the top half of our range of 52% to -- or excuse me, 51% to 53% for 2013. And we're going to work very hard to try and make that happen. But as the year goes on -- or as the year went on, it seemed to improve.","From an expense control standpoint, all I can say is to the Fastenal, the blue team, is I think they did -- we've done a nice job. We've -- our expenses grew on the fourth quarter by about 7.5%, and there were a few things that made that a little harder. Our vending bonuses that we announced at the beginning of the year were very tail-loaded because it was a 12-month incentive, and they billed [ph] as the year but there were a lot of people pushing hard. And you saw that in our vending numbers to achieve that goal at the end of the year, so that was a much larger number than we've seen in previous quarters. It's a great way to spend money, I believe, or is a good initiative.","Another one is our 401(k) match. Our 401(k) profit sharing is based off our pretax profit percentage, which was a record for us and so that pushed up also. So we grew our expenses at 7.5% with those additional expenses. So I'm very proud of what everyone was able to achieve.","Pathway to profit. For the year, on year-over-year, total basis, we only grew our pretax profit by 70 basis points, which is 30 points less than we had hoped for and planned for. But if you look at a 2-year basis, we were able to grow it by 220 basis points. So when we laid this out several years ago, we knew that it was going to be a little bumpy. But as long as we can continue to hit it and a longer runway, we're still happy with the results.","For the year -- or excuse me, for the quarter, our pretax profit was 21.5% -- excuse me, that was an annual number I wrote down, 21.5%, which is a record for the company. And I'm really proud that we were able to achieve that. We're still very focused on the pathway to profit and believe that we can achieve our goals in a normal economy, whatever a normal economy means. I guess what I mean by that is as long as we don't see a big step-down in the economy, we're still very confident that we can achieve our pathway to profit goals and move that forward as the years go on, still believing it's a good strategic growth strategy for our company.","Looking at some of our specific growth initiatives. As you know, most of you know, we've invested more heavily in the Government business over the last several years. For the quarter, our Government business grew just over 26 percentage points. Again, against 8% -- 8.5% for the company. So a nice improvement over the overall company numbers and something that gives us confidence to continue to invest in salespeople in that specific area.","Our metalworking product area, it also grew nicely. It actually grew at 26% -- 27%, just slightly above the Government business but very similar. Again, gives us confidence to continue to invest in that product line and the salespeople that push it. So we're seeing nice things there.","In 2012, we started working very -- developed a focused effort on trying to improve our fastener growth, mainly on the OEM side, the larger accounts side. And although it's too early to give any numbers as to how we're doing with that, we're very optimistic with the anecdotal information coming back from the field and this process that we've developed. And we believe that by the second half of 2013, we should be able to report more information and results, but we're very optimistic. The fastener business is a business that we're very good at, and there's a tremendous opportunity out there to grow that business.","On the vending side of our business, industrial vending that we talk a lot about, I was very pleased with the fourth quarter results. We ended up with 20,161 machines for the year. Up until the -- actually the beginning of January, I didn't think we were going to achieve the 20,000 number. I kept going into Russ Rubie's office, the guy who runs it for us, and asking him about it. He was confident that we would, and I'm really proud of what they've been able to do. I think we're showing great progress there.","As Dan put in the earnings release, our goal for 2013, we've upped it to 30,000. We put new incentives and put 30,000 units for the year. We put new sales incentives in place, raising the numbers and tweaking some things to try and get the focus that we'll need to achieve such high numbers, but we're confident that we should be able to hit those numbers.","At the same time, we're working very hard on developing improved systems, processes and new efficiencies to try and improve that business and basically improve the profitability. It's already profitable, very good business, but we believe we can make it some of the most efficient business that we do. One of the big steps that we're taking to improve that business is we made a decision to invest in a vending-specific warehouse in Indianapolis, Indiana. It's a building that we own, but we're retrofitting it so that we're going to start picking orders. This will be in the middle of 2013. We're starting -- we're going to centralize the order picking for vending machines for any store that chooses to do this. And from the information coming back from the field, it will be a high percentage of them.","So we will take the electronic order from the store, send it in electronically to the vending warehouse where they'll stock the specific items, pick up on a very efficient manner and send them back to the stores on a, basically, an overnight basis. There are 3 things that we believe will improve because of this. One, is we'll reduce our labor. It's a far more efficient process. Two, is we believe if we do this for the store, they will not need to stock the inventories to improve our inventory turns. And the third is that we believe we'll be able to improve our margins because we'll buy such tremendous volume into one location, and the central purchasing opportunity will give us margin opportunities. So we believe this is a good investment.","That investment is part of our overall distribution plan. Dan has brought you to a much -- or a higher number for capital expenditures this year because based on what we've seen in Dallas, Indianapolis and our new Winona facility, we're very committed to automate more of our warehouses. We've seen great results and, really, that's in 3 areas. We've lowered our labor, improved our efficiencies. We've reduced the mistakes that we make in those warehouses because it's a better process. And we're able to push our trucks out earlier so we can provide even greater service to our customers. Based on that view, we've made a decision to add automation to Atlanta, our Atlanta warehouse, add our distribution warehouse on to our existing warehouse in Akron, Ohio. Those are under construction, as we speak. And then in the spring, we're going to add one in Scranton, Pennsylvania. We just received the permits for that this week. So we're very focused on expanding our distribution. And it's really all part of an overall plan of making a far more efficient distribution machine for Fastenal over a long period of time.","With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan, and he'll give you some more color on the numbers in the quarter. Thank you very much.","Daniel L. Florness","Thanks, Will, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining in on our call today. My comments today will be relatively brief. I'll touch on a few things. First off, one housekeeping note, and this is just something for the analysts on the call. Please be mindful of, as we enter our first quarter of 2013, we have a calendar change for the quarter. There aren't any big swings like we saw in Q4 where we have months with plus or minus 2 days. I believe we have one additional day in January. We're down one in February. We're down one in March. So last year, it was a 64-day quarter. This year is a 63-day quarter. We get that day back in the third quarter this year so the annual basis, 2013, is pushed to 2012. Just a housekeeping note.","The chart on the bottom of Page 3, I think, tells the story a little bit of the year as far as from a top line standpoint. So as Will mentioned, as we've talked about in earlier calls, we saw a dramatic -- a meaningful change in our business in the late April and May time frame. And if you look at those, the lines on that graph, you see a separation of current year to the 2 prior years and the benchmark period quite dramatically emerge when you get into May, and it stayed there for the balance of the year, and that really changed the chart of our year.","The big change that drove that was the change in our fastener business, and Will touched on it earlier the -- some of the investments and the initiatives we have with the -- as they center on fasteners as we go into '13. We're optimistic about those. When I look at the -- at what happened to our fastener business, the drop-off from 15% growth in the first quarter to 2.5% growth from the fourth quarter, I really see that as a pure indicator of the state of our economy, the state of the market we sell into, because the change is so abrupt, it was really a case of customers just purchasing less product because they're producing less product themselves. Our fastener business is really driven by the OEM portion of it. And if we have a customer that's down 10%, 15%, 20% on their production, that directly ties to their OEM spend, and it's a less direct relationship to the MRO spend. So really impacted the fasteners.","The flip side of that coin is our non-fastener area. We started the year growing about 25%. We ended the year growing about 13.6%. I think that the change also represents the state of the economy. But a good piece of that offset by the impact of some of our initiatives and the biggest one that comes to mind would be our vending, as well as our Government, our metalworking, but the vending was really the driver of that. And so we've done a really nice job, in my opinion, of coming up with incremental growth drivers to our business to deflect the impact of the short-term economic situation that we face. And it really, to me, speaks more about the opportunity that is in front of us. There's a massive market out there for us to sell into, and this is a means to take market share faster.","ISM Index. We've been publishing that in our release throughout this year, just to try to give a little more insight for the reader of the release. It's been moving around a bunch. One thing that was -- that you noticed around in the last 4 months of the year, it's been bouncing around, but we did end the year north of 50. If there's any consolation to it, it's nice to end in an upbeat rather than in a downbeat number, so we are optimistic as we go into 2013.","As Will touched on, nice progress, again, with our FAST Solutions and the fact that the customers with vending continue to hover in that 30%, maybe -- rather think we were 28% and change, but continue to hover in that 30% neighborhood of the growth. And that growth, to me, is, as I've said in past calls, is a sign of engagement with that customer. Every one of our customers has the potential to spend more money with us, and the real question is how do we position ourselves to get more of that spend and provide more solutions for our customer in the process.","The profit drivers, and again, Will touched on this as well, we hit 20.9% in Q4, 21.5% in -- for the year of 2012, both our high-water marks for our organization. And we're quite proud of those and proud of the blue team for achieving those numbers.","Gross margin. I think Will covered it sufficiently on the fact of what's going on from a trend standpoint. One item I'd add is really the nature of the trends inside the quarter, so get beyond the headline and look at inside the quarter a little bit. In Q3, if you look at where we were in July to September, we've been struggling as we've gone through the year. Our fastener business is a little bit weaker. Our vending business is driving our margin. Our large account business is growing a little bit faster. So there's some things that are naturally creating headwinds for us in our gross margin.","As we went through third quarter, our gross margin from July to September dropped 20 basis points, so our slant was downward as we went through the third quarter. From September to October, our gross margin was flat. From October to December, we increased 40 basis points. So the headline number might be the same gross margin in Q3 and Q4, completely different quarters, if you look under the surface a little bit. And I think that positions as well, and we're quite optimistic about our potential for gross margin as we enter the new year, and Will touched on that earlier.","Operating expenses. I think we did a nice job managing through that during the year. I'm particularly proud of the portions of our operating expenses because if you look at where they did grow, they're really growing because of growth drivers in our business and our success with those growth drivers. The vending bonus, I think, is a great example of that. On things that are more fixed cost components, we're managing those fixed costs, I think, quite well. On the occupancy, for example, 100% of the increase related to occupancy centered on our vending initiative, whereas all the other pieces we were able to manage in an offset fashion. Bringing on the Winona facility live and adding a number of storage this year, both of those are offset by savings in other areas, so good expense management there.","From a cash flow standpoint -- oh, and I skipped past the operational working capital on Page 13. A little disappointed on that page. Quite frankly, the calendar wasn't our friend in the fourth quarter. A good chunk of our business is customers with terms of 30, 45 days, so we have a lot of customers that will pay in that 40- to 42-day neighborhood. And so for us, in any given quarter, in any given month, the real question is how much of our sales from the middle month of the quarter is collected by quarter end because all of our December business, by and large, is outstanding at the end of the year. And our November business, what percentage of that is collected? When you have a really short December, and the way the calendar worked out, we had a really short December this year. There's just not enough of November that gets collected in December and it's coming in, in January. So it creates some challenges for us on the AR side, something that, I believe, will correct itself as we get into a more normalized calendar period in 2013.","The inventory, on the other hand, we bought some inventory at year end. There were some opportunities availed to us by our suppliers to buy inventory at a discount. We took advantage of some of those opportunities. We added probably about $15 million more in inventory in the fourth quarter than I would have expected. And I think they were good decisions. I think we could have done a better job of offsetting some of that in other places. And I think we'll be able to burn off a good chunk of that inventory, that increase as we go through first quarter.","On the cash flow side, when we started the pathway to profit back in 2007, I remember the meeting down in the Indianapolis facility where we first introduced pathway to profit. On the cash flow, what we already talked about at the time was operating cash expectation. My number I had in my head was 85%, so I cited a range of 80% to 90% to give me a little bit of wiggle room. I think what we've really done over, as the pathway to profit has improved a little bit of profitability, that 85% has moved more up to a 90% number. And that's where really my head is at when I think of where our operating cash should be as a percentage of earnings. For the year, we came in at 94%. In fact, I think in the last 6 years, 5 of those years, I think we've been north of 90%. And so very pleased with our ability to generate just cash, operating cash, in our business.","In that same discussion, talk about we had 90% of earnings and operating cash, we'll spend about 25% of that in CapEx because we're a growing business and we need the infrastructure for future growth. In 2012, that number came in about 32%. The real driver there is the vending side. I think about 45% of our CapEx for the year was vending centered. And as Will touched on, next year, we have quite a few plans in place for expansion of our distribution centers. We're very optimistic about the capability of our vending initiatives, and we would expect to be higher in CapEx. In fact, I'm looking at our 10-K page for CapEx next year. And just for those of you in the analyst community, we're expecting a number somewhere between $185 million and $190 million in CapEx next year. So meaningful increase over the $134 million that we did this year.","With that said, that leads me to the last item, and that is our dividend. Last night, we announced a dividend of $0.10 per share. Our last regularly -- we paid a supplemental dividend of $0.50 late in 2012 because of the uncertainty around dividend taxes. If I go back to our last regular quarter, we paid out about $0.21. In the release, I touched on the fact that we expect to pay a smaller dividend than the initial quarters of 2013 because of the large payout late in '12. We want to replenish our cash a little bit, primarily because, if I was going to read anything into Fastenal's release this quarter, what I would read into it is bullishness. We are bullish on our ability to put out vending machines, and I think that bullishness is supported by what we actually did in 2012. We're bullish about expanding our distribution capabilities because of what we've seen in 2011 and 2012. And we are bullish on what we can do on top line sales in the new year, and that requires some working capital. So we're a little cautious on our dividend payout in the first quarter, but we expect in the future to resume to a normal payout pattern.","With that, I will turn it over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Holden Lewis of BB&T.","Holden Lewis - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Wanted you to expand a little bit on the gross margin, if you could. I mean, it sounds like you're kind of assuming that the momentum you experienced in November, and perhaps December, is going to carry forward. So can you give us a sense of -- I mean, November, December, are we already in between that 52% and 53% range? Kind of what drove the number perhaps up there? And to the extent that you may need to improve it further, what do you expect to do in 2013 to achieve that? I don't know if it's pricing getting better. How are you going to do that?","Willard D. Oberton","Well, there are several things we're working on, Holden, one is pushing fasteners harder, hopefully, get some help there. But another initiative that we've been working hard on for last few quarters is we've developed some new pricing systems for our stores. And although it's early, we've been seeing some positive results there, using better data on guiding the stores on where to price the product. And so we're working hard on that. We really believe that we're going to pick up some improved margins. I mentioned the vending, we're working very hard. We've actually installed a team within the vending group to work on underperforming machines. What we've identified in some of the vending areas is our -- we put a lot of pressure for people to sign these machines and sometimes, we didn't give the product away, but that's what it would almost look like. So we're going in and we're reconfiguring some of the machines with more profitable product. So there's several initiatives that we're working on. But as Dan stated, from October to December, we've seen a nice, steady uptick. And typically, December is the worst year -- month of the year for margin. I don't know why, but that's the way it always seems. This year, actually, was the exception to that. So it's all about focus, but the biggest piece would be the new system that we're working on at the store.","Holden Lewis - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And can you just comment, as my follow-up, on sort of the pricing environment? I think you alluded to perhaps some pressure in international markets. But what are you seeing in terms of just the core pricing in your domestic markets and maybe also just any discounting or anything like that you might be seeing in the market?","Willard D. Oberton","We haven't seen a lot of change in the markets, to be honest with you. The steel pricing has been soft, and that has not helped us. It's also part of the reason, I believe, our fastener sales are down because Asian steel prices have dropped. But otherwise, there has not been a lot of activity. We've had some of our suppliers coming in pushing price increases. We've been pretty successful on holding those off. There's not a lot of inflation, and there's not a lot of -- business is slow, so people are less likely to push pricing. Very, very kind of uneventful pricing environment. We just believe we have some opportunity to move it on our own. And we're not pushing a lot of price increase. We did do some selective price increases on some of the products, all non-fastener products. We didn't push fasteners at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","I have a couple of vending-related questions. I guess, first, on what are we seeing today on the vending adoption across the store base? And kind of what percentage of the stores are participating now? And maybe just your general thoughts on how that progresses for 2013.","Daniel L. Florness","Actually, right now, about 90% of our stores have at least one vending machine. And just north of 80% of our stores have put out a vending machine in the current year. But what reason we're bullish on vending is if you really get down to it and you look at where the machines are, it's still in a subset of our stores. We have a lot of stores out there that have one machine or 2 machines, but it's the subset that have really hit home with it. Will?","Willard D. Oberton","One thing that we did, Adam, because we're aware that we have a lot of opportunity in these underperforming stores, is the new vending incentives that we put into place. One of them is we introduced some new incentive to the managers that were -- did well last year, that hit a certain number last year. We are offering them an opportunity to make up to $3,500 to go down the street to a store that hasn't done as well in their area and sell up to 10 machines. So if they hit 10 machines, they get -- we send them a check for $3,500 and it racks [ph] itself from 5 to 10. So we think -- because what we've identified is those managers are the best salespeople we have in our company, the ones that are already doing it. So we're leveraging that talent. We also have taken the 70 people that we have driving around in vans, the vending vans, and we've changed their pay program. The stores in the top quartile of vending signings last year, they will only be paid 50% commission. We'll cut their commission in half on our best stores. The bottom half of our stores, we will double their commission, no, the bottom half. So 25% of the stores are going to get half commission, 50%, they're going to get double commission because what we know -- we know what happens is those salespeople are going to go where the rain is happening or where they can make money. And so they're going where we don't really need the help because those managers are so good. To identify this opportunity, we've adjusted the programs. It was all rolled out in early May -- or excuse me, in early December, and we're excited to watch how it happens. We've already gotten some good stories back on the manager, we call it the mentoring program, on that program where we -- managers' gone in and hit it in a couple days.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, got it. That's really helpful. I guess just tying it all together, Dan, you had mentioned that you're really bullish on the top line opportunity for the year, and the momentum on vending would suggest really strong growth. If the economy doesn't move from where we're at right now, any stabs in the dark of what you think you could do in revenue growth?","Daniel L. Florness","We just as a -- historically, don't go there because we just hate to try to predict what the economy is going to do. What I can tell is our sequential pattern, I think, tells a story, and I think we have a lot of growth drivers. If I look -- I always look at it and say, what are my plusses and what are my minuses from that historical benchmark period. One minus that you have to acknowledge is the fact we're opening fewer stores today than we were a decade ago. For that one minus, I have a handful of plusses. We have a vending initiative. We have international expansion. We have metalwork initiative. We have government initiative. We actually have a stronger manufacturer initiative. We have an OEM fastener initiative. And you start adding all those pieces up and you see what some of our initiatives did to buck the trend, if you will, in the non-fastener part of our business in 2012. It really tells me that we have like 10:1 positive to negative in our growth driver. Obviously, the first one, we are opening fewer stores, and that was evident in the past time frame when I'm using that benchmark. But I think all these other 10 more than offset it. So we think there's -- odds of beating that trend are greater than missing that trend line, and I think that speaks for itself on how that plays out for '13, and then the wildcard is that little thing called the economy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Barry of UBS.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Dan, that was great hearing you list all those growth drivers. I was curious which of them you think will contribute more to growth in 2013 than they did in 2012, i.e. which of them is actually accelerating?","Daniel L. Florness","Well, I think it's clearly the vending. And the real reason for that is there's a latency to it. We signed a lot of machines. We have a lot of machines in place at year end, relatively were at the end of last year. But most old machines, if you look at the machines rolled out in the last 3 months, they really haven't contributed that much in top line for the current year. If you look at the machines rolled out in the third quarter, they're just starting to get traction. And the ones from the first 6 months of the year gave us a half a year's worth of stuff. So you get a full year from the stuff in the first half, you get 4 quarter -- you get 3 additional quarters from the stuff in the third quarter, and you get 4 quarters from the stuff in the fourth quarter. You lob all those things together and that's a lot of inertia there.","Willard D. Oberton","I think the other reason vending is because of -- in the first quarter, it represented 7 -- the customers that play in it represented 17% of our revenue. That grew to more than 25%. If that trend were to continue by the fourth quarter of next year, we're up somewhere close to 40% -- or high-30s. And if we maintain a growth rate even close to where we are, that puts a lot of energy into our growth.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just to follow up on that, maybe 2 questions. One is the acceleration and signings where you think you'll see a commensurate acceleration in installs or maybe even a faster rate of installs; I thought there were some things you were doing to kind of reduce the time from signing to install. And then second is if you could just update us on what you're seeing in terms of the mix of the machines you're signing. Is each install still generating on average about $2,000 a month in that incremental business? Or is that mix changing at all?","Willard D. Oberton","On the installs, we actually slipped a little bit in the fourth quarter. Looking at it -- and January, I guess, will tell the story, but December really turned into about a 3-week month for installing machines because we didn't -- we got very little done in the holiday week. So if we can make that ground up, we're still going to -- we're going to be somewhere around that 90-day lag. We'd like to shorten that up, but we struggle with it. Part of the reason we're struggling with it is because the signings are growing at such a rapid pace. But if we can stay at 90 days, we'll be -- I mean, we'll be just fine there as long as we continue to sign the machines. Or if we can get it to 90 days and stay there. What was the second? I...","Daniel L. Florness","Well, why don't I get on the mix? One thing I did add to this quarter's release is, and I added it for a couple reasons, one to demonstrate the evolution of the business and the new models that we've introduced to our fleet of equipment, if you will. But if I go back to the first quarter of 2010, basically, all the machines we had out there were the helix, the FAST 5000, that standard helix-based machine. Today, that FAST 5000 represents just around 60% of our total installed base. We've introduced quite a few lockers and other machines into the fleet. And a lot of the -- if I have an install at a customer, it's not uncommon where the next machine would be a locker, to marry it up with the first machine. And so you're seeing a mix. I think a lot of the initial machines that go into customers will still be the FAST 5000, the helix-based machine, but you'll see a lot of them where they're sitting there in tandem.","Willard D. Oberton","Well, one of the things we introduced either late and -- probably late 2011 was a standalone locker. Before that, we had to have a helix. The computer and the helix drove the locker system. About a year ago, we introduced a locker that actually had its own controller. So that really increased that system because it could -- it's multifaceted. It offers -- creates a new opportunity for us to sell and them to buy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Luke Junk with Robert W. Baird.","Luke L. Junk - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Will, I was wondering if you could expand on the comments in the press release you're guiding, the steps you're taking to reinvigorate both the OEM fastener growth and also to address the underperforming locations. And then Dan, just conceptually, wondering how you're thinking about the October to January relationship this year, just considering the fact that, of course, we had the Sandy drag [ph] in October and we've got one fewer day in January here as well.","Willard D. Oberton","As far as the OEM fastener initiative, we put in -- we worked on this throughout the year, but in the middle of the year, we put in a small team, brought our leader from Europe back and put him in a position of driving OEM initiative. Basically, what he's done is they -- working in conjunction with our district managers, they've developed a list of more than 3,000 customers that have the potential to do north of $250,000 a year, and this is our estimate, $250,000 a year in OEM fasteners, the average being much higher than that. Each district manager has a list of anywhere from 8 to 15 of these customers, and these are customers that we do not have their OEM fastener business today. In many cases, we have a relationship but it's a smaller relationship. He's developing a system to -- so that they can -- it's really a call system that he's been working with them on to basically rail these customers in over a longer period of time, and we've seen some great results. We believe that the call, the sales call activity, is up by probably 4 or 5x with these people and these customers. And we believe with that, over the next, I'd say, the second half of 2013, we're going to see positive results. We've seen a lot of -- we're hearing a lot of positive results but not in the quantities that we need or the size of numbers that we need. But we're very optimistic about that. As I mentioned earlier, we're very good at providing fasteners. We're a good -- I believe, a very strong fastener distributor. But we weren't always good at selling all the things that we did but we're able to do. As far as the underperforming stores, that's been something we've been talking about since -- for a long time, and my board has been reminding me of that a couple of quarter -- a few quarters ago. And so we sat down as a leadership team and said we're going to take aggressive approach with this, just like we did with metalworking and vending and all these other things. We're going to create a budget, and then after we have the budget, we're going to create a team. And we developed a budget, how much we have -- working with Dan's group how much we could afford to spend on this. And then we assigned 2 proven leaders in our company, one to take the east -- well, actually, 3, one to take the east, one to take the west and one to take Canada. And they have put together a team of about, I think, it's about 35 to 40, I don't have an exact number.","Daniel L. Florness","38.","Willard D. Oberton","38, okay. 38 proven store managers, a couple district managers, and these people are going in just to the underperforming stores. One other thing we did is we added a -- Lee Hein added a direct report. First, a long-term employer is very good with statistics and understanding where we are with the numbers. And he is basically the scorekeeper and he runs the performance improvement program. So he runs the numbers. We have proven sales leaders in the field, leading groups of people going into these stores, the stores that this gentleman I -- Ryan Rosenberg is his name. Ryan identifies the stores just starting, as the year rolls out, very optimistic. The team of 38 people is in Winona for the first 3 days of this week. I was able to meet with them for quite some time. Had -- able to have dinner with the group and they're fire breathers. They're the A types that want to go out there. And so we're optimistic that we're going to -- are we going to solve all of our store problems? No. Are we going to show improvement? I'm very confident that we will.","Daniel L. Florness","Regarding the October to January sales trend, here's the way I thought about it and we're having discussions internally and in our meeting with the board yesterday. Typically, I'd look at October and I'd look out to the following January and I'd expect it to increase about 90 basis points. This year, September and October, there was some weird stuff going on with the calendar. October was impacted by the hurricane on the East Coast. And so I took a little bit of a different approach and I said instead of taking October, if I took September and October and I average the 2, and then I went off that, what does that mean for daily sales growth in January using the same type of 90 basis points step-up? That gets it to just under $13 million a day. I think it's $12.9 million and change a day in sales, which would imply a growth rate of just over 10% in the month of January. And that's where my head would have been, and the only thing that moved me away from that position would be, is there something going on that influences that? I can tell you the first week of January and typically, we don't go here but since you asked, the first week of January, that 3-day short week was a disaster. There were a lot of businesses that were shut down for that entire week. When we're calling around the different regional VPs and different district managers, they're just like, you know what, this customer, this customer -- they're rattling off their customers that are shut down, and so we got off to a horrible start in the month of January. And even that next week, we didn't really climb too much out of the hole. This week's going well and so I don't think we'll hit the 10% number, but I don't feel negative about February and March based on how January is going. We just had an awful start to the month because a lot of customers were shut down, but it seems to be running normal now. I don't know if Will wants to add anything to that, but...","Willard D. Oberton","Well, I think you hit it perfectly. Over a long period of time, it seems like the holidays continue to expand or the time people take off. We've always seen, in a slower economic time, factories look for reasons to shut down because it's good for the employees and good for the bottom line.","Luke L. Junk - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then just a follow-up on that, Will. Thanks for giving us an update on the growth in the metalworking and Government this quarter. I'm just curious if you have the numbers in front of you just on what those businesses are in addition to international as a percent of the total business here at year end.","Willard D. Oberton","The metalworking business represents -- for the year, it represented just over 8% of our revenue growing and so it -- I don't have the quarter, how it grew. And the Government business is right at 4%. So those 2 combined are 12%. You add international and you have about 22% of revenue.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Baliotti with Janney Montgomery Scott.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just had a couple housekeeping questions. I was wondering, could you just -- in terms of December, how many days were you open?","Daniel L. Florness","I believe it was 19 days.","Willard D. Oberton","Yes, it was 19 days. We took off the day before Christmas. We actually work pretty clean because it created a 4-day weekend there and then we were open the last day, the Monday after -- or Monday before New Year's.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you were close -- so you were only open -- the stores were only open 19 days?","Willard D. Oberton","19 days versus 21 in Q4.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. So then for December for this year, we're going to have 2 extra days, December '13?","Willard D. Oberton","I don't have it in front of me.","Daniel L. Florness","I don't even know off hand.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","All right. I have 21 days for December of '13. I just wanted to see if -- make sure we had the right number there. On the -- in terms of vending, is there a sense of -- or is there a way to characterize the number of installed machines, what -- kind of what percentage are loaded and revenue generating versus last year? Has that number increased?","Willard D. Oberton","Could you repeat the question?","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","The number of vending machines that you have installed, is there a metric to look at in terms of how many are loaded and revenue generating, kind of how that growth has been versus last year?","Willard D. Oberton","What we've seen ever since we started vending is if we sign a machine, it will take about 90 days to install it on the average. And then after it's been installed, it takes on the average about 90 days to generate the full revenue. And what that is -- when we talk to our managers and ask why that is, they say it's because, in most cases, the customers have inventory built up to be used to supply their plant, so there's a burn through of inventory. But as far as comparing it to last year, I would see no difference. We send them all of our inventory, but the customer has to sell off what they have before they start buying from us. And we assist them in that process because the faster we burn through it, the faster we create sales.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So basically it's about 180 days from signing until it's loaded and generating?","Willard D. Oberton","Well, before it's generating. It's loaded at about 90. It's fully generating at about 180.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the -- here's the last...","Willard D. Oberton","I was going say there's a range on that, but that's a good average.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Yes. Okay, great. And then just the last housekeeping, on the -- in terms of the stores, you gave us some expectations for this year. We're looking at about 65 to 80 stores. Are you expecting that to be a net number? Like, if you look at this year, you added 80, the net number is 67. Is that -- that 65 to 80, you look at that as a net for 2013?","Daniel L. Florness","Yes, I think -- I'm thinking of is what we're going to open, but I'm not anticipating much in the term of closing this year. We've been challenging our folks. One thing that I think is a healthy process for every company to go through all the time is to constantly look at your business and say -- and we're doing performance improvement program that Will just touched on. We're doing different things. We have a performance improvement program within our vending initiative of looking at all of our machines and -- well-performing machines, underperforming machines. You have to look at all your business, including your store locations, and sometimes you fish or cut bait.","Daniel L. Florness","Okay, looks like we're right on 9:45 and again, I want to thank everybody for participating in the call this quarter. And I hope you found the release to be informative as you look at our business. One item in closing, I sometimes try to find something to have for closing, I asked Russ Rubie, who heads up our vending initiative, if he had any odd locations that I could share with the folks on the call today where we have some of our vending equipment. He didn't come up with -- he came up with a few that I felt were worth noting of just places we put vending machines. I know in Western Canada, it sounds like we have a few machines that are underground in some mining operations and producing well. We also, down in Florida, have some vending machines that are physically located in sugarcane fields underneath a roof where folks working on the sugarcane fields can access equipment -- or supplies, excuse me. And we have quite a few in Northern California in some wineries. So I thought I'd share a few of those, the places vending machines can go. And so I think the future is bright for Fastenal and our vending opportunity.","Willard D. Oberton","And I'll add to that, we have many with office supplies. So if any of you need some in your offices, just give me a call, you have my number. Thank you very much for your support.","Daniel L.

Go ahead, Mr. Oberton.","Willard D. Oberton","","Thank you, Ellen. Thank you for everybody for joining us on the call this morning. To talk about the third quarter of 2014 overall we feel that we had a good quarter. Starting out with sales July was a little bit weak. We had a very good August and actually September was a good number. We had a very slow start after the holiday but once we got through the first four days we had a very good run rate, very much on pattern of what we would expect after historical numbers. ","On the margin I also believe we did a good job on the margin. There are a lot of gives and takes on the margin right now. We have customer mix, larger customers are growing faster. We have some product mix issues but the Fastenal growth continues to rebound and that\u2019s very positive. We also saw nice growth in our exclusive brands, which run at a much higher margin and going forward we have a lot of opportunity to improve the margin on our vending product through \"T\" hub and other things we are doing to source that product, lower our cost to package and lower our cost to serve the customers.","I think the most important thing to think about on margin though is a piece that Dan put in, talking about the margin in larger stores and the profit -- inherent profitability of those larger stores. As you put in there the stores with revenue north of 100 the two groups, one from 100 to 150, then 150 and above have a -- about 90 basis point lower margin than the company average. Bigger customers -- bigger stores bigger customers, that\u2019s really the story. But the most important part there is their operating profit is 350 basis points above the company.","So we are not as concerned about the absolute gross margin. We are concerned very much about the pretax and return on investment and we continue to make that point and that\u2019s why I am pounding it here today.","From an expense standpoint we did a good job. We didn\u2019t do a great job on that because I\u2019ll put it this way, we did a nice job considering the labor we added in the store, we would have expected little more leverage, we continue to add labor in the stores. Going forward we\u2019re in a very good position with store labor. We will continue to add labor in the stores at a rate of about 10% more hours which translates into about 5% or 6% higher labor cost plus commissions and things like that. ","So we are in a very good position labor wise and I believe our expense growth going forward will look much better. One area in particular that we did a nice job, kind of a shout out to team is the transportation. It\u2019s been a tough area right now -- excuse me transportation has been tough, trucks are hard to find, rates are going up but our team just did a great job in both the second and the third quarter. I am very proud of what they have been able to do.","Vending, very steady progress. We are happy with what\u2019s going on in vending. Our signings are basically have been steady all year. The best numbers are the numbers that give me the most -- I\u2019m the happiest about sorry are really the sales going through the customers that have vending. That growth -- the customers with vending grew at 21.9% and that represents 37.8% of our business. So very good progress, growing as a percentage of our business and vending in general, the overall business concept has a long pathway. We continue to see other ways we can use the technology. We continue to lower our cost of the product and lower our cost to serve the customer, very competitive. We believe it\u2019s a very long-term business for us.","On the inventory, working capital, inventory grew much lower than sales and thus we made nice progress there. Our supply team group is very focused on improving the service levels while at the same time reducing our days on hand. I spent a lot of time talking with that group recently and we believe we have a lot of opportunity over the next four to even eight to twelve quarters to continue to improve our service to our customers and at the same time reducing the working capital need of inventory, using new tools, new tools they are buying and just getting better at understanding how to use the inventory.","Overall, for the quarter I feel very good about where we are. We have good sequential growth going into 2015. We watch that very close. Our margin seems to be more stable than it was earlier in the year. Labor in the stores is at a good level, so we have added the labor. Our margin is stable. We have good sequential growth. If the economy stays steady we are in a very good position to see the benefits of pathway to profit in 2015. ","Before I turn over to Dan I apologize for stumbling. I was looking at the stock going down at the same time and I couldn\u2019t speak clearly. With that I will turn it over to Dan. He will cover some more things and then we will come back and answer questions. Thank you very much.","Daniel L. Florness","","Thank you, Will and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I\u2019ll reiterate the commentary; well we added some commentary in the quarterly release, I think much more explicit then we have been in the past and maybe that\u2019s remiss on my part. But on the page reference I am going to use are on my copy and if the version you print on the web is slightly different I apologize for that. ","But on one page one -- page two, we talked about gross margin and relative profitability, as Will touched on it a few minutes ago. And that takes me right to page 10 which is our pathway to our discussion on profit drivers of our business and really the pathway to profit. And some things that I think are worth pointing out on that table, one is and we have continued to make this point in both of these sections our profits and ability to leverage profits long term is above the top line growth and growing our average store size. ","We have said that for a number of years as relates to pathway to profit we\u2019re kind of -- to accentuate the feel of the components, the puts and takes in the math, both on the P&L as well as the working capital side, I think they are both important to talk about long term profit, growth, relative profitability and relative returns and we think we have amplifying effects for all.","Some things that I think probably jump out to you is the relative profitability decline in the different groups. And it really is stemming from four components, when I look at it; one, in comparison to both 2012 and 2013 our gross margins in those periods were 51.6 in 2012, third quarter I believe. Last year was 51.7, we are 50.8. So we have given up about 90 basis points of gross margin, that\u2019s one component when I look at that table.","Another component is, as we talked about last -- last year in the July and October calls we felt we were under investing in people, especially at the store level and so there was a little bit of under expense in those two periods when I look at those relative groups of stores and I believe we have corrected that and we have the appropriate staffing in our stores today to grow our business. ","Growing our business drives our average store size up because when you look at these tables yes, we gave up some relative profitability in the groups but look at the percentage of the stores that are now in the fourth and fifth group, 100 to 150 and 150 plus. The relative in the 100 to 150 has gone from 15%-16% one and two years ago, they are at 21%. The relative percentage of stores in the fifth group, over 150, is now at 17%. Last year was at 13% and change, two years ago was at 11% and change. That\u2019s what driving our overall profitability even giving up 90 basis points and adding people at a faster clip than we have done in each of the last two years, when I look at that third quarter timeframe. And I think those are important distinctions to make. ","The other distinction that I think is important that\u2019s often overlooked, I believe by many people, sometimes myself until you take a step back and you think about it, our relative expenses, if you look at our P&L over a number of years is a gross margin in the low 50s and operating expenses, 29%-30% kind of neighborhood and operating profit in the low-20s. ","And I think those are important things to sit back and think about, because when I think about a lot of companies, I look at in the industry, I am just talking about public companies, I am talking of private companies too, in the industry when I think about profitability within industrial distribution, I think about a number in the low double digits and I think about P&L that probably is gross margin in the lower half of the 40s. I think of operating expenses around 30%, maybe 29% maybe about our number and an operating profit in the low double digits and some of the better players in the industry, some of the better leveraged players in the industry starting to line up into the teens.","I think an important thing to ask yourself is Fastenal has an average store size of 107,000 which means that some time in our history, 20-30 years ago we figured out how to make money in a store doing $50,000 a month. There aren\u2019t too many players in the industry have done that. ","If you look at the average store size of most private and public players in the industry their average store size is a multiple of ours, eight, nine, ten times larger average store but the operating expenses really don\u2019t change appreciably. In fact they are in many cases when I look at them, they are at or slightly higher than ours, which always makes me scratch my head a little bit, of why the industry is so different. And maybe it\u2019s just a case of we developed a frugal nature 30 years ago and that frugal nature continues to shine through in our business and gives us just a structural delta to everybody else, I am not sure.","But I think it\u2019s something for people to think about, because it positions us long term with that structural advantage to keep going after the market, and to keep going after the market in a profitable way and with great returns. And speaking of going after the market and top line growth some things that always pop in my mind is it really gets down to a handful of things; our top line growth is above the existing market, it\u2019s big, the relative health of our existing market share, and that\u2019s had a tough couple of years for us. ","We talked a lot about what we saw in our Fastener business, what was going on with our large customers over the last several years, the fact that was stabilizing, improving slightly I think you see that in nice growth numbers or good growth numbers in our Fastener business. We grew about 10% this quarter and that\u2019s a big business and we are pretty excited about the improvements we have seen there. ","And then and then the growth in the average, in the available selling store energy, the fact that we have right-sized, we have corrected the headcount in our store and we\u2019re positioned really well going in 2015 and our trends year-to-date you look at our daily gains in overall business, in fastener business in non-fastener business are quite strong as we approach 2015. ","Some things, other things that jump out to me when I am going through the release and again I\u2019m using my page references, on top of page four, looks at our five-year stores what\u2019s happening to the growth in our five-year stores. We have had five months now of 10% plus growth. Look at the last three -- look at the three years on that table that never happened. I think we had five months in 2012 with 10 plus growth but they weren\u2019t consecutive. I don\u2019t believe we had any last year and so there are some [powerful] things going on because we have added the selling energy into our store and our large account business has stabilized, our heavy equipment manufacturers have stabilized and our inherent growth is shining through.","Page six, and I touched on this already, but our end markets and our product we are seeing improving trends there, both when you look at absolute year-over-year numbers but more importantly when you look at year-to-date numbers, where we will be January, where are we in September how we\u2019re trending, as we\u2019ve had said in the past, September and October tells us where we are start the New Year.","On page 12, you see the numbers and I am sorry headcount numbers, you see the number settling down now as we get in the third quarter because we are anniversarying where we started to add people post Labor Day last year. Gross margin we\u2019ve touched on that, I think pretty explicitly both in the early part of the document is well on page 13. ","The page 14, our SG&A. Probably the only thing that stands out for me there is, okay our labor count -- our labor expense is up because of the headcount we added and because there has been improvements in our profitability bonuses, in our profit sharing contributions, because of our of -- of what we are performing relative -- and that\u2019s more about the last several quarters, so much then the anniversarying. ","One thing that jumps out, our selling transportation is too high, as we\u2019re adding people we are adding, I believe some expenses there faster then we should and those are some things we are working on to correct right now, kind of rounding out the release. Our operating cash flow is okay. It\u2019s about operating cash is about two points lower than where I\u2019d care it to be but it\u2019s where that you won\u2019t get that comment out of me on a quarterly basis we are two points higher, and we bought back some stock in the third quarter. ","So year-to-date we bought some in the first quarter, we had previously disclosed we bought some in the third quarter and we increased our line of credit during the quarter to have some cash ready and available to buy -- to buyback those shares and potentially some more.","One item I\u2019d like to throw out there that I want to point out, our International business, we were particularly pleased with that business and by International we -- our U.S. and Canadian business are very homogenous businesses from the standpoint of our store footprint, the infrastructure in those countries and the amount of time we have been in those countries. ","So when I talk about the international, I\u2019m excluding the Canadian piece. I am just looking at south of the border, Europe, Asia business, very pleased with performance in that business. We grew our earnings more than 50% in that business, third quarter to third quarter, partly recovery, had some struggle a year ago but probably just some darn good performance and a good compliment to Steve Rucinski and his team in those businesses. ","With that I am going to turn it back over for some Q&A and as we have asked in previous quarters please limit yourself to one question with maybe a potential follow-up and we\u2019ll go from there. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company","Thanks, good morning everyone.","Willard D. Oberton","Good morning, Ryan.","Daniel L. Florness","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company","So I guess the big question here is how can we have confidence that gross margin stays near 51%, if the plan is for larger stores across your network, which larger stores had larger customers and the larger customer have lower gross margins?","Willard D. Oberton","Dan, I will give it to Dan.","Daniel L. Florness","Yes, first off as we cited, the stores that are north of that have a gross margin that is slightly lower. I think, Ryan it really gets back to what\u2019s our operating profit going to be and if I think if everybody who looks at the Fastenal business and looks at owning our stock and looks at owning our stock today and having that stock three years from now and five years from now. ","If you believe we can grow the business and we look out to a larger business some years into the future, and let\u2019s just say for discussion sake that the margin drops 40-50 basis points but the operating margin is at 23 or 24 because right now the one thing that I probably didn\u2019t touch on, sometimes I have learned to shut up when I should shut up is 23.7 for a 100 to 150, ","I would be lying if didn\u2019t say I was really disappointed in that number. I don\u2019t think that number should be below 24, I think it should more like 24.5. But would you own Fastenal organization, that larger organization in the future, because I believe it\u2019s going to grow and I believe our average -- and if it grows our average store size has to increase and would you -- the question you should ask yourself, would you own that company that looks a lot like that, even that disappointing number that we have in my mind today, would you own that business versus some other stock, I would.","Willard D. Oberton","Ryan, I think I know history doesn\u2019t always predict the future but if you -- we are focused on big stores margin going down but over the years we focused on company gets the bigger, the margin goes down. Fastenal mix drops, margin goes down. There is a long list of things I could address there but our margin has been around 51, as the center point for 25 years. And so a lot of it and Bob Kierlin always stated this, the number one thing that determines our margin is our branch pay programs or our incentive programs, not just at the branch but at all the levels and that continues to come true if you pay people to hit a goal, high percentage of time they would hit a goal. It\u2019s far more about that, than it is about product mix, customer mix or store size.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company","Okay, and then I guess my follow-up or second question, do you have an updated pathway to profit, average monthly store size to hit that 23% EBIT margin target? Is there an update there, I mean clearly it looks like it\u2019s higher than 110,000 a month.","Daniel L. Florness","Yes, I removed that paragraph and there was some discussion on whether I should or shouldn\u2019t and I looked and I said we have had that paragraph in there for years and I think the table removes the need for the paragraph and so I just finally decided get it out there and partly because I think there was always so much questions about 23, 23, 23% has never been a target. 23% is a point in time reference. I just cited a company in the future that has a 24% and but right now if you look at the table that 100 to 150 is at 23.7% and so I mean you could look at the -- I\u2019ll throw out some components. Right now the 2,647 stores that are in that table as you see in the next page represent about 87%-88% of our sales. ","If I look at the first five groups in that table, the ones where we have explicitly call out the percentages that subset represents about 80% of our sales, and the delta is in the strategic comps and oversea stores. So you know, I look at a number that\u2019s with the gross margin being lower then it was a year ago, it\u2019s not a 110, because we are at 107 right now for average store size ","Willard D. Oberton ","","But we are also not happy with where those numbers came out this quarter, Ryan. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that far off of the 110, somewhere in that range, 110 to 125 but it\u2019s really about point in time growing average store size.","Ryan Merkel - William Blair & Company","Okay, thanks guys.","Willard D. Oberton","You bet.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial","","Hey, guys good morning.","Willard D. Oberton","","Good morning, Robert.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial","","Will, I did just want to follow-up on that and clarify. I mean I understand that some of the targets could be a little bit soft at times but it does sound like versus last quarter your outlook for the profitability of your business has gone down. It sounds like both on the gross margin side and on the EBT margin side I mean is -- [that] involves interpretation?","Daniel L. Florness","","Yes. Yes. Our optimism about building the profits of the organization and our ability to grow profits has never been stronger. ","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial","I guess\u2026","Daniel L. Florness","We did -- we expanded the language around gross margin. If you went back to the transcripts from the second quarter call in July, I was very much expecting a call that would center on top line growth, top line growth, how do you get that top line growth, primarily because third quarter of a year ago we were in that July timeframe. Our growth was pretty anemic; our growth was more in line with the industry. And we had started to expand our growth. We felt there was great momentum to continue to expand our growth and I was frankly a little disappointed that the entire call was about 15 basis points, 20 basis points of gross margin and not about our ability to grow the business. ","And when I look at that table, that [path to the] profit table I -- it\u2019s so compelling about where we can move the profit of the business to, if we are growing and we grow our average store size and the discussion was getting lost in a few fixation points and I think the fixation should be how do we move deeper into that table? And why do we do and grow our top line and how does that happen? ","The market\u2019s big, what\u2019s the health of our existing market share and what are we doing to grow the business and I think that\u2019s where the headcount, the energy in the store really comes in to play and those are the three most important things.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial","You know\u2026","Willard D. Oberton","To get back to your question, you misinterpreted our report. We are very confident in our ability to be highly profitable.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial","","Yeah. I guess, just to clarify, I mean I guess I\u2019d agree with you about you know maybe there was too much focus on the gross margin but at the end of the day I think we need to measure the growth as well as the cost to engender that growth and as we move further down the income statement I mean I\u2019m more concerned I guess about what sounds like backing off the ability to get to the 23% EBP at the 110,000, then I am about the softer gross margin target because that does sound like there is some offset on the SG&A.","Unidentified Corporate Participant","","Let me jump in here. If you think about the 2007 I don\u2019t if you followed us then, when we came out with pathway to profit our 23% was -- goal was at a 125,000 a month. ","Daniel L. Florness","Halfway between the 150\u2026","Unidentified Corporate Participant","I think it was 125,000. In the interim when we got very tight with our expenses during the very tight recession of 2008 and \u20189 we lowered our base cost. We brought that down to 110. Now we are back to where we were at 2007, somewhere in the middle there and actually at 125. I think it will point to 23.7. ","So the difference between 110 and 125 and 22 and 23.7 to us is going to move around. It\u2019s an inexact thing but we believe we are going to go right by that number and be highly profitable and so we are not trying to back off the number. We are trying to not give so much information that our calls are completely dominated by, as Dan said 5 or 10 or 15 basis points in different categories.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial","Okay. So the message you want to leave with investors is that kind of over a period of time kind of big picture the targets are kind of roughly as they have been?","Willard D. Oberton","Absolutely.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial","In terms of your ability to raise profitability, yes as store size grows.","Willard D. Oberton","It\u2019s easy math, if we don\u2019t open many stores we grow our top line just say 15%, our average store size goes from here to here you can look at the chart put your finger down and get a good idea of what the leverage is.","Daniel L. Florness","And the average store, in that 100 to 150 category right now is the 123,000. That\u2019s the average store size if you actually run the math.","Willard D. Oberton","And we believe that should be about, we believe that group should be in the low 24% pretax not 23.7, that\u2019s where our head is. We need to move to the next question.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial","Yes, okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Flavio Campos with Credit Suisse. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Flavio S. Campos - Credit Suisse","Good morning, thank you for taking my questions. Just focusing on the selling personnel after you count it was flat in September and pretty much flat as well on the quarter, a little bit down. I was just wondering if that\u2019s just a seasonal thing because of the summer months and how do we go back, how do we go up to that 10% growth that you mentioned in the call?","Daniel L. Florness","There is always some flattening that occurs in the August-September time frame really August through the first half September timeframe. We have a fair -- one of the means in which we recruit is we strive to have a subset of our employee base be full time students either in a four year state college or a two year technical school, technical college. Because we find that if we have some part timers working for us that hit that type of demographic it\u2019s a great short term work force but probably more importantly it\u2019s a great long-term recruiting force. And so we recruit from that. ","There are certain times of the year you get some churn in that group or just some stalling in that group. When they are going back to school in August you see a little bit of a pause until they get their schedule worked out in August-September and you see a little drop off in some hours typically.","Willard D. Oberton","Because when we report numbers we are reporting FTEs.","Flavio S. Campos - Credit Suisse","Perfect, that\u2019s helpful. And just turning to margins for just one quick second, on Q4 generally we see a little bit of a drop seasonally. Just wonder if we are going to see that this year if you are expecting that this year as well or if this 50.8, that\u2019s kind of your expectation for Q4 as well?","Willard D. Oberton","We don\u2019t give guidance on the fourth quarter. I mean, Dan anything.","Daniel L. Florness","Yes, the only thing is the softness that we do sometimes seasonally get is related to, we have an extensive trucking network and that trucking network loses a little bit of leverage in the November-December timeframe. It can be amplified in a year like 2012 or 2013 or 2008 if there is something that\u2019s compounding that softness, but it\u2019s a little bit of noise and right now our trends on volume are good.","Flavio S. Campos - Credit Suisse","Perfect, that\u2019s helpful. I am going to jump back in queue and thank you for taking my questions.","Daniel L. Florness","You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird. Sir please go ahead.","David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Thanks, hi guys, good morning.","Willard D. Oberton","Good morning, Dave.","David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co.","First off, I realize that stores don\u2019t drive growth at Fastenal. It\u2019s the people but you closed 37 locations, I am just trying to get a read on that number and did those closures, do you think have any impact on September? And then to back it up and forget about the stores for a second, could you discuss your hiring plans as you look to 2015? Will, I think you mentioned 5% to 6% increase in labor cost, is that kind of a next year thought as well?","Willard D. Oberton","I\u2019ll take that part and then I will hand it to Lee for the store closings. Our thought is 10% more hours, a minimum of 10% more hours assuming our sales growth stays in the range it is, the teens. If we do that it will cost us about six percentage points higher labor and that is the plan for 2015. Well we\u2019ll move that up or down as if we grow faster we will add to it, if we grow slower that kind of that roughly add hours about 5% lower than our sales growth.","David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay.","Willard D. Oberton","And the other 5% come through productivity. Now I will give it to Lee on the stores.","Leland J. Hein","","Hey, David. On the store consolidation piece it really you got to get your arms around the fact they are small stores. We\u2019re highly aggressive as we open stores. So yeah, did we put some stores in markets that were fairly close, we really feel we are going to retain a good portion of the business, we have [homes] for our people, the markets are great and it was just a great strategic move for us but it\u2019s really about the consolidation and we are still committed to the markets in almost every case and even more so when you really think about going forward with the energy we are going to put it into some of these stores or move the business and it\u2019s just discipline at work at Fastenal and it\u2019s what we do.","Daniel L. Florness","And the store would not have impacted September any more than it would have impacted August, July, June or May because these things were in the works. And I think we cited in the second quarter release and I apologize if I am slightly off, but out of the 40 some stores we had identified I think they were eight that were more than ten miles from another store and when I looked at all the data we assumed less than 10% of the sales from all the stores we were closing would have some risk of being lost.","David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Got it, okay. And then just final question, you touched on \"T\" hub and it\u2019s been over a year since you started rolling that out. I am just wondering if you can talk to us about are we seeing the benefit today, what kind of tail is on this initiative?","Willard D. Oberton"," ","I don\u2019t have the stats, I stay very close to it, Dave, but I don\u2019t have the stats as far as how many parts we\u2019re shipping. I don\u2019t know if you do, Dan.","Daniel L. Florness","","I don\u2019t but I\u2026","Willard D. Oberton"," ","And I said in the second quarter call it has not ramped-up as quickly as we thought it would but it continuous to grow. We have a long tail on it from a -- probably the biggest, two biggest areas that we will pick-up benefit is gross margin because the product in \"T\" hub we are buying at very, very good prices; and the other is inventory turns because if we are buying it centrally the stores do not have to buy as much because if stores are buying a product on their own they might buy two or three months\u2019 supply to get the pricing. So the big advantage right now is we see our gross margin and inventory turns as also efficiency but that is probably not as big a saving. So we are very still very optimistic on moving that project forward.","Daniel L. Florness"," ","Just a couple of thoughts on it, end of July we had all of our stores that are going to be serviced by \"T\" hub, their point of sales system was converted over, such that they could turn parts on\/off on being serviced out of \"T\" hub and that ramp up really occurred in the June-July timeframe. So the steps that occur before and after that is aligning the parts that are being vended in the machines and optimizing the turning parts, so that you have an efficient redistribution plan. ","I always use the analogy if we have a soda machine in the warehouse and nine out of ten people want Mountain Dew and Mountain Dew is one of the six options, they are going to fill the Mountain Dew slot every day as opposed to maybe you need five out of the six be Mountain Dew or Diet Coke or whatever the case might be.","One tangible thing that I can point to that comes with \"T\" hub, Will touched on the gross margins, is we measure different pieces of our business and the one thing that did change is the percent of our sales going through vending, that are Fastenal brands went up by one percentage point from Q2 to Q3. And so we are seeing some tangible things there and for the suppliers of branded products that are in our \"T\" hub facility I would expect to see their business and we have seen their business grow commensurate because there is more of that activity going on.","David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Got it, great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Hi guys, good morning.","Willard D. Oberton","Hey Adam.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","I guess just to start with the Fastenal sales, you touched on it a little bit here but -- and we saw good acceleration in that. Could you talk about the visibility that you have into growing that chuck of the business, what are you hearing from customers and their production schedules versus new business that you brought into the fold and combined with that heavy manufacturing, there is a good deal of worry from investors like us from the impact from farmer equipment demand and oil and gas. So maybe you could help us understand your exposure to that as well.","Willard D. Oberton","It\u2019s hard for us to breakdown exactly where the Fastenal growth is coming from. The biggest part of it is machinery manufacturers. We have also had a very strong push with small customers. It\u2019s really about incentive programs at the stars, difference programs for bin stocks and just raising the awareness of Fastenal because it\u2019s kind of the other stuff is more fun to sell, branded products are just more to it. ","So I think it\u2019s about putting the energy in and continuing to work hard on just talking about the Fastenal. As far as the exposure, yeah I have been reading that too, some of the large farm equipment manufacturers are slowing down. I guess fortunately we don\u2019t have a lot of that business right now. We would like to have it but the timing is probably good that we don\u2019t. I guess our exposure really trends more with the overall manufacturing than any specific area of manufacturing, I mean whether it would be egg. We are light in egg on a big scale the [Dears and the CH Case and Holland], we are light in automotive. So there is less exposure in those areas but it\u2019s broad manufacturing base. I mean I think it\u2019s same exposure we see in all manufacturing. Does that help, it\u2019s a little bit difficult.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Yes, that\u2019s helpful, thank you. And then just somewhat related to that, if you think about your longer term growth drivers, can you talk about what you are seeing, what metalworking, government, e-commerce overall the growth rates and maybe how big they are now?","Willard D. Oberton","On the -- government continues to grow well, represents about 4% of our business. Metalworking has slowed a little bit still, are growing the company but slowed some, that\u2019s about just under 10% of our business. So it\u2019s about a $300 million business. We are working hard on that, trying to think about -- we talked about the vending earlier, fasteners you know those numbers. Safety is one that continues to do well, driven -- it\u2019s a great product -- through vending. We continue to see very good growth in the safety product line, some of them, trying to think ones that aren\u2019t doing as well, fasteners I guess is still doing well but it\u2019s still not keeping up with the company, so the other ones are outgrowing it.","Daniel L. Florness","One tip that I will throw in though on trends is year-to-date the last couple of years if I look at what our business was doing in \u201812 and \u201913, if I looked at January to September we are up about 12% on average, 12.5% in \u201812 and 11.5% in \u201913. We are up about 18% this year. Fasteners aren\u2019t far behind that 18%, so up about 17%. Last two years they were up 8% and 6% respectively and our non-fasteners are up about 19% to get our average of 18% and they were up about 16% the last two years. And so our vending business continues to help support our non-fasteners, more hours in the store support our non-fasteners. The marketplace as well as more energy in the stores is getting our fastener growing.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Okay, thank you.","Daniel L. Florness","Thanks Adam.","Willard D.

And I also want to welcome Holden to not only the earnings call, but to our organization as well. Holden has been here now for, I believe, about 5.5 weeks, so he is seasoned veteran at the Fastenal organization.","When we started 2016, we had a handful of expectations for the year. And I thought I\u2019d run through those expectations and talk a little bit how the year has played out relative to those expectations. First expectation for the year, we are going to open some stores. We hadn\u2019t opened much stores in recent years. We are going to open a few more stores and not a lot, but a few more because that is part of our long-term growth and it\u2019s about always exploring ways to grow in different markets. The second thing we were going to do is we are going to reinvigorate our store network. We talked about the CSP 16 at our Investor Day last November. Essentially, we injected about $75 million of inventory in our store network to be a better supplier, a more efficient supplier and a better same day supplier. And we are pretty good already, but let\u2019s get better.","Third item, let\u2019s reinvigorate our vending. We have created a wonderful vending business in the last 5 years. But in the last 2 years, we have lost some steam. In 2014 and 2015, we had \u2013 we were signing about 4,000 a quarter, so we had run-rates of about 16,000 a year and really saw there is a lot more potential there and our capabilities are strong and this naturally works with our store and onsite network. Let\u2019s go back to this more aggressively. The fourth, speaking of our onsite network, let\u2019s transition to an onsite mentality for growth. History says we will sign about 5 to 10 a year. In 2015, we have started a transition. We signed about 80. Could we sign 200 in 2016?","Five, our comps are going to ease in Q3 \u2013 sorry about that, folks. I am not sure where that came from. Our comps were going to ease a bit in Q3 would allow from mid single-digit growth in sales and it gives us a little more flexibility on what we could afford to spend as we approach the year. Let\u2019s focus on our growth drivers in 2016. Let\u2019s demonstrate to ourselves and others that we can grow in this environment. And let our regional vice presidents, our district manager group, our hub manager group, our support leads run their business. It\u2019s an incredibly talented group. They run an incredibly impressive business. Let them run it. Let\u2019s focus on our growth drivers.","And point 7, 8, 9 and 10, serve your customers, serve them everyday, improve their business and ours and be creative, we will grow. What are some of the realities of the year? We are opening some stores. We opened about 30 \u2013 we will have opened between 35 and 40 stores for the year. I think that\u2019s a good number for us in 2016. One item that changed on our stores is in May of 2016, the Department of Labor published some new rules regarding exempt employees. This rule, while it doesn\u2019t impact our company in totality, because it essentially raised the threshold of what qualifies as an exempt employee from \u2013 there is rules for duties that qualify you and there is also a rule for pay, and those rules were increased dramatically in 2016. Because of that change, it does impact our smaller stores, because in our smaller stores, we don\u2019t always compensate above that $48,000 level, because we have folks that are building a business and we are a sales minded organization, but the opportunity is huge. But as you all know from the years of us publishing our pathway to profit data, stores under $75,000 a month are not profitable \u2013 are marginally profitable and this damages that. And we decided to close some stores.","We moved fairly aggressively on it. We closed 65 stores in Q3. We have another 32 stores queued up to close in Q4 and we are also evaluating another group we are going to look at in 2017. But because of the close to 100 stores that we identified for closure, we did book up a reserve in the third quarter for those closures primarily related to the occupancy, but we move fairly quickly on it. These closures should have a minimum impact on our revenue similar to closures in the past because the stores have another \u2013 these locations have another store in reasonably close proximity. And as you know from previous conversations, the vast majority of our revenue is business-to-business, most of it going out our back door and we are delivering to the customer sites. So if we are serving a market with five stores versus four stores or three stores versus four stores doesn\u2019t necessarily change our ability to grow or our ability to maintain the business we have. And typically, we maintain 90-plus percent of the business when we close the store. But it did change a bit of our thought process as we have gone through the year just because of the changing landscape, the reality we live in. ","CSP 16, we moved aggressively on that early in the year. Our store conversion is largely behind us. We believe this broadens our ability as I mentioned earlier, be a better same-day supplier, appeal to a broader range of customers. We believe that ultimately this will help us as we go on in 2017 with our construction customers. But we believe it makes us the more efficient business.","On vending, our run rate has improved. We have been signing 4,700 to 4,800 per quarter instead of the closer to 4,000 we were doing the last 2 years. Right now, our run rate, if you just take that number and annualize it, it\u2019s about 19,000 run rate versus the 16,000 the last couple of years. This is okay, it\u2019s not great. We added 200 and some people earlier in the year to ramp this number up. That ramp has been moving a little bit slower than I would have liked. I would like the quarterly number to start with a five versus a four but we have improved it nicely. And I also have to acknowledge the fact that as you all know from previous calls, we signed a rather sizable vending leasing program earlier in the first half of the year and we have deployed in the last four months roughly 11,000 vending machines into that program. That\u2019s created a little bit of distraction to our program, but I would still like a number that starts with a five. But we have made nice progress.","Regarding the transition to onsite, I am frankly impressed with our team. We still have work to do, but I am impressed with the fact that we have signed 133 year-to-date. That put us on pace to do roughly 180. Our record year last year was 80. I believe we are creating momentum for our business into the future because the closer we get to the customer, whether that be with our store network, our vending platform or our onsite, history has demonstrated we take market share when we do that because we have a servant\u2019s heart within our organization. Our covenant with our customer, we will help you be a better business by being a great supplier, a great partner to you, and the onsite strategy only makes that better. And I am very pleased with the transition we are making and with that I expect us to continue making as we enter 2017.","Point five, the comps were easing in the third quarter and that will help us. Unfortunately, we are still stuck in that band of one to three. If you look at it from Q2 to Q3, our sales are treading water but there is two stories going on in there. Our fastener business continues to be weak. That business has been weak since the spring of 2015 and our fastener revenue dropped about $10 million from Q2 to Q3. Under the hood, our fastener margin improved nominally from Q2 to Q3. Under the hood, our non-fastener margin improved nominally from Q2 to Q3. We didn\u2019t execute that \u2013 we haven\u2019t been executing that well, in my opinion, in 2016 in general on our freight. Our propensity to charge freight has weakened in the last six quarters, seven quarters. Lower fuel prices and its part of the reason, discipline is the other, perhaps the marketplace is making it a little bit more challenging to charge freight. But there are still ample examples where we can charge it we are not and we need to be better at executing on that front. But the product margins under the hood again, we have mix going against us because the fastener business was down about $10 million. We continue to see us inching along and improving the relative gross margin on the components.","If sales are up 5% and \u2013 5% to 6% as we were expecting, the fact that our expenses are up a little bit above 5%, would be okay, wouldn\u2019t be great, but it would be okay. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the fact pattern and we are pulling some levers on expenses. One of those levers that we are pulling is to help offset some of DOL impacts as we go into 2017, to offset some of the investment impacts we made in 2016. The regulatory environment, well, you all watch the news, I am not sharing a secret here. It\u2019s not a great environment to do business in. But that\u2019s the world we live in and that\u2019s the world we need to contend with. And there is a lot of uncertainty. But the certainty I do know is that we have a great organization, a great group of people out there managing our business. And we are going to continue to focus on our growth drivers and we are going to continue to let our regional vice presidents, our district managers, our hub managers, our support leads run their respective groups. But we will need to be mindful of the environment we are in. It\u2019s a different earnings call for me this quarter and as the last couple of quarters have been in and that I don\u2019t have a bunch of spreadsheets set in front of me ready to answer any and every question, just talking about the business. And I am upbeat about our business as I look forward. There is a lot of good things from a momentum standpoint, but it was tough quarter.","With that, I will turn it over to Holden.","Holden Lewis","Great. Thank you, Dan. Yes, I will cover the numbers and try to give a little bit of color into what we saw that generated them. In terms of the revenues, total and daily sales in the third quarter were both up 1.8%. That\u2019s the third straight quarter where we have seen daily sales growth between that 1.5% and 2% range. We did like that the quarter finished in September with a daily sales rate up 2.8%. But as you all know, the comparison did get quite a bit easier and that\u2019s a pattern that\u2019s going to continue into the fourth quarter. Qualitatively, it\u2019s not clear to us that the tone changed much in the third quarter. We saw that the sales of fasteners into heavy manufacturing construction end markets were relatively weak as we have seen before. The same could be said of our largest customers. Our top 100 was flat to maybe down slightly during the period. But again, these are the same dynamics that have persisted throughout 2016.","If there was any incremental change, it may have been that the U.S. business grew a little less quickly while Canada and Mexico actually strengthened. But at the end of the day, it all blended in what we thought was a fairly consistent quarterly sales performance. This sluggishness does mask the progress we are making on our growth drivers. Dan alluded to some of this, but we did sign over 4,700 vending machines in the third quarter. Our total installed base rose by more than 2,000 units. We now have 60,000 \u2013 more than 60,000 in the field. That\u2019s a figure that does not include the machines that are related to our leased locker program, which is being rolled out as we expected it to be. We also signed 41 onsites in the third quarter. We are up to about 133 year-to-date. The SKUs related to our CSP 16 initiative are growing faster than the company as a whole. And we will provide some additional insights into the CSP 16 and onsite initiatives after the fourth quarter. But again, overall, we think that those initiatives are proceeding nicely.","In terms of gross profit, our gross margin was 49.3% in the third quarter. That\u2019s down 120 basis points annually and that\u2019s down 20 basis points versus last quarter. We have discussed the gross margin ramifications related to the relative growth of our non-fastener or large customer mix in the short and intermediate term and that dynamic was significant in the annual decline we saw this quarter. In particular, fasteners as you saw as a percentage of sales, that\u2019s down 180 basis points year-over-year to 36.1%. That does have an impact on our gross margin overall. There was also a factor in our modest sequential decline. But that said we were a bit disappointed that the gross margins slipped in the third quarter. We looked at the gross margin of the fastener and non-fastener categories. They remained stable. We did good work there. We don\u2019t believe that we saw any meaningful pressure within the product categories themselves. We did see higher freight costs this quarter. That relates to both the weak demand, also perhaps our own diligence around inventory levels during the quarter. But regardless, the freight was a significant contributor to the downward drift we saw in the sequential gross margin Q2 to Q3 of \u201816.","In terms of operating expenses, our operating margin was 20% in the quarter. That\u2019s down 210 basis points annually and down 60 basis points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our total headcount at the end of the third quarter was down 115 people. That decline was greater in our part-time labor. As a result, the full-time equivalent headcount was actually still up 1.4% in the quarter and that reflects both the Fasteners Inc. acquisition as well as the additions we made to vending and onsites. Sequentially, total headcount at the end of the third quarter was down 460 people. The full-time equivalent was down 4.8% and that just relates to what\u2019s become prudent headcount management given the sluggish demand environment and our efforts to prune some of our stores. We did see an increase in healthcare expenses in this quarter. However, overall, the employee-related expense as a percentage of sales, we thought were stable year-over-year and frankly improved slightly sequentially. Occupancy, expenses there were up both on an annual and sequential basis. This relates to three things. First and most significantly is the continued growth in our vending equipment. Revenues through our vending machines were still up almost 10% in the third quarter. That\u2019s well above our corporate growth, so we feel good about these investments. Secondly, we continue to invest in our distribution infrastructure, primarily related to automation initiatives we have had underway. We think that that will contribute to long-term productivity. And then third, in the third quarter the expense was also lifted due to the closing of those 65 stores. For those reasons in the short-term and given the current environment, occupancy expenses are certainly playing a material role in pushing down our near-term margin.","Cash flow generation, we generated $133 million in operating cash in the third quarter. That\u2019s down about 5% versus last year, really related just to lower income this period, but it does represent 105% of this quarter\u2019s net income, which is actually slightly better than last year. We did have a free cash deficit of about $27 million. That includes our having paid our dividend, but we also saw capital spending rise and that\u2019s simply a function of the lease locker program with Wal-Mart and sort of the costs related to that. We didn\u2019t buyback any shares in the period and we did add about $15 million in debt to finance the free cash shortfall.","Lastly on balance sheet, our total debt at the end of the third quarter is now about $445 million. That is up $130 million from the end of third quarter last year. On a net cash basis, our total debt now is 13.5% of total capital, up marginally from 10.2% in the same period a year ago. That rise is modest and it relates to the modest free cash generation we have had from lower earnings. The higher inventories we put out there due to CSP 16, some stock repurchase and of course, the payment of our dividend. We do view the balance sheet as being conservative to capitalize and we have ample liquidity to continue to invest in the business and pay our dividend.","In terms of working capital, this will be my last comment. We were comfortable with how the numbers shook out. The receivables came in at about 49.7 days. That is comparable to where it was a year ago. Inventories came in at 159.6, that\u2019s well ahead of where we were a year ago, but that was expected. It does reflect our infusing the CSP 16 products into the field, the acquisition of Fasteners, Inc., which will anniversary in November and the increase in onsite locations. But the annual increase in dollar inventories was 9.5%. That was \u2013 that did achieve our goal of keeping growth below 10%. So overall, we are comfortable with where the condition of our balance sheet is, given the effect of the significant growth investments that have impacted it. That\u2019s all I have and with that I will \u2013 we will turn over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Merkel","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Dan Florness","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Merkel","So first, can you talk a little bit more about September, which to me it looked like sales stabilized at a low level, but how did the month start and finish and I know you said that not much has changed with the end markets, but are you seeing any signs that the industrial economy is bottoming?","Dan Florness","I can\u2019t say that we are, Ryan. I can tell you that with the two weeks left in the month and I am looking at where I thought the momentum is going to finish and how it played out, there were no surprises in the last ten days, which says as much about our large account performance as it does our small account performance, just the dynamics of timing during the month. And \u2013 but I can\u2019t say that we saw any kind of inflection. Holden, I don\u2019t know if you have any comment to add to that.","Holden Lewis","Yes. And what I will say about that Ryan is when we look at sort of our customers by category or end market grouping, we didn\u2019t see a lot of changes in September. We might be lapping some of the issues around the energy side, but that would be one month in hand with that. We will see how that plays out through fourth quarter. But there may have been some indication on that in some of those customers. We probably saw a little bit of incremental weakness in the heavy-duty truck customers that we might have. But beyond those two items, there is not a lot more to add in terms of end markets. Regionally, we indicated the U.S. was a little bit weaker than the international. Some of that might simply reflect changes in currencies more than anything else. But there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of change beyond those fairly minor sort of differences in the quarter or in the month.","Ryan Merkel","Okay, fair enough. And you could see a little bit more evidence before you are willing to call it bottom, I understand. Then, moving to incremental margins, I think in the last call, Dan, you said that the new level was 20% to 25% just given the onsite business that\u2019s ramping, but what level of sales growth do you need in 2017 to get there?","Dan Florness","Well, if you look at our expense growth right now, we are running \u2013 and I am assuming in this discussion that gross margins, the drain that we have seen in the last five, six quarters moderates. Our fasteners as a percentage of our business moderate to a certain degree. And there is a better shine through of the revenue growth or maybe I could just answer to the context of gross profit or the growth we need. Right now, our operating expenses are up about 5% year-over-year. Some of that because of the investments we have made. We need to structurally lower that probably closer to 3.5% to 4%, so that at 3.5% and 4% revenue growth, we can let that shine through. Obviously, one thing that\u2019s inherent in our numbers right now is of the accordions that are within the \u2013 if you think of the cost structure of Fastenal, our incentive comp is at an incredibly low point right now. So, we would be very mindful of the structural expenses we are adding as we look into 2017 and \u201818, because we know there will be some expansion in that cost pool as we want the \u201817 and \u201818 and that\u2019s frankly a good thing. That was also \u2013 I am not going to paint the picture of the DOL rule changes were the only reason we closed some stores. They were recently moved pretty quickly, but we do need to be mindful some structural costs that we can remove from the business, especially in an environment where onsite is a bigger part of our growth driver going forward.","Ryan Merkel","So next year, you need mid single-digit top line maybe a little bit better to see some meaningful earnings leverage, is that fair?","Dan Florness","Yes, yes. I think it\u2019s also fair, Ryan, to suggest that coming into this year, we sort of took it for granted that we grow mid single-digits and plan to invest around that. I am not sure that we are making such \u2013 that we are making any such assumption about the go forward market given that we haven\u2019t seen any meaningful improvement in the markets. And so we are not necessarily going to assume that we are going to make those same investments for that same level of growth. We maybe prudent if we don\u2019t begin to see the revenue growth rates begin to tick up.","Ryan Merkel","Right, makes sense. Okay, thanks. I will pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","David Manthey","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Could you remind me the math on vending? You asked that customers have an incremental spend of about $2,000 a month I believe it is, is that a net goal after the reduction in usage of the products that are in the vending machine?","Dan Florness","Yes. And it does not \u2013 it does not need to be vending revenue and again that\u2019s based on the machine itself and different machines have different requirements. The FAST 5000, which is roughly, I think, 40% of our fleet, that\u2019s that $2,000 number. But for lockers, which have a lower cost basis than the FAST 5000, the number might be $1,200 or might be $1,000. That\u2019s why we have disclosed historically, we have talked about both our absolute device count, but then our weighted average count, because the weighted average is more akin to the $2,000 number.","David Manthey","Okay, got it. And if I recall your realized incremental revenues was something less than that $2,000, is that still the case?","Dan Florness","No, our realized historically, if you look at that as far as growth with those customers, that was realized, again, not all that through the machine, because our average machine runs closer to $1,100, $1,200 versus that $2,000. But we do achieve growth outside the machine and that\u2019s why you see our vending direct \u2013 our business with the vending machine continues to grow. And our non-fastener business, which \u2013 about 25% of our non-fastener business goes through a vending machine and that\u2019s why that business continues to grow mid single-digits in an environment where the peers in that business are contracting.","David Manthey","Okay. So what you are saying is that per weighted average machine, you are achieving $2,000 of total net growth, again yet realizing that\u2019s not just through the machine, that\u2019s all in for the customer, correct?","Dan Florness","Correct.","David Manthey","Okay, alright. Thank you for that. And then how much higher were your occupancy costs due to the closures in the current quarter. And then you mentioned the reserve for future closures that you took in the third quarter, I think you said it wasn\u2019t that meaningful, but could you just give us an idea of what that was?","Holden Lewis","I believe it was just over \u2013 just under $1.1 million that we booked during the quarter. And again what that is, once we make the \u2013 and this is the \u2013 Dan thrown his CFO hat on for a second, sorry, some habits are hard to kill. What you accrue when you are closing locations is you look at future expenses you will incur that do not have a future benefit. And so in the third quarter store closures, there is some real estate that we need to contend with. And in the fourth quarter locations, there are some real estate costs we will need to contend with and those we accrue a lot based on assumptions of similar closures in the past, but it\u2019s about $1.1 million.","David Manthey","Alright. And then final question on pricing, you have been seeing some pressure on the fasteners side recently, has that alleviated at all [indiscernible] fasteners, non-fasteners and then your outlook for 2017 on pricing?","Dan Florness","I don\u2019t know if we have an outlook, a generic outlook for fasteners and non-fasteners. My earlier comments were from Q2 to Q3, our gross margin on fasteners ticked up nominally. I look at that and say that probably should have occurred structurally just because some of the weakness usually occurs that we are seeing most acutely is in the OEM fasteners and so mix should be helping fasteners a little bit. So I would look at that and Holden characterized it as treading water. Our non-fasteners, we improved a little better than 20 basis points from Q2\u2026","David Manthey","Yes. But from a pricing standpoint, Dan?","Dan Florness","From a pricing standpoint, not much going on there Dave, that\u2019s \u2013 the non-fasteners is as much about us doing a better job of managing the mix.","David Manthey","Okay.","Dan Florness","To the extent Dave, that in prior quarters, there was any confidence from our people that there was a little bit of pricing pressure they were seeing on fasteners, I would say that the confidence is not as high that they are seeing that pressure at this point. So it was never huge on fasteners to begin with. And whether we are anniversarying it or what have you, it doesn\u2019t seem to be a big factor in what we saw this quarter. And again I think that\u2019s reflected in part by the fact that we had relatively stable margins on our \u2013 when you look at the category specifically.","David Manthey","Alright. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on the onsite business, maybe Dan if you could frame for us, how should we think about the ramp period associated with the new onsite store either in revenue per month or however you want to describe that, just trying to get a sense of how the onsite business ramps over time and against critical mass and I realize that would vary depending on the customer, but just any sense of that would be helpful?","Dan Florness","What we talked about a year ago, I will answer it in two components, we talked about a year ago was and what Chris talked as he had studied a lot of our existing onsites is that you could take a $20,000 or $30,000 a month relationship and grow it to $120,000 or $130,000, $150,000 relationship in 12 months to 24 months. We still believe that to be true. We have ramped so many, the 80 and then the ones we have signed this year, many of which we are turning on at different times last year and different times this year. In our earlier commentary, we talked about in January, given a little bit more insight what we have seen from this first group of 80 how we will have a calendar year under our belt and then what we are seeing in the new group coming in that have turned down as we have gone through the quarters. I just soon hold the answer to that for that point in times we will have more succinct data to share with you. What I can tell you is our assumptions initially we have not seen evidence that causes us to think that assumption should be different going forward.","Hamzah Mazari","Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up question, on the gross margin, anything you can quantify around freight and also the CSP 16 startup costs, just trying to get a sense of the margin degradation regarding those two items. It\u2019s not like margins coming in your expectation was probably flat to up slightly given some of the inventory you pulled out last quarter. Is that fair?","Dan Florness","Yes, that\u2019s a fair characterization of what we talked about in July. If you look at the CSP from a gross margin perspective, the stuff we were seeing earlier wasn\u2019t about CSP 16 so much. That was about \u2013 we were introducing some new tools into our business inventory by location and some other aspects like that and we were aggressively moving on some inventory from a clearance standpoint. The CSP 16, those \u2013 the margins on those projects are nicely above the company average. That has much to do about the mix of who that business is going to as it is about the actual products. Because in the CSP 16, there is a fairly strong mixture of tool categories etcetera that don\u2019t necessarily have higher gross margin, but the mix of customers is beneficial in that business. So, that CSP 16 has a positive influence overall to gross margin albeit relatively small impact on the relative dollars. In terms of the freight, I mean, our gross margin declined 20 basis points sequentially from Q2 to Q3. I think it\u2019s fair to suggest that freight was a significant piece of that 20 basis points, if not all of it.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. Very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Adam Uhlman","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Dan Florness","Good morning.","Adam Uhlman","Just sticking with that freight theme for a second here, we have talked about fuel and execution behind that. I am wondering if you are seeing any changes in how the market approaches freight, because obviously a lot of consumer markets, consumers expect free shipping. And so maybe you could talk about how much of your revenue base you already have free freight with certain customers and then maybe talk a little bit more about the pushback with the execution issues that you are seeing there?","Dan Florness","Well, two things going on here, Adam. One is if you think of our growth drivers both short-term and multiyear, our growth drivers lend themselves towards things that really don\u2019t have a freight component to them. Vending, there really isn\u2019t a freight component to vending, so that business, that growth, that $600 million plus business a year is freight free, because it\u2019s part of the offering we have. If you think of CSP 16 by placing it in the store, those products don\u2019t really lend themselves to having freight charged on them, whereas perhaps in the past some of that revenue again, that\u2019s a relatively small impact. One of the selling impacts or selling philosophies of the onsite is that we are by moving in onsite to your facilities, there are certain costs we can strip out. One of them is some of your working capital costs as we can stock that inventory because we are a more efficient supply chain. Some of that is because we are more orderly in what we are ordering in our visibility to when we see \u2013 we learn about transactions before they become quotes and purchase orders. And so we can be more efficient on how we manage our freight costs. So, those are structural changes over time that aren\u2019t necessarily detrimental in the true sense of the word.","I think one of the things that can happen when you are going through this environment of some of the structural changes don\u2019t necessarily have a freight component to them is that you can convince yourself that maybe the other pieces don\u2019t have as great propensity to have freight on them as they did in the past, maybe that piece of that is the tone of the leaders of the organization and I look at myself when I say that. Maybe I am not pushing it hard enough. But it\u2019s the case of, sometimes, you can convince yourself on why you can\u2019t do some stuff and you need to convince yourself on why you can, why you should. And I think that\u2019s probably the bigger culprit in this equation than the marketplace, because the marketplace doesn\u2019t change that abruptly to explain some of the degradation we had.","Adam Uhlman","Okay, thank you. And then if we could just switch gears back to the revenue growth trends, the non-res construction sales have been weaker sometime and I think Holden, you mentioned that we are starting to cycle against some of the oil and gas headwinds that we had last year. Maybe could we dig into that a little bit more deeply? What have you been seeing by region, any pickup in oil related customer growth recently? Thank you.","Holden Lewis","It would probably be premature to get particularly excited about what we are seeing. As I said in September, it looked like maybe a couple of our national accounts within that energy piece should begin to see some of their annual rates have changed become less severely negative, but they are still negative. And we will see how the next couple of months, couple \u2013 the next quarter plays out on that space. But I think that the real emphasis that we would make and I guess, this came about the question of bottoming. We are not seeing things getting a lot better. If those customers get better, it\u2019s because the comps are getting easier. Maybe we will be pleasantly surprised and demand will actually improve from here going forward. But it\u2019s a little bit early to make any such declaration in any of those markets.","Dan Florness","I will throw one comment and I had the opportunity early last week to reach out to our regional leader in the Gulf Coast. Steve and his team have gone through a pretty ugly period in the last 1 year, 1.5 years. And that business grew in September. And it was fun making that call and congratulating them because I know from a first hand basis some of the discussions I personally had with them as well as other individuals in that business unit, they have had a really ugly period and I was really happy for them to see their business grow in the month of September.","Adam Uhlman","That\u2019s good to hear. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Sam Darkatsh","Good morning Dan, good morning Holden, how are you?","Dan Florness","Good. Good morning Sam. Thank you. Good morning.","Sam Darkatsh","Couple of questions here, first off, related to back to vending, the spread between the growth in vending customers and non-vending customers is obviously pretty tight right now, I am trying to think about what factors might occur that would create that spread to re-widen in vending\u2019s favor especially with your thoughts Dan that you think the fastener business ultimately for you stabilizes from here?","Dan Florness","We had quite a few vending machines that have been running negative and vending relationships that have been running negative. And I asked our team to take a look at this group of vending machines. And it\u2019s a sizable group of vending machines, so population if you look at and you can actually glean some knowledge from it. We took a good hard look at it and what we saw \u2013 because one thing \u2013 one visibility we have into our customers\u2019 business that we have never had before is the insight into how many unique people are using the device. If there is 100 employees that are in this customer\u2019s facility, you know that because those 100 people are in the database are people that can use the vending platform and it also \u2013 of those 100 people can get these products versus those products. If I am in the welding area, I have access to the welding tips. But if I am not in the welding area, I don\u2019t have access to those six buttons, if you will and \u2013 or those six products. And one thing that jumped out for us where we had vending machines that were negative and again, it was a sizable number is the number of employees on the database right now versus a year ago had dropped. And that group, the number of employees had dropped about 10%. And I don\u2019t recall offhand how many customer locations this included but that tells me we have a bunch of customers and our fastener business was negative with those customers. We have a bunch of customers who had downsized some operations, maybe they have fewer shifts maybe they have fewer people per shift, but they have downsized in this group about 10% actual headcount. And we were seeing in those machines revenue down in the teens. So that\u2019s the case that there was some serious belt-tightening going on. But there was just a drop in consumption because there was a drop in the workload at that business. And that\u2019s \u2013 the economics are such that if there is fewer employees from a year ago, they need fewer safety glasses and gloves and new consumables that go with having people.","Sam Darkatsh","Interesting. A couple of more quick questions if I could. What would prompt the resumption of the share repo activity is it just a matter of once you no longer require the capital for the Walmart initiative or is it something else?","Dan Florness","I don\u2019t know if we know the answer to that right now, Sam. One of the \u2013 personally, one of the advantages of bringing in somebody like Holden into the organization is the perspective of Fastenal has historically been we are boringly conservative Midwesterners and we tend to look at the business probably not as financially as still as we should and that\u2019s probably a reflection of the old CFO. I like the fact that we have a voice at the table that is going to challenge us to think about our business differently. The fact that think about our working capital, think about our capital structure just think about the business, in general, little bit differently, it doesn\u2019t mean we are going to change suddenly on our appetite for doing different things, because we have changed our appetite in that over the last 2 years. But we have been \u2013 as you see from the numbers we have been pretty quiet on the buyback and I don\u2019t know that, that will change in the next few months.","Holden Lewis","When the decision was originally made, part of it was simply the capital structure had been so under \u2013 so overly conservative, if you will. At this point with 13% debt-to-cap is certainly not a lot, there was plenty of room to go higher should we choose to do so, but at the same time, we do in fact have debt at this point. So, the same urgency to address our capital structure isn\u2019t quite where it might have been originally and so there maybe reasons to buyback stock in the near to intermediate term, but there is no urgency to do so.","Sam Darkatsh","And then the last question...","Dan Florness","Sam, I will have to take that one offline. I see we are at 45 minutes past the hour and we have always religiously held to the 45-minute conference call. I realized it\u2019s the start of earnings season and everybody has a lot of demands on their time. I want to close the call by thanking everybody for your interest in the Fastenal organization and learning a little bit about our quarter and about our growth drivers. I am as excited about the opportunities for our business as I was a year ago as I was 5 years ago and really feel we have begun taking two nice steps, 2015 and 2016, into transitioning to an onsite mentality for growth. And I am excited about what that means for our future. Thank you everybody and have a good day.","Holden Lewis","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."]}}
