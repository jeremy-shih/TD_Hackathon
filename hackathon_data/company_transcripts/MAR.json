At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","Before we get started, I'd like to thank Carl Berquist for his outstanding financial leadership over the last 14 years. During his tenure as CFO at Marriott, we announced the Starwood deal, acquired AC Hotels, Gaylord, Protea, and Delta, and created considerable value by spinning off our timeshare business. Further, he bought back nearly 150 million shares of stock at an average price of $47. He brought us through the tough times in 2009 and 2010 and like many of you, Carl remains a Marriott shareholder. Thank you, Carl, for everything.","I'd also like to welcome Leeny Oberg to the CFO position. Also a great leader, Leeny brings a wealth of Marriott experience including project finance, international finance, corporate financial planning and most recently CFO of our Ritz-Carlton organization. She started her career in banking and her Marriott career in Investor Relations, so I know she well understands the Street.","As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed and\/or implied by our comments.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, February 18, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","To begin, the biggest Marriott news in 2015 was our announced acquisition of Starwood. The transaction is on track and we expect to close around midyear 2016. The S-4 went effective yesterday. We expect a proxy solicitation will be mailed to shareholders of both companies on or about February 19 to stockholders of record as of February 2. And the special shareholder meetings for both Marriott and Starwood are scheduled for March 28. We are seeking government approval for the transaction in multiple jurisdictions. Starwood's timeshare spinoff and merger with ILG is proceeding on schedule and we do not expect this transaction to delay our acquisition of Starwood.","While we are on track, Marriott and Starwood are still separate public companies and are limited in the information we may share with each other and you. So our discussions today about RevPAR, booking pace, pipeline, unit growth, EPS guidance and so forth are for the Marriott business only and do not reflect the impact of the acquisition. Like you, we eagerly await this afternoon's comments from Starwood about their business trends.","So let's get started. Attendance at ALIS Conference in L.A. this year was a bit light due to the deluge of East Coast snow but there was still a lot of conversation at the conference. And the number one topic was the disconnect between stock performance and hotel fundamentals. Let's start with two facts about this business. First, it is cyclical with demand highly correlated to GDP growth, capital investment and the employment. Second, it has seasonality and can be sensitive to holidays, group bookings and special events. In any given quarter, it's sometimes difficult to see which of these aspects of the business are most impactful.","This was true in the fourth quarter. System-wide North America RevPAR grew 5% in October, roughly 4% in November and just under 3% in December. We believe it was the modest growth in GDP in the fourth quarter that constrained our transient business particularly premium rated business. As we typically have little group business during the holiday season, we turn to price sensitive travelers, opening discounts for AAA members, seniors and others. As a result, our fourth quarter occupancy still reached near record levels, although room rates were modestly weaker than anticipated.","Other factors also came into play. In Houston, system-wide RevPAR declined 8% in the quarter reflecting weakness in the energy sector. While occupancy in our New York hotels remained very strong at 88%, our RevPAR growth in New York declined 1% as new supply constrained pricing. In San Francisco, RevPAR growth moderated from earlier in the year rising only 6% in the quarter as high prices detoured guests to more affordable destinations like Los Angeles where RevPAR saw a double digit increase.","Make no mistake, business travelers are on the road. While the energy and manufacturing sectors were weak in the quarter, we saw significant strength in technology, professional services, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, automotive and media. In fact, room sales from our nearly 300 largest corporate customers increased 4% in the fourth quarter, 7% excluding energy and manufacturing companies.","And near-term transient trends in North America are improving. System-wide total transient revenue increased roughly 2% in December and nearly 2.5% in a very snowy January. For February, transient revenue on the books is up nearly 4% to date. For the full year, our special corporate customers tell us they expect to travel at least as much in 2016 as in 2015. And with special corporate negotiations nearly complete, we expect special corporate pricing to increase at a mid-single digit rate in 2016.","Group business is even stronger. North American group revenue in the fourth quarter increased 6%, and attendance at meetings exceeded expectations. Catering revenue also increased 6% with considerable last minute food and beverage upgrades. New group business booked in the fourth quarter for any period in the future increased 10% year-over-year. Group revenue booking pace for the first quarter of 2016 is up 2%, reflecting the shift in timing of Easter year-over-year.","Not surprisingly, the second quarter is much stronger with revenue pace up 9%. For the full year 2016, group revenue booking pace is up 7%. Incidentally, with very high occupancy rates and limited hotel meeting space, groups are booking earlier. Group revenue booking pace for 2017 is up 8%, while 2018 is up 9%.","So what does this mean for RevPAR guidance? With the tough Easter comparison, we expect 2% to 4% RevPAR growth in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect North American RevPAR growth at the upper end of 3% to 5%. Our full-year outlook is tempered a bit from our October view due to incremental weakness in the energy and manufacturing sectors and a modestly lower GDP growth assumption for 2016.","Elsewhere in the world, economies in Italy and Spain are recovering nicely, while German economic growth has cooled with fewer exports to China. Despite Russia's ongoing recession, we saw higher domestic demand in our hotels in Moscow in the fourth quarter. Security concerns continue to weigh on demand in Paris and Brussels and to a lesser extent in London. In 2015, Europe represented 7% of our worldwide fee revenue. For 2016, we expect Europe's RevPAR to increase at a low single-digit rate.","In the Middle East and Africa, RevPAR declined in the fourth quarter due to security concerns, low oil prices, and Dubai oversupply. For 2016, we are modeling low single digit RevPAR growth, as expected infrastructure investment in UAE and Qatar, economic growth in Africa, and easing comparison in Egypt should improve results late in the year. In 2015, the Middle East and Africa represented 3% of our worldwide fee revenue.","In the Asia-Pacific region, China's economic growth moderated in 2015, yet mainland China RevPAR still rose roughly 4% in the fourth quarter. Chinese consumers continue to spend. In fact, international travel from Mainland China to our hotels in other markets increased 31%. In India, the improving economy drove RevPAR up 12%. In 2015 the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 8% of our worldwide fee revenue. For 2016, we expect the Asia-Pacific region will continue to grow RevPAR at a mid-single-digit rate, with continued strength in India, Japan, and Thailand.","In the Caribbean and Latin America region, solid economic growth in Mexico is driving both RevPAR and hotel expansion, while the Caribbean remains an attractive venue for groups and an appealing warm weather playground for tourists, particularly after they dig out from under two feet of snow. We have seen a few cancellations due to the Zika virus and are watching this carefully. Hotels in affected areas are fogging outdoor areas, providing mosquito repellent for guests, and dealing with areas of standing water. While Brazil remains in recession, we are hopeful that the summer Olympics will lift RevPAR in that market in 2016. For the full year, we expect RevPAR will grow at a mid-single-digit rate in the Caribbean and Latin America. In 2015, the region accounted for 4% of our worldwide fee revenue.","All in all, we believe our worldwide system-wide RevPAR will grow at 3% to 5% for the year.","Our system grew by nearly 52,000 rooms in 2015, 11,000 in the fourth quarter alone, taking our system to nearly 760,000 rooms worldwide. New owner and franchisee signings in 2015 reached a record 104,000 rooms, taking our development pipeline to more than 270,000 rooms, another new high. Our brands continue to be preferred by hotel developers. According to STR, at year-end 2015, 27% of hotels under construction in North America were affiliated with one of Marriott brands, more than any other hotel company.","Outside North America, in recent years we've enhanced growth and increased speed to market by decentralizing decision-making, tailoring brands to local market tastes, and building relationships with local partners to drive development. This has really made a difference to our limited service brands. In fact, in the past five years our limited service portfolio outside North America has more than tripled to 316 hotels, with another 250 hotels in the development pipeline.","Consistent with this strategy, yesterday we announced a long-term agreement with Eastern Crown Hotels Group for development of Fairfield hotels in China. Demand for economy-tier lodging has grown rapidly in China in a relatively short period of time, as the middle class has rapidly expanded. Eastern Crown is targeting 140 signed deals over five years, including 100 Fairfield hotels expected to open by 2021.","Worldwide with our strong brands and deep development pipeline, in 2016 we expect our rooms will increase by roughly 7% net of deletions. While not included in our growth targets, nevertheless we expect our worldwide system will take a significant leap forward with the completion of the Starwood acquisition. This transaction will expand our presence around the world, broaden our appeal to younger travelers, and increase the growth opportunities for Starwood's valuable brands. In addition, the combination of Starwood's leading lifestyle brands with Marriott's strong presence across the select service and luxury tiers as well as our convention and resort segment will create a very attractive portfolio that should be more appealing to guests and meeting planners, and thus more appealing to owners and franchisees as well.","We believe the transaction offers meaningful opportunities for shareholders, hotel owners, and hotel franchisees through enhanced growth and improved efficiency. We expect to accelerate the growth of Starwood's brands by leveraging our hotel development expertise and strong relationships. We continue to estimate that we will achieve annual run rate synergies of at least $200 million by the second full year after closing. Excluding transition and transaction costs, we continue to expect the transaction will be EPS accretive in the second full year after closing.","We know you have many questions about our brand strategies, integration plans, and specific efficiency opportunities. We don't have answers for you today and ask for your patience as we work through these decisions and plans. We believe this transaction will create substantial value for Marriott and Starwood shareholders and look forward to working aggressively towards its completion.","In Marriott's history, there have been a few profound decisions that changed the company's course and launched us to greater success. In 1979, we sold our first portfolio of owned hotels and became hotel managers. In 1993, we created Host Hotels, further reducing our real estate focus and stepping up franchising. We became a pure-play lodging company just five years ago with the spinoff of our timeshare business. We believe this acquisition is as significant. It will make us the largest hotel company in the world, focused solely on management and franchising, with a very strong portfolio of great brands, powerful loyalty programs, and terrific prospects for the future.","Now to provide more information about the fourth quarter and our 2016 outlook, let me turn things over to Leeny. Leeny?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, Arne.","Marriott is known for its quality brand portfolio and asset-light business model. For those of you who have followed us for a while, you also know we're serious about transparent disclosures and delivering high returns to shareholders. While the Starwood transaction will do much to change Marriott, it won't change those commitments. I'm looking forward to getting to know as many of you as possible in the coming months.","So let's look at the results. 2015 was a great year. Worldwide system-wide RevPAR rose 5% on a constant dollar basis. Total fee revenue reached $1.9 billion, constrained by about $32 million of foreign exchange. Incentive fees in North America increased 18%, largely due to strong performance at our limited service hotels and our California and Florida resorts.","For the full year 2015, the percentage of North American hotels paying incentive fees increased from 36% to 63%. The increase in the number of hotels paying fees was largely due to three portfolios of limited service hotels that earned $7 million in incentive fees in the full year 2015 and are expected to earn higher incentive fees amounts in 2016. Incentive fees from our international hotels declined during the year, primarily due to $15 million of foreign exchange headwinds. In the fourth quarter, worldwide system-wide RevPAR rose 4% on a constant dollar basis and 2% on an actual dollar basis. Total fee revenue in the quarter increased 6%, constrained by $12 million of foreign exchange.","Our hotels did an outstanding job in the fourth quarter, as they focused on the bottom line. House profit margins at company-operated hotels increased 90 basis points in North America and 70 basis points worldwide. House profit per available room rose faster than RevPAR, up 9% in North America and 7% worldwide. Fourth quarter incentive fees in North America increased 20% to $33 million, with particular strength in full-service hotels in Florida and Washington DC. Incentive fees in international markets declined 12% in the quarter, reflecting tough foreign exchange comparisons and a few weak markets in the Middle East and Latin America.","Owned, leased, and other revenue declined 7% in the quarter largely due to weaker revenue growth at a hotel under renovation and unfavorable foreign exchange. Net of expenses, owned, leased and other increased 4% in the fourth quarter due to higher termination fees and lower preopening expenses.","General and administrative expenses increased 4% in the quarter reflecting $5 million in transaction costs associated with the Starwood acquisition and higher net hotel development costs. We received $62 million in cash in the fourth quarter for our St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton hotel. For the full year 2015, we recycled nearly $950 million from asset sales, investment redemptions and note collection.","Our fourth quarter tax rate was lower than expected, largely due to the St. Thomas transaction and a favorable IRS settlement. We expect our book tax rate to be roughly 32.3% in 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, our 2% to 4% expected RevPAR growth and continued unit expansion should yield $475 million to $485 million in fee revenue. We're expecting $13 million in lower relicensing fees for the quarter versus last year.","Owned, leased, and other revenue net of expenses should be flattish in the first quarter due to tough comparisons to last year. As I mentioned, we recently sold the St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton. As an owned hotel in its seasonally strong first quarter of 2015, the property earned nearly $6 million. First quarter G&A should total roughly $160 million. We still have a tough comparison to $13 million in favorable litigation settlements in the prior year. Our G&A estimate does not include Starwood acquisition related expenses. All in all, we expect EPS for the first quarter will total $0.81 to $0.85.","For the full year with 3% to 5% worldwide RevPAR growth and roughly 7% net unit growth, we expect fee revenue will increase 79% to reach roughly $2 billion. We expect roughly $30 million negative FX impact on year-over-year fee revenue growth in 2016. Even including FX impact, we expect incentive fees will increase at a 10% to 15% growth rate with continued strength in North America.","We expect full-year owned, leased and other, net of direct expenses, will increase roughly 20%, reflecting the impact of completed hotel renovations and higher branding fees from residential sales as several projects should begin sales during the year. Further, we expect higher credit card branding fees with growth in new accounts and cardholder sales. We expect general and administrative costs will increase 3% to 4% in 2016, a 3% to 4% decline on a per-room basis.","Net interest expense should increase to roughly $160 million, reflecting both higher borrowings and higher interest income. All combined, we expect 2016 fully diluted EPS will total $3.69 to $3.86, an increase of 17% to 23%. Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 should grow 10% to 14%. We understand there are a variety of opinions about likely economic growth. Our 2016 outlook assumes roughly 2.5% growth in U.S. GDP. For those of you with more bearish economic views, we believe that flat U.S. GDP would still likely yield roughly 2% RevPAR growth at our hotels in North America given today's supply environment.","Given our significant management and franchise business, we expect this scenario would still yield mid-teens 2016 EPS growth and high single digit adjusted EBITDA growth. Remember, our guidance excludes the pending Starwood acquisition. We expect the P&L impact of Starwood will be very noisy in 2016 due to the transition and transaction costs. We will provide more information about the transaction during the second quarter earnings call.","Investment spending in 2016 should total $450 million to $550 million, including about $100 million in maintenance CapEx spending. With few owned assets remaining, we expect asset sales and loan repayments will total roughly $200 million to $250 million. Our business strategy enables us to grow rapidly in a strong market and continue to deliver attractive returns in a weaker one. Compared to 2007, today we have 40% more rooms in our system worldwide. Our development pipeline is deeper. Our cash flow is less volatile. We are out of the timeshare business, and while we still earn attractive incentive fees, those fees represented only 17% of fee revenue in 2015 compared to 26% in 2007.","Today, we estimate that a one-point change in our RevPAR outlook across our system for the full year 2016, assuming it was evenly distributed, would be worth about $25 million in fees and roughly $3 million of owned, leased and other net. Even after completion of the Starwood transaction, we intend to remain a solid investment-grade company with strong access to capital markets. We will be out of the market until after the special shareholders meetings, but expect to resume share repurchases as soon as possible thereafter. In fact, we expect to return more than $2 billion to shareholders in 2016 through share repurchases and dividends just from our legacy Marriott business. With the Starwood transaction, returns to shareholders could be meaningfully higher.","As we approach the integration of Marriott and Starwood, we've identified a few guiding principles. We will continue to put people first. This is our cultural touchstone because taking care of associates enables them to take care of the guests. We recognize customer service is the foundation of every lodging brand and RevPAR premiums. Throughout the integration process, we intend to drive results for owners and franchisees to help enhance the value of their hotel investment. For shareholders, we will continue to look for ways to leverage the scale and opportunities from this transaction, to drive value beyond the base case synergies we've outlined for you, and we intend to do all of this as quickly as possible.","We appreciate your interest in Marriott. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","Laurie, we'll take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. I do have questions on the deal but I know that you probably wouldn't be able to answer, so I'm going to stick to asking about your incentive management fees. Just looking at the percent of properties paying and I know that the full year number is more relevant than just the percent that we're paying in Q4. You're above your previous peak, and as is your RevPAR, and I guess your international mix. Do you have a view on where that may go to across the range of your RevPAR guidance in 2016?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","I think next year you could expect the percentage of hotels earning incentive fees to go up a few more percentage points. Not a whole lot more than that. There is obviously some seasonal variety, depending on whether it's first quarter or fourth quarter in terms of how we recognize incentive fees, but I would expect that it could go up slightly next year.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","And then just to follow up to that, I guess in terms of the actual dollar amount, because you had a big increase in terms of percent of properties paying. But the dollar fees, the Q4 decline, part of that was related to FX which I guess on a year-over-year basis may not be as big of a negative in 2016. But how would you expect in terms of dollar amounts it will correlate to that kind of increase in properties?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","I think next year, you could look to our incentive fees getting hopefully back up close to where our peak was in 2007. So, the guidance that would be at the top end of the range, if that's where we hit. But I think broadly the 10% to 16% increase of the guidance that we've given does take into consideration some FX impact, but largely represents the fact of a few more percentage points of hotels earning incentive fees.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","And again, I will say North America is the biggest driver of this bus in 2016. You're going to see really strong incentive growth from the North American properties.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. And, Carl, best wishes.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Good morning, Harry.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","And welcome, Leeny.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Thank you, Harry.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So if you guys could, talk about the challenges that you face integrating the two companies and their systems. We're getting several questions about going back to the Ryman acquisition. I guess the question really is, what are you doing to be as thorough as you can so that you avoid some of the pitfalls?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","It's a good question. I think we are hopefully learning from the experiences we've had in the past few years. You can, to some extent, look at the Gaylord acquisition and the Protea and Delta acquisitions as warm-up acts for this, I suppose. And hopefully, we're getting better at it.","Now at the same time, obviously, Starwood is a much bigger deal than any of those were, which presents some positive differences and then some greater challenges. I think on the positive side, Starwood is hopefully less distracted by the process of the sale of the company. And you've got a big talented group of folks over there running 350,000 rooms or so. But I know the Starwood team, with our encouragement, is very much focused on continuing to drive sales and to drive the development engine. And we've taken steps to try and put our arms around those teams of folks so that they are as little distracted by this as possible.","I think some of the other deals we did early, it was that sales engine which looked like it got distracted during a sales process and to some extent between the negotiate \u2013 or the signing of a deal and the closing of a deal. And we're doing everything we can to plan for integration of systems and integration of business units between now and when we close so that we can implement those as quickly as possible. And we're optimistic at this point that this will go well.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Arne, are the systems relatively comparable? How much of headwind do you have there?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","It won't surprise you to know there are many systems. On the property level, the property management systems, they both have the same core engine running them. And I think actually unlike in prior deals, we will not try and move all of one portfolio of hotels to some other property management system from the one that they've got, and instead find a way to make those systems communicate above the property in a way that hopefully will be much easier.","But then you get to some places like email systems or the like, which are very identical. But other systems which are unique and have been custom developed by each of Starwood and Marriott. Generally, our plan is as quickly as feasible to move to one system, not two. By doing that, we think we will provide efficiencies to our hotel owners and franchisees. We'll provide ease of operation, and we should free up resources to invest in loyalty program system and some other things, which are much more strategically important.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","My second question is probably for Leeny. Is there much share repurchase baked into your earnings guidance this year? And if so, is it weighted? How is it weighted, and what are the assumptions on the acquisition price?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","So as we talked about before, Harry, the numbers that we're looking at in all the things that we're talking about today reflect only Marriott, core legacy Marriott. So obviously, we would assume that and hope that once we've acquired Starwood that you would see share repurchase go even higher than the numbers that we've presented. But what we've talked about is that we could see total capital return to shareholders of over $2 billion in 2016; that will have the roughly similar payout on the dividend side and the rest in share repurchase. First quarter is obviously quite constrained, and basically what you've seen us buy to date is probably pretty much it given that now until shareholder vote we're out of the market. But then we look forward to being back in the market as aggressively as we can and look forward to still hitting those numbers assuming all goes well for the rest of the year.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","But is $2 billion baked into...","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","And I would \u2013 sorry?","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Is the $2 billion or say$1.5 billion baked into or included in your earnings estimate guidance?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Yes.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, all right. We'll follow up in a little while. Thanks very much.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Hi, Felicia.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Hi, Felicia.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Arne, it was helpful in your prepared remarks to give us some color regarding what happened to your transient business in the fourth quarter, so thank you for that. Just looking forward, you've given us some nice detail about what the forward group bookings look like and what your corporate negotiated business looks like. I'm wondering as we look to 2016, how are you modeling for transient and leisure segments?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","I think the transient obviously is both business and leisure. You get the leisure piece of it, but I think we will see transient grow in about the same range. Let me just talk a little bit more about the philosophy around our RevPAR guidance of 3% to 5% for 2016, which has been noted obviously in a number of early reports that have come out that that's a point lower than what we thought a quarter ago. What's changed between then and now, I think we look at a world in which there's obviously more anxiety in the marketplace. There's a bit more anxiety about what GDP growth is going to look like in 2016. And as a consequence, we've been a bit more conservative in the forecast that we've provided.","When we look internally at our own budgets that are rolled up by hotel, and this is a U.S. focused comment obviously, I think our expectations have maybe declined by about 0.5 point from where we've guessed they were a quarter ago. And that's why we mentioned in the prepared remarks that our expectation is towards the higher end of that 3% to 5%. But there's enough uncertainty out there that we thought the 3% to 5% range is probably a more constructive place for us to be than to try and move it by only 0.5 point. It gives us a little bit more room to see what happens with GDP growth.","Transient business is the hardest to predict because it does not really have much of a long lead time, particularly with business travelers. There you're really talking about days or maybe a week or two. Leisure tends to be a little bit longer than that. But what we see is, again, reasonably encouraging. The sky is not falling when we look at our data. That is profoundly the case when you look at group business, but it is also very much the case when you look at transient business. We mentioned the 2.5% transient demand in January. We look at U.S. system-wide RevPAR numbers, and they were up a hair over 3% in the month of January. And we think that probably had nearly a point impact because of the blizzard on the East Coast.","And so all things considered, that's not bad and we'd expect February to be better. That's a longer answer than you asked for. But generally, we would expect transient to be a bit lower than group but still in meaningful mid-single-digit range.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","No, that's great color. I appreciate that. And then at the high end, you said now twice that you think the high end is achievable. At the high end, are you assuming that 2.5% GDP growth, or are you assuming something higher?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","No, it's probably in the 2.5% range, 2.2% to 2.5%, something like that.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Agreed.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Hey, Shaun.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And, Leeny, welcome on board. So I just wanted to maybe ask a little bit more about some of the feedback that you received, Arne. Really since the last time we were able to ask you in this format, you've obviously been able to collect some of the feedback on the deal from the owner community, which is probably the most important constituency out there. So I'm just curious on the thoughts around how they're reacting to the combination and any impact you think that could have on your ability to sign deals between now and the time the integration plans are a little bit more clear.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","The owners and franchisees love it. They absolutely love it. They understand the strategy behind it. They understand the power that can be driven by the system. Obviously, each of them will ultimately look at it from a very selfish perspective, which is okay, what about my hotel in this market and what is the impact there? And we're still early. They're still early in trying to understand that piece of it. But I think most of them, and certainly those that are largest in size and most institutional in flavor see this as something that should drive good economics, not just for Marriott and Starwood shareholders, but great economics for them as well.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And if there \u2013 sorry. Go ahead. I was just going to say if there was one callout or sticking point that they're excited about, when we spoke with some of those probably bigger institutional owners, they mentioned leverage on distribution costs as being one key thing. But is there anything that comes up time and again in your conversations with them?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Again, they're going be looking for the things that they always look for, which is top line synergies and margin improvement, and there are opportunities in both of those places. So when you think about revenue synergies, and they're the hardest things for us to put a number out there. We don't have one for you now. Hopefully, when we get to a point of digesting the acquisition and sharing in more detail with all of you our plans, we can be a little bit more specific about it. But the basic notion is how do you take these two leading loyalty programs in the industry, Marriott Rewards and SPG [Starwood Preferred Guest], and create something which is even more powerful, and by doing that, take greater share of the business for the members of those two programs and drive top line revenue for the hotels that are in the system.","I think when you get to the cost side, we'll find hopefully that we are less reliant on the most expensive sources of third-party business over time. I think we'll find that there are opportunities in procurement. I think we'll find that there are efficiencies in systems costs that can be driven in as a result of going to one system instead of having two. And I think we'll find lots of opportunities to really, again, both drive the top line and the bottom line. So we feel really good about this.","I think the only thing we hear in response to the deal that is a community that says please reassure us is Rewards and SPG members want to make sure that their points are protected and that they don't have anything to fear. And we've been assuring both of those communities that the principal reason for our doing this deal is actually to redouble our commitment to them and make them feel even better about their loyalty to us so that they need not be worried. But I think so far it's going great.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff of JPMorgan.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Laura E. Paugh - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi, Joe.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Hey, Joe.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And, Leeny, welcome to the front as well. Two quick questions for you all. I think one of the themes we will hear this earnings season and certainly you guys are touching on it is the solid group production we saw in the fourth quarter. Are you seeing any trend change in the level of group production? I know it's early here in the 1Q to date. And then, I have a follow-up.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","No, we're not. The only thing we've seen and we mentioned this in the prepared remarks is we are seeing a bit of a lengthening of the group booking window. So we talked about how in the fourth quarter we had an increase in group bookings for all future periods of about 10%. Actually, when you look at that by year, 2016, 2017 and 2018, the weakest booking year-over-year would be 2016. That is not a function of a slowdown in demand. That is a function of the fact that bookings are already up 7%, and there's not that much space left. And I think that's something we're likely to see continue here as long as the trends continue in the way that is implicit in our guidance. Otherwise, there is no \u2013 nothing that gives us cause for concern.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And at this point, how much of your anticipated group bookings are on the book for this year? And how does that compare to historical trend?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Oh, let's see. Have you guys got that number? It's about two thirds.","Laura E. Paugh - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","A little bit better.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Actually, a little bit higher.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","That's on the books. Let's see. 77% is what they've got here compared to 74% a year ago. So about three points higher.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then my follow-up question, if \u2013 remarkably the development pipeline keeps growing, which is a good thing. Are you seeing anything here in the 1Q where we should be bracing for a more moderate performance or a moderate level of growth in the development pipeline? And that's all for me. Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","I think that's going be a really interesting question, and Leeny jump in here with your perspective. But I think the weakness in the financial markets, which does impact confidence particularly among financial players is making debt financing, I think, more difficult today than it was a few months ago. And as a consequence, I suspect that some of these deals which have recently been signed will be harder to get financed than deals that were signed maybe a year ago. And so if there's a risk here in the near term, it is that some of these deals either will get delayed to some extent, or some may even be killed if debt financing cannot be made available. It's going to vary a little bit by type of owner, partner or franchisee partner. I think those that are \u2013 tend to be more in the center part of the country, more conservatively financed, more regional banks probably will continue to be less impacted by this sort of increased anxiety. I think those that are less institutional, more classically project financed as opposed to balance sheet financed, I think there is a greater risk that some of those projects may be delayed.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker of Canaccord Genuity.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Hi, Ryan.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","I just wanted to ask a question and I don't know how much color you can give versus can't give. But just wondering how Starwood's guidance this morning lined up to your expectations as you guys were underwriting the deal? Obviously, their 2016 guidance came out a lot lower than consensus expectations. I know your guys' driver of the deal wasn't 2016 numbers, but just wondering if you guys envisioned something similar to that, or any color on concerns surrounding how their business is operating relative to that disappointing \u2013 those disappointing expectations that were put out this morning. Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","We saw their results when you saw their results. So, we will \u2013 probably as soon as this call is over, actually maybe while this call is going on, we are looking at exactly some of those questions. We've had a chance basically to do a quick \u2013 I've had a chance to do a quick read through of their release. Don't have any real insight to it. Not surprisingly, the weak foreign currencies have a more profound impact on their business, given their international mix than we do. And that is a piece of things. That piece is not surprising, obviously. We see proportionately the same sort of FX impact to our business going forward. But we'll have to digest those things. And again, this is not a deal that is based on one quarter's numbers or necessarily even one year's numbers. But a deal that we think is very attractive both financially in the long-term and strategically.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Arne.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Good morning.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Good morning.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just in terms of the deal that you signed with the Fairfield brand in China, in the past when we have discussed similar select service deals in China, I think the issue has been the per-unit profitability and the infrastructure that you have to build to drive that. So, I guess what has changed to drive this deal? Thanks.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","So first, the most important part is to look at the partner in this particular situation, and that is we're working with one of the largest hotel operators in China on this particular deal. So from a standpoint of having a knowledge based infrastructure capital experience with these kind of projects, frankly, we couldn't ask for a better situation. They know the markets. And I think from that standpoint, it will allow us to leverage a large number of hotels quickly and get them into our fee stream by working with somebody like that.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","We looked at a couple of alternatives in this broad area in China over the last few years. And the concerns that you raise were the kinds of concerns that we had. We feel obviously better about this deal than other ones we've looked at and decided not to pursue, in part, because of the strength of Eastern Crown as a franchise operator and in part because of the structure of the deal. But I think increasingly like some of our competitors we want to make sure that we are playing in all of the segments which are relevant to the growing China middle class and not purely being in the luxury space which is really where we've been so far. And this is a way for us to get there. We'll continue to expand the Rewards program and I think expand the familiarity and breadth of our brands to Chinese travelers.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. For the 2016 guidance you guys mentioned that you're guiding owned EBITDA to increase 20%. Can you just help us think about how much of that growth is recurring versus one-time, thinking specifically about the branding fees on The Ritz-Carlton Residences? Is that something that you are expecting to continue in 2017 and 2018? Or \u2013 yeah, any color would be helpful. Thank you.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Sure. No, that's great. No, I appreciate the question. First of all, I would say the three areas that we mentioned, roughly fairly even. So when you look at where the growth is coming from, whether it's the owned, leased hotels or these branding fees or the credit card, it is \u2013 the growth is split fairly evenly between those three. And frankly, they're all pretty sustainable. These, on the hotel side, we're looking at several hotels coming off of renovations which is great and they've got some nice growth in those numbers.","On the residential sides, we definitely are now seeing kind of the \u2013 that business has really picked up from 2013 through 2015 as you saw the residential market rebound. And so as we look out into the future, we've got a number of other projects coming onboard in 2017 and 2018. So I would look for that to continue not necessarily to grow at quite the same growth rate that it's growing in 2016 but certainly in terms of continuing forward to look as strong as it's looking in 2016. And then the credit card business, obviously, this is all ultimately to some extent tied to GDP and how consumers are behaving but assuming we continue to have an economy that marches forward, we look for new cardholders and increase spend to add those credit card fees.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Loeb of Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.

Great to have you back and you obviously have big shoes to fill for Carl but you have our confidence.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Well, thanks.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. I don't know how much you want to say on this, but can you just talk about whether you have any influence on the pace of asset sales at Starwood or what you're thinking about going forward about the pace of asset sales once they are your assets? And how do you think the market has changed over the last, call it, 90 days?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Well, first of all, I will say we are \u2013 you're right in the kind of first supposition. We're totally separate companies and we actually are still competitors for the time being. So any sort of direct influence on these asset sales is nonexistent. But certainly in terms of our asset light model, it won't surprise you that we would like to recycle the capital as fast as practicable and turn those into good solid management agreement and be able to recycle the capital for our shareholders and look forward to doing so. I think you've heard that we expect once the transaction gets going \u2013 once the integration occurs that we're looking at $1.5 billion to $2 billion worth of cash coming from the asset sales, we would continue to look forward to seeing that.","In terms of the market out there, as you know, it's very asset specific, very asset dependent. We are not involved in the details on each asset sales. So I can't really comment particularly about how we would see those. But at the same time for high quality assets like the ones that Starwood has, we would look forward to them continuing to see a robust buyers' market forum.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So just to follow up, is it fair to say that your view is that none of Starwood-owned assets need to be Marriott-owned assets longer term? Nothing is sacred here.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","I would say longer term being the operative word, we're not going to say whether it's six months or 18 months that we would expect to have recycled them. But yes, fundamentally, philosophically yes, I would agree with that.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great, thank you very much for the candor.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs.","Steven Eric Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions. First, your Asia-Pacific RevPAR growth was pretty healthy, up 4.7%. Could you just talk about China in particular? And then, separately, I am just trying to understand and I understand if you can't discuss this part, but just the relationship with VAC and Starwood's relationship with Interval International. Are there risks to licensing fees for Marriott and how have you started to think about how you're going to feed customers to the two separate timeshare companies?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Let me start with the Asia piece, particularly China. Obviously, we've been bombarded with news about the Chinese economy over the last couple of quarters. Most of it not very positive in what we read in the papers here. And obviously a big chunk of that is related to their manufacturing and export business. To some extent, it's related to their infrastructure spending, and to some extent to their financial markets and financial institutions. I think underneath all of that you've got China continuing to move towards a consumer economy. You've got a growing middle class that has resources to expend on things other than bare necessities.","And as a consequence, I think we see in our industry and certainly at Marriott, stronger performance in China than you might expect from reading that newspaper. Obviously, it is a very big market. And so the performance in different cities will vary from place to place. We had some of the numbers in our prepared remarks. Shanghai continues to be a very strong market all the way through 2015. Hong Kong, by contrast, has been a market which has been under pressure, in part because of the political implications of some of the street protests and other decisions that are made that derive from that. But then you look at other markets like Japan. China visitation to Japan was up something like 25% or 30% last year, if memory serves. And it is driving great performance in our Japanese hotels. And you see that sort of growth in outbound China business continuing to perform really well. And what we see so far in 2016 continues to make us quite positive about China.","Now to be sure, the China New Year has shifted from January to February. So we'll have to get through February and see exactly how the dust settles. But we're feeling pretty good about China and we're feeling pretty good about Asia. When it comes to MVW and ILG and their interest in the loyalty programs, this is a \u2013 it's going to be a really fun set of issues to work through. And obviously, we've already talked about the strategic importance of using these loyalty programs to both grow our loyal customer base and to intensify our relationships with them. And we think SPG and Marriott Rewards give us a perfect opportunity to do that.","At the same time, we have in MVW and ILG companies, which are keenly interested in making sure that they can continue to market Marriott timeshare to the Marriott Rewards folks and Starwood timeshare to the SPG folks. Similarly, we have credit card partners in those two programs, AmEx with SPG and JPMorgan Chase Visa with Marriott Rewards. And we'll work through those things with both. We don't fear either of those issues, though, and think actually that we will find a way to create great value for us and our customers as well as for those partners.","Steven Eric Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. I'm looking at the $30 million of increased ForEx headwind this year. I'm looking at the dollar index. It's roughly flat this year \u2013 or year over year. So what's driving that? Did you have any currency hedges on?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Right. So...","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Are you talking about 2015 fourth quarter or 2016 numbers?","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, 2016, the $30 million total ForEx headwind.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Right. So that actually includes the benefit of the hedges in that number. And generally, the thing I would caution you to remember is we have basically 25% of our fees come from outside the U.S., and then only a third of those do we hedge. So for example, whether it's the yuan or the South African rand or things like that which we don't currently hedge, so you're looking at two-thirds of our international fees coming from unhedged currencies. So that's where you're seeing some of the numbers in 2016 relative to 2015.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then can you do anything for some of these loosely hedged \u2013 or, I guess, loosely pegged currencies, anything on the \u2013 yeah, I guess any way you can hedge that with debt?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","In terms of \u2013 no, in terms of the debt that Marriott takes on, no. I think we're always looking at new ideas on the hedging side and hedging the fees. But to be quite honest, in many cases the costs of those hedge are so prohibitive that it's really better off to stick with the risk. Now I will also say that we do \u2013 we are hopeful that the dollar doesn't strengthen at the same kind of rate that it did in 2015 in 2016, and I think our forecast does take into consideration that we're not expecting quite the same level.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then looking at that 3% to 5% RevPAR growth for the year, how much of that comes from occupancy gain?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Not much, I would say it's probably in the ballpark of 75% to 80% rate and the rest occ.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James.","Bill A.

Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Arne, let me follow up. I think it was Joe's question on construction financing. You did indicate that it looked like there might be a slowdown there. Do you expect Marriott to get more aggressive in providing mezz or other financing alternatives for would-be developers?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","No.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, easy question. Easy.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Is that clear enough?","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's clear. I appreciate that. One question on geographic footprint, if you go back a year and look at where Canada was and then you fast-forward through Delta and then with Starwood, I'm just curious. How big a contribution do you get out of Canada now? And the same question on China on a pro forma basis with the Starwood deal.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","China will be much bigger than Canada for us, even with the Delta acquisition earlier last year. I don't know that I can pull those numbers off the top of my head. I think China will \u2013 when we close the deal, will be something like 250 open hotels between Marriott and Starwood, and gross fees that must be in the $150 million to $200 million range, I would think, something like that.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So you think maybe 15% of EBITDA or something coming from China, is that a...","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","$150 million to $200 million would be less than 15% of EBITDA. I think combined EBITDA must be in the $3 billion range. You can pull the numbers out from our respective statements and put something together on that.","And Canada, I can't \u2013 I don't remember the numbers off the top of my head, but I would think that they are half-ish or maybe even less than that of China. And China, it won't surprise you to know is obviously growing faster.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So no concerns, though, that you've bulked up in two markets that are maybe from a macro perspective facing some challenges?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","No, not at all. And I actually don't \u2013 in a very short-term perspective, you might have some of those questions. I think when you look at the long term, particularly China, we are extraordinarily enthusiastic about the future potential of that market, both for travel in that market and the importance of outbound China travel, and both depend on our having strong distribution and brand familiarity in China.","I think the issues in Canada are \u2013 only time will tell. But if you're referring to the energy market and the impact that that has on the Canadian economy, I think our bet would be that that is more transitory than permanent, albeit we do have a long-term perspective. So while we're not making a forecast on oil prices at the end of 2016, we would expect that the Canadian economy, which has a lot going for it in terms of a workforce and global integration, will be a market that continues to grow for the foreseeable future.","Bill A.

Good morning, everyone.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Good morning.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Good morning.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","So I've got two questions here. The first one is on the U.S. portion of the RevPAR guidance for 2016. I'm just wondering. Is that a top-down forecast based on U.S. GDP, or is it more bottoms up based on the various markets around the U.S.? And if it is based on the bottoms-up market analysis, could you give us a little more color on what you anticipate for some of your major U.S. markets? And then one follow-up after that.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","It's more bottoms-up.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Bottoms-up. Bottoms-up.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","It's more bottoms-up than top down. You can tell from the comments we made earlier about the difference between a 0.5 point decline in our bottoms-up approach and a roughly one-point decline in the guidance that we're giving you this morning. So there is a bit of a flavor that comes from the judgment that we've applied to it. But our planning process does not really fundamentally start with the GDP forecast. It starts with \u2013 when we get to this point of the year particularly, it starts with budgets at the hotels. And they're looking at some supply trends, but essentially much more demand trends in their market. And if you look across, have you guys got 2016? We would expect that New York is going to continue to be a fairly challenged market with barely positive RevPAR growth I think is what we've got in the model, maybe in the 1% range, something like that.","Laura E. Paugh - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Group pace was up about 2% in New York.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Group pace is better. And so that may help us get to that number. But I think that's going to continue to be a market we slog through. I think the oil patch will continue to be difficult markets that we slog through. But I think the bulk of the markets we think should perform more or less within the range of what we've talked about.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Okay, that is helpful. And then secondly on \u2013 just on the capital returns forecast of $2 billion, as per the release, it does look like capital spending or rather investment spending is coming down by two \u2013 $250 million from what occurred in 2015. And so I am just wondering what the delta might be, given that capital returns are also down by maybe $200 million as well. Is it loan repayments, is it asset sales?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Right. So great question. So you answered part of the question yourself in terms of the reason why expenditures are down, and that is Delta. From the standpoint of when we were talking to you a year ago, we knew that we were going to be spending $130 million odd on Delta. We also knew that we had some more CapEx to finish putting into our EDITION hotels. So that really makes up the bulk of the difference in terms of the CapEx spending. But then when you look at the amount of recycling that we did do in 2015 and what that led to in terms of share repurchases, the real difference when you look into 2016 is, number one, we're starting off a bit under-levered.","So if you think of something like a point, 0.1 times on our leverage ratio gives you share repurchase capability of close to $200 million. And if we started off at 2.8 times, and our typical number is three times, right off the bat you've got $400 million of additional share repurchase capacity without really doing anything. Then you've got a little bit \u2013 as you spoke of, a little bit less in CapEx. And then, frankly, we are able to lever up a little bit with our growing EBITDAR and you put those together, and that gets us to our $2 billion, or over $2 billion.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, Leeny.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Katz of Telsey Advisory Group.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Hi. Good morning, all.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Hi, David.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Hey, good morning.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Thank you.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","You're welcome, so two questions. One is when \u2013 Arne, you mentioned earlier that you expect the acquisition of Starwood to be accretive by the end of the second full year, I believe, was what the statement was.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","In the second full year.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","In the second full year.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Right.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","I assume that excludes the impact or the benefit of any share repurchases that may occur as a consequence of the deal, correct?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","I'm not sure it goes quite so far as to exclude any. I mean what our base model assumes is that over the course of the first couple years or so, we will get the combined larger company back to sort of the three times debt-to-EBITDA target that we've talked about for years. There are some things we still don't really know in detail. Actually, a lot of things we don't know in detail but part of this is making sure that we assess how many dollars are trapped offshore and work through the planning process to see whether they can be brought back to the U.S. and used. And we don't know how long that's going to take really. Starwood has work that is underway there and we have some sense for what the options are there. But we've got a lot more work to do.","And so it's a longwinded way of saying we do have some assumptions about share repurchase over the first few years in the model as with all of our share repurchase assumption that tends to have stock prices when we buy back stock at sort of normal multiples and growing stock prices whether you look at the Marriott standalone model or the combined multiple. And so they are not as profound in driving EPS accretion as you might think. If you sat here and said okay, well, what if you buy back all the stock at today's stock price, for example. But we'll work through that. I think there is \u2013 just to state the obvious, the more we can convert the acquisition of Starwood to a cash deal by buying back stock sooner particularly at the kind of values that the market is attributing to the companies today, the more we like that deal.","And it becomes something which is a no-brainer attractive transaction for us. And so where we end up exactly in this, we'll have to see both what happens with stock price and what happens with the cash management issues that we need to get through.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","So thank you for that. And if I back up one step farther and leading to what the cash is that is available for share repurchases, I start to think about the owned properties that you will be acquiring.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Correct.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","And while we can perhaps make some assumptions around what those properties earn and what would be a fair multiple, and we can \u2013 I think we have talked about on the call the questions around who the buyers are and their ability to pay, one of the unknowables for us is what the tax basis is on those properties today. My question is, what happens to that tax basis by virtue of the acquisition as we go through it? Because ultimately that helps us estimate what the gross proceed \u2013 what the net proceeds will be on an after-tax basis?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Just a couple of thoughts there. The $1.5 billion to $2 billion that Leeny referenced before is net of our estimate of what the taxes would be.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Right.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","And it is not \u2013 it's not enormously punitive to the transaction. It's in the, if I remember right, 10% to 15% range of gross proceeds, something like that.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","Right.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","There generally, though, is not an impact on tax basis from the transaction since we're acquiring the stock of the parent company. And whether those assumptions turn out to be exactly right, we'll have to see as we get further into it. You're right, though, to talk about asset sales because that will be one of the things that has a significant impact to both the amount and pace of share repurchases. I think it's \u2013 without getting into the details, it is crystal clear that from an earnings perspective, these hotels can be sold in every instance at a dramatically higher multiples than what the earnings contribution are from them. When you look at EBITDA multiples, it becomes a little bit closer but even there it's a great portfolio of assets that we would think in virtually all instances.","And again take this all with a little bit of grain of salt since there's still a lot we don't know. But in virtually all instances, we would think that the prices available would be at higher EBITDA multiples than the companies who are trading at which just gives us that much more conviction that we ought to continue with the strategy we've had for a number of years which is to be focused on management and franchising and not on owning real estate.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Perfect. Thanks very much. Good luck.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","You bet.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Stuart Gordon of Berenberg.","Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Good afternoon. I was just curious on the net additions you are looking at this year. I think you're looking at net additions of 7%. I think you were just a touch lower of where you are hoping to do in 2015. Is this partly a fall-over from some openings delayed for 2015 to 2016 or should we be thinking that you can hit that level of run rate from the pipeline you have got now going forward?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP","So a couple things. Mostly, I would say, it is not that it is delayed deals moving. There probably are a handful that could fall into 2016 that we had hoped would be in 2015. But overwhelmingly, it is the steady progression of our pipeline turning into real hotels. There is about half of it, just when you think about it. We expect about half of them to be limited service North American hotels. And when you saw the signings that we did of over 100,000 in 2015, it should give you good confidence about that number. So I think in general feel pretty good about it. And again, at the margin, a little bit higher percentage of overall relative to openings in 2015 we would expect to be from limited service in North America, which again, they seem to be going along like clockwork.","Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Okay, thank you very much.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Okay, thank you all very much for your time this morning. We appreciate your interest in Marriott, and look forward to welcoming you in our hotels all around the world. Have a good one.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Carl Berquist, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.","Carl T. Berquist","Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, October 29, 2014, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","We were delighted with our third quarter results. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.65, $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance of $0.59 to $0.63. We beat guidance largely due to strong RevPAR growth.","There were several unexpected but offsetting items in the quarter. On the upside, we received $0.02 from deferred fees associated with an owner's sale of Courtyard hotels, and $0.025 on the equity and earnings line associated with the tax law changes affecting 2 international joint ventures. On the downside, EPS reflected $0.01 expense associated with Venezuela currency devaluation, $0.015 from higher bonus accruals and $0.02 from a nonrecurring tax item.","Third quarter worldwide systemwide RevPAR was strong, rising more than 8% on a constant dollar basis. For company-operated Marriott Hotels in North America, transient RevPAR increased more than 8%, while group RevPAR rose over 10%. Transient business benefited from improving mix as we reduced discounting and increased high-rated retail business. Leisure demand was extraordinary. Third quarter RevPAR from leisure guests increased 10% for the Marriott brand and 9% for Courtyard.","For company-operated Marriott-branded hotels, group room nights increased nearly 9%. The surge in group occupancy was in part due to shifting business from other quarters, likely due to the holiday timing. At the same time, group attendance and last minute group bookings exceeded our expectations. Property-level catering revenue for the Marriott brand increased 6% in the third quarter. Meeting planners continue to make last minute food and beverage upgrades. Looking ahead, we are increasing F&B minimums during peak demand periods and increasing catering prices as well.","In the quarter, we saw double-digit RevPAR improvement in Atlanta, Boston, New Orleans, Orlando, the California desert, Denver, L.A., San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Demand strength was widespread, particularly in the financial, health care, professional services, insurance and manufacturing sectors. In the Greater D.C. market, high government demand reflected easy comps to last year's sequestration. More important, D.C. strong saw strong special, corporate and group business in the third quarter, taking the market's RevPAR up 11%.","Outside North America, third quarter systemwide constant dollar RevPAR rose nearly 6%. In Europe, RevPAR increased 3%, benefiting from greater Middle East travel to Paris, Vienna, Munich and Istanbul, while RevPAR in Russia declined. Stronger occupancy in Egypt drove RevPAR in the Middle East and Africa region up 15%.","In the Caribbean and Latin America region, favorable leisure demand in the Caribbean and Cancun, along with the impact of the World Cup in Brazil, increased RevPAR by 11%. In Asia Pacific, RevPAR rose 5%, reflecting greater demand in Shanghai, Hong Kong and India, tempered by declines in Thailand.","House profit margins benefited from strong room rate growth and solid cost control. At domestic company-operated hotels, house profit margins increased 240 basis points. Worldwide, house profit margins increased 200 basis points.","Total fee revenues were $448 million in the quarter, 19% higher than the prior year. This quarter's results included deferred base fees totaling $15 million compared to $2 million of such fees in the prior year. In this year's quarter, we booked a $9 million deferred base fee, triggered by an owner's sale of 40 Courtyard hotels, and another $6 million deferred base fee due to favorable performance at a 53-hotel limited-service portfolio.","Total incentive fee growth reflected strong RevPAR, solid cost controls and higher house profit margins. Nearly all of the incentive fee improvement in the quarter came from properties in North America. Incentive fees at our hotels in San Francisco, Chicago and the Pacific Northwest increased meaningfully.","Turning back to the P&L. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $55 million in the quarter compared to $48 million in the prior year. Results reflect strong RevPAR growth as well as our purchase of the Charlotte City Center Marriott, and the addition of the leased Protea Hotels that came with the acquisition, partially offset by the impact of renovation.","General and administrative expenses totaled $172 million in the third quarter compared to $147 million in the prior year. Our 6 -- $160 million to $165 million guidance did not assume the net $4 million Venezuela currency devaluation charge or the $6 million in higher bonus accruals.","Our fourth quarter North America group revenue pace for the Marriott brand has improved steadily since June, but remains about flat with prior year. Flat group bookings imply less occupancy compression and more modest room rate growth in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. However, given the strong transient demand we've seen in the last few weeks, we expect fourth quarter North America systemwide RevPAR will increase 5% to 7%.","Outside the U.S., we expect fourth quarter constant dollar RevPAR will increase 4% to 6%. We expect low single-digit RevPAR growth in Asia Pacific, Europe and the Caribbean and Latin America. In the Asia Pacific region, India's holiday schedule presents a tough comparison, and business in Indonesia is expected to be weak. In Europe, the fourth quarter reflects continued weak demand in Russia. In the Caribbean and Latin America region, leisure bookings during Christmas are up over 15%. Mexico group bookings in the fourth quarter are very strong driven by demand in Cancun, but Central America hotels continue to suffer from oversupply and the weak economy in Brazil.","We see 2 stories in the Middle East and Africa region. In Africa, our integration of Protea is on track, and the hotels are now available on marriott.com. We acquired the Protea brand in April 2014 and expect the brand to generate roughly $12 million in EBITDA for the 9 months of 2014.","The most obvious risk in the continent is Ebola. This awful disease has taken a terrible toll on the people and economy of West Africa. Occupancy rates at our 11 Protea Hotels in Nigeria have declined, and we've seen a few group cancellations in South Africa. We are watching the situation carefully, raising the awareness of our staff and reinforcing existing operating procedures and business continuity plan.","In the Middle East, with greater political stability, travel is returning to Egypt. This should contribute to a mid- to high-teens growth in comparable hotel RevPAR in the MEA region in the fourth quarter.","Given this global RevPAR outlook, we expect earnings per share will total $0.62 to $0.66 for the fourth quarter and $2.48 to $2.52 for the full year 2014. We expect full year 2014 adjusted EBITDA will total over $1.5 billion, a 14% to 15% increase over the prior year. At the midpoint, our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2014 is $25 million higher than our guidance last quarter and $55 million higher than our initial view of 2014 issued just 8 months ago, largely due to strong operating fundamentals. For the full year 2014, investment spending could total $800 million to $900 million, including about $100 million in maintenance spending, roughly $200 million for the Protea acquisition and roughly $225 million on the 2 EDITIONs under construction.","We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchase. We expect to recycle $600 million to $700 million from asset sales and loan repayments during 2014, including the completed sales of the London EDITION and the Barcelona Renaissance and the pending sale of the EDITION Hotel and residential real estate in Miami. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we've recycled over $300 million. We expect to return $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends this year. Year-to-date through today, we've already repurchased more than 20 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion.","To talk about our 2015 outlook, let me now turn it over to Arne. Arne?","Arne M. Sorenson","Thanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. Carl's remarks this morning demonstrate a simple truth. While global economic growth is important for the long-term strength of the industry, performance can vary considerably from market-to-market and quarter-to-quarter, often driven by local economics, events, politics and supply. Still, there are some broad and common themes that bear exploring.","The first is room rates. In the third quarter, the combination of very high occupancy rates, a strong book of group business, great corporate and leisure transient demand and low supply growth all provided the compression needed to drive room rates. North America room rates rose 5% in the third quarter, while room rates on Marriott brand group business booked in the third quarter for all future periods rose 7%. This combination of low supply and favorable demand drove room rates in markets around the world, including the Caribbean, Mexico, Japan, Kazakhstan, Germany, Hungary and the Northern U.K.","Hotel real estate is another theme. STR estimates U.S. lodging room supply will increase by only 1.3% in 2015, and we don't believe we will see supply growth reach 2% until 2016 or maybe 2017. While supply growth is modest, there is still considerable demand from investors for hotel real estate. Year-to-date, 10% of our North American limited-service hotels and 4% of our full-service hotels have changed ownership. As hotels change hands, renovations are frequently accelerated and our relicensing fees increase.","In addition, sellers, in many cases, are redeploying the cash to purchase other hotels or pursue new development deals. Marriott is garnering a significant share of the new deals. Once again, this quarter, with only a 10% share of existing rooms in the U.S., Marriott brands represent more than 1\/4 of all new U.S. construction, more than any other company according to Smith Travel.","To state the obvious, new deals depend on owners choosing Marriott brands over the brands of our competitors. A major factor in their choice is the relative performance of our brands. Let me highlight one of our brands to illustrate the point. In the third quarter, The Ritz-Carlton posted RevPAR growth of 7.6% in North America and 6.8% outside North America. Without looking at its RevPAR index figure, it's hard to know how good that RevPAR performance really is. The short answer is, it was great. Worldwide, The Ritz-Carlton increased its RevPAR index by 200 basis points over the last 12 months, a meaningful outperformance against luxury hotel competitors in the same markets. Maybe even better, in the third quarter, The Ritz-Carlton team improved hotel-level house profit margins by a full 3.9 percentage points in North America and 1.4 percentage points outside North America for a worldwide flow-through of almost 70%. This performance drove from 32 to 43 the number of highly profitable Ritz-Carlton hotels paying incentive fees in the quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. This is precisely the kind of performance that explains why we have 37 new Ritz-Carlton hotels in our development pipeline.","As we noted at our Analyst Meeting last month, we expect our worldwide unit growth to accelerate from the 3% average net growth over the past 4 years to 5% to 7% over the next 4 years. We've signed roughly 60,000 rooms year-to-date in 2014 and expect to sign a record 80,000 to 90,000 rooms in the full year, an estimate that is higher than our signings forecast at the Analyst Meeting we held in September. New brand platforms have helped this growth. 1\/3 of our newly signed rooms year-to-date are in brands we didn't have 5 years ago, and 30% are luxury or lifestyle rooms. Our experienced development organization and strong brand platforms have driven our pipeline to nearly 225,000 rooms, and our system to over 700,000 rooms at the end of the quarter.","Our third theme relates to the next generation of travelers. We talked quite a bit at our Analyst Meeting about how Marriott is positioned to win with the growing numbers of young travelers. We opened our first Moxy hotel in Milan last month. Moxy guests include both the young and the young at heart, and the guest reviews are fantastic. We expect to have nearly 40 Moxys opened in Europe by 2017.","Our first North American AC hotel should open in New Orleans next month. Millennial travelers are impressed with the style of this brand. We already have 37 hotels under the AC brand in our development pipeline in North America, and we are in talks on another 30 sites. This brand has grabbed the attention of our franchisees.","Next-generation travelers also expect outstanding mobile services. In the third quarter, reservations on Marriott Mobile were up over 45% year-over-year. Since its launch in August 2011, our mobile app has been downloaded over 4 million times. To date, we've rolled out mobile check-in to approximately 1,200 hotels, so guests can use their smart devices to connect with their hotel and experience a faster, more seamless arrival. By the end of 2014, we expect guests will be able to use their mobile devices to check in and check out of almost all of our more than 4,000 hotels worldwide.","So let's talk about our RevPAR outlook for 2015. Our budget process is just beginning and there are, to be sure, many uncertainties around the world, from Ebola to the Ukraine, from the Middle East to Europe's economy. We aren't prepared to offer EPS guidance yet, but we would like to share our early thinking.","Recent occupancy rates at our hotels in North America have been very strong. Transient demand is growing. Our group booking pace for 2015 for the Marriott brand is up nearly 4% and has been improving steadily month by month and quarter by quarter. All of these facts set us up for room rate expansion in North America again in 2015. Given our bullish outlook for group and continued strength in transient demand, we believe systemwide RevPAR at North American hotels will increase at a 5% to 7% rate in 2015, with the improvement largely coming from rate.","In Europe, new hotel supply growth should remain under 1% despite higher supply growth in some markets including London, Berlin and Amsterdam. Our outlook assumes an ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, weakening trends in Germany and continuing soft conditions in France, but the U.K. should benefit from stronger group volume and from the Rugby World Cup in the fall of 2015. Given this we expect constant dollar RevPAR will increase at a low single-digit rate at our European hotels in 2015. Europe contributed about 8% of our fee revenue in 2013.","We expect continued good economic growth in Asia and are modeling a mid-single-digit constant dollar RevPAR growth in 2015, similar to our performance in 2014. We expect RevPAR growth in China to remain strong in 2015, reflecting the impact of a growing economy and maturing hotels. China remains our largest market outside the U.S., with nearly 27,000 rooms. And we continue to sign hotels at a rapid clip, driving our China distribution and market share higher. Year-to-date in 2014, we have signed over 10,000 new rooms in Greater China, on pace with 2013 signings. We are carefully watching the economy, supply growth and the government's efforts to slow the frothy residential market. But beyond some individual market issues, to date, we are not reining in our expectations for RevPAR growth or new hotel openings. In 2013, Asia contributed roughly 9% of our fee revenue, with about half of that coming from China.","In 2015, we expect constant dollar RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America to grow at a mid-single-digit rate, with particular strength in Mexico and the Caribbean. By the way, we are pleased to welcome the 3,400-room Atlantis Paradise Island to our Autograph portfolio as of this month. CALA represented 4% of our fee revenue in 2013.","In the Middle East and Africa region, we are modeling a mid- to high-single-digit RevPAR growth for 2015 on easy comps in Europe -- excuse me, in Egypt. The Middle East and Africa region represented 2% of our fee revenue in 2013.","In summary, we are very bullish about the future. We see great momentum in demand, with meaningful group business already on the books. Supply growth is modest in most markets. We expect to price aggressively and anticipate a 5% to 7% worldwide constant dollar RevPAR growth in 2015, with strong RevPAR growth mostly from rate, more hotels should be paying incentive fees. Room additions are accelerating as we enter new markets and expand our new brands. We expect to increase our worldwide rooms distribution by roughly 6% to 7% gross in 2015 alone, with most of that already under construction.","Taken together, these elements imply a strong 2015 and continued attractive cash distributions to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] We are not limited to 1 hour today, and we expect to stay until all of your questions are answered. Maria, will you open the line?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Arne, since you spoke last, I'll ask you first. So you gave us your 2015 outlook, which was very helpful. And acknowledging that it's early, you're obviously bullish about what you're seeing so far next year. Obviously, based on already strong data points, especially in the group business which you touched on, I'm assuming the transient demand that you discussed though is more close in. So I'm wondering what gives you the confidence that the transient demand will continue at the current pace. And then also how you're thinking about balancing the strong group demand with the potential benefit you could get from the transient segment?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, all good and fair questions. And you're absolutely right, the booking window for transient business, particularly business transient, is dramatically shorter than for group business. So we would, sitting here today, have virtually no business transient on the books for 2015. We would have some leisure transient, which obviously books a bit further out, but would be focused primarily in the resort markets. But I think what we see is that, we are obviously performing at record occupancy levels today. We see in Q3 a positive upside in terms of both transient and group demand and, if anything, some building momentum on the demand side. And when you look at demand, what's driving those demand trends, clearly, the U.S. economy is a big piece of that. And we see nothing to suggest that those trends are likely to moderate in the near term. And I think as a consequence with that high occupancy and with the group base, we should be able to continue to drive rates.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, helpful. And then just as my follow-up, flipping to internationally, similarly your outlook there next year seem pretty solid despite the macro headwinds. Just wondering, what are you seeing in your business? And you've touched on some of these things, but really that gives you confidence about the international outlook? Because I would have thought given what's going on in the macro environment, perhaps you would have been inclined to build some cushion into that outlook.","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, we've got -- I think when you roll up those international markets that we went through continent by continent, we would expect the RevPAR outside the U.S. to be modestly lower than RevPAR in the U.S. next year. Probably, if our U.S. number is 5% to 7% and global number is 5% to 7%, probably a 4% to 6% range outside the U.S. It is more difficult to predict RevPAR outside the U.S. than to predict it in. But we expect Europe will continue to muddle along sort of the way it has this year and last year in low single-digit land for the reasons we talked about. Russia, obviously, is the weakest market in Europe. I think in Russia, where we have 17 hotels, we were down about 20% RevPAR, for example, in Q3. We're -- we have no expertise and no basis to really build a model that assumes that things change as far as Russia and the rest of Europe is concerned, so we would expect that to stay quite weak. On the other hand, you've got markets like Egypt, where with stability that's returning, we will see RevPAR, we think, continue to build very well. RevPAR in Egypt in our third quarter, for example, was up 100%. Now to be fair, that's because a year ago in 2013, conditions were awful, and they still are not back to the levels that we had in 2010 before the government change there. And we'll see how that goes as we go forward. You go, you kick around the world and you see different trends in different places. Caribbean and Latin America is more derived from the U.S. We think as a consequence will reflect the strength of the U.S. Mexico is doing quite well. Central America and Brazil doing less well. You get to Asia. Hopefully, knock on wood, we'll have easy comparisons in Thailand, where we've had a very rough year this year. And continuing solid performance, if not eye-popping performance in markets like China and India. China and India, for us in Q3 this year, were both about plus 7% RevPAR. And obviously, in China, you've got a government which has a profound ability to impact the economy there, and we'll see how that devolves, but we would expect that the sort of current trends will continue there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So 2 questions. First, IHG and Starwood both suggested there were supply and demand issues in China that it sounded a little bit worse than that way you are viewing them. And I just wanted to understand what you were seeing versus what they were seeing. And then Arne, on the lifestyle brands and the affiliation brands, so Autograph, Moxy, EDITION, we're starting to see lots of other companies launch those too. And I just wanted to ask you what you're seeing on activity and desire for affiliation with your brands? And what seems to be winning? And where are you seeing competitive pressures?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, so let's start with China. I think the -- there are 2 things in China that bear asking, I think. One is the impact of supply growth, and the other is the impact of economic conditions, particularly the residential market in China. I think there's nothing new on the supply side. We -- obviously, in many markets in China, we have seen healthy supply growth now for a good number of years. That's what you should expect in a market that is growing the way China is growing. We have, as we sit here today, I'm guessing a little bit, but I think we probably have 25 or 26 hotels open in the City of Shanghai. So we are a piece of that supply growth. Notwithstanding that, we have high single-digit RevPAR growth in City of Shanghai because it is a really important commercial destination and it's a great city. And I don't think the supply trends are likely to change very much. If anything, the supply may decelerate a little bit for the market as a whole. That then gets to the question of residential growth and new intakes, if you will, to the development pipeline. And there, too, I think we've been watching the residential market all of this year. I think if you had asked these questions a quarter ago, we would have had exactly the same level of concern we have today, which is some. I mean, clearly, there will be a slowdown in residential development in China. A number of hotels are developed as part of mixed-use projects that include a significant amount of residential. And so we'll see a bit less than that, I suspect, than we would have if the residential market had been stronger. But having said that, you've still got a market which is growing well. And you've got both domestic travel and outbound travel in China, which is growing very, very strongly. And as consequence, we continue to be pretty optimistic about that market. Your question about lifestyle and affiliation brands, we are in one of those stages where it seems like every few weeks, we see somebody announce a new brand launch. That's probably a sign that conditions are good, and it's probably also a sign that folks see some of the opportunity available in the space. We really have not seen any impact though. So when we look at Autograph growth and we look at AC Hotels growth, and those 2 are the places where new brand launches are probably most relevant, we still see great appetite from our hotel-owning partners for both of those brands. We gave you the statistics for AC Hotels in the U.S. in the prepared remarks. We didn't give you Autograph statistics. I'm not sure I can give them to you off the top of my head. But if you look at our unit growth schedules in the deck, you'll see that Autograph is continuing to grow really well, both in Europe and in the United States. A little bit less so in Asia, which is primarily a new build market, but we're seeing some growth there as well. So it seems to add good momentum to those new brands.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just one quick question for Carl. I think he mentioned that 2015 group pace is up mid-single digits, 60% of expected group business booked so far. Can you just give us a sense how that compares to Q2 and how that compares at this point last year at the same time?","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, I don't have last year's number. But I think we've seen it -- we've seen group pace build over the last 3 quarters. And so as you mentioned, we're at probably about 4% group pace, 4% or 5%, right in that neighborhood as of the end of the third quarter. So what we've seen over this year is that's built up to that number. But again, we're only at 60% of what we would expect the total group to be, so we still have plenty of runway. And as you know, that number continues to move around. It's just a point in time which your pace is compared to last year at this time. I would say we're up 4% over last year.","Laura E. Paugh","Steve, if you give me a call, I'd be happy to get you the number for a year ago at this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Joel H. Simkins - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Arne and Carl, you guys spoke pretty positively about strong transient demand, continued growth at marriott.com. It seems pretty clear throughout earnings that leisure travel is generally pretty healthy. I know you guys don't use a lot of OTA business. But perhaps, does this strength in sort of leisure transient give you guys some ability to continue to push down some of these partners a little bit harder in 2015?","Arne M. Sorenson","The -- that's an interesting question, and I'm not necessarily sure I'd connect them exactly that way. Obviously, the OTAs are more relevant in leisure business than they are in business transient or in group. And I think that's one reason we're seeing OTA volumes grow for the industry as a whole as leisure demand comes back a bit. We'll obviously have to watch. Our philosophy is really to try and sell rooms the way our customers want to buy them. We want to, at the same time, make sure that we are managing the costs as well as we possibly could. And we'll work the tension out between those 2 things step by step as we go along.","Joel H. Simkins - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sure. And one quick follow-up. Obviously, you've got some pretty strong momentum in the pipeline, which you highlighted at the Analyst Day and obviously earlier today. Some of your competitors look like they're following behind a little bit in select service. Does this give you any concern perhaps that others might get a little bit more aggressive on key money and incentives?","Arne M. Sorenson","Oh, I don't know that, that's much of a change from where we've been before. We've got -- it's obviously a highly competitive industry. And we've got some competitors with very strong brands that compete against the brands we have in the limited-service space. So we've got some competitors with weaker brands than we have. By and large, those trends are not new. And I think one of the things we're pleased about in terms of the industry is we are getting to a place where the companies are, on average, longer term in their focus and more disciplined about driving value, and not simply looking at a short term, \"What do I do to get my company ready for a listing?\", which is happening in the real near term or something else of the sort. And so I think while some of our competitors are more aggressive with key money or other financial incentives, I think, by and large, we see an industry where, at least, the branded companies are hopefully managed by rational folks who are trying to create value for the long term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two questions. The first question, from last quarter's guidance, 3Q fees obviously outperformed, but appears your expectations for 4Q have come down a bit. What drove that? Were there fees that you expected that you booked early? Or did what's going on with international macro make you a bit more cautious on 4Q? And then the second question is releasing your earnings the same day as Starwood, I guess, is kind of a blessing and a curse as it makes us compare the 2 companies even more than we usually do. But you guided international RevPAR for the fourth quarter up 4% to 6%. They guided their entire system up 3% to 5%. Their commentary suggests that their international guide is probably lower than that. So why do you think your expectations for 4Q international RevPAR is so much higher than theirs?","Arne M. Sorenson","The -- let's see, a couple of things there, the fourth quarter first. We've looked at that. And I actually think our fourth quarter -- our expectations for total fee performance in the fourth quarter are roughly the same now as they were a quarter ago. There's a little bit of movement in there place to place. I mean, we may have -- we did have some outperformance in Q3 on incentive fees, and we'll probably give a little bit of that back. But I think we're probably also a little bit modestly higher in some of the other fee categories. And so within the realm of predictive accuracy, I think our expectations for the fourth quarter are about the same. When you look at the full year numbers though, and we -- we're sort of wrestling with these numbers this morning a little bit to try and make sure we understand what was going on. I suspect we had a fairly broad full year RevPAR range, maybe a little broader than we needed when we reported results a quarter ago. So a quarter ago, we were still looking at a full 2 points of RevPAR range and the fee range that went with that. So we had a range in our total fees, I think, of $40 million, if I remember right. Halfway through the year, that's probably a pretty big range, although consistent with the way we've done it in the past. It sort of suggests -- 2 quarters were already in the books. It suggests that, in effect, it's looking at a 3- or 4-point RevPAR range for the final 2 quarters of the year to get to that change. And so here we sit with a better Q3 than we anticipated, to be clear, with a Q4 expectation, which is roughly equivalent to what we thought a quarter ago, but the full year RevPAR numbers that are implied by the guidance we're giving you today are still within the full year range of RevPAR we used a quarter ago, albeit at the higher end. So it's not so much that we're taking back. It's just that the range has, in effect, narrowed a little bit, including on the top end. Let's see. Comparing our expectations for the rest of the world with one of our competitors, I'm not sure we're really in a position to do that. They are looking at whatever data they look at. And they're looking at their own distribution, which is certainly different from ours in some respects. We're doing the best we can. I guess on balance that means either we're a bit more optimistic than they are or our distribution is a little bit better than theirs is, at least as it relates to the fourth quarter RevPAR. We're giving you our best estimate of where we think we'll end up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to ask my question on unit growth side. So you guys gave, I think, the latest expectations for 6% to 7% gross room openings next year. And so my question is how much of that, kind of generically can you break down for us, is coming out of the United States versus out of international right now? Or directionally, what would you think on that?","Arne M. Sorenson","I would think 50% to 60% is U.S. and 40% to 50% is international, roughly. I think in -- so far, we're running about 50% -- the pipeline is maybe 54% -- 54% in the U.S. and 46% outside. And I can't tell you exactly what the 15 openings look like, but I would expect they would be somewhat similar to those ranges, give or take a few points.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. And you mentioned that right now, you haven't kind of seen any need to change your outlook for China, but maybe just a little bit more clarity on -- if China were to slip, how much of that number do you think could be at risk? Are we talking 50 basis points? Or are we talking a material kind of percentage point?","Arne M. Sorenson","Remember, our -- the numbers we gave you, now we had -- we used full year 2013 fee numbers because '14 is not over yet. But about 8% of our total fees came out of Asia, and about half of those came out of China. China has grown a little bit faster than the rest of Asia for us. So the '14 number is when '14 actually comes to a rest, could see a little bit more coming out of China than that 4%. But that would be our sort of total exposure to that market. So if you factor in a few points of better or worse RevPAR, it's not likely to be a huge impact to Marriott.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Greff of JP Morgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two quick questions for you, one on your 2015 group commentary for the Marriott brand. Of that 50% of the expected bookings that are on the books so far, how much of that do you estimate was booked this year, how much of it booked in years prior? And when you look at that or if you do look at that in those 2 buckets, how much stronger is the '14 group bookings made for '15 versus the prior years? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Arne M. Sorenson","So on rough order of magnitude for '15, 40% or so, maybe 35% to 40% of the group business would have been on the books before the end of 2013, leaving about 60% to be booked in '14 for '15 and in the year for the year within '15. Now tell me again, Joe, your second question?","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, if we were to sort of just isolate those 2 buckets, I would imagine the group bookings made for '15 this year probably have higher pricing, better F&B and catering terms than in years prior to this year.","Arne M. Sorenson","Absolutely. Yes.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is there some sort of metric that you can communicate to us to sort of just gauge that? I would imagine the 40% left to be booked for '15 would also follow a similar trajectory?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. I mean, we've seen every month that the rate -- ADR for the group business on the books for 2015 has improved. And so when we started the year, started 2014, I think our '15 bookings would have had rates equal to '14 rates. And as we sit here today, we're probably up about 2 points in rate alone. Now you're obviously moving -- you've got to move through your new bookings, the averages from the bookings that were already on the books. We did use one statistic in the prepared remarks, which I think is pretty powerful. And that is group bookings made in Q3 2014 for all future periods, rates were up 7%. That includes bookings for the balance of '14, the bookings for '15, the bookings for all future years. But that number too is strengthening quite well. And I -- that's the kind of trend we'll continue to see. Now when you talk about Food & Beverage, Food & Beverage is a little bit more influenced by volume and current conditions than by pricing at the time the booking was made. So ultimately -- in part because there will be an anticipation of F&B when the booking is initially made, but those can easily be adjusted as you get closer to the event. And so we'll see in stronger economic environments, lower-rated group business booked in weaker times still come in and say, \"We want to upgrade our food and beverage.\" Or the volumes that folks that we're going to have showing up for the meeting are higher because of the stronger economic conditions. And so Food & Beverage ought to grow, even for prior group business, maybe a bit better.","Laura E. Paugh","Also I might add in answer to Steve Kent's question, booking pace for 2014, 1 year ago at this time, where we sat 1 year ago looking at '14 was about in the same place. Booking pace was around 4%, and the room rates at that time were flat. So you're seeing meaningful improvement in pricing that's reflected in the booking pace.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. That's helpful, Laura. Carl, in your earlier comments talking about the full year '14 investment spend and capital recycling and asset sales and loan repayments, you mentioned part of the $600 million to $700 million of asset sales and loan repayments include the EDITION Miami hotel and residences. Could you remind us what that total would be?","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, we think that the total of the 2 combined will be all around $330 million, probably about $230 million for the EDITION hotel and another $100 million or so on the residences that will close in '14. It's really the residence part will be on the timing of the close.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And the $100 million for the residences, is that it? Is that over? Or is there some spillover into '15?","Carl T. Berquist","No, no, no. That's -- we've got about 65% of units sold to date. So we'll start closing those once the hotel opens. The hotel is scheduled to open actually next week there. And so we'll start -- in fact, we've actually closed on a couple already. We wanted to get into the condos to start doing all of their decorating and everything. So we think the process of closing on those through the rest of the fourth quarter will generate $100 million, maybe as much as $120 million. It really, now these closings, they get moved and everything, but you could kind of circle the wagon around $100 million on that.","Arne M. Sorenson","But the total of the residential would be $170 million?","Carl T. Berquist","$150 million to $170 million on the total, yes, Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harry Curtis of Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just a quick question on incentive management fees. Back in 2007, your incentive management fees included roughly $70 million of Courtyard fees that were -- that kind of drifted away as the CapEx program went into place. So my question is how close to you -- are you to beginning to receive incentive management fees from the Courtyard brand? And to what degree are you able to make up that difference?","Arne M. Sorenson","We've got $1.6 million in incentive fees on 120 Courtyards in Q3.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, I think on the...","Arne M. Sorenson","How do you like them apples?","Carl T. Berquist","Yes. On the select service property, we did have during the third quarter about 120 -- 130 select service hotels that began paying. But in total, all of those hotels only paid like $1.6 million of fees. And probably a large portion of those portfolios may not pay in the fourth quarter just because of the timing and seasonality. We have to be careful about the number of hotels paying. I think mathematically in the third quarter, over 50% of our hotels were paying incentive fees, but that number may come down a little bit as these portfolios move in and out of the number of hotels.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","But I guess my question is, if you got $1.6 million in the third quarter, does that mean that you're pretty close to the cusp of a much more meaningful number going forward?","Carl T. Berquist","I think it will start building, but I don't think it will be a material number in the next quarter or 2 or 3 is what I'm saying. They'll move in and out for a while and then it will start growing. If you kind of think of the schedule we did in the investor -- in our Investor Day, where we showed that once they do start paying, it's an acceleration. I'd just caution on what we saw in the third quarter. We think some of those portfolios moving in and out for the next couple of quarters.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up question relates to the owned and leased line item. You mentioned in the press release that there were some hotels that were under renovation. And recently, you've had a benefit of some of those lease -- those renovated hotels in the leased portfolio contributing. To what degree or how many of the leased hotels are under renovation? And what sort of impact might they have in 2015 as they come out of renovation?","Carl T. Berquist","Well, as you know, our whole leased portfolio is only about 35, 40 hotels. A couple of hotels can move it, but we have probably half a dozen hotels that are in various stages of renovation through this quarter and into next year and they'll come out of renovation at different times next year, and so it's probably not going to move the needle that much when one comes in or out. I think Uruguay is one of the ones where it's completely shut down as it's completing going through renovation. So that one, when it comes back online, will have an impact, but that won't be until later next year, probably near the end of next year. So I think there won't be anybody that comes online that's going to have a material impact to change the numbers in the owned\/leased.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So if anything, Arne, let's at least congratulate you on your $1.6 million in the IMFs.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, thank you very much. We were pleased to see it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two questions. Looking at your incentive management fees and you remarked already on -- there was such a big step-up in the percent of properties paying. And I realize that just crossing the line doesn't necessarily mean huge dollar amounts. And you mentioned, you'll kind of -- some of those will move in and out of paying incentive management fees for a few quarters. But if you take your 2015 outlook and assume that the things stay at those levels, is this an inflection point here where next year we'll see that percent of properties paying better [ph] fees in that 40% to 50% range? Because this is -- I don't remember a quarter where you had such a significant step-up in paying properties.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, and it shouldn't surprise you that, that 120 Courtyards, when they pop in, it has a impact on the number of hotels paying, almost more profoundly than it does on the dollars of incentive fees that we receive. This is one of the challenges of coming out with any comments on 2015 before we've started the budget process. There is still a lot of work that we have to do in order to give you detailed answers for 2015. All we really wanted to do is give you a sense for RevPAR and unit growth, which we can have the most insight into at this stage of the process. I think that in terms of incentive fee growth and owned and leased growth, the last couple of questions that have come in, probably still the best source for you on our thinking about that is what we shared that the Analyst Meeting in September, which was built on not as thorough a plan as individual hotel budgeting, but it was well done and still probably the best thinking we have as we sit here today.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then -- and my other question, circling back to group business, which I think everybody is trying to understand why we're hearing kind of different outlooks in group and you've mentioned the kind of improving from quarter-to-quarter. Is there -- just sort of mathematically trying to think about how -- what may be happening out in the market overall and not necessarily to Marriott. But have you experienced cancellations where your bookings earlier in the year for group were strong, but some of those later got canceled? Just trying to struggle with some of the comments about group, not necessarily -- not yours, but trying to see them as consistent with other comments.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, here's what I'd say about group and I don't know everything that's been said out there. So I can't comment on that. But when we have looked at our fourth quarter of 2014, all year long, we've seen in the fourth quarter a weaker quarter. And I don't think that has anything to do with fundamental economic conditions or the pace of recovery in the lodging business. I think there is always a bit of a arbitrariness or seasonality. I think Q3 was good. The holiday calendar in September was almost as good as we can have it. The holidays felt very near weekends. And so it didn't disrupt regular travel or group business as much as might be the case. And it may be that Q3 benefited a little bit at the expense of Q4. Because people know about those holidays long in advance, that means the strength of the advanced bookings was higher in Q3. It was higher in Q1, 2 and 3 than Q4 for a long time. And I think that there is an industry dynamic which is at play there. I think it would be wrong to conclude that a relatively weaker Q4 is the shape of things to come. In fact, when we look at Q1 and Q2 for 2015, we see group bookings higher than our averages for 2015 as a full year. And what that tells us is this is about the unique attributes of Q4 2014, the way the holidays fell maybe a little bit, the way the rhythm of group business sometimes plays out arbitrarily. And then as we get into 2015, we should see good, healthy performance in group again as we go forward. By the way, Q3 -- or September specifically in 2015 will not be as good a calendar as September was in 2014. And that will be something that nobody will remember, but we'll undoubtedly talk about when we talk about group results in Q3 2015 a year from now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the pipeline you guys spoke about earlier. I think, Arne, you said 54% was U.S. Would you guys mind maybe giving a little detail to the extent that you can on how you split between full and limited service within that, and maybe top 25 versus non-top 25?","Arne M. Sorenson","8% and 46% is limited service and full service, 46% and 8%. Top 25 and other, I don't know that I have, to tell you the truth. Obviously, the limited service has got mostly secondary market, I would think. Some of those maybe in top 25 MSAs, but would be suburban locations as opposed to city center locations. But -- so you can tell from those numbers that it is still very little full service or upper-upscale of luxury supply growth in the United States. Of those 8% or so of rooms, so that would be 16,000 rooms ballpark, 16,000 to 18,000 rooms. You've got some notable big hotels that are working their way through the system like JW Marriott Austin, which will open next year; a Marriott Marquis in Chicago that will open in, I don't know, '17 or '18, maybe, something like that; and Houston Marquis, which is under construction, I think it's opening in 2016, if I remember right. But these are all 1,000 or 2,000-room hotels. And they really are coming not so much as a leading edge of supply growth, but as a function of cities building their convention facilities and convention headquarters hotels.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And one quick follow-up, if I could, for Carl. Within the context of the 10% to 12% fee guidance you guys shared at the Analyst Day, when we think about some of the deferral items, how should we treat them on a go-forward basis? Or how should we think about them with respect to the growth within the fee business?","Carl T. Berquist","Yes. I think when we have an item like where we get these deferred base fees from sale of an asset, those are -- they're rare and they're one-off kind of things and we'll always call those out and we don't put those in our projections or forecasts or our assumptions. The other ones though are when -- they're basically subordinated fees. So when you have operations improve and you hit certain levels, then you get paid those fees. Those come as your economy gets better. As our operations get better, we'll start realizing some of those subordinated fees that you saw in the third quarter. And we had some last year, too. We had a couple of million dollars last year. But I think you can kind of think of those as just part of the normal process that we have from time to time. It's a little lumpy, but they're not really big numbers when you think of the realm of the total fees. That -- that's the 2 pieces you saw this quarter, one being as a result of a transaction, the other is just because of improved operations, and they'll continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Actually just maybe building on that earlier question, when you look at that forward look at U.S. supply growth, I think you were saying you thought it was going to accelerate from 1% growth to 2% by about 2016 or '17. What share of that incremental growth do you think you guys are capturing? And how do we think about your year-over-year unit growth? How do you see that accelerating, I guess, over that time frame?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I mean, I think we'll see inevitably that we're opening more into our system in the U.S. than we have in the past in the limited service space, particularly. We are -- our approvals have been steadily coming up over the course of the last, oh, I don't know, 18 months maybe, 2 years like that. And obviously, you go from an approval to an opening over the course of about 2 years, I suppose, for a limited service hotel. And so we'll see more openings. I -- we use that 1\/4 number, 25% number. We think of all the hotels under development in the United States something like 25% are headed towards our brands. And so you can do the math and that would suggest that we ought to see our supply growth, Marriott supply growth stepping up in the U.S. from the levels we were at a couple of years ago.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just maybe on the other side of the world on China, how do you handicap the odds that -- the slowdown in China's economy or the residential development dynamics ultimately impact your ability or your competitors' ability to bring the China pipeline to market in the next 36 months, say?","Carl T. Berquist","Well, we've got -- of our pipeline in China right now, about 65% of it's under construction. And so that -- those properties will be -- might slip a little bit, but based on everything we know right now, those hotels will be completed and delivered. So it's not a matter of them falling out, but a matter of just the timing of when they get delivered. I think so -- and as we look at the remaining hotels in our pipeline, right now, we don't see any trends where we're seeing a material amount of them. They might be slipping a little bit timing-wise, but they're not falling out of the system, so to speak, right now.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. The -- I think the -- I don't disagree with anything Carl said. We have -- we signed about 3,700 rooms into the development pipeline -- or added 3,700 rooms to the development pipeline in Q3 in Asia Pacific, which is meaningfully more than the rooms we opened or the rooms that we either canceled or delayed. So at the same time, I think our team in China has been saying all year, MOUs may be coming in a little bit slower. There's -- beware, we might see it start to impact the intake of new deals in the development pipeline. So far those warnings really haven't proven out in the statistics that we're looking at. Having said that, I think at the moment, if I'm a developer of a mixed-use, big mixed-use development in China today, I'm probably going to be philosophically open to let the thing take a little longer to get to opening than I would have been, maybe a couple of years ago because of the strength of the residential market. So I think there is risk that opening dates extend a bit. And I think there is still risk as our team warns us, that we could see the intake of new deals into the development pipeline slow a bit over the course of the next few quarters. Weakness, though, also gives rise to some opportunities, which is hotels that are under construction that are not committed to a brand or maybe some conversion opportunities. My guess is that those are an upside, which is not quite as significant as the downside would be in terms of extended opening dates.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker of MLV & Co.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted you to maybe give us a little more color surrounding the deferred base fees. I guess, first of all, was that in your 3Q guidance when you had issued it in July? I would have assumed, at that point in time you might have had some idea, particularly with regards to the ones that were based on performance incentives? And then the second question is with regards to those deferred fees. How much of your base management fee portfolio is subject to a performance guarantee or performance minimum where you don't actually see those base fees? I'm just trying to figure out how onetime in nature this is versus recurring.","Carl T. Berquist","They were not in our guidance.","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, the $6 million were in the guidance, but the $9 million were not.","Carl T. Berquist","The $9 million were not in our guidance. The subordinated fees were in our guidance. The ones that we record based on performance, we'll consider those because we do have visibility. We can't control transactions. So when they're based on the sale of an asset, we don't have that much visibility in that. And then it's typically these things relate to 1 or 2 of our limited service portfolios. So it's not a big part of our total portfolio. And then when they happen, it more relates to how those portfolios perform over a period of time. So I don't think it's going to be a huge percentage of our total base fees from time to time. Like I said, it will be a little choppy, come in and out.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, how many of those portfolios do you guys have that you operate on a select service basis?","Arne M. Sorenson","I don't think this -- I don't think the deferred fee is material to the system. I think if you look at the total fees that we reported in 2014, you're talking about a few million, which would be deferred fees total.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Arne, we saw international inbound travel up about 8% in the first half of the year. You talked about Ebola, strong U.S. dollar, weaker Europe. Are you seeing any change in the velocity of travel inbound? And how able are you to identify changes in demand at your hotels in those kind of core West Coast and East Coast markets?","Arne M. Sorenson","We've asked exactly these questions to our revenue management team, including looking at weekly data now. Weekly data is highly volatile based on holidays or other trends. But we have seen no indication that inbound international travel to the United States is weakening or is declining, and that's looking at both West Coast and East Coast markets. Obviously, New York is a place that we've dug into significantly to try and understand that. When you think about Ebola, nobody has really asked specifically the question on Ebola, but we also tried really hard to canvas our performance around the world and say, \"Is Ebola having an impact now?\" And what we found is about a sum total of 4 or 5 anecdotes around the world that amount, in the aggregate, maybe a couple of million dollars of revenue. So it not even...","Carl T. Berquist","Hotel revenue.","Arne M. Sorenson","Of hotel revenue, not even a rounding error. It won't surprise you to hear that Nigeria, where we have 10 hotels, but on a full year basis, maybe have $1 million or $2 million of fees. I don't even know off the top of my head. RevPAR in Nigeria is down something like 20% and obviously, Nigeria is in West Africa. Even though Nigeria really has had only very light exposure to Ebola, it is close enough to the Sierra Leone and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and the others to have had some impact. Outside of that market, though, we see really nothing, and we don't see it in terms of big travel trends and we don't see it in terms of the bookings in our hotels or the stays in our hotels.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","The follow-up question, Arne, is that you are in or you're entering a special corporate rate negotiation period. And I just wanted to see how you're approaching it. What the initial reaction has been from those that you've talked to? What you think the expectations are on the other side of the table?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I think the -- with each passing year of the recovery, we get that much more clarity about the reasonableness of driving rates, I suppose. And as a consequence, I suspect we'll see the trends of the last few years continue. And that is we will drive rates in special corporate and we'll probably reduce special corporate volumes. So the least attractive special corporate accounts, I think, inevitably, will be left without as many hotels participating or maybe no hotels participating and depending more on RAC rate availability of those hotels. So when you look at our Q3 numbers as an example, our special corporate rates were up less than the hotel as a whole. Special corporate volumes would have been flattish, maybe down a little bit and RAC rated business would have been up substantially, both in terms of room nights in terms of rates. And I think we'll see that continue into next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nikhil Bhalla of FBR.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just for the sake of perspective, I was wondering if there's a way to figure out maybe on a same-store basis if we can, where your group room nights through the first 3 quarters of this year and maybe your group rate in aggregate compares to where the last peak was, maybe back in 2007 or '08?","Arne M. Sorenson","There's certainly a way to do it. And probably the best thing for you to do is to touch base with Laura and Betsy, and see what kind of data they can get for you. I know that our group volume is probably -- still as a mix of total hotel business is probably still 1 point or 2 lower than what it was in 2006.","Carl T. Berquist","For the Marriott brand, it's probably -- the mix is probably lower now than it was in 2007, but...","Arne M. Sorenson","But not by a lot.","Carl T. Berquist","But not by a lot and I don't know where the rate sits. So the total revenue, I don't know how that goes. So we could probably get you that if you give us a call.","Laura E. Paugh","Give us a buzz.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up question on the group pace for next year. Just to be clear, I think you gave the group volume pace not the group revenue pace. Is that correct?","Arne M. Sorenson","No, no. Revenue pace.","Carl T. Berquist","That was revenue pace.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. So it's 5% up revenue pace. Okay. Just wanted to be sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Agnew of MKM Partners.","Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Sorry to come back to question on China. But I wanted to ask if your geographic and chain scale exposure is different enough in China that you appear at least to be more sanguine than your peers, do you have less exposure to mixed-use projects?","Arne M. Sorenson","No. I actually think there is a difference probably. That's going to vary from company to company, obviously. But we are -- in terms of our current distribution, we are way at the top end. So Ritz-Carlton, we're absolutely convinced is the leading luxury brand in China. But JW Marriott, Renaissance Marriott, these are all luxury hotels in China. And we have much less in sort of the upscale area, if you will. So we do have a few Courtyards, but we don't have many and we don't really have small, limited service hotels in anyway comparable to what we have in the United States. So that's one difference in terms of our existing portfolio. The other is we are much more heavily concentrated in the key cities. So Shanghai and Beijing, we think, we have got a leading distribution in those 2 markets. And markets like Shenzhen and Guangzhou, I suppose, would be next. We -- I think this is a function we've talked about this over the last few years. I think we started focusing on the secondary and tertiary markets in China later than a number of our competitors. And that may have some impact on near-term RevPAR expectations. I don't think that, that should explain any difference you might be hearing from us in terms of optimism about new development going forward.","Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","And if I could ask a follow-up on mobile bookings. Can you share any insights into the profile of customers booking direct on mobile? Is there more of a concentration with high end reward members and what other channels is mobile taking share from?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, mobile -- obviously, all of this comes through marriott.com, at least when it's our proprietary channel. And I think we are seeing -- and by all means, touch base with Laura and make sure that these are close, but I think we will do over $10 billion of total sales in marriott.com this year. We'll do over 2 billion of mobile volume, and that mobile volume has come from nearly 0, 3 years ago and is growing dramatically faster than the marriott.com as a whole. I think the guests are comparable though. I mean, I think they may skew a little bit younger than those that are using other marriott.com channels, but I think all customers are getting more and more used to using their handheld devices as opposed to desktop devices to engage in commerce, including booking hotel rooms. There is much of the business that comes through marriott.com, whichever -- whether it's mobile or desktop is rewards business and it's obviously easier to use both of those channels if we know who you are and we've got customer data in and the transaction itself becomes faster to book. Did that answer your question?","Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, just one quick -- one quick follow-up. Yes, Arne, I think you mentioned about 10% of your limited service, I think 4% of your full service hotels changed hands. What's the mark-to-market, if you will, on the fee differential between what you're changing the new customer versus the prior?","Arne M. Sorenson","That's a good question. The -- I don't know. I think a few of the brands we've moved franchise fees up by 0.5 points in the last couple of years. And essentially, whenever you move franchise fee levels up, as we've done in that example, it would apply only to new projects or to new owners who are buying those hotels. There will be some upside associated with it. I can't tell you how significant that is. That's a good question.","Laura E. Paugh","That's a good question. We'll take a look at what that number is.","Arne M. Sorenson","All right. Maria, you got anybody else?","Operator","I'm showing that was our final question sir.","Arne M. Sorenson","Okay. Thank you all very much. We appreciate your time and attention and look forward to welcoming you into our hotels on your travels.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin.","Arne M. Sorenson","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Carl Berquist, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, April 30, 2014, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","In the past few weeks, I attended the groundbreaking of our new 1,000-room group hotel in Houston, toured development sites in Europe and Japan and met with travel industry leaders at the World Travel & Tourism Council summit in Sanya, China. At every stop, I sensed tremendous optimism in this industry. Not only is economic growth driving REVPAR, but larger trends, from globalization to the rise of the middle class in emerging markets, are driving opportunity for the travel industry.","We were pleased to hear last week that the Chinese government leadership set a target of 500 million annual outbound Chinese trips, up from 98 million in 2013, confirmation that the China growth story is alive and well, both at home and abroad.","My first stop was on the groundbreaking of the new Marriott Marquis in Houston, Texas. Expected to be open in 2016, this big-box hotel will have nearly 100,000 square feet of meeting space connected by a walkway to the convention center. By the way, we define big-box hotels as properties with more than 1,000 rooms. Smith Travel data shows that, today, we lead in this space with a 13% share of these highly profitable hotels in the United States, and our lead continues to grow. As of quarter end, we had nearly 30% of the industry's new big-box hotel pipeline, more than any competitor.","One of these new properties is our official 4,000th hotel, the Marriott Marquis in Washington, D.C., a 1,175-room convention hotel with 105,000 square feet of meeting space and connected to the Washington Convention Center, with over 700,000 square feet of exhibit space. Scheduled to open next month, we hope you stay with us the next time you are in Washington, D.C.","Despite these exciting new projects, overall supply growth in the North American market remains low, constrained by high construction costs, tight financing and attractive existing-hotel investment opportunities. But things are slowly beginning to change. The continuing recovery in the CMBS market has freed up some capital, and banks are getting interested in the higher yields made possible by lending for limited service hotels. High-quality brand sponsorship and low leverage are still the norm, but lending is steadily becoming more available. We expect it will be a few more years before we see meaningful supply growth. In fact, given today's strong demand environment, we believe we are only midway through this cycle.","We continue to benefit from lender and owner preference for our brands. At quarter end, our worldwide pipeline stood at over 200,000 rooms, with nearly 40% already under construction. In the U.S., across all our brands, we have a 10% share of existing rooms but nearly a 25% share of industry rooms under construction. Our overall development pipeline still favors smaller markets. Over 65% of our North American pipeline hotels are outside the top 25 MSAs.","In North America, our newest brand is AC Hotels. It's a metro urban lifestyle product transplanted to the New World from our Spanish joint venture. Franchisees love the concept. We already have 28 AC Hotels approved in the U.S. and another 40 hotels in discussion.","In Europe, MOXY is generating a lot of buzz. We already have a dozen MOXY HOTELS in our pipeline, with the first hotel expected to open later this year. We see considerable franchisee interest in this brand, targeted at a high-style, youthful market, and expect to have more than 100 MOXYs in 10 years.","In Mexico and Brazil, development is picking up. We are building 3 hotels in Brazil to kickstart the Residence Inn, Courtyard and Fairfield brands. Total investment should be $150 million to $200 million spread over the next 3 to 4 years, with recycling sometime after opening.","In Mexico, a very strong capital market and new lodging REITs are driving limited-service development. Including our full-service hotels, we already have 23 hotels open in Mexico and 18 new properties in the pipeline.","In the Asia Pacific region, we signed more new build upper upscale and luxury rooms in 2013 than any competitor, and 2014 looks just as strong. I toured at our new Marriott in Osaka and the new Ritz-Carlton in Kyoto earlier this week. These are exciting hotels in highly profitable markets.","In India, while full-service development is tough, Courtyard and Fairfield development is taking off, with 4,000 rooms in the pipeline. Across China, we have roughly 25,000 rooms open and more than 35,000 rooms in our development pipeline under 8 different brands.","The Middle East and Africa region, we completed the acquisition of the Protea Hospitality Group on April 1, adding over 10,000 rooms and launching us to the leading position in Africa. We are excited about the growth opportunities that come with this management team and their brands.","Some believe that our size and global distribution are impediments to our growth. The evidence reveals just the opposite. 20 years ago, we had 5 hotel brand platforms positioned to grow. Today, we have 17. In 1993, we had about 100 franchisees operating our brands worldwide. Today, we have more than 800. In 1993, we operated in 21 countries. Today, we are in 78. In 1993, our international presence was typically 1 or 2 hotels in each country. Today, our market share of branded upper upscale and luxury hotels around the world is impressive: 11% of the market in Dubai, 12% in Paris, 14% in Mumbai, 15% in London, 17% in Rome and 23% in Shanghai. All of this has not only enabled us to grow our system, it is enabling us to accelerate growth of our system.","In 1993, our pipeline was roughly 30,000 rooms. Today, it's over 200,000 rooms. Last year, we achieved a record 67,000 rooms signed worldwide, contracts that we value at roughly $1 billion in MPV, and we expect to achieve another record signing in 2014.","Over the years, the lodging industry has evolved from independent hotels, brands to multi-brand organizations. Marriott has been at the forefront of this segmentation evolution, linking the brands with Marriott Rewards and marriott.com. Today, we have over 45 million Marriott Rewards members accounting for over half of our worldwide occupancy. In the first quarter, marriott.com accounted for over 26% of our room night bookings worldwide or 1\/3 of our transient business, and 40% of our marriott.com traffic came from mobile devices. We've nearly completed deployment of mobile check-in and checkout across the entire Marriott Hotels brand worldwide, well ahead of the industry. We expect to offer this service at more than 1,000 hotels by year end 2014.","We recognize that industry leadership isn't a given. We need to invest and change to be prepared for the future. We have nearly completed a 6-year, 800-plus hotel renovation program for Courtyard, which has meaningfully increased that brand's REVPAR index and improved profitability. At the Marriott brand, we've introduced new service initiatives for our meetings business and introduced the Travel Brilliantly marketing campaign. We are renovating guestrooms, offering better guest room bevs [ph] and completing the rollout of the Marriott Greatroom.","There's a lot going on at Marriott. We're gratified by our stock price performance and appreciate the confidence that our shareholders have in us.","Now I'd like to think things over to Carl Berquist to talk about our outstanding first quarter results. Carl?","Carl T. Berquist","Thanks, Arne. The first quarter 2014 lodging demand was very strong, and worldwide systemwide REVPAR exceeded the top end of our guidance. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.57, ahead of our guidance of $0.47 to $0.52. It beat the midpoint of our first quarter EPS guidance by about $0.08. Roughly $0.01 came from better profits at the own-lease line, $0.02 from the timing of G&A spend, $0.05 from a favorable discrete tax item and $0.02 in favorable interest cost and joint venture results. This was offset by roughly a $0.02 impairment on our EDITION hotels recorded on the depreciation line.","With better-than-expected REVPAR growth in the first quarter, very strong transient trends, improved group bookings, we have increased our REVPAR growth outlook modestly for 2014.","In 2013, our first quarter included a 3-day stub period, which contributed about $5 million pretax to operating income and set up a modestly tough comparison for the first quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact of this calendar change and the $10 million impairment, operating income rose nearly 20% in this year's first quarter.","Courtyard benefited from this strong trend transient demand. Company-operated North American Courtyard REVPAR rose almost 9% in the quarter, largely due to the impact of our Courtyard lobby and room renovation in the prior year.","The Easter comparison helped our group business. Marriott brand group REVPAR at comparable managed properties in North America increased 8%, with over 3% higher room rates. Group attendance exceeded expectations, and cancellations were below trend. Group spending on catering rose an impressive 11%, and food and beverage outlet sales rose 5%.","The group business meaningfully outperformed the competition in the first quarter. In fact, our Marriott brand group REVPAR index in North America increased nearly 500 basis points in the quarter.","Looking across the markets, our company-operated hotels in San Francisco, San Diego, LA, Dallas and Denver all reported double-digit REVPAR growth in the first quarter. Florida markets had strong leisure demand, but tough comparisons to a variety of events last year restrained growth in New Orleans, New York and Washington, D.C.","While we haven't seen an upturn in U.S. government business, government demand seems to be stabilizing, and comparisons should get easier as the year progresses. In any event, given strong transient and group demand, we are intentionally reducing government occupancy in many markets.","Outside North America, systemwide comparable REVPAR rose 6% on a constant currency basis. Systemwide constant dollar REVPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America region increased 10%, with strong performance in Mexico, which was up 13%. Our resorts in the Caribbean increased REVPAR 10% as strong group demand, combined with a cold winter in the U.S., filled warm weather destinations.","In the Asia Pacific region, constant dollar systemwide REVPAR rose more than 6%, exceeding our expectations, with particular strength in Japan, Indonesia, Australia and Greater China. Greater China alone saw REVPAR up nearly 7%, driven by strong results in Shanghai and Hong Kong.","The economy in Europe is improving, and REVPAR rose almost 4%. REVPAR in the U.K. was up more than 5%. Germany rose nearly 4%. But with a weak economy, France declined 4%. First quarter REVPAR at our 13 comparable hotels in Russia declined 1%.","REVPAR rose modestly in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting strong results in the UAE but difficult business conditions in Egypt. Worldwide, systemwide REVPAR rose 6.2%, and our worldwide REVPAR index increased nearly 100 basis points.","Turning to margins, gross profit margins at company-operated hotels in North America increased 160 basis points. Utility costs were unusually high with the cold winter, but improving room rates and food and beverage revenues contributed to the strong performance. Worldwide house profit margins increased 130 basis points.","Total fee revenue increased 5% in the quarter. The longer fiscal quarter in 2013 contributed about $5 million to last year's fee revenue. Base fees reflected stronger REVPAR but were offset by the impact of terminated contracts and a $2 million negative impact on foreign exchange.","First quarter incentive fees were constrained by tough comparisons in New York, New Orleans and Washington, D.C. We continue to expect incentive fees will increase at a low double-digit rate for the 2014 full year. Worldwide, 36% of managed hotels paid incentive fees in the quarter compared to 33% in the year ago quarter.","Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $49 million in the quarter, 9% higher as in the prior year, driven by improved results at owned and leased hotels, partially offset by $5 million of lower residential branding fees and terminations.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $36 million in the quarter compared to $25 million in the prior year. The increase was largely due to the first quarter impairment, as I mentioned earlier.","General and administrative expenses totaled $148 million in the quarter, beating our guidance, largely due to timing items. For Marriott International, our adjusted operating profit margin in the first quarter, excluding the impact of reimbursed cost, increased from 38% to 41%, or 42%, excluding the impairment. We repurchased 7 million shares during the quarter for approximately $355 million. Our average fully diluted share count in the quarter was 5% lower than in the prior year.","Looking ahead, we expect second quarter REVPAR will increase 4% to 6% worldwide. Our second quarter group booking pace in North America for the Marriott brand is modestly higher year-over-year, despite the timing of Easter, and we see strength in corporate and leisure transient business. Across our North American brands, we estimate the REVPAR impact of the Easter shift is about 1 point favorable in the first quarter and will be about 1 point unfavorable in the second quarter.","Outside North America, we anticipate REVPAR will increase at a double-digit rate in the second quarter in the Caribbean and Latin America, as we benefit from strong demand in Mexico, Caribbean and Brazil. Asia Pacific REVPAR should grow at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting strong results in most markets. We expect low single digit growth in REVPAR in both Europe and the Middle East and Africa regions, held back by disruption in Russia, continued weak demand in France and ongoing weakness in Egypt.","For the full year, we expect REVPAR to increase 4.5% to 6.5% worldwide, driving fee revenue up 8% to 11%. Group business is building. 3 months ago, our 2014 North American group booking pace for the Marriott brand was up just over 4%. Today, it's over 5%. Corporate group pace is even stronger. For owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expenses, we expect higher results due to our newly purchased hotel in Charlotte, the leased Protea hotels and higher branding fees all overcoming the roughly $25 million of lower termination fees.","Overall, our earnings guidance reflects approximately $15 million of EBITDA from Protea operations for the 3 quarters of 2014. In addition, guidance reflects roughly $6 million of transaction cost and $7 million of depreciation and amortization of Protea in 2014.","We expect our general and administrative expenses will be flattish in 2014, and we remain intensely focused on controlling our G&A spend. All in all, we expect fully diluted EPS will total $2.39 to $2.53 in 2014, a 20% to 27% increase from 2013.","For full year 2014, we expect adjusted EBITDA will total roughly $1.44 billion to $1.5 billion, a 9% to 13% increase over '13. Investment spending could total $800 million to $1 billion, including about $150 million in maintenance spending and $193 million for the Protea acquisition.","We will remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchase. We expect to recycle $600 million to $700 million in asset sales and loan repayments during 2014, including the sale of the London EDITION and the Barcelona Renaissance, transactions which are already complete. We expect to return $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends this year. Year-to-date, we've already repurchased 9 million shares for $467 million.","We appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] We expect to stay as long as you want to, to answer your questions. Maria, we'll take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just looking at the results, you said REVPAR came in at the top end of guidance, but fee revenue, maybe not as high relative to expectations -- I mean, it was within your guidance. So I guess I'm just wondering, did that have to do with REVPAR in properties that are not in your same-store comp set? Or just trying to think about why that outperformance in REVPAR wouldn't have been in the fee revenue as well. And then just for my follow-up question, just I'm just wondering if you can quantify all the serve risk of the EDITION cost's still going up for the 2 properties that aren't complete, and with your sales price locked in, and I guess that would be all Marriott having to pay for that additional spend. I don't know if you can quantify that.","Arne M. Sorenson","Good questions, Robin. on EDITION, first, we have looked through to the completion of the project and made the best estimates we can. So as we sit here this morning, we are optimistic that we'd captured everything. Although as we've mentioned before, construction risk is retained with us until these projects are completed. And until they're done, the risk will not entirely disappear. With respect to REVPAR and fees and how they relate to the guidance ranges, we've obviously looked at that. I think the -- probably the best single thing to say is that around incentive fees, maybe particularly, there's always a little bit of lumpiness so that as we look at Q1, we had, obviously, a greater weakness in markets like D.C. and New York, which are good fee-earning markets to us. The stories were different in those 2 markets. In D.C., we had the tough comparison to the inaugural in New York. I think we had a Super Bowl that was a little less buoyant than we had anticipated. And obviously, we've got a fair amount of supply growth in New York, which is the one big MSA which has seen supply grow. Where, by comparison last year, we had the Super Bowl in New Orleans, which drove significant performance there. And then you get markets like Thailand. Thailand was down, top line, probably almost 20% in REVPAR in Q1. And I think, on a fee basis, it was probably down more like 40%. That's a comparison to budget, not a comparison to last year. And you roll all those things up and you get a few million bucks here or there, which had some impact to us. All in all, though, we think the fees came in more or less within the range that we would have expected.","Operator","The next question comes from David Loeb of Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wonder if you could just talk sort of big picture about what you're thinking in terms of the potential for acquisitions. What opportunities do you see to, for example, jump-start the growth of AC or EDITION or Protea? And then just kind of one -- my follow-up slot, any implications from Winthrop's liquidation relative to your EDITION Times Square deal? Will that change the structure of the put option for that asset, for example?","Arne M. Sorenson","I'm pretty sure, on the latter, the answer is no. That deal is fully baked and documented. So while I'm not up to speed with the details of what Winthrop is up to, I don't think there's any reason for that to have any impact to us. With respect to the sort of M&A market, I think actually, where we sit today, we are really pleased with the new platforms and the way they're set up for growth. So you talked about EDITION and AC and Protea, specifically. EDITION, obviously, we've got London. We opened last September. It's doing great. We're really pleased with the customer response to that hotel, both on the room side and the food and beverage side. We'll be opening in Miami and the Clock Tower building in New York within the next 12 months, I think Miami later this year and New York early next year. And I think, behind that, we've got another 8 to 10 EDITION hotels. Probably half of those are in Asia. They're great hotels, and we're feeling like the investments we've made in EDITION are paying off and are hopeful that we won't have to make any further significant investments, although we'll continue, obviously, to kick tires whenever opportunities are presented to us. We gave you the statistics for AC U.S. in the prepared remarks. That brand is absolutely sizzling in the United States, with nearly 30 that are signed but another 40-plus which are under discussion. And I think we'll see that our franchisees come in to invest in that brand in a way that is really head-turning. And then Protea, as we've talked about, is a great investment for us, we think, for 2 reasons really. The first is, as a multiple of the EBITDA we're acquiring, we think it's a reasonable transaction at about 10x. And we will be pleased to add that, the accretion impact of that through the P&L. But maybe almost even more importantly, we think that the leadership team and the group of highly engaged associates that they've got in South Africa and Nigeria and other places will bring us tremendous expertise that will allow us to open hotels that were already in our pipeline and accelerate the growth that we've got. And so we sit here thinking that we're in good shape. Now that doesn't mean we won't continue to look at opportunities that are presented. We are really quite pleased with the 3 deals we've done recently on the M&A side: Protea, Gaylord and AC. They're all paying dividends. Each, of course, has its own story in some respects. We're probably a little early in Spain, but I think in some respects, the AC acquisition is going to be really proven out with the growth in the U.S., which we haven't anticipated so much when we did the deal. So we'll keep looking, but we have nothing to forecast at the moment.","Operator","The next question comes from Smedes Rose of Evercore.","Smedes Rose - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask you, on the M&A outlook, as well. But with Protea comes, I think, a number of leased assets. And is that something you would look to sell those lease interests over time? And I was also curious, you mentioned development in Brazil. Is that a joint venture? Are you doing that on balance sheet? And is that -- are those kinds of initiatives something you would look at in other markets as well?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. The lease -- why don't you talk about Brazil, Carl? But the leases in the Protea deal, that's the way the deal came to us. All things being equal, we'd just as soon have management contracts, not leases, for obvious reasons. Part of that is that leases are extremely difficult to recycle. So the expectation that we would sell the lease position, I think, is not one that you should have. We are pleased that the leases in the Protea deal are, by and large, revenue share leases, variable leases and, as a consequence, don't give us quite the same risk that a typical hotel lease in Germany, for example, might, which is a much more sort of hell or high water lease. We think they'll be accretive to us, but the way the math works, it will impact our capacity a little bit, so we'll be watching that. Carl, do you want to talk about...","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, on Brazil, we'll be doing those 3 hotels on our balance sheet. We're working with some major developers in Brazil. The idea, and it's already paid off, is to seed the select-service in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio and develop that, and we've already signed several new management agreements as we started to roll out those brands down there in South America and, in particular, in Brazil.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up on that question on Brazil because does that say anything about the appetite for owner-developers down in Brazil to -- because your brands are established. It's a little different than going out and doing EDITION in order to get that brand going, so I'm a little surprised that you're doing that on balance sheet. And I'm just wondering whether that's hesitancy or difficulty of local developers. My follow-up question is, Arne, I want you to just talk about how you're thinking internally about your share repurchases and what the valuation metrics and you might use to think about when the best time is to be buying stock.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. So Brazil, just to give you a little bit more color on that, we've got a 2-pack of Courtyard and Residence Inn under development in Rio, which we expect will open by the time of the World Cup next year. And we wanted to see that...","Carl T. Berquist","The Olympics.","Arne M. Sorenson","Oh, the Olympics, excuse me. We wanted to seize that opportunity before it disappeared. And it was teed up and ready to go, and so we grabbed it. Then we've got a big Fairfield project in S\u00e3o Paulo that also is underway. Brazil is a bit of an interesting riddle, I think, for us and for much of the industry. None of us have very good distribution in Brazil, at least in terms of number of hotels. I think we're open -- I may get this wrong, and Laura and Betsy will maybe find a way to look and correct me before we finish the call, but I would think we're about 8 to 10 hotels open in Brazil, and we've probably got a pipeline of another 10 or so behind that. And not tremendous strength with the limited-service brands, even though we think it's a market that has huge potential for our limited-service brands. And so we have been working in the last 1.5 years, maybe, or so to get these projects off the ground. Obviously, we'd love to have partners come in and take the equity stake. It's conceivable that we could do that before they open, but the right expectations for you to have is that it will not happen until after opening. And we think, again, because our distribution in Brazil is relatively small, we will -- it is akin to investing in new growth platforms in that market, which is very much Brazilian focused, obviously. In terms of share repurchase, Carl can talk about his scorecard for share repurchase in a way that's more precise, but as we sit here today, we think we're in the middle of this cycle, not towards the end. We don't have anything to tell you about 2015, 2016 and 2017 guidance in this call, but the kinds of things which are driving our earnings and EBITDA growth today, strong REVPAR growth, strong unit growth, great G&A leverage and great capital leverage, if you will, from share repurchase, we think are likely to continue for the foreseeable number of years. And when you look at valuations in light of that, we are convinced that our stock is still a very good, very reasonable and very strong buy. Carl, do you want to add anything?","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, the only thing I would add is that it starts with a capital allocation plan and strategy that you have as part of the company. And when you do that, you take into consideration the macro environment we're operating in, as well as where we're at in the cycle. And you take those things into consideration, as Arne just talked about, and you look at where we think we are in the cycle: as Arne mentioned in his prepared remarks, about midway through the cycle. You look at those things and you look at our capital allocation strategy, which we've discussed with all of you, particularly the fact that, first and foremost, we're going to invest in the business to make sure that we have the dry powder to do the Gaylord deals, the Protea deals, the AC deals, expand the business. But at the same time, that strategy encompasses returning money to shareholders in the form of share repurchase as well as dividends. So all those things go into consideration as we look out as this cycle runs and how that plays into our strategy.","Laura E. Paugh","Oh, and Bill, you can -- to let you know, we have 5 hotels open in Brazil and 10 in the pipeline.","Arne M. Sorenson","Oh, and one last thing on Brazil. The -- while we maybe talked about this a little bit more specifically today than in prior quarters, these numbers have been in our capital investing guidance for some time. They're not new. They're not incremental to the numbers we've given you before.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nikhil Bhalla of FBR.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just a question on the government-related comps getting easier for you during the year. As I recall, last year, I think once you started out strong with groups. And as the sequestration and all that impact unfolded, I think the second and third quarters really bore the brunt of government cutbacks, especially on the group side. Does that mean that you may actually see some easier comparisons on the group side going forward, like second, third quarter?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think -- yes, I think you're exactly right. On government group business, the comparisons get dramatically easier in the second half of the year compared to the first. So my guess is we'll see government business stayed and paid in the second half of '14 compared to second half of '13 up meaningfully. Maybe 10% or some number like that wouldn't be surprising. At the same time, we are already yielding out government transient business. And so when we look at the first quarter chart for the Marriott brand, as an example, government rate is probably up 1% or 2%, but total government volume, I think, was down in the 15% range because we're seeing a number of our hotels yield government business out in favor of higher-rated business. But still, they -- yes, there -- we may still have government business in its entirety down this year, but I think more of that is by choice as opposed to by the forced impact of sequestration and the like.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it. And just a follow-up question on your fourth quarter this year. I think in the last conference call, you had mentioned something about the fourth quarter. It was tracking maybe not so good at that point in time, a little bit more moderate than your other quarters. Have you seen that improvement kind of build up into the -- into 4Q as of this time? Any major changes?","Arne M. Sorenson","We have seen improvement in group bookings really across the spectrum, both bookings for '14 and bookings for future years. But as with 1 quarter ago -- so we sit here this morning with group bookings up about 5% compared to the same time last year for '13. The fourth quarter is closer to flat, and the first 3 quarters are, as a consequence, up more in the, I don't know, 6% to 7% to 8% range, something like that. But that is -- that's where we'd just as soon be. It gives us that much more opportunity to add business in the year for the year in Q4.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. As much stock as the insiders own, is there any move to or interest in lifting the dividend?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, we have, I think, every year in the last few years, at least, moved our dividend roughly with our earnings. We have a board meeting coming up in May, and we'll announce whatever we decide in that board meeting. But I think the last few years, our announcements have followed that May meeting, spring meeting. And that dividend payout ratio, Carl, is in the 30% to 40%?","Carl T. Berquist","30% to 35%.","Arne M. Sorenson","30 -- of earnings. We have not indicated -- and I wouldn't anticipate that we would indicate a meaningful shift towards a dividend repurchase. We obviously compete and operate in a business which has got some cyclicality to it. We have very deliberately talked to our shareholder community about returning capital one way versus the other, and I think what we have heard back loud and clear from folks is that they appreciate our returning capital to shareholders very consistently. But there is not a consistent view that it ought to be more richly in dividends as opposed to share repurchases. So I suspect you'll see us continue more or less the way we've been going the last few years. Last -- maybe I should say the last few decades, I don't know.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up is related to the incremental group demand that you guys are seeing. And I'm interested in -- maybe if you could share with us from the point of view of the companies booking more. What do you think might be giving them greater confidence to lift their group demand? What are you hearing?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think we hear that -- I think there's broad optimism. It's obviously a big world out there, but focusing on the United States, we hear corporate customers with greater confidence about the economic recovery in the United States and has been the case the last few years. I think a piece of that is the atmosphere. To some extent, it's politics. I mean, in the last few years, we've always had a bit of an overhang on fiscal issues, whether that be debt ceiling limits or budget negotiations. And with the deal that was put in place early this year, that, by and large, is off the table. And so that threat doesn't exist. But I think, also, a significant piece of that is more fundamental and is a view that the economic recovery is broad and steady and ought to continue. And so we see corporate customers that are not throwing caution to the wind by any stretch but are prepared to invest in their business and do the things that can be accomplished through meetings, whether those meetings are focused on internal strategy, partners' meetings from big services firms or customer relationships, sales conferences and the like. We also know that our group share across the Marriott brand and essentially all of our brands in the United States, but you look at the Marriott brand, I think our group share is up 5 to 6 points this year and was up meaningfully last year. And so -- a couple of points, maybe, in the same quarter last year. We know that we're taking significant group share, and we are hopeful that's driven both by our service of those group customers in our hotels and our sales force that really services them on the front end.","Operator","The next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","There's been a fair amount of focus on group this morning, and you've mentioned a couple of times the group pace is improving, but it's obviously off of a lower base. Can you just give us some more color on your expectation for group versus transient performance? And do you think there'll be a point where group REVPAR will start to outperform transient for a sustained period of time?","Arne M. Sorenson","A year ago, there was a significant discussion about whether there was a secular shift in -- away from group towards transient, and we kind of resisted that notion then while conceding, at that point in time, that if you look at 20-year trends, you see a shift towards more transient and more leisure, and we would expect those kinds of trends to continue. But as we sit here today, we would say the evidence shows reasonably clearly that group is coming back about the way it should and you'd expect it to, based on prior economic recoveries. Group always takes a bit longer to come back than transient business, and we're not surprised that it's a bit more modest this time, given that REVPAR itself and economic growth itself are a bit more modest coming out of this last recession than they were out of prior recessions. And so we're encouraged by what we see. We also think it's not surprising and not meaningfully different than what we've seen out of prior recessions. Having said that, the way transient and group grow in an economic recovery, group doesn't really, on a sustained basis, outperform transient until transient begins to weaken. And so we are actually hopeful that we'll see transient business continue to grow faster than group as a stayed and paid matter for the foreseeable future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Greff of JP Morgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You all talked about the New York City market in 1Q being -- as a relative underperforming market compared to the overall North America result. Is it all supply related, or is there anything else? And is -- when you look back at the 1Q, was there a big difference between New York City full-service and select-service hotels? And do you anticipate New York City getting any better?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think New York REVPAR for us was between 1% and 2% in Q1. You have 2 things going on in the quarter, maybe 3, actually. One is the comparisons to Hurricane Sandy. So when you look at the New York Metro area as a whole, which is in our New York numbers, last year, there was a lot of extended-stay business for folks that were dealing with Sandy. There was much less of that business this year. And so that's a bit of a headwind. You also had, I think, potentially some weather impact. I mean, obviously, it was a tough winter in markets like New York and Chicago, particularly. We were surprised and encouraged over the course of the quarter how little impact weather seemed to have on our -- the nationwide REVPAR numbers. But I think when you look at New York and Chicago, it is conceivable there was some impact on REVPAR from weather-related events. But having said that, New York, Manhattan supply is growing robustly. And I think full year, we're expecting supply growth in New York of more like 10% than 5%. Those are stunningly big numbers. Having said that, demand for New York is very strong globally.","Carl T. Berquist","Occupancy still runs up around 80% in New York City.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. And this is good for the city of New York. I think it'll make New York that much more attractive a destination. And to add some limited-service hotels, particularly, and some better affordability through those hotels for customers that would like to come to New York is, we think, a very good thing.","Operator","The next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Arne, I just want to follow up. It seems like capital returns have been a big -- one of the big investor themes for this quarter, anyways. And you gave some good color on where you thought we were in the cycle, but one thing Marriott's been very good about it is kind of, as your EBITDA grows, you've kind of consistently added a little bit of leverage to the business. Is there a point in the cycle, particularly as we move into the second half, that you guys begin to maybe reevaluate that strategy? And how do you -- just kind of how do you think about the puts and takes of that versus the fact that your overall credit profile is in -- still in extremely good shape?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. Carl, jump in and just correct me if there's something that you would say differently. But I'd tell you 2 stories. One, 15 years ago or so, 16 years ago, when I became CFO, I know we had a view then that we sort of inherited, which was we ought to hold a bunch of dry powder, just in case. And over the 4 or 5 years after that, I think we looked at that dry powder and saw that if you never used it, actually, you're increasing your cost of capital and probably destroying value. And so you're better off not, we thought, at least the way things work at Marriott, we're better off not simply reserving some of our capacity. A second and maybe contrasting story, I suppose, is that into -- we were buying stock into 2007. In the first half 2007, I don't remember precisely the dollars we spent, but we bought stock at -- in the mid-40s, I would think, in the first part of 2007. And we ended up entering the recession in 2008 and 2009 with debt-to-EBITDA of about 3.25x. And as EBITDA declined, we had less capacity than we might have wanted to have in theory to buy our stock when it bottomed at $11 a share in early 2009. Having said that, many of us have talked about this over the years, there is a reason the stock was $11 in early 2009. We were all frightened that the world was falling apart. And I'm not sure that if you gave us the truth serum and said, if you had been more lowly leveraged in 2009, would you have stepped up and bought significant quantities in the teeth of that apprehension and anxiety, I really don't know what we would have done. Now you put those 2 things together, we think the right general approach is to continue to increase our nominal debt but not our leverage levels so that 3 to 3.25 is about the right kind of target. We have talked with the board and among the management team about, as the recovery continues, it's probably sensible to bring that 3 to 3.25 to 2.75 to 3 or some modest decline in leverage but not to go back to a place where we think we ought to be sitting on dry powder because we could be sitting on dry powder for a number of years and really increasing the cost of capital and destroying value. So all those things to us really mean not only do we think our stock is still a good value, but we still think the financial structure that we've outlined is one that ought to continue in place for the foreseeable future.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, the only thing I would add is, given the strong free cash flow of the company that the company generates every year, it gives us a lot of flexibility. So that cash flows, together with that leverage of 3x to 3.25x, gives us that flexibility to return cash to shareholders and be opportunistic when and if those opportunities come up, we don't find ourself in a situation where we say, \"Hey, we just have too much leverage, we can't do it.\" So I'd just say it's a, right here at this point in the cycle, good place to be.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And my follow-up would just be, yes, I think in the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned a little bit about EBIT growth and developers beginning to come back, particularly for some of the limited-service brands. So the question is simply on when do you think those openings actually start to really come online in the U.S., right? So most of the openings today are coming from overseas. I think we all know that. And then the question is kind of when do you really think that, in your portfolio at least, limited-service openings start to actually show up in the kind of net numbers you guys are reporting?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, this is a little bit of an overstatement. But obviously, the factual piece of it is about 2\/3 of what we're signing in the U.S. today is outside of the top 25 MSAs. And that was the case last year, too. In fact, I think the number was 67%, if I remember right. I could be off a little bit.","Unknown Executive","Yes, I think that's right.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes.","Arne M. Sorenson","But -- and the piece that's probably an overstatement is to say all the rest of it is in New York. We know that, that's not true. But we've already talked about New York a bit, and New York is the one significant MSA that's getting significant supply growth. And those -- the openings in New York are obviously already happening. I would suspect that New York, we could see supply growth decline, not increase. But we'll have to watch that together and see how it develops over the next few years. The limited-service deals that are being signed in the United States, they will start to open in probably the second half of '15 and into '16. But we're still sitting here not looking at much full-service supply growth, and it's not really until you start to see full-service start to move that you get the kind of threat to supply that I think we all worry about. So hopefully, we're -- we've still got a number of years before we see those numbers start to move.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust.","Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just double-checking on your expectations for the timing of the asset sales, first off later this year and then next year. Has there been any change to the EDITION in Miami for the fourth quarter of this year and then selling the New York City EDITION in the first quarter of next year?","Carl T. Berquist","No, the idea would be to close on the sale of the Miami EDITION hotel shortly after it opens, which is anticipated for the fourth quarter, and the close on the sale of the Clock Tower, the New York EDITION, during the first quarter of '15. Residences, they'll close as the contracts close, shortly after the hotel opens.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's not Felicia. It's Anthony Powell here subbing in for her. So just on -- in the first quarter, there was more occupancy growth than I think we expected and I think many other operators suspected. As you look to the rest of the year, how focused are you on driving rate versus occupancy? And how do you expect higher occupancy to impact profit growth throughout the year?","Arne M. Sorenson","We are very interested in driving rate growth and think we're doing that as fast as anybody in the industry. But I think one of the things you've got to keep in mind for the first quarter numbers is Easter shifted from Q1 to Q2 in the comparison to last year, and that has a roughly 1-point positive impact on REVPAR, not entirely through occupancy but included in occupancy. And conversely, it'll have about a 1-point negative impact on REVPAR in Q2.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And the pipeline growth has been very impressive the past several quarters. Do you have a rule of thumb of, say, every 200,000 rooms on your pipeline, how many will open in any given year or what percent opens up on an annual basis?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, we don't really. I mean, we signed 67,000 rooms last year, as we've talked about a number of times before. And I think the guidance we've given you all for openings this year, excluding Protea, is in the 30,000- to 40,000-room range.","Carl T. Berquist","Including Protea. 6%. 6%.","Arne M. Sorenson","Excluding -- 6%.","Laura E. Paugh","5% in...","Arne M. Sorenson","Right, 6% is -- well, you can do the math. So you can see that it takes a while before the higher level of signings we did last year start to open up into the system. But to state the obvious, as more years pass, we'll see, hopefully, growing gross openings coming through because of this growing numbers of signings that we've done.","Carl T. Berquist","And we'll be able to give you a better sense of the longer-term opening schedule when we do our analyst meeting in September.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just on your managed hotels earnings incentive fees, we've seen a nice improvement over the past few quarters, 2% to 3% year-over-year. Can you give us a sense as to where you expect '14 to end? I know you don't give specific guidance to that, but I guess what I'm getting at is, does this -- do those incentive fees gradually inch up? Or are we at the timing of some of those contracts that were signed maybe 5 to 6 years ago that just start to get a bump up or a binary switch-on for some of those incentive fees and how we should be thinking about that? And then on -- you mentioned a couple of times about food and beverage spending, that, that's very important for your full-service hotels, in particular. Are you seeing that in forward group bookings committing to more of F&B, so you feel better about that as you're moving along? And are there any specific pockets of strength that you're seeing on the F&B side?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, let's take F&B first. I think if you look at Q1 actual numbers as opposed to booking numbers, food and beverage was up about 8% compared to the REVPAR up about 6-ish or 5.5%. And that was driven -- I think the group F&B catering business was up like 10%, and the outlets business was up 7% or 8%, something like that, if I remember correctly. And so both are performing well and are the best indication, we think, of what we can expect from group business going forward. Groups, of course, do talk from the beginning about food and beverage spending, but that is often finalized closer to the time that the event actually takes place. And so I think the actual numbers for Q1 are probably a better indication, hopefully, of where we're going and the kind of conversation around the bookings. We don't have a number for you of the number of managed hotels that we would expect will pay incentive fees on full year '14. Obviously, we're off to a good start with about a 3-point increase in Q1 compared to Q1 last year, and we ought to see that incentive fees continue to grow. I think it's obvious -- it should be obvious to all of you, as it is to us, that incentive fees are generally not growing so far in the 20%-plus range over the last few years but at numbers which are more modest than that. And I think that's driven by the amount of capital that's been invested into our system, particularly those limited-service hotel portfolios we've talked about but also a number of the full-service hotel portfolios. Hang with us until the analyst conference that Laura talked about. This is often the hardest thing for us to give you good guidance about, and I suspect it will continue to be one of the tougher riddles we face when we get together in September. But we'll do the best we can to give you a sense how we think those incentive fees should grow going forward.","Carl T. Berquist","Right now in our guidance, Steve, we're anticipating it to go up in a low double-digit growth rate for 2014 for the full year.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker of MLV.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Glad I got in under the wire. Just a quick question, kind of a little bit of a follow-up to Steve's question on incentive management fees. You guys' North American properties had probably margins up 160 basis points in the quarter. Was that in line with your expectations, above, below? If we see that type of growth throughout the remainder of the year, is there an inflection point in incentive management fees where we might see incentive management fees exceed what's currently embedded in your guidance?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I mean, I don't have really anything to add on the incentive fee comment other than what we just talked about with Steve. But I think the margin performance in Q1 was modestly better than we would anticipate. The operating team has done a really fine job. I think we mentioned that utilities costs were a bit higher in Q1 than we would have anticipated because of the colder weather in the North, particularly. But the team really has done well around various kinds of efficiencies in the hotels, in procurement and some other places, in order to drive our margins well, notwithstanding that. There is a lot of focus. We know our owners are keenly interested in leverage from margins at this stage of the cycle, and we're doing everything we possibly can to drive them. I think the food and beverage growth above REVPAR growth was also a piece of that in the actual results for Q1.","Maria, have you got anybody else? Oh, Ryan, I'm sorry, did you have anything else?","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","No, I think that does it for me.","Arne M. Sorenson","Maria, anything else? Any other questions?","Operator","No further questions, sir.","Arne M. Sorenson","Okay, great. Well, thank you all very much for your time this morning. We appreciate your interest and your support.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Welcome to our second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","Let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued today along with our comments are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold.","In our discussion today, we will talk about results excluding merger-related costs, and we'll compare 2017 results to prior-year combined results, which assume Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business were completed on January 1, 2015. Of course, comparisons to our prior-year reported results are in today's press release, which you can find along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website, at www.marriott.com\/investor","So, let's get started. We appreciate you joining us at this late hour. Travel schedules made it difficult to hold this call at our normal 10:00 a.m. time slot. In fact, today we are here in Shanghai at the new stunning W Hotel, having just announced an exciting joint venture agreement with Alibaba. Larger than Amazon in terms of active users, Alibaba has over 500 million active users on their e-commerce platform, giving them tremendous reach to Chinese consumers.","Alibaba's online shopping platform, known as Taobao, or Tmall, makes products available through general sites and storefronts that list the products or services for sale by category and brand. The Tmall travel site, called Fliggy, hosts over 10,000 travel merchants, offering everything from hotels and visa applications to airline services and vacation packages. We are impressed by the power of the Alibaba platform. Through a targeted marketing program late last year with Alibaba, we signed up 600,000 new Marriott loyalty members in just eight weeks.","Drawing on resources from both Marriott and Alibaba, the joint venture will create a new Marriott booking portal on Fliggy with enhanced functionality, enabling Marriott to benefit from the broad reach and efficiency of Alibaba's digital Chinese language platform. The joint venture will manage Marriott's storefront, market directly to Alibaba's customer base, leverage Alibaba's IT and marketing infrastructure, and provide a link between Marriott's loyalty programs and Alibaba's loyalty program.","The Marriott storefront on Fliggy will offer Marriott member rates and the opportunity to earn loyalty points for Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and SPG members. The joint venture should enhance our service for Chinese guests when they arrive on property by enabling Alibaba's digital payment system, Alipay, at key properties worldwide across our portfolio. We also expect to broaden our offerings of guest amenities and services appealing to Chinese travelers to more hotels.","We believe this relationship with Alibaba will enhance the appeal of our products to Chinese guests, further increase Chinese membership in Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and SPG, and make travel easier. With the joint venture, hotel owners should see both an increase in bookings from Chinese travelers as well as a lower cost for these reservations.","Five years ago, we held our Security Analysts Meeting here in China and talked about the tremendous opportunity this country offers. At that time, we noted that China was the third largest source market for outbound travel behind the U.S. and Germany. Today, China is the largest source market for outbound travel. At Davos this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping forecasted that Chinese tourists will make 700 million overseas visits in the coming five years. Not only large and growing, Chinese outbound travel is also maturing. Visa processes have improved at major destinations to facilitate travel and most outbound Chinese travelers are now traveling on their own rather than in a tour group. Fliggy and Marriott will help these travelers find products that are tailored to their interests and offer a seamless travel experience.","We've opened a dozen hotels in China year-to-date, and today we have over 500 hotels and 170,000 hotel rooms open or under development in China. In fact, today China represents 8% of our worldwide rooms and 17% of our worldwide rooms pipeline. Here in Shanghai alone, we already have 52 hotels open or in the pipeline. As we've grown our presence outside North America, we have increasingly tailored our hotel designs and service offerings to local consumers and owners, and embraced technology to enhance the guest experience. This joint venture will further both of these goals by dramatically enhancing our online presence and linking it more closely with the Marriott on-property experience in Chinese for the Chinese traveler.","While we are here in China to announce the joint venture with Alibaba, we are with you today to talk about earnings. Results in the second quarter were very strong here in the Asia-Pacific region. Constant dollar system-wide RevPAR rose nearly 7%, exceeding our expectations. Comparable hotel RevPAR in Greater China increased more than 8%, driven by broad-based strong performance across Mainland China, particularly in cities such as Tianjin, Guangzhou, Sanya, Shenzhen, and many markets throughout Western China.","Food and Beverage revenue in China increased 3%. In the second quarter, China represented roughly 6% of our worldwide fees. RevPAR in India increased 10% with solid domestic and international demand, while Japan's RevPAR rose 5%, benefiting from strong leisure travel during the cherry blossom season. We expect third and fourth quarter RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region to increase at a mid-single-digit rate with some upside potential.","Now, over to Europe; our Europe hotels are benefiting from improving economic growth and greater U.S. demand, driven by the stronger dollar. As a result, Europe's RevPAR rose 7% on strong transit performance in the second quarter. Constant dollar system-wide RevPAR in the U.K. increased 8% with London up 12%. RevPAR in Spain also increased 12% as the economy has rebounded and U.S. demand has increased. RevPAR in Europe exceeded our expectations, as many markets bounced back from recent terrorism events faster than expected. For the third and fourth quarters, we expect RevPAR in Europe to increase at a mid-single-digit rate, also with upside potential.","System-wide constant dollar RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America increased 4% with continued strength in Mexico, which was up 10%. Our resorts in the Caribbean increased RevPAR modestly as travelers returned to the region for the Easter holiday and Zika concerns continued to abate.","RevPAR in South America declined 2% on weak economic trends. For the third and fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR in the CALA region will increase at a low-single-digit rate, constrained by weakness in the Brazilian economy and tough comparisons to last year's Olympics.","RevPAR rose 2% in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting strong results in South Africa, but flat RevPAR growth in the Middle East. Sanctions on Qatar have reduced travel into and out of that country. Weak oil prices and lower government spending in several countries in the Middle East have also contributed to a bearish travel sentiment in the region. We are modeling a low-single-digit RevPAR decline in MEA in the third and fourth quarter.","In North America, first quarter system-wide comparable hotel RevPAR increased 3.1%. In the second quarter, RevPAR rose 0.9% on strong leisure demand, in line with our expectations. Our RevPAR guidance for the third quarter is flattish and we expect the fourth quarter will be up 1% to 3%.","While these growth rates seem to vary considerably, they are less volatile than they appear. Excluding the impact of the Washington inauguration in January and the shifting Easter holidays, we estimate RevPAR in both first and second quarter increased roughly 1% to 2%. And excluding the impact of the shifting Jewish holidays and the DNC and RNC conventions last year, we believe RevPAR in both the third and fourth quarter will also increase 1% to 2%. We would characterize this guidance as steady-as-she-goes. With this steady outlook for North America, we expect worldwide RevPAR will increase 1% to 2% in the third quarter and 1% to 3% for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017.","Our development organization continues to fire on all cylinders. We expect to grow our system-wide rooms by 6% net this year. Our pipeline reached a record 440,000 rooms this quarter, which implies embedded growth of 36% of our current system size. In the second quarter alone, we added 36,000 signed or approved rooms to the pipeline. One third of these new room signings and approvals were legacy Starwood brands and 55% were outside North America.","Today, we have the largest share of luxury hotels in the world with 426 luxury properties and 113,000 luxury rooms worldwide. Upon completion, our pipeline of luxury hotels should add another 200 hotels and nearly 50,000 rooms. That is over 40% growth implicit in the pipeline.","Our brands are strong and continue to be preferred by developers and lenders alike. Based on STR industry pipeline, one in three hotels under construction in the U.S. will fly one of our flags, and worldwide, one in four hotels currently under construction will open under one of our brands. We are very optimistic about the long term. RevPAR is increasing in most markets around the world and our impressive rooms growth will continue to build economics, scale, and consumer preference for our brands.","Our integration of Starwood is on track. While there is much yet to do, guest and owner feedback has been positive. I've said it before, but it bears repeating. I'm incredibly proud of the many people working on this integration, and they have my sincere thanks. We relish the opportunity to demonstrate to guests, owners, and you, what we can accomplish with all 30 of our terrific brands.","Now, for more about the quarter, here's our CFO, Leeny Oberg.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you, Arne. For the second quarter of 2017, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.13, $0.12 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance of $0.99 to $1.03. Fee revenue contributed $0.04 of the outperformance with about $0.02 due to better-than-expected property performance driving incentive fees, and $0.02 due to better-than-expected relicensing and branding fees. Results of our owned, leased and other lines outperformed by $0.02, largely due to a business interruption settlement, termination fees, and better overall results.","Depreciation and amortization was about $0.02 unfavorable to our expectations due to fine-tuning of purchase accounting associated with the acquisition. We expect to finish purchase accounting adjustments affecting D&A in the third quarter.","On the gain line, we recognized about $0.04 associated with the sale of the Charlotte City Center Marriott. Finally, taxes were about $0.04 favorable to expectations, reflecting a favorable tax settlement and greater tax benefits related to stock compensation.","Compared to the prior year, total fee revenue totaled $849 million, 8% over prior year combined amounts. Base fees increased 1%, driven by unit growth and RevPAR improvement, offset somewhat by negative foreign exchange impact.","Franchise fees increased 12% in the quarter, reflecting a 7% increase in franchise rooms year-over-year and growth in non-property fees. These non-property fees include application fees, relicensing fees, and fees from our timeshare, credit card, and residential businesses, which together totaled over $105 million in the quarter, 23% higher than combined results in the prior year. Relicensing and branding fees were particularly strong.","Incentive fees increased 9% year-over-year, largely due to strong managed full-service hotel RevPAR in Europe and Asia, solid RevPAR improvement among managed hotels in North America, and good margin performance around the world. Global house profit margins at company-operated hotels improved 50 basis points during the quarter.","While most of the improved margins were associated with RevPAR improvements in International markets, hotels also benefited from synergies associated with the Starwood acquisition, including OTA and procurement savings, revenue management improvement, benchmarking initiatives, savings on maintenance agreements, insurance savings, and lower loyalty costs. These property synergy savings could further improve in 2018.","Global incentive fees exceeded our expectations by $10 million in the quarter, largely due to better than expected managed hotel performance in North America, Europe, and Asia. For the third quarter, we expect total fees will increase 5% to 7% on strong unit growth with flattish incentive fees. For the full year, we continue to believe incentive fees will increase at a mid-single-digit rate.","Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $102 million in the second quarter, compared to $115 million in the prior year. We saw a stronger year-over-year operating performance from hotels in Anaheim, Hawaii, Tokyo, and Toronto, as well as a business interruption settlement. Profits in the 2016 second quarter included $18 million from seven hotels that have since been sold. Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of expenses, was $12 million better-than-expected, due to the $5 million business interruption settlement, higher-than-expected termination fees, and better-than-expected results.","In the third quarter, we expect owned, leased, and other revenues, net of expenses, will total roughly $75 million, compared to $116 million in the prior year. Our owned hotels in Rio have a particularly tough year-over-year comparison for the third quarter, given last year's Olympics. Profits in the 2016 third quarter included $15 million from hotels that have since been sold. Our guidance for owned and leased hotels assumes no further asset sales this year.","For the full-year, we expect net owned, leased results will total approximately $355 million, compared to $426 million in 2016. The full-year comparison to last year's combined results includes $45 million negative impact from asset sales completed since the beginning of 2016, as well as lower hotel results in Rio and New York and fewer termination fees.","Adjusted general and administrative expenses totaled $226 million, a $21 million decline from the prior year, reflecting continued cost reductions as the integration continues. We expect G&A will total $215 million to $220 million in the third quarter and $880 million to $890 million for the full-year, consistent with prior guidance. We continue to expect to achieve our annualized $250 million in cost synergies by the second half of 2018, including achieving over $200 million in savings in 2017.","In the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 8% over combined adjusted EBITDA in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter 2016 included $18 million from owned assets that have since been sold. We expect adjusted EBITDA will total $770 million to $790 million in the third quarter of 2017. The third quarter of 2016 included $15 million in EBITDA related to assets that have since been sold. For the full-year, we expect EBITDA to total $3.131 billion to $3.201 billion. Full-year comparisons to last year's EBITDA includes roughly $40 million negative impact from sold hotels, including lower profits on the owned, leased line and higher related results on the fee line.","Adjusted diluted EPS in 2017 should total $4.06 to $4.18, an increase of 23% to 27% over prior-year combined results. 2017 investment spending could total $500 million to $700 million, including about $175 million in maintenance spending. This includes the very modest amount we are investing for minority interest in the joint venture that we announced today. We have already recycled roughly $800 million of assets since closing the Starwood acquisition, including the sale of the Charlotte Marriott City Center for roughly $170 million, and receipt of a $60 million loan repayment last week, and we anticipate recycling another $700 million by year-end 2018, although no asset sales beyond those completed are included in our earnings or share repurchase guidance.","With our success in asset recycling, we've returned considerable sums to shareholders. Since the closing of the Starwood acquisition, we've returned over $2.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Through last week, we've repurchased nearly 16 million shares for approximately $1.5 billion thus far this year. Excluding the impact of future asset sales, we anticipate returning over $2.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends for the full-year 2017. This is higher than our expectations from six months ago, due to stronger-than-expected EBITDA and asset sales.","We appreciate your interest in Marriott, and we know the hour is late. So, we'll limit the call to one hour, but Laura and Betsy will be available to take your questions afterwards. They are here in Shanghai, so please send an email and they'll call you back. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible on today's call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for your questions. Your first question comes from Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. I don't know if it's a \u2013 this is something you've looked at, but can you tell what merger savings for the hotel owners ended up adding to your incentives management fees? In other words, where you would have just gotten some percent of that?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, so a couple things. I would say we are very pleased with the margin performance. And in North America, in particular, given the RevPAR environment, I would say the margin performance is terrific. We talked about shooting for something like 50 basis points in margin to get that as quickly as we can, and we see through what we've done so far that we are approaching that for this year. And from that standpoint, that would give us a little bit more on the incentive fee line, but I would say it's probably in the low-single-digits material, and not material, but low-single-digit millions on IMS (21:42).","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And maybe just one quick follow-up on fees. You called out branding and relicensing fees as being particularly strong in the quarter, and I think you raised the full-year by that amount. But was that just a timing issue? In other words, why only higher in Q2 for those things? Because I would think your branding fees would be more consistent, maybe, and would have added to the next two quarters, as well?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","So, a couple things there. First of all, we've kind of got two things going on in the branding fees. One is residential and one is related to credit cards. On the credit cards, hard to predict exactly, but they do seem to be doing well so far. But on residential, they are tied to the sales of residential real estate and, frankly, they are fairly lumpy during the year, where they can be up or down $10 million just based on the quarterly progression of where these sales come. So, some of this is timing related, but as we look through the year, we basically took it and rolled it forward to the rest of the year.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harry Curtis of Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hi, I've got a...","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, Harry.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Yeah, good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good afternoon.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","I've got afternoon for you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","We're not quite sure what time it is here.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Morning for us.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Exactly. So, just a housekeeping item. Do you have the ending share count \u2013 diluted share count at the end of the second quarter?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yes, we do. Hang on a second","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yes, we do. I have it for you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You got another question?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","374 million shares outstanding, and on diluted, approximate basis would be 380.2 million.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Okay. Very good. And then bigger picture question is, getting back to the U.S., we've got somewhat historic highs in occupancies and positive earnings trends at the corporate level, which should combine for a positive pricing environment. And so, I'm wondering, as you think about the next 18 months, are we seeing just the typical EPS growth lag leading to stronger RevPAR, or is there something else holding corporate travel budgets back?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, it's a good question, Harry, and something we talk about quite a bit. I think there are a few factors going on here. I think GDP probably is still a better reference point for assessing demand than corporate profits are. Obviously, they're both averages of lots of economic activity and lots of participants in the economy. But GDP is a broader measure. Obviously, GDP has been quite anemic. The numbers that have been reported initially for the second quarter feel a little bit better at 2.6%. And if they really are meaningfully better, that will ultimately show up in demand. But GDP has been fairly anemic.","Second, I think, is that the occupancy, you look at the quarter numbers are fabulous. System-wide across North America, we're nearly 80% for the full quarter, which is a pretty impressive kind of number. And so, you would expect a little bit more pricing movement. But, I think underneath that, you've got relatively more strength in leisure, which is more price-sensitive than the corporate business is. And I think one of the things we need to keep in mind is, while there are a few iconic companies in the lodging space, it sometimes looks like the industry is fairly concentrated, you've got to remember that we have thousands of franchisees who are pricing their own hotels on a day-to-day basis. And it is a market with radical transparency in pricing. And that may have some impact on our ability to move rates in this cycle compared to prior cycles.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Felicia.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","You all sound very perky for the hour. Impressed.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","We're perky. Yep","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, I'm going to start out with kind of staying on this bigger picture topic and your last answer was helpful. But, I'm also wondering if you're seeing any significant differences in corporate travel spend from different industry sub-sectors. Within your largest corporate customers, could we be seeing just weaker corporate travel because industries like retail, oil, gas, and finance simply aren't going to be generating as much travel as they used to?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I think that's a perceptive question. In fact, all of these averages hide underneath them pluses and minuses that vary dramatically from company-to-company and industry-to-industry. And, obviously, there are industries like oil and gas, the energy environment, which are much tougher than others. But even if you go to the technology space, for example, technology ranges from companies that have existed for many, many decades to companies that are just a few years old.","And when you look across that segment, you'll see that there are companies in there that are being very cautious about travel and very cautious about managing expenses, and others which seem to be spending as if they're having a great party. And that pops up in different ways in different markets. But, I think generally, it leads to a sort of anemic corporate transient business. Especially corporate, which tends to be the bigger accounts, is weaker than sort of what we would call corporate rack rate transient. But even if you look at that and you're not talking about being up a point or so in the second quarter.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, a little more specific, I'm just wondering if we could touch for a moment on the individual property performance. So, luxury and upper upscale, for you guys, performed mostly in line with the STR Chain Scale data. But, peeling back and you're looking at different brands, the W brand seems to continue to underperform, but Marriott did, Courtyard also has been kind of underperforming for a few quarters. So, I was just \u2013 can you walk us through that? Maybe some of it has to do with business, but travel, but just wondering generally what's happening there?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, you've got to remember \u2013 start with the notion that STR industry numbers are being reported as all hotels, not just comp hotels. And so, you're getting new hotels that are just ramping that would not be in our comp numbers. We really are in the second year of performance where we've got true comparisons before we start to report comp. And that singularly is the biggest difference between STR's numbers and the numbers that we would report. We talked about this many times, but the core information to look at is RevPAR Index, and that's how do our hotels perform against the hotels they compete in market-by-market. And there we're performing quite well with modest increases in RevPAR Index in North America, and in other parts of the world, more significant Index, but we're really doing well.","When you look at individual brands or individual markets, you mentioned W, for example, W is, I don't remember the number of open comp hotels in the United States, but it can't be much more than 25 or so, maybe even a little bit less than that. So, it's going to depend on our renovation in the hotel, it's going to depend on maybe a piece of Group business, something else. And it's hard to generalize from that kind of small portfolio anything about performance. We're in this brand-new W Hotel in Shanghai, opened five weeks ago. And when we look around the world, we see a pipeline and a portfolio of hotels in the W brand that is extraordinarily exciting. So, the brand is actually doing spectacularly well.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And on the Marriott and Courtyard side, is it also just anomalies there?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","That would be our true comparisons as opposed to all hotels in the market. Brands are doing fine.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","But, again, it's going to depend a little bit on the dynamics. So, in the second quarter, you've got \u2013 and this will be an impact in the third quarter, too. Marriott skews a little bit more towards Group than the industry as a whole. And so, in quarters, where Group is weaker, we're likely to see a little bit more modest performance of that brand, and in quarters where Group is stronger, just the opposite.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the questions.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Stephen.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. You mentioned the $700 million of asset sales through 2018 that are still coming. Can you just remind us what properties are still being shopped, and how the market for these types of assets has evolved since the acquisition?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure. Good afternoon, Stephen. So, we've still got about 18 hotels that in some way, shape or form over time we'd love to recycle, and 12 of those are legacy Starwood. And if you think about where they are, you're talking kind of broadly in the Americas. So, 10 of them are in the Americas, 4 of them being in CALA and 6 in North America, including 3 in Canada, and then two in Asia-Pacific. And as we've talked about before, it's not purely the market that you're selling into, it's also a combination of things about whether there's a ground lease, whether there are other zoning things going on related to a certain hotel. And so, from that standpoint, we continue to click along through selling the ones that, frankly, have absolutely no \u2013 nothing that needs to be worked out. And then some things that we need to continue to work through several issues related to the possible sale.","But, we continue to feel good about the markets that we're selling into, with the exception of ones like a Rio, for example, where we do have to consider whether it makes sense to perhaps hold on to them for a little while until things improve. But, I think overall, we continue to feel good about the ability to sell these hotels.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. And then turning back to the integration synergies and maybe a follow-up to Robin and Felicia's questions, how should we be thinking about the potential impact from revenue synergies at this point? And what do you think you've seen so far?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I think we're still very early in the process. We are seeing great anecdotal results from our customers. I think the Index performance is really encouraging to us. In full candor, I worried that there could be some dip in top-line performance in the quarters immediately following the close, because of the impact, particularly on Group business from distraction that could have been relevant in quarters before we actually closed the transaction. And what we've seen would suggest that we're performing right through that in a way that's extremely strong. And I think a part of that may be that we are, in fact, taking more share from our customers because of the bigger portfolio here.","It's hard to be definitive about it because we don't have, except through partners and only in a somewhat dated way, share of wallet information. We have what we achieve from our customers, and we obviously can analyze that. And secondly, we are continuing to evolve the loyalty program. So, we need to get to a place where we've got a single loyalty program with the simpler interface with our customers, which hopefully, will take place in 2018. But, at this point, we think that there has been revenue lift, but it's a little bit early for us to claim victory.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. I'll jump back in the queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, good morning to you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey there.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. I apologize if I missed it. Did you say how your Group pace for 2018 is tracking? And also for North America in 2018 as well?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Group pace and \u2013 well, Group pace for North America is all we really have, I think, at the moment. Up modestly in 2018.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Modestly? Okay.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yep.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then secondly, we're starting to hear a little bit about construction delays due to labor creeping into the development process. Is that something you're seeing at all as well?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I think we are seeing the construction process take a little bit longer than we anticipated. And so, the opening seems to have slipped back a little bit by a number of months. We have seen essentially no cancellations, which is a good news. And the other bit of good news is, just looking at very current trends, we are seeing construction starts continuing to move forward with considerable momentum. So, I think the construction markets are tight. I think the labor markets are tight, but the deals are getting done.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Beckel of Bernstein Research.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, and thanks for the question.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Regarding the Alibaba joint venture, I was curious if you could tell us what percentage of your stays outside of China are Chinese guests, and how you think, if you know, that that benchmark is relative to peers?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, let's see if we can find \u2013 I don't know if we've got that, and it's (36:56) worthwhile, but, let's break this down, sort of think it through aloud. There were about 125 million outbound trips by Chinese last year. And that would include very nearby markets, which get substantial visitation, which would be Macao, Hong Kong, for example. But then also markets like Korea and Japan, increasingly resort destinations, Thailand, I'd call out and Australia, I would call out. And, I think in some of these markets, the Chinese are overwhelmingly the biggest visitors. Take Macao as an example. In other markets, they may be \u2013 I don't know if we've got...","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, in the U.S....","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","In the U.S. it would be tiny.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. 0.2 of a percent.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I think the U.S. visitation is about 3 million Chinese visitors to the United States in total. And so, they're going to be a pretty small percentage of business in our hotels or in the industry as a whole. But, in most of these markets, it is going up 25%-ish year-over-year and has been for some period of time. And we see that in essentially all markets around the world. So, it's a bit of a small base in some markets, but the growth is fabulous and I think, it's going to be that way for many years to come.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Just as a reference point for you, roughly three-quarters of the Asia-Pacific travel right now is to Asia-Pacific, to other parts of Asia-Pacific, while the travel to, for example, for our hotels to the North America is 15% of their travel.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. That's very helpful, thanks. Just as a quick housekeeping, can you update us on your \u2013 the components of your RevPAR guide by Group, leisure, and business transient?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","For Q3 and Q4?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","For the full-year...","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","For the full-year, yeah.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","If you're talking about full-year in North America, if you're talking about 1% to 2%, I'd say a little bit higher on the transient side than the midpoint, a little bit lower on Group, but very, very close to each other. So, similar sorts of growth rates.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Greff of JPMorgan.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hello, everybody.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Joe.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just with respect to your Alibaba announcement from earlier today, is this an exclusive deal? In other words, can they replicate this with other hotel brands? And how long \u2013 if it is an exclusive deal, how long is that period of exclusivity?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","There are some features of exclusivity in this deal for a period of time. And that's about as far as we'll go. We have a lot to do together. I think we are going to be focused on doing that together. And we're excited about it. I know Alibaba is excited about it. I think this is a joint venture that would not have happened had we not done the Starwood transaction. I think when the Starwood transaction was announced, Alibaba was one of the companies that saw it and said we are very intrigued by the size of this portfolio, particularly with luxury and lifestyle and sort of the aspirational kinds of hotels that are in our portfolio, and we want to do meaningfully more business with you, Marriott, to help you and to help us. And we think that working together, just the two of us, we can accomplish a lot that's good for us and they can accomplish a lot that's good for them.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And Arne, is it fair to say that the three-year outlook that you gave at the Investor Day doesn't incorporate any of the benefits from this deal in particular?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, that's right. But I think the most important part of the benefits of this deal will be driving hotel demand, which obviously will then come through our P&L and RevPAR and fees and incentive fees and the like. While we could conceivably make money on the joint venture itself, but that is not our primary focus on this. And I would caution you not to build anything into the model at this point until we can give you some more sort of color in that in the quarters ahead.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Right. As I described, Joe, it's a really very modest investment.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And just to clarify, I think your comment you made before, Leeny, about the $700 million by the end of 2018, is that asset sales, or is that all in total capital recycling? And is there a difference? I think there is a difference, but if you can clarify that.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","You know, it is asset recycling as the way we've described the $5 billion over time, but, obviously, that's overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly driven by hotel sales. I mean, there is, as you heard us talk about, there's a $60 million loan repayment that we just received last week from a loan that we had out. But overwhelmingly, it's asset sales.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, guys.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Meliker of Canaccord Genuity.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Ryan.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Ryan","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Just a follow-up on some of the asset questions you guys have had. We've heard from a lot of the REITs during this turning season that liquidity in the debt markets has really opened up. We, obviously, saw a private equity bid for one of the hotel REITs during this quarter. I'm just wondering is with the $700 million worth of assets that you guys have highlighted, you know, I understand from, Leeny, what you mentioned with \u2013 you've got some ground leases, you've got some other complications, is it realistic to believe that a portfolio transaction could be put together? Or do we think that's really off the table and is really going to be more one-off transactions going forward?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","One-off transactions. You've got a wide variety of everything from foreign countries to particular issues on ground leases to different kinds of hotels. Obviously, different kinds of investors who are interested in those hotels, so, absolutely I would say these are going to be onesies and twosies.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then the only other thing I wanted to touch upon was could you give us any color on how things are performing with the changes in cancellation policy that's obviously being going around the industry?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, it's been \u2013 I don't remember precisely, maybe a month, I suppose, since we announced that, maybe a little bit \u2013 June 15, is that when it was? So, six weeks. And what we've heard back has been encouraging. And we're not surprised by that. We did some beta testing in some markets before rolling it out as a brand standard, to see how customers responded to it. Nobody likes incremental restrictions on the flexibility of reservations, but I think most customers understand that we've got a need to manage our inventory and avoid walking people and doing those sorts of things. And as a consequence, the response has been just fine and we think really no impact on the business.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","All right, that's helpful, thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning to you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Thomas.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, just on your North America RevPAR guidance, first half RevPAR guidance \u2013 RevPAR came in at up 2%, and you chose to cut the guidance to 1% to 2% from 1% to 3%, so, can you just talk a little bit more what went behind that? Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, this will be repeating a little bit what I said in the prepared remarks, but if you look at the first two quarters, we reported at about 2%, but if you back out the impact of the inaugural, and obviously, Marriott has got a big presence in the Washington market, we're really running more at like 1.5%. And that's \u2013 essentially you could do that by taking February through June, if you will.","And as we've said in the prepared remarks, if you look at Q3, which we say roughly flattish. Why? Because you've got the loss of the political conventions in July, you've got shifting of July 4 towards even more midweek than it was last year, which makes the week tougher, and you've got the shift in Jewish holidays into Q3 and out of Q4. And so, if you kind of adjust for those, you're probably in the same 1% to 2% ballpark. And you look at Q4, you obviously have the benefit in Q4 of the Jewish holidays having shifted to Q3. So, the reported numbers will be better.","But we see there's still a sort of 1% to 2% range. Obviously, we debated whether or not we should leave our North American guidance at 1.3%, but we couldn't figure out a math that made 3% germane any longer. When you really look at the 1% to 2% reporting, we think that's kind of the pace we're running at. You can't have the results we've had year-to-date be flattish in Q3 and expect that you're going to get to a 3% number, so we thought it was better to narrow the range.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful, thanks. And just a quick follow-up, compared to your prior EBITDA guidance, did asset sales post May 8 have any impact on your new guidance?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yes, it did. If you think about it, the last guidance that we gave included the assumption that you had Charlotte for the full year. It was sold in June, so, as a result, you then drop that out for the rest of the year. Now, that's not a major impact, but it does have a bearing. It's going to be several million.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. That's what I thought. All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Shaun","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. So, a lot of my questions have been touched on, but maybe just one on the guidance and then maybe one on China. But, the one on guidance would just be we've seen, as a lot of people have reported this earnings season, that some of the select-service type brands have underperformed across the industry. And as you guys look at what you're seeing in performance there, how much of that would you characterize as more about the corporate environment? And then how much of that do you think might start to have anything to do with supply?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Oh, I think \u2013 that's interesting. The corporate environment is probably, in some respects, less relevant to the select-service brands than to the full-service brands. It's not irrelevant. Obviously, you've got individual business travelers that are staying there, particularly midweek. But the portfolios are broad. They tend to be a bit more sub-urban, they probably tend to be more in energy markets than the full-service brands would be, and energy, obviously, is an industry that's tough. So, there's some dynamic of this which is about the distribution of that product. Could there be a supply piece to it, too? Of course, I mean, the supply growth which is occurring in the industry is disproportionately in upscale, not in upper upscale. And so that has an impact.","But generally, our view is the sky is by no means falling in the select-service space. These are hotels that are performing quite well and are quite profitable, and when you look at what's happening on the development side, you see that our development partners want to do more of them, not less.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for that. And then, like I said, switching over to China, and you had mentioned, I think, that 6% of your fees right now are coming from China, or something to that extent. What kind of growth rates are you seeing when you kind of add up the fact that you're obviously growing RevPAR extremely quickly at the moment in that market and also probably have a very healthy pipeline?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I could think it through with you, but certainly our fee growth is double-digit in China, maybe mid-teens or something even. But because we are getting 6% or 7% RevPAR growth, which is driving at least the same comp hotel performance, probably even a bit better because of incentive fees, not dramatically different because the way the formulas are, but a little bit better because of incentive fees. And we're growing units at much more than the 6% net, which is our average around the globe. It's probably unit growth more in the 10%-plus range. We can provide that to you supplementally at some point in time, but it's a very healthy growth rate, both in China and Asia-Pacific as a whole.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","I'd say it's probably 13% to 15%.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Crow of Raymond James.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, Bill.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, Bill.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Your comments on your dealings with the larger corporate clients, sets up a pretty weak time of corporate rate negotiations this fall. And I'm just curious, last fall you had, I think, what were very strong results from special negotiated rates, and it really didn't follow through to any incremental business, right? We haven't seen it. So, I'm just curious, going into that period, it feels like we're negotiating from a much worse position. Is that fair to say? And do you focus more on occupancy as opposed to rate in that environment?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","It's a good question. To me, it feels comparable to last year's negotiating session on special corporate rates, maybe actually a little bit better. Don't under-appreciate the optimism, which still seems to exist in the market and in corporate America these days. And compare it to the point of view last August, September, and October, you're talking about a pre-election time. I think there was not a sort of robust optimism. Economy seemed to be producing, again, fairly anemic GDP growth. And I think in some respects, while that fairly anemic GDP growth has continued into 2017, there is still some optimism. You can see it reflected in certainly the equities markets and other places. That will flavor a little bit those sorts of conversations.","So, I think when we get into those negotiations, we will, obviously, start with we're running high occupancies and your profits are good and talking about the terms that are a part of those contracts. And I suspect we'll sort of end up in the kind of range we negotiated last year, although we'll have to see. It obviously is something that we're just starting at this point in time.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful. Arne, real quick, last quarter, you talked about franchise application volumes peaking in 2015 and being flat in 2016 and down in 2017. Has that continued as this year has progressed?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yes, I mean, I talked about the \u2013 that's really about select service growth in the United States and I think we signed more deals in 2015 than we did in 2016, when you adjust, obviously, for apples to apples and new brands and the Starwood merger and the rest, our numbers are continuing to go up because we are bigger with more brands. And there are some tremendous opportunities as we go forward. We look at the strength of \u2013 a renewed strength of Aloft and Element, for example, and what we hear from our franchisees, they are much more interested in those brands than they were in the past.","AC Hotels is on fire in the United States as well as elsewhere, and Moxy looks like a global home run. So, there's some good stuff there. But, when you look at the United States, I think what we see is very healthy steady growth, but probably not at the levels fairly adjusted that we saw in 2015, and I don't think we'll get back to 2015 levels unless the economy with greater clarity improves from where it is today.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Safe travels. Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Wes.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Looking over at the Greater China region, it looks like you have the most demand growth there, but that's the one region where you don't have any pricing power. And can you comment on when you think that region will get pricing power?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I'm not sure I'd say that it has no pricing power.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Right.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","China's obviously a very big market. Asia-Pacific is a very big market. Even you look within China, Shanghai trades very differently from Chengdu, for example. And in years past, what we saw is much greater strength in Shanghai than in a market like Guangzhou, although Guangzhou has started to turn decidedly more positive. And it's driven by occupancy and intensity of demand, and I think we'll see that we continue to have probably more ability to move rates in the strongest markets in the years ahead than we've had in the last few years. But we feel actually quite good about it.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then maybe just looking at that occupancy, it looks like it's only 70.8%, which is still well below the U.S. Not every market is comparable, but do you have a lot more upside on the occupancy there? Are these just assets taking a few years to stabilize?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, I suspect they'll stabilize a little bit lower than assets in North America. But there is, within the comp portfolio, a lot of hotels that have opened relatively recently and a lot of markets which are just sort of being defined. And as a consequence, I think we'll see as they mature that they will continue to build occupancy going forward and that gap probably will shrink to some extent in the years ahead, because we'll have relatively higher percentage which are comp hotels \u2013 sort of truly comp hotels, in other words, stabilized hotels.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, everyone, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Leeny, just to kind of go back a little bit with respect to your incentive fees, obviously, all the parts are in place, your international business is growing well. I believe there was a line in the release that talked about more than half of your incentive fees were obviously coming from outside of North America, and you had about 64% generating incentive fees.","In the first quarter, I think you guys guided incentive fees down 10% for the quarter and obviously grew nicely. For the 2Q, it was flat and grew nicely. For the 3Q, you had commented on flat again. All the elements are kind of in place to see some of the growth that we've been seeing, but it seems like the outlook around incentive fees remains somewhat tempered. Did we pull some fees forward in this year, or is everything fairly linear and we could think about a relatively robust back half, absent kind of the flattish guidance for the 3Q?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","So, really good question, and definitely you point out something that is true, that we have, I think, been fairly conservative as we looked at IMF as we started the year. Part of it, again, if you remember, FX, I think when we started the year, we thought that we were going to end up with a stronger dollar through the whole year, and I think that we have seen some lessening of that impact. We've frankly seen stronger margin performance than we expected in some markets, which has been helpful, and so we've outperformed. There is the reality, the way that we book our incentive fees, that as you go through the year, you have the possibility of having to give some back, depending on the performance of the various seasons during the year. And I think it is the case that in Q3, given the RevPAR that we're looking at, we could see that that happens.","But, as we've said, you've described the beginning of the year, we have moved to where we're talking mid-single-digits growth rate for incentive fees for the year, which I think does reflect the fact that we've had a bit stronger performance on the profit line than at the beginning of the year we anticipated.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. That's very helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great, thanks. Last year at this time, you noted Group for 2017 was pacing up about 7%, and right now it sounds like it's on track for a little bit shy of 1.5%. Curious if that's evolved as you've expected in the last 12 months. And then I think you noted Group for 2018 was pacing up modestly. Like, what's your best guess at how that evolves in the next six months?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yes, it's a good question. I think Group has softened a bit more than we would have anticipated. Now, we always anticipate, when we start a year with mid to high-single-digit Group revenue on the books above the prior year that we'll give some of that back over the course of the year because some of that is about booking earlier, and therefore having a bit less capacity in the year, for the year Group business. But I think to be fair, we're forecasting right now and believing right now that we're going to end up staid-and-paid Group business in the books in 2017 a bit less than what we would have anticipated when the year began. And I think we're seeing 2018 a touch more modest than we would have expected a few quarters ago.","Why? You know, it's probably a little bit the lengthening of the booking window. It's probably a little bit tough comparisons. Think about that 80% occupancy, roughly. And we've been putting a lot of Group business on the books for the last few years, so that gets a little bit tough. But I think there's probably a piece of some corporate cautiousness that is preventing us from posting even better numbers.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And then just as you think about the fourth quarter, I know there's some push\/pull with the holidays, September, October. How is October pacing? And are you feeling really good about that month?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","October will be a great month. Now, part of that is the Jewish holidays that were in October last year will not be in October this year. But the Group business on the books for October, a benefit of that holiday shift, October will be a great month.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","And the fourth quarter will be a great quarter.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I should keep my fingers crossed and knock on wood when I say it that definitively, but October and the fourth quarter as a whole will be obviously a fairly strong quarter, certainly compared to Q3.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","And the difference in Group between the two quarters is marked.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","All right, I think this is the last question. So, have at it.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Thanks for squeezing me in. Good morning to you guys. Arne, you referenced some upside potential in the back half for both Asia and Europe. How should we think about that comment in relation to the full year 1% to 3% RevPAR guidance? Does that imply upside to the guide or are those just \u2013 those two regions are just not really big enough to move the needle?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, I think \u2013 well, they're big. And I think if you look at the year-to-date and you look at the guidance numbers, the relative softness in the U.S. compared to maybe our hopes, I suppose, has been at least offset by the greater strength that we've seen outside the United States. So, while we've brought down, for example, to 1% to 2% instead of 1% to 3%, the North American number for full year, we're sticking at a global system-wide number of 1% to 3% because we think that international contribution is at least as strong as the risks in the United States. How it ultimately pans out, we'll have to see. But we've done our best to reflect the best guidance we've got in the numbers we've give you this morning \u2013 this afternoon, I should say.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Okay. And then, Arne, I thought your point on pricing transparency this cycle perhaps may be holding back rate a little bit. I thought that was interesting. Can you elaborate on that a bit? Are you specifically referring to some of these third-party sites that are monitoring fares? Is it OTAs, home sharing, maybe a combination of all of it? We'd love to hear your thoughts on that.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, I think it's all of it. But it's not particularly focused on home sharing or the disruptors in the space. It's much more about just the ubiquity of information. And I think with each passing year, it becomes simpler and simpler to know the rates at every single hotel, quite simply, within our own system. So, you've got that transparency on Marriott.com just as you do through other platforms. And with an increasing participation in the industry of the franchise community with individual pricing decisions that are being made by individual hotels, I think that's the world we live in. It does not mean that there won't be ability to drive rate in the future. We do have the ability to drive rate, certainly on midweek nights and others where the hotels are effectively full. But I don't think it's quite the environment we might have had in years past where probably there's a little bit more flexibility to do that.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Okay. Well, thank you all very much for your time and attention this afternoon. We appreciate your flexibility, particularly with the schedule change, to pull you in after the markets close instead of as they open. But we thank you, as always, for your interest in Marriott and we wish you the best for the rest of the summer. Get out there and stay in our hotels. We'd love to be able to welcome you.

We are encouraged by our record 67,000 signed rooms in 2013; a significant growth in our hotel development pipeline, reaching 195,000 rooms; and the success we've had with asset sales.","To date, in 2014, we've completed the sale of our London EDITION hotel and our Renaissance hotel in Barcelona and have signed contracts for the sale of the New York EDITION and the Miami South Beach EDITION.","In North America, we opened more than 15,000 rooms in 2013. That is 1 out of every 5 new rooms added in the U.S. industry. Our North American development team signed deals for nearly 34,000 rooms during the year and welcomed 90 new owners and operators to our North American system.","Many are in new markets. In fact, over 70% of the hotels in our North American pipeline are outside the top 25 U.S. MSAs. U.S. lodging industry supply growth was less than 1% in 2013, and STR expects industry supply to increase only 1.2% in 2014, well below the 4% we saw in 1999.","Our 2013 pipeline growth is less a sign of significant new supply and more a sign of our growing market share. We continue to believe we are quite early in this development cycle and don't see U.S. oversupply in the near term.","We added a new brand platform to our Americas region in 2013, AC Hotels, imported from Spain. The first U.S. AC Hotel should open in early 2015. We already have 22 projects in our Americas pipeline for this fast-growing brand and another 27 projects in early discussion.","In Europe, we opened 2,400 new rooms in 2013 and signed development contracts for a record 5,600 rooms. We converted the St. Ermin's Autograph in London and signed the 266-room JW Marriott Venice, which should open by early 2015. We launched the MOXY brand in Europe. We already have more than a dozen MOXY HOTELS in the pipeline and another 15 in discussion. We anticipate opening 150 MOXY HOTELS in Europe in the next 10 years.","In the fall, we introduced our EDITION brand to the U.K. to a great fanfare. We are thrilled by the early success of that hotel, including the fact that the restaurant is booked full for dinner for the next 2 months. Our next EDITION opening in Miami should occur in the early fall and should be a great deal of fun. With our terrific, creative partnership between Marriott and the very talented Ian Schrager, the EDITION brand is building momentum around the globe.","In the Caribbean and Latin America, we opened nearly 1,000 rooms in 2013 and signed nearly 3,000 new rooms, driving our pipeline in the region up to nearly 50 projects. In November, we opened a beautiful new 320-room Ritz-Carlton in Aruba. It's doing very well with vacationers from the frozen East Coast. Last year, we announced 4 new projects in Brazil and signed 9 limited service deals in Mexico.","In the Middle East and Africa, we opened more than 1,000 rooms in 2013 and signed nearly 3,000 rooms. The Protea transaction will propel us to #1 in Sub-Saharan Africa and provide us with local brands and talented people to fuel even faster growth in the region.","In the Asia Pacific region, we opened over 5,000 rooms and signed an industry-leading 22,000 rooms in 2013. In China, economic growth may have moderated, but mixed-use projects continue to offer expansion opportunities, and we are aggressively pursuing the domestic leisure market.","Elsewhere in the region, rapid economic growth and significant travel from China's rising middle class is fueling new development. In the last 2 years, we've seen a doubling of outbound travel from mainland China to our comp hotels in Asia. Incidentally, we expect to open the 1,060-room JW Marriott in Macau in late 2014 and the 220-room Ritz-Carlton in Macau in 2015.","We live the motto, \"Success is never final.\" For many years, our brands have earned significant REVPAR premiums with their competitive set, taking more than our fair share of business in markets around the world, and those premiums are increasing. Our worldwide Smith Travel REVPAR index for our brands increased nearly 1 full point in 2013.","We were the first hotel company to go asset-light and remain committed to that strategy. Most hotel additions to our system have little to no Marriott investment. If we decide to invest in a project, we seek a return on that investment as well as a long-term fee stream. We may prime the pump for distribution, such as our recent investment in EDITION, but we are not real estate speculators. In fact, it is our consistent and long-term commitment to strong returns on invested capital that really sets us apart from our competitors, demonstrated by our 32% return on invested capital last year.","In the past 5 years, despite a significant economic downturn, we have grown our system by more than 20%, while also returning $4 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases and reducing diluted shares outstanding by 16%.","In just the last 7 weeks, we've announced agreements to sell assets totally -- totaling nearly $880 million in transactions expected to close over the next year or so. With such capital recycling picking up, we also expect to accelerate cash returns to shareholders. In fact, we anticipate distributing $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion in dividends and share repurchases in 2014.","Our legacy of relentless improvement continued in other ways in 2013. Last fall, Internet Retailer recognized Marriott as the fourth largest mobile merchant on its annual list, after such big names as Apple and Amazon and well ahead of our lodging competitors. Our total gross room bookings on mobile devices increased 67% year-over-year. And as our customers go digital, our success in winning them goes beyond the booking.","In August 2013, we led the industry in the launch of mobile check-in, making it available in 329 Marriott Hotels in North America. In 2014, the entire Marriott Hotels brand, all 500 properties worldwide, will offer both mobile check-in and checkout. This will be the first brand-wide deployment of this scale.","These experiences are critical to changing the way that our guests interact with Marriott. In fact, success in mobile requires success on 2 fronts: an easy-to-use mobile app experience and flawless execution on property once the guest arrives. That is, \"I easily checked in with my mobile device and my room was actually ready, as promised, when I arrived.\" Our execution success rate on mobile check-in is 98%, and guests are now telling us that they are more likely to stay with us again based upon this mobile experience. One of Marriott's core strengths is executing at scale, and it will be an advantage in the digital age too.","New brands such as EDITION, MOXY and Autograph attract new guests and provide a halo to our entire system, and that system is doing very well. In the 2013 American Customer Satisfaction Index, our combined hotel brands scored not only higher than our lodging competitors, but outpaced our own previous 20 years of strong performance.","At our recent full server -- Full Service Owners Conference, we showcased all that is new for 2014 at Marriott, a new Marriott hotel room design, new offerings for mobile check-in and mobile guest services, new initiatives for fitness and wellness, exciting meetings concepts and new lobby Greatrooms. Owners are excited, we are excited and we think our guests will be excited too.","Years ago, some speculated that we couldn't add more hotels in North America because our market share was already so high. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our unit growth is sustainable, not only in the developing world but with strong brands that work for owners and franchisees in the developed world as well. We would no sooner write off growth in the U.S. than we would in China.","Further, we are seizing growth across a broadening spectrum of product, entering new segments and new markets that are supported by growing customer demand. From Courtyard to EDITION to Renaissance, we have again and again demonstrated the power of our industry-leading diverse brand portfolio.","Now for some more thoughts about 2013 performance and our 2014 outlook, let me turn things over to Carl.","Carl T. Berquist","Thanks, Arne. Well, we were very pleased with our 2013 results. For the full year 2013, diluted earnings per share totaled $2. Excluding the Courtyard joint venture gain in the prior year, EPS was up 22%. Full year fee revenue exceeded $1.5 billion, a record and up 9% from 2012.","In the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share totaled $0.49, at the high end of our $0.47 to $0.50 guidance range. Fee revenue was about $0.03 per share stronger than expected due to better REVPAR in many international markets and strengthening group business in North America.","Better-than-expected branding fees and profits from leased hotels added about $0.02. Our G&A was about $0.06 unfavorable. Although our ongoing net admin came in within $0.01 of what we expected, total G&A was higher due to greater-than-expected legal settlement costs and impairments of deferred contract acquisition costs. We also booked higher development expenses associated with the record level of new development deals in 2013 and expense transaction costs related to the Protea acquisition.","Our tax line helped us by about $0.03, largely due to several favorable discrete items. All in all, removing the noise in the G&A and taxes, it was a pretty strong quarter.","In North America, continued economic recovery drove North American systemwide REVPAR up nearly 5%. We saw very a strong REVPAR in San Francisco, Houston and Miami. The Red Sox, the World Series champions, drove business in Boston.","On the other hand, New York had tough comps to last year's Hurricane Sandy recovery effort. And Washington suffered from, well, being Washington. In most markets, we improved our mix of business and leisure demand was very strong. Group REVPAR at the Marriott brand rose over 4% in the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago quarter, with group room rates up nearly 3%.","Future group business looks even brighter. During 2013, our group sales organization put nearly 7% more Marriott hotel revenue on the books than in 2012. This is business that will be served in our hotels over the next 5 to 6 years.","Booking pace is another way of looking at group performance. It measures how much business is already signed today for 2014 compared to that amount signed for 2013 at the same time last year. Booking pace for the Marriott brand for 2014 is up over 4%, about the same as we reported in September, and corporate group pace is up nearly 10%. Since corporate demand is typically also quite short term, the trend is very encouraging for 2014.","We made significant improvements to our sales organization years ago, and today, one can see the payoff. Our group business outperformed competitors meaningfully in 2013. North American company-operated group REVPAR index for the Marriott brand, as measured by Smith Travel, increased nearly 6% in the fourth quarter.","In Europe, we saw signs of improved economic growth. Fourth quarter constant-dollar comparable REVPAR increased 3% across all our brands. REVPAR of our comparable hotels increased 6% in the U.K. and 9% in Germany. For the full year 2013, Europe represented about 8% of our fee revenue.","In the Caribbean and Latin America, REVPAR rose 9% in the fourth quarter across all brands, but excluding the inflation-driven Venezuela market, constant-dollar REVPAR rose 4%. Good leisure business and group demand drove results in the Caribbean, and Cancun reported double-digit REVPAR growth, concluding the year with a great Christmas holiday demand. Panama continues to report lower REVPAR due to oversupply. For the full year, Caribbean and Latin America represented about 4% of our fee revenue.","In the Middle East and Africa, REVPAR declined 9% across all brands in the fourth quarter. REVPAR growth was strong in Kuwait and Dubai, but we saw significant REVPAR declines in Egypt. In 2013, the Middle East and Africa represented about 2% of our fee revenue.","Our Asia Pacific region saw REVPAR increase 5% in the fourth quarter, with strength in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. REVPAR in greater China increased 3%, with REVPAR at our 13 comparable hotels in Shanghai up 9%. But government austerity measures intensified in Beijing, reducing food and beverage revenue. New supply constrained REVPAR growth in Tianjin and Sanya. In 2013, Asia Pacific contributed 9% of our free -- fee revenue, with about 1\/2 of that coming from China.","Margin performance across our system was outstanding during 2013. Comparable company-operated house profit margins increased 130 basis points in North America and 90 basis points worldwide. Higher room rates and continued productivity gains drove our results. And adjusted for cost reimbursements, Marriott's operating income margin increased to a record 40%.","Worldwide, fee revenue totaled $388 million in the fourth quarter, as REVPAR was stronger than expected in many international markets. Both local and group catering revenue in the U.S. also exceeded expectation. For the full year 2013, incentive fees in North America increased 34%. Incentive fees from outside North America declined 2% due to a tough comparison to the prior year, moderate REVPAR growth in Asia and the turmoil in the Middle East.","Turning to 2014. For the full year, we expect REVPAR in North America to increase 4% to 6%. With little new U.S. industry supply and demand momentum building, we plan to further reduce discounting and drive rates higher. Special corporate rate negotiations for 2014 are largely complete, and comp accounts are showing roughly 5% higher room rates.","We expect REVPAR to increase 3% to 5% at our hotels outside North America, including growth at a mid-single-digit rate in both Asia and the Middle East, a low single-digit rate in Europe and a high single-digit rate in the Caribbean and Latin America. Worldwide systemwide, we expect REVPAR to increase 4% to 6%.","Including the planned acquisition of Protea hotels, we expect the number of gross rooms to increase roughly 6% in 2014 or about 5% net of dilution. We expect fee revenue will increase 7% to 10%, reflecting REVPAR and unit growth. Total incentive fees are likely to grow at a low double-digit rate.","In 2014, we anticipate owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expenses, will total $210 million to $220 million. This outlook reflects lower termination fees, slightly higher preopening expenses and stronger profits from our owned and leased hotels in our affinity credit card. In 2013, owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expenses, totaled $223 million, excluding the impact of $52 million of depreciation.","We expect 2014 depreciation and amortization should total roughly $120 million, with less accelerated amortization than the prior year. Depreciation and amortization in 2013 totaled $127 million.","In 2014, we expect G&A to be flat to down 2% year-over-year. For the full year 2013, general and administrative expenses totaled $651 million, excluding the impact of $75 million of depreciation and amortization.","All in all, we expect fully diluted EPS will total $2.29 to $2.45 in 2014, a 15% to 23% increase. We estimate that a 1-point change in our REVPAR outlook across our system in 2014, assuming it was evenly distributed, would be worth about $20 million in fees and roughly $5 million on the owned and leased line pretax.","For the full year 2014, we expect adjusted EBITDA to increase 8% to 13% to roughly $1.25 billion to -- I'm sorry, $1.425 billion to $1.495 billion. Investment spending could total $800 million to $1 billion, including about $150 million in maintenance spending.","In 2014, we plan to renovate several owned and leased hotels, build a Fairfield Inn in Brazil to launch that brand and to complete the acquisition of Protea. We expect asset sales and loan repayments to total $600 million to $700 million. As a result, as Arne said, we expect to return $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2014. Year-to-date, we've already purchased 5 million shares for $246 million.","In the first quarter of 2014, we anticipate REVPAR will increase 4% to 6% in North America and 3% to 5% internationally. The Easter holiday slides to the second quarter in 2014, which makes for easier group comparisons, but we'll have tough comparisons to last year's inauguration and Hurricane Sandy. We expect first quarter earnings per share to total $0.47 to $0.52.","We are planning an analyst meeting for Monday, September 8, at the new Washington Marriott Marquis hotel. Please mark your calendars. We'll be talking about investments we've made in the business over the past 4 years, a continental management structure that positions us for growth around the world, increased resources for new hotel development that has yielded an amazing acceleration in unit growth and the addition of 5 new brand platforms to our already leading portfolio that should yield more unit growth and guest satisfaction. And we'll be talking about our vision for the future.","We appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] Jackie, we'll take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joshua Attie with Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The REVPAR guidance for North America of 4% to 6%, it seems like the economy is improving, you did roughly 5% in 2013. How did you think about the range? And are there any specific items that are weighing on the outlook or kind of put you toward the low end?","Arne M. Sorenson","I mean, I think thematically, as we start the year, we are building expectations for '14 which look a lot like '13. There are some signs that the economy is stronger now than it was a year ago. But they're not definitive, I think we would say. And so as we've done our planning and budgeting across the system, what we see is REVPAR growth in this 4% to 6% range. That obviously reflects also our distribution of assets, which is very broad. We're talking about 3,000 hotels, I think, across the United States with good distribution in essentially every market, as well as D.C., which we expect will continue to be weak. I think you didn't ask it quite this way, but if we were to sit here today and say, \"Is there a greater chance of outperforming or underperforming?\" I think we'd probably say there's a bit greater chance of outperforming than there is of underperforming. But we don't have the hard data which would cause us to come out and say you ought to start to build expectations above that 4% to 6% range.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And you mentioned some individual markets, and you probably have the best insight into the impact that the new Marriott would have in D.C. Can you just kind of talk about what kind of impact you think it will have on the overall market and your other hotels in that region, I guess, in the back half of this year?","Arne M. Sorenson","I don't think the new Marriott Marquis is likely to be terribly impactful to our hotels or the other hotels. Obviously, the Marquis is a group shop, which will be right next to the Washington D.C. Convention Center, which has suffered a bit for not having a headquarters hotel right next to it. That hotel has obviously been in the development process in one way or another for about a decade. It hasn't been in group sales for quite that long, but we've been selling groups into that hotel for the last few years. And I suspect most of the business that they bring in early will be, in effect, incremental to Washington.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker with MLV & Co.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Just first of all, can you kind of just walk through the depreciation and amortization changes for us? Help me understand. It looks like, from my calculations, that the overall depreciation and amortization based on the changes are up close to $40 million in '13 and more than that versus our expectations in '15. Where is that money coming from? Is that coming from unconsolidated entities or is that coming from somewhere on your income statement?","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. Let me kind of walk you through. Just to step back a little bit, what we plan to do in '14, we're going to be breaking out depreciation and amortization on the face of the income statement to provide more transparency, some better comparability with other peers and also to respond to some other questions from the analyst community. But when we did that and we start doing that, we have to make that consistent with the cash flow statement and then we float it through EBITDA as well. So some of the pieces that we've added there, as you'll see, when you look at the cash flow statement, we've added to the depreciation and amortization number there the accelerated amortization of contract acquisition costs. Previously, that was on a separate line item. It was about $21 million. And just to kind of talk a little bit about that, that relates to about 36 hotels where the contracts were revised or something happened to the contracts that, under the accounting rules, we have to accelerate that amortization. But only 7 of those 36 hotels left the system. The rest of them just had either amended contracts or signed new franchise agreements or something like that. Then we have depreciation and amortization that's in our -- reimbursed by our owners that's on a separate line item in the P&L, but we'll break that out as a place on the cash flow. So I think those 2 items are the items that are kind of new where we're providing more transparency. If you'd like, Laura and Betsy could really get granular with you and walk you through even more of this over the next day.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Okay, that might be helpful. And then also, I was hoping you guys might be able to give some color, if you have it, on when the Protea acquisition was going to close and what type of impact you think that acquisition is going to have to your owned and leased line in 2014?","Arne M. Sorenson","We think it will close about April 1. And I think the -- on a -- we're paying about 10x EBITDA, which we've disclosed. Obviously, there will be both a partial-year impact this year and there will be some closing costs that will flush through the P&L in -- it did in the fourth quarter but also will in the first and second quarters, I think, as well. So on balance, it's not going to be terribly impactful one way or another. I suspect we'll get a net few million dollars a quarter when the dust settles on the transaction costs and the like.","Laura E. Paugh","We -- when we announced the transaction, we said that the price was in the roughly $200 million, and we were buying it at about 10x EBITDA.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Right. I guess I was just thinking about the owned and leased line item. Specifically, your guidance at the midpoint is roughly $45 million above where you ended 2013. So just trying to figure out how much of that might be coming from Protea and how much of that is from your, I guess, legacy portfolio?","Carl T. Berquist","I think you've got to be careful. You've got to add -- take out the depreciation.","Arne M. Sorenson","Part of that is the depreciation.","Carl T. Berquist","Part of that's just the reclass of the depreciation on the base of the...","Laura E. Paugh","Ryan, when we close, we can walk you through it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, can you just talk about the SG&A guidance? It looks like you're guiding roughly flat, and I wanted to understand that a little bit, especially in light of in the fourth quarter, where you talked about higher legal expenses and the impact of some deferred expenses. So if you could just go into a little bit more detail on that. And then for my follow-up, just some trends on group and conference bookings. In the past, you've talked that there was a lot of activity in the quarter for the quarter. Is that still the case or are you starting to get a little bit of a further readout?","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. I'll give you the G&A and then maybe we can try -- Arne can talk a little bit about the group. But Steven, in the fourth quarter, we had several items, as you mentioned, that were unusual. We had the Protea transaction costs and then our development incentives that we paid and the costs of the development, a record development. Just to give you a little statistic, through the third quarter, we had signed about 33,000 rooms, and by the end of the year, we had signed 67,000 rooms. So you can see the fourth quarter -- now obviously, there's always the rush to get rooms signed by year end, but nothing at that level. So it was just a record quarter of signings, drives a lot of legal costs, a lot of developer's incentives, obviously, which are great things. But that kind of was about $10 million more than what we had thought about when we had guided, together with Protea transaction costs. And then yes, we had some extraordinary legal costs that weren't anticipated, about $8 million. And then we had some impairments write-offs of about $6 million and then some other little cats and dogs. As you look forward into 2014, when we're saying we're flat, the direct and indirect will probably be up just a tiny bit relative to inflation and some investments we're making in some areas, especially in our continent structure, where we're hoping to offset those with the fact that these will be nonrecurring costs that we just talked about and just the management of the direct expenses.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. When I -- I'll give you a simpleton's answer on the G&A point to the -- when you look at about $25 million or so more of G&A than we guided for Q4, I think of that as a little shy of $10 million was related to Protea and development, about $15 million was related to noise, nonrecurring, and we probably had about $3 million to $5 million of sort of real G&A spending, which was above our guidance. And as we look into 2014, we are going to be more maniacally focused on managing those G&A dollars, and that's what's leading us to provide the guidance of essentially flattish sort of performance on that line item for the year. If you get to group trends, we end the year, and I think Carl mentioned this in his prepared remarks, with Marriott brand group on the books about 4%, a little over 4%, up from the same time a year ago for '13. We like the pattern of that so when you look at it for the Marriott brand, the first 3 quarters are stronger and probably up in the 6% range, something like that. And the fourth quarter looks relatively weaker. And that's okay because obviously, we've got 3 more quarters before we get to the fourth quarter, and so feel good about that pattern. The other thing that I think we saw as the year came to an end was great December bookings for all future periods. So when you look, not just at what came on the books for '14 but what came on for '14, '15, '16, '17, varies a little bit depending on the brand you look at and the precise hotel you're looking at. But we are looking at essentially record levels of group business confirmed and booked in December, and that just gives us further bullishness that group is doing what it should do as the economic cycle matures, and that is it's coming back. And hopefully, we'll see those trend lines continue in early '14.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Earlier, you had mentioned that the corporate group pace is up meaningfully more than the overall pace. Can you talk about that part of the business? What percentage does the corporate group make of the total group? And then how does the profile of that business look when you take into consideration non-room revenue spend?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I think -- I don't -- you stump me, Joe. I don't know precisely the mix between corporate group and noncorporate group in our group measures. I would think it's material but probably less than 1\/2, although I'm not positive about that. And we will check that instinct to see whether or not it's right and reach out to you and come back with it. I think when we look at '14, and I'm not sure if this totally answers your question, but if we look at sort of budgeted expectations for food and beverage and non-rooms revenue, we would think that they will grow a bit faster than REVPAR but not dramatically so. A few tenths of a percent, something in that order of magnitude.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then back to the 4% to 6% North America REVPAR growth guidance for the year. When you break that between the full -- break that out between full service and select service, is the select-service hotel underperforming the full service?","Arne M. Sorenson","I don't think -- I'm going to quibble with you a little bit about underperforming. I don't think that, that's necessarily a fair characterization because, obviously, the REVPAR index is the single best indication of how well our hotels are performing compared to market. And having said that, based on distribution, based on segment, I would think that full service, on average, will be better than limited service. Part of that is geographic distribution, part of that is group strengths. I think when you get to Residence Inn, particularly with its longer-stay dynamic, we'll probably see Residence Inn towards the bottom end of our REVPAR numbers for the year. But you've got brands like Courtyard, which is also limited service. Courtyard managed portfolio is doing fabulously well as '13 ended. I think a lot of that is the reinvention of lobbies, particularly in that brand. And we expect that, that brand will continue its very strong momentum in '14 and continue to take share, and probably will put reasonably good REVPAR numbers on the books for it. I don't think there'll be a dramatic difference between full service and limited service when all is said and done.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It looks like, in 2013, the percent of hotels paying incentive management fees accelerated a little bit from the increase in terms of the 6 percentage points of hotels, a little bit of acceleration from the 2 years prior. How do you see that in 2014 with another 5% REVPAR increase?","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. Just remind people, the numbers in the fourth quarter, 32% of our hotels were paying incentive fees as compared to 30% the year earlier, and for the full year was about 39% were paying incentive fees compared to about 32%, 33% in the year earlier. I think one of the things we saw in the fourth quarter is because of Asia moderating and the turmoil in the Middle East, most of our incentive fees came from the U.S., which was up pretty dramatically, the incentive fees. I think it was in the 30s. It was very high. I think as you look out into '14 and '15, obviously, as the international markets start coming back, Asia Pacific, Middle East settles down, we would expect those to continue to grow and generate incentive fees. In the U.S., though, I think we're still a little bit away from the limited-service hotels paying incentive fees or other full-service hotels that aren't paying today to start paying. And even if they did, it would be minor amounts. It wouldn't be major amounts coming on. So I think you'll see continued growth. I think we're expecting low double-digit incentive fee growth, and it will come from a combination of those that are paying today domestically, growing as margins grow and REVPAR grows and then more and more of the international coming back online, as well as those that are paying, paying more.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nikhil Bhalla with FBR.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just a question on the brand strategy that you\u2019re following with Protea and MOXY last year. Could you give some sense of what you're thinking for Asia? Are you looking for another brand there? Or are you trying to just grow brands right now in different continents, specific to those continents? Just any color.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, the -- it's a good question. We've obviously been very active in the last 3 or 4 years with new brand launches and new platforms for growth. They've each got a story, and I'm not sure that they necessarily can be simplified into one story for each of those brands. So Protea, the most recent, not even yet closed, is really a -- fundamentally about geography, about growing middle class and growing travel trends in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the opportunity with the team at Protea to do a deal that brought us good existing distribution with a good brand and a great leadership team, a great team of associates in that market that will help us grow, not only the brands that they've historically been focused on, but our brands as well, which are already many of them in the pipeline but I think these folks will help us. And we think of that as probably more of a play on Africa than we do as something that started in the abstract as an effort to add another brand in that market. You look at MOXY in Europe, and in some respects, that too, was opportunistic in the sense that with Inter IKEA, a real estate portfolio and one of our good franchise partners in Europe, we had been in discussions for a period of time about the need for the industry to reinvent the economy space in Europe, which was not a very appealing tale, and willingness on their part to put in a huge amount of capital to invest and to grow a new brand. And that looked like a great place for us to move going forward. When you move to Asia and ask the question that you've asked, I think we would say that we are still growing relatively few of the brands that we have in our portfolio. We've talked over the course of the last year or so about opening Fairfield in India. We did this year in the fourth quarter in Bangalore or maybe the third quarter, I don't remember precisely the opening date. And we've got another 10 or so Fairfields, maybe 15, that are in the development pipeline in India. That's a brand-new brand for that market. In some respects, it is not all that significant that we use the same word, Fairfield, in the United States because it will be overwhelmingly a local brand, and it could have a different name and it probably wouldn't mean that much to us one way or another. You go to China where the growth engine is continuing to accelerate for us. And we're really only growing at the top end, so that's Ritz-Carlton, JW Marriott, Marriott Renaissance and some Courtyards. None of our limited-service brands are really moving, other than Courtyard. And the Courtyards there are full-service hotels; they're big hotels that I think, if they were here, probably would look like a full-service Marriott to many of us. I think in the years ahead, we're hopeful that in China and other places of the Asia Pacific market, we will see opportunities to grow in sort of the moderate-tier market. Whether we do that with Fairfield or with MOXY or with other brands that are already within our portfolio or we add additional brands, only time will tell. There is a simplicity in doing the growth with the brands we already have, which is an advantage and an attraction to that. But we're also quite prepared when opportunities arise, whether it's through the deal market or in some other way, to work with our partners to add new brands if we think we can grow materially in those new platforms. That's a long answer that probably was not quite what you expected but it's a continuing source of conversation here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On the EDITION sales and the binding agreements, did those go through a bidding process? And if so, what kind of other counterparties were there?","Arne M. Sorenson","We had a form of bidding process, yes. We had a...","Carl T. Berquist","We went through that straight with a book and...","Arne M. Sorenson","We had a broker and we had a couple of other players. We actually had a fairly long list that submitted bids on London. We had a few that were aggressive about trying to do something with the portfolio as a whole. It shouldn't surprise any of you that selling London alone would have been much easier because that hotel was very close to opening, and in fact, did open roughly the 1st of September. When you get to Miami and New York, New York EDITION won't open until the first quarter of '15 is our guess as we sit here. And for those of you in New York, you know what it looks like with the elevators on the outside of the building today and scaffolding all around. That becomes a harder task. And I think as we looked at it, we knew we had an option to wait, finish construction and put them on the market where they were open and performing. We're very optimistic about the way these assets will perform. They'll be great hotels. And probably get more on the sale of that, but we would compromise something on the near-term certainty. And again, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're not -- we are obviously interested in getting a fulsome price for these assets after we've taken risk to them, but we're really not in the business of saying, \"All right, let's just roll this for another year or 2 or 3 and see whether or not we had timed the economic cycle well and the capital cycle well for real estate investing and make some profit, which would come through our P&L in one lumpy number that nobody will probably give us credit for anyway.\" So we think we're much better off doing the kind of deal that we've done now with ADIA. We're excited about them. They are already very big partners of ours, and they've got a passion for this brand and we think it will be a great partnership. And we think they will be extremely successful with the investment that they're making as well, which is good for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.","Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a little bit of a follow-up question on the asset sales. Can you just review again exactly what the timing is on all of the ones that you have, what you've completed, what you have coming up and, as well and more importantly, the timing of and amount of the expected proceeds for EDITION? And I think you have one in Barcelona that you've recently sold.","Carl T. Berquist","Right. We've closed on that Barcelona sale. That closed at the end of January and so that one's done.","Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","How much was that?","Carl T. Berquist","We netted about $60 million. And then London's already closed. We netted around $240 million. Miami will close in late '14. That's the hotel part, about $230 million, give or take. And then New York, as Arne said, will be first quarter of '15, and that will be the rest, about $350 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Carl, your commentary on the group booking pace, does that include the new -- the D.C. convention hotel?","Carl T. Berquist","No, it would've been just our comp hotels, comparable hotels, so that wouldn't have been a comp hotel.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then given the strong headline growth we're seeing in Europe and REVPAR in Europe, your European REVPAR guidance just seemed a bit conservative. Just wondering if you could touch upon that.","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, we had, last year in Europe, full year, 1.5% REVPAR growth. Europe, there are places of significantly greater optimism today than a year ago, and hopefully that will come through. U.K. would probably be among those markets. But I actually think the 3-ish percent is about the right kind of expectation to have. If we do better than that, that would be great. Among other markets, I think you've got places like Paris, which are lagging. You've got Istanbul, which had a rough second half in '13 and we'll have to see how Istanbul performs. I think the political controversy there has had some impact on the market. And so let's see how it develops. Hopefully, you're right and we come back and say we were conservative about that. But I would be cautious about being too bullish on Europe before we've got a little bit more evidence to support that bullishness.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. Last thing. Carl, you had mentioned something about the incentives that you have to give developers. Can you just quickly talk about the promotional environment that you are seeing as you're signing contracts?","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. The incentives I was referring to is for our associates, the bonuses they get for bringing in a -- the deals and getting the deals signed, not third-party incentives.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But are you seeing -- what is the promotional environment look like as you're trying to attract deals?","Carl T. Berquist","I think it's great. Our folks are well networked around the world with all the major developers. And in the U.S., we have a great team that's been out -- across the world, a great team. And they've been working with these people for years. We've made some investments in new offices, especially in China and Asia Pacific, and they continue to do well. The other thing is, is that our brands are very strong. So our brands are sought after by developers. They can get them financed and right now, that's pretty important. And with a Courtyard in the U.S. or a Residence Inn, the banks know them, and they can get them financed pretty easy on the flex service. Same with our full-service brands outside the U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Loeb with Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On the Renaissance Barcelona, that was a bit of a surprise to us. We did not realize there was that kind of value embedded in that asset. Are there others in the leased portfolio or in the owned portfolio that you see substantial value in or that you might look to monetize over the next year or 2?","Arne M. Sorenson","The 4 hotels Carl just went through are the ones with -- the only ones you should be paying any attention to, the 3 EDITIONS and the Barcelona Renaissance. We've got a couple of European Courtyards. The most valuable might be worth $20 million to $30 million, something like that. And hopefully, we'll announce the sale of 1 or 2 of those this year too, but they're not very significant.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Rennardson with Jefferies.","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","It looks like your REVPAR in this quarter was 6% [ph], and I'm wondering what was [indiscernible] between occupancy and price. And as occupancy peaks, why isn't the industry able to put [ph] through better pricing than it does? It seems to me that pricing is starting to [indiscernible] starting to come off. [indiscernible] thought on that?","Arne M. Sorenson","Ian, I don't know what there was in your telephone connection, but you sounded vaguely Martian, a sort of pulsing in your words, and I'll confess we didn't get it all. But it sounded like you were focused on driving rate and rate in occupancy contribution to total REVPAR mix...","Laura E. Paugh","For '14.","Arne M. Sorenson","For '14. And I don't know, I think what we'll see in '14 is a continued shift towards a higher percentage of total REVPAR growth being driven by rate. I think in retrospect, we were probably a bit surprised how well occupancy continued to grow in '13 and how much of the REVPAR was driven by the occupancy contribution. And you can obviously see that in the schedules to our press release and do your own math there or see it in Smith Travel. We do see, though, demand continuing to build, and as a consequence, I suspect occupancy will continue to build in 2014. But hopefully, we'll see better pricing power as the year goes along.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Evercore.","Smedes Rose - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask you, with the group having lagged so far in this recovery, and that there was a suggestion for a while that the composition of groups had changed and the way that corporate America does groups has changed. Now that you're seeing a more sustained recovery and it sounds like you're pleased with what you're seeing with the outer years beyond 2014, do you see it more or less in line with what you've seen in previous cycles, or are you seeing kind of the composition of group change?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think nothing stays the same forever, so don't hear us as saying that this is exactly like prior recoveries. But I think it's more like prior recoveries than it's not. Group always lags. It lags to our benefit, to the benefit of group hotels when business -- trends in business is declining, and it lags on the recovery to transient businesses. Transient business comes back more than group. And I think it's done it in a very similar way now. I think when you look at corporate, corporate is probably more similar in its recovery pattern to prior economic cycles. I think it's maybe been a little bit more muted, just as REVPAR as a whole has been a little bit more muted in this recovery compared to prior recoveries because the economy hasn't come back as strongly as it has in prior economies. So a number of you noticed this -- noted this in your own reports, but you look at growth in the middle of the last decade, and we had a number of years where REVPAR for the industry was growing in the 7% to 10% range. And we really haven't seen those kinds of numbers in most of these years. We've been more in the 5% to 7% range, I think. And we, as a consequence, may get more years in this recovery, which would be a great thing. But I think that, that same more modest REVPAR growth has some impact to the speed that group comes back with. Having said that, I think when you look over a 20-year period of time, what we see is a relative growth in leisure at the expense of both corporate, transient and group. And I suspect we'll see those trends continuing. I think part of that is -- these are mostly U.S.-centric comments, but I think a bit of that is about the aging of the baby boomers, who will increasingly have time to go with resources to enable leisure travel. I think part of that is about travel trends broadly. There's a growing group of people around the world who want to see the world, and they want to see that, including with their own dollars for leisure travel. And I suspect we'll see that continue, and so that I -- that 10 years from now, as we're looking at the data, we'll probably see that leisure is a few points more of the total mix in the industry and in our hotels, and that will come, to some extent, out of group. But I think those are modest and very long-term changes. And I don't subscribe to the notion that there is a sort of permanent change, that group is down and out and is never coming back.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Arne, last quarter, you talked a little bit about operating leverage and this being a focus going forward. And I think we see a piece of that obviously, in the SG&A guidance. But as we look back at this past year and we kind of think about buckets of where you spend some of the increase in SG&A, can you just walk us through a little bit about how you prioritize some of that increase when you think about opportunities, both new development, some of the new brands that you guys obviously added, some of the one-time costs and maybe technology expenses? And then as we look forward into the guidance, which ones of those buckets do you think maybe start to either roll off or become a little bit lower, just as we think about that concept?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, that's a fair question. I'm not going to give you a too data rich an answer because -- maybe because I'll get the data wrong. You've got a number of buckets, though. One is noise, and noise did impact us last year meaningfully, and that noise can range from a lawsuit that we paid off in the fourth quarter that cost us $6 million or $7 million, something like that, and is a frustration point. There's nothing about it, which is interesting or potentially recurring to the write-off of investments we've made in management contracts in prior years that -- either for hotels that we had lost or frequently for hotels that converted to franchise or were subject to a brand-new management agreement, and the accounting rules essentially preclude us from transferring the balance sheet balance to that new contract and instead require us to write it off. And so we've got a number of bits of that, and those can be frustrating. And those numbers actually were fairly big, some number of tens of millions of dollars when you look at full year 2013, but are not likely to be recurring, at least on any individual circumstance. The second category of spending would be building up really our leadership teams around the globe to run our businesses. And we've talked about this before, but we have been in a multiyear transition of resources and decision-making and authority from Bethesda to independent operating divisions that are spread around the world. We think it will make us better. We think it will make us faster. We think it will cause us to grow better in those markets. And at the same time, there's some cost implications associated with it. And then I think the third -- and by the way, that category of growth should start to taper. So as we get to the point where we've got the leadership teams there, and I think we are most of the way there, we should see that the growth that we need to incur in spending in those markets should start to look more normal. And then the last thing is we've talked about the brands that we've added. We've also talked about the 67,000 rooms we signed last year. We've put a lot of resources in new growth platforms, new developers that are on our team to make sure we've got the resources to go out and seize the opportunities that are available. And so when you launch an EDITION brand or a MOXY brand or AC Hotels in the United States or Protea, all of these things come with a need to do some things, like new GDS codes for new brands, which are like a $1 million a pop, something like that, and they run straight through the P&L; or brand strategies and articulation of how these brands are going to be distinct; to preopening and some marketing efforts to get these brands familiar with customers. And I suspect we will see the dollars we spend on developers remain fairly steady and grow at a sort of normal rate. If we don't add new brands in the next few years, I think we'll see that we get a benefit from that. And in fact, we don't need to keep spending to -- once the brands get launched, they tend to pay for themselves in a way. The distribution is the primary -- the additional distribution is the primary way of marketing those brands, and marketing dollars are available from the hotels. And so there will be less incremental dollars needed for those brands, which we've already launched. We're obviously not predicting that we're going to be launching any new brands going forward, so I suspect the best set of expectations is we'll see some of that spending come down.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's really helpful. And I guess just my follow-up would be the -- the net unit growth had been, I think, kind of translates or comes out of this, obviously picked up a lot in terms of your outlook. How many years do you think this is sustainable given -- I mean, if you signed a lot of rooms even late in 2013, given the lead times here, it would actually seem to imply that 2015 and 2016 could actually be even better years on a net growth perspective. But how would you think about that without maybe -- without putting too much in -- stealing too much from your Analyst Day in September?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I mean, I -- the 67,000 rooms we signed in 2013 will -- and then 195,000 rooms we've got in the pipeline, they portend a fabulous few years ahead of us. And obviously, you can't take anything for granted, but I suspect there's a lot of good news that's built into those numbers, which will help our model and earnings growth and cash flow growth and all the rest of it in the relatively near term. I think when you look longer term than that and you look at the global travel dynamics, you look at our small share of the industry outside the United States, it's a big world out there, and we've got lots and lots of growth available for us in the decades to come. I made some comments about U.S. growth in the prepared remarks. I've been at Marriott now 17 years, and for the entire 17 years, we have been asked and we have asked ourselves, \"Can we continue to grow in the United States? Are we getting to a point where we've got too much market share?\" And every year, we prove that there is more growth available to us in the United States. And we feel that with more confidence today than probably at any time over those last 17 years. I think when you look at AC and the way that, that's moving, you look at the way the limited-service brands have rebuilt their strength, you look at the response that we're getting in the secondary and tertiary markets to limited-service-brand growth in the United States, which is a place where we haven't focused, where some of our competitors have in the decades of the past, I think we've got great years of growth in the United States ahead of us as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a follow-up question. You gave some of the data about the pipeline basically doubling in Q4, the number of rooms from what was signed in the first 3 quarters. I'm just curious if there was a particular incentive that you put out there, that you wanted those to close by year end or just how that timing came into place?","Arne M. Sorenson","We have -- obviously, we're very deliberate about incentives, but there was nothing unique about the fourth quarter.","Carl T. Berquist","There was nothing.","Arne M. Sorenson","So we didn't pull the whole team together and say, \"We want to prove to everybody that we can make the fourth quarter of 2013 spectacular.\" In fact, we were fairly -- I think when we sat here a quarter ago, we would have guessed that we would do 60,000 rooms or some number like that. And so I think the positive surprise was probably mostly driven by the state of the economy, availability of financing and the typical year-end drive to get deals done. And so it was all good, but not a particularly manipulated result, if that's sort of what you're asking.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I wouldn't have used the word manipulated, but just incentivized, but that's helpful color.","Operator","And it appears that we have no further questions at this time.","Arne M. Sorenson","All right. Well, thank you all very much for your time and participation this morning. I'm sure you can get a sense for our pleasure with the 2013 results and optimism about the future.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Carl Berquist, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Carl T. Berquist","Thanks, Christy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, October 31, 2013, and will not be updated as actual events unfold.","You can find the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","We were pleased with our third quarter results. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.52, above our guidance of $0.42 to $0.46. Some of the improvement compared to our expectations was due to timing, including $0.01 we picked up in fees, $0.02 for termination and branding fees on the owned, leased and other line and $0.01 improvement in G&A. Not due the timing, we had $0.01 of outperformance due to strong results at some of our owned and leased hotels and a favorable $0.03 due to true-ups of our foreign tax provisions and a lower-than-expected tax rate.","Third quarter worldwide system-wide REVPAR was strong, rising nearly 5% in the third quarter on a constant dollar basis. For company-operated Marriott Hotels in North America, transient REVPAR increased 7%, with group REVPAR rising 3%. Transient business benefited from improving mix as high-rated retail business was very strong, and our group business was better than expected due to strong attendance at group events.","Across our system in North America, leisure demand was extraordinary. Third quarter REVPAR from leisure guests increased 9% for the Marriott brand, 10% for Courtyard and 12% for Ritz-Carlton.","In the quarter, we saw double-digit REVPAR improvement in San Francisco, Houston, Miami and Atlanta. Strong overall demand not only drove occupancies higher, it also enabled us to replace low-rated segments such as government travelers with higher-rated customers in many markets. Only in Washington, D.C. did we see a meaningful impact from weak government demand. REVPAR in Downtown D.C. declined about 0.5%, while REVPAR at our hotels across the Greater Washington market declined 6%. Given our significant Washington distribution, the Greater D.C. market alone reduced our North American system-wide REVPAR by about 70 basis points in the quarter. Outside North America, including our luxury brands, third quarter system-wide constant dollar REVPAR rose about 3%. In Europe, strong performance in Eastern Europe offset declines in London, enabling us to raise REVPAR 2%. Excluding the London market and the impact of last year's Olympics, European REVPAR increased 4%. Unrest in Egypt reduced REVPAR in the Middle East by 3%. In the Caribbean and Latin America region, favorable leisure demand drove REVPAR up 7% as greater numbers of groups and leisure travelers enjoyed the resorts in Canc\u00fan. And in the Asia Pacific region, strong results in Indonesia, Thailand and Japan drove REVPAR up nearly 5%. Excluding Greater China, performance was even stronger, with constant dollar REVPAR up 8%.","Total fee revenue was $378 million in the quarter compared to $319 million in the year-ago quarter. We estimate about $37 million of the year-over-year fee revenue improvement was associated with the longer fiscal quarter. Incentive fees were strong in Boston and New York, but were flattish in many international markets and retreated a bit in D.C. You may recall that we booked $7 million in deferred base fees in the year-ago quarter associated with the sale of our Courtyard joint venture. Nearly 25% of our full-service managed hotels paid incentive fees in the quarter, compared to 19% in the prior year. Worldwide, nearly 1\/3 of managed hotels paid incentive fees in the quarter, compared to 28% in the third quarter of '12.","Worldwide house profit margins at company-operated hotels increased 110 basis points as room rates moved higher. These margins are not adjusted for the shifting fiscal calendar, so they're not comparable to our calendar quarter REVPAR stats, but we were pleased with the performance. We expect roughly 100 basis points of margin improvement for the full year.","Turning back to the P&L, owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses totaled $34 million in the quarter, compared to $26 million in the prior year. We estimate the longer fiscal quarter increased results by approximately $2 million. We enjoyed better results at our leased hotels in the U.S. and higher termination fees. Somewhat offsetting this performance, profits from our leased hotel in London declined roughly $3 million due to the tough comparisons to last year's Olympics and preopening costs, which totaled about $2 million, largely associated with our new EDITION hotel.","General and administrative expenses totaled $167 million in the third quarter compared to $132 million in the prior year. The longer fiscal quarter added an estimated $12 million of higher costs, and routine administrative costs increased about $8 million. Operating income totaled $245 million in the third quarter. And our adjusted operating profit margin, excluding the impact of reimbursed costs, was 41%.","Unit growth was strong in the quarter. We opened nearly 6,600 rooms and deleted about 2,200 rooms. Nearly 40% of those room openings were conversions from other brands. We are on pace to grow our system by nearly 30,000 rooms in 2013, and we expect to delete about 10,000 rooms.","This quarter we've modified how we report our development pipeline as a result of the change in an approach at Smith Travel. You can see more detail about this change on Page A-4 of the press release. Essentially, under our new pipeline definition, we are only reporting signed and binding contracts, including signed contracts for conversion. We are no longer including accrued but unsigned projects in our pipeline and are no longer including a hedge.","In the third quarter, our pipeline increased to over 144,000 rooms, with over half of the rooms under construction or awaiting conversion. We applaud Smith Travel for encouraging this approach to ensure comparability and consistency of information cross the industry. We'll be surprised if everyone in the industry doesn't join in this effort to improve the integrity of your and Smith Travel industry's supply forecast. While we aren't including approved deals in the pipeline, to help you better understand the deals on the horizon, we will still provide the number of rooms that have successfully gone through our approval process but are not yet under contract. While not yet signed, many of these projects are well underway, have been approved after an evaluation of the local market and reached an agreement in principle with the proposed owner or operator. The number of approved rooms had doubled in the third quarter, from roughly 15,000 rooms last quarter to more than 31,000 rooms this quarter. We expect to enter into contracts on many of these rooms over the next 3 to 6 months.","Turning to the fourth quarter. We expect North America REVPAR to increase 4.5% to 5.5%. Excluding the impact of Washington, D.C. government shutdown, we believe our North America REVPAR would be about 100 basis points higher in the fourth quarter. North America group revenue pace for the Marriott brand for the fourth quarter is up nearly 7%, due to a strong short-term booking. The timing of holidays in the fourth quarter is favorable with Hanukkah and Thanksgiving Day falling in the same low-travel week. Outside the U.S., we expect fourth quarter constant dollar REVPAR for our entire brand portfolio to increase 1% to 2%. In the Asia Pacific region, we expect low single-digit REVPAR growth despite China government austerity and new supply. In Europe, REVPAR growth should improve as comparisons get easier in the U.K. The Caribbean and Latin America should see continued strong leisure demand and increased REVPAR at the middle -- mid single-digit rate, while constant dollar REVPAR in the Middle East will likely remain challenged. For full year '13, our new forecast reflects some fine-tuning of our REVPAR and G&A outline.","On the incentive fee line, we expect very strong performance at our hotels in New York, Boston, San Antonio and New Orleans. And we expect more hotels globally will be paying incentive fees during the year. Despite the October government shutdown and modest REVPAR growth in many of the international markets, unit growth and higher REVPAR should increase our incentive fees by about 10% for the full year 2013.","We expect earnings per share to total $0.47 to $0.50 for the fourth quarter and $1.98 to $2.01 for the full year. Excluding the gain on the sale of our Courtyard joint venture last year, we expect earnings per share to increase 21% to 23% for 2013 and EBITDA to total nearly $1.2 billion.","To talk more about our 2014 outlook, let me turn it over to Arne.","Arne M. Sorenson","Thanks, Carl. Good morning to everyone. We're pleased with our strong third quarter performance and look forward to 2014. Our budget process is just beginning, so we aren't prepared to offer EPS guidance yet, but there is much we do know. Occupancy rates at our hotels are nearly at record levels in North America, well ahead of industry averages. In the third quarter, we aggressively yielded out low-rated business and saw gains in both REVPAR and room rate share in the U.S. for our largest brands: Marriott, Renaissance, Ritz-Carlton and Courtyard.","In 2014, with little new U.S. industry supply expected and demand momentum building, we plan to further reduce price-sensitive accounts and to drive rates higher. Our 2014 group booking pace for the North American company-operated Marriott-branded hotels is currently up 4% to 5%, a meaningful improvement over the 2% we reported last quarter. We're seeing more corporate business such as training, meetings and new product launches. In fact, bookings made in just the third quarter of 2013 for business in 2014 increased roughly 14% year-over-year. 60% of our 2014 group business is already on the books. Given all this, we expect system-wide REVPAR in North American hotels will likely increase at a 4% to 6% rate in 2014, with the improvement larger -- largely coming from rate.","Most of Europe is growing again. Across the continent, new hotel supply growth should remain under 1% despite higher supply growth in some markets, including London, Berlin and Amsterdam. Given this, we expect constant dollar REVPAR to increase at a low single-digit rate at our European hotels in 2014. Europe contributed about 8% of our fee revenue in 2012.","In Asia, with continued economic growth, we expect mid single-digit constant dollar REVPAR growth in 2014, constrained a bit by recent supply growth. In China, government policies targeting conspicuous consumption reduced demand in 2013. And additional strict guidelines on government meetings and banquets take effect in January 2014, but comparisons will be easier. In 2012, Asia contributed roughly 9% of our fee revenue, with about half of that coming from China. In 2014, we expect constant dollar REVPAR in the Caribbean and Latin American market to grow at a mid single-digit rate. We are already seeing groups returning to Canc\u00fan, strong leisure performance at our Caribbean resorts, and we are looking forward to an exciting World Cup in Brazil next year. We're also hoping for another year of good weather in the Caribbean. CALA represents 5% of our fee revenue in 2012.","In the Middle East and Africa region, unrest in Egypt remains a challenge but, elsewhere in the region, demand was strong. The U.A.E. benefits as a safe haven destination, while Saudi Arabia hotels should enjoy the lodging demand that comes from massive infrastructure development next year. We are modeling a mid single-digit REVPAR growth for 2014 on easy comps, but recognize the meaningful risk in any forecast for the region. The Middle East and Africa region represented 3% of our fee revenue in 2012. All in all, we are expecting 2014 worldwide constant dollar REVPAR will increase 4% to 6%.","I'm sure you have noticed our higher G&A spending. This year, we've increased resources in development and in a number of new brand launches, as well as feasibility and legal, all to drive new unit growth. As a result, 2013 is shaping up to be a record year for new room signings, and we are well positioned for unit growth in 2014 and beyond. When you look at core G&A spending, our G&A includes growth-related investments. In fact, only about 2\/3 of our G&A is administrative costs and those admin costs are running up about 5% in 2013. We expect G&A spending to grow more slowly in 2014.","Next year's room openings should accelerate from 2013 levels, with roughly 5% gross rooms additions likely offset by deletions totaling 1% to 1.5% of rooms. Nearly half of the new room openings will likely be outside the U.S.. In fact, given our strong pipeline in Asia, we expect to open a hotel in that region on average every 8 days through 2016.","We continue to see very little full-service hotel development in the U.S. as the financing environment remains challenging. For limited-service hotels, franchisees are stepping up development with significant equity contributions to make the deals work. We are seeing more development interest in Middle American markets, along interstate highways and in small towns where we are underrepresented today. In fact, more than 70% of our limited-service pipeline projects in the U.S. are outside the largest 25 SMSAs. We do not expect significant impact on our REVPAR from these new unit additions.","Our management franchise strategy, along with the strength of our brands, allows us to expand quickly in a low supply growth environment with minimal capital investment. With the broadest brand portfolio in the industry, we offer owners, developers and franchisees brands that attract guests and deliver results. We enjoy significant REVPAR premiums worldwide as measured by STR's REVPAR Index. And as I said earlier, those premiums have increased this year, including in our third quarter. Owners and franchisees expect our brands to perform, and they do.","But success is never final, so we continue to look for ways to make our portfolio of brands even better. We are extending the success of marriott.com into the mobile space, attracting a new generation of travelers. Our mobile app has been downloaded nearly 2.5 million times since August 2011 and customers have already booked 6.6 million room nights year-to-date in 2013 on mobile devices and tablets. Adopting technology quickly, we rolled out mobile check-in to more than 300 Marriott hotels just this quarter, so guests can use their smart devices to connect with their hotel and experience a faster, more seamless arrival. And earlier this year, we launched Red Coat Direct, which allows a meeting planner to request, respond and connect in real time with our event coordinators on any device.","We invested more than $200 million on our first company-developed 175-room EDITION in London, which opened last month to considerable excitement and fanfare. In its first 6 weeks of operation, results are exceeding our expectations. Occupancy has averaged almost 75%. Room rates are over $425. London's Metro News said that our Berners Tavern restaurant is set to be the defining restaurant of the decade. And we are on track to open EDITIONs in Miami in 2014 and in New York in early 2015. In total, we are investing approximately $800 million in these 3 hotels. We expected that this commitment to the EDITION brand would encourage additional development, and that is happening. Including our EDITIONs underdevelopment, we have 7 EDITION hotels in our pipeline, all subject to signed contracts.","We invested roughly $200 million last year to acquire the Gaylord brand. While integration of these large complex assets has taken longer than we anticipated and government austerity has clearly hurt the top line, Gaylord hotels are benefiting from operational improvements and synergies under our management. We've also seen a significant uptick in year-over-year trends in demand, including Marriott Rewards business. We've added sales resources to pursue the profitable 1,000-plus room night business and expect the brand integration to be complete this year. We're very optimistic about the future. Meeting planners love the Gaylord \"all in one place\" experience. The brand is very strong. They're great assets, and we're committed to their success.","We acquired the AC brand at the beginning of 2011. This contemporary hotel brand has sleek, sophisticated European-inspired aesthetics that bring local culture alive to enhance our guests' experience. Our launch of the brand in the Americas has been warmly received even as demand has been weak at the hotels in Spain and Italy. Franchisees are excited about the brand, and we have 15 AC projects signed or approved on this side of the Atlantic, and we're looking at another 2 dozen sites. We already have projects underway in important markets such as San Diego, Chicago and Miami Beach.","Where we can grow without capital, we will do so. In fact, we announced the MOXY brand earlier this year with Inter IKEA. The brand is focused on the large 3-star segment in Europe and on the millennial traveler looking for style and attractive prices. We've already identified nearly 30 sites, approved a dozen projects and we expect the first hotel to open in Milan this spring.","Occasionally, we will invest capital to accelerate product initiatives in our existing brands. Just a few weeks ago, we acquired the Charlotte Marriott for roughly $115 million. We're going to be using the hotel to prove some new product innovations before deploying system-wide. We expect to sell the hotel subject to a long-term management agreement and will not own it for long.","Finally, we've employed capital to enter new markets. We seeded the India market with a joint venture and have recently seen other developer interest emerge, allowing us to open our first Fairfield hotel this month. We also expect to invest in new hotels in Brazil to see that emerging market. We continue to look at investments in other emerging markets that offer opportunities for long-term growth.","We expect total investment spending in 2013 will total $600 million to $700 million. For some time, we have been modeling about $100 million in asset sales and loan repayments in 2013, but actual proceeds from capital recycling may be higher as we're making steady progress on the sale of the 3 EDITION hotels. We have a letter of intent for all 3 properties in a transaction that would monetize the London EDITION at the contract's closing, which may occur by year end, and the Miami and New York properties upon their opening. We are also working to sell a couple of other hotels, probably closing sometime late this year or early next year.","As much as investments can help drive shareholder value, there typically aren't enough attractive opportunities to absorb our cash flow. So we return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the third quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares and bought back 16.6 million shares year-to-date. In 2013, we expect to return roughly $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and we expect to continue to repurchase shares in 2014.","In summary, we are very bullish about the future. We see great momentum in demand with meaningful group business already on the books. Supply growth is modest in most markets. We are aggressive on pricing and anticipate a 4% to 6% REVPAR worldwide constant dollar growth in 2014. With strong REVPAR growth, mostly from rate, more hotels should be paying incentive fees. Room additions are accelerating as we enter new markets and roll out new brands. We expect to increase our rooms distribution by roughly 5% gross in 2014 alone, with most of that already under construction. We should experience considerable operating leverage in 2014 as G&A grows more slowly than in 2013. Taken together, these elements imply a strong 2014 and attractive cash distributions to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","We appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] We are not limited to 1 hour today and expect to stay until all your questions are answered. So Christy, let's get going.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Arne, since you just mentioned it, as it relates to the sale of the EDITION hotels, can you talk about how the valuation was determined for those properties? And was that a function of construction costs, or was it based on a multiple of forecast earnings performance?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, obviously, the buyer had to get comfortable that the price was fair, and so they certainly looked at forecasted returns on the assets. But fundamentally, it was driven by our estimated cost of completion all in, including soft cost and hard cost for the 3 hotels.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Is there any sort of clawback in the purchase price if performance fell short or...","Arne M. Sorenson","Essentially, no. I mean, the -- it's a long-term management contract. Our risk is really fundamentally about whether it costs us more or less to get these hotels completed and opened than we estimated. We bear the construction risk around cost, which in some respects is purely about cost and in some respects is about timing and how long that capital is tied up in the projects. But that's our fundamental risk. There are, of course, performance termination provisions and others in the contracts, but they're reasonably standard.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harry Curtis of Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","You probably are going to guess that this question is coming. Share repo, I was surprised that you only bought 3.2 million shares with the stock in the low 40s, given that your net debt is up only about $100 million since the end of last year and you've got proceeds coming from the sale of EDITION. So why less aggressive? Why not be a little bit more market -- sensitive to the market prices, I guess, what I'm asking.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, it's a good question, Harry. While -- as we look at share repurchase, we a lot of things into consideration. Our anticipated capital spending and, as Arne mentioned in his remarks, we've actually -- our estimate now is about, on the top end, about $100 million less than what we were expecting. As you look at the EDITION transaction, we are still only under an LOI right now, letter of intent. We're confident that we'll get this deal done, but it's not done yet. But hopefully, by the end of the year, we could get that signed, but it's not done yet. And then we looked at other transactions. As Arne mentioned, we bought the Charlotte Marriott hotel during the quarter. So we evaluated everything. And as we look out right now for the full year 2013, we're looking at returning about $1 billion to shareholders, which is a little higher if you think about the $800 million to $1 billion we talked about before in the form of dividends and share repurchase.","Arne M. Sorenson","Harry, we've talked for years about targeting our debt to EBITDA at about 3x to 3.25x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA, taking into account lease exposure and guarantee exposure and the like. And that's about where we ended the third quarter, in that range. We may pine for the days when the stock was that cheap and we'll miss the opportunity to do it again, but we think to spend the money before we receive it and drive those leverage ratios higher than the target.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, understood. I just wanted to register the comment that the market has an opportunity to give, and I had hoped that you would take greater advantage of it, that's all.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. Thank you for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Arne, as you think about next year and you gave us some color on your REVPAR outlook for 2014, thank you for that. There is a potential that we have a similar government debacle in the first quarter, as we just had. So I'm wondering if that was contemplated in your outlook.","Arne M. Sorenson","No, it's really not. I mean, you can hear we've got about 1 point of REVPAR impact estimated for the fourth quarter of '13. And in fairness, there's still some guess work on that. We would guess that October, hopefully, will contain most of the impact. But you had meaningful disruption particularly around government travel and travel which is loosely connected to government. So across from our offices here is the Marriott Suites. The GM told me very early in the government shutdown that NIH groups had canceled. These are folks obviously working on studying for cures for cancer and that sort of thing, so not the thing you think of immediately when you think about government shutdowns. We'll have to see how that builds. I am hopeful, but it's hard to be confident that we will avoid another government crisis in January or February. Obviously, if we had a government shutdown and the longer it lasts, the less good news there is in that. But that is really not factored into our numbers.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up on your group outlook, I thought it was encouraging that you said that your -- in the quarter for the quarter bookings were strong in the quarter. Do you have any sense if that trend will continue? I know it's so short a term, so it's hard to have visibility. But maybe your sales people are telling you something encouraging.","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, if you look back of the last 6 or 7 quarters, what we see is business booked in the quarter for future periods, up in all but a couple of those quarters. Qs 1 and 2 this year were down very modestly. So not significant, but they were down. And obviously, to be up 14% in Q3 is a positive inflection point. I think it looks more like the quarters we saw in 2012. And hopefully, it gets us back sort of to the trend line that ought to continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Loeb of Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Arne, Carl, can you give us a little bit of an idea about the value of the condos at the Miami EDITION? And in all of these EDITION asset sales, is there any -- are any of the proceeds shared with Schrager, or is that surely on the licensing side?","Arne M. Sorenson","The rough order of magnitude, the condos in Miami are about $100 million in estimated proceeds from buyers. We have about 60% of the square footage that is under contract to be sold already, including one which I think defines the largest residential sale in Miami ever. And the pricing has been about $3,000 a foot, so it's been very attractive to date. Having said that, I think when you -- when the dust all settles and we collect the proceeds from our buyer of the hotels and the proceeds from the residential, our best guess is we're going to essentially recoup our invested capital. And we're not looking at either the residential or hotel side as to drive meaningful booked gains.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And on...","Arne M. Sorenson","And the Schrager piece, by and large, Ian's involvement with us is as a fee earner, not as a capital investor in the hotels, and he will generally not be getting any percentage of capital return, if you will.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Meliker of MLV.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question. In your guidance, you talked about the fact that you've got higher development costs in the fourth quarter to drive unit growth. I guess I'm looking at, if I look at the managed system, it looks like from a managed system standpoint, room counts have been declining I guess over the past 7 quarters or so. Looks like, excluding the Gaylord acquisition, you're down about 3,000 rooms. We know managed rooms generate more fees per room than franchised. So help me understand what's going on in the managed system. Are you being forced to spend more to either maintain contracts, to get new contracts than you have in the past? Are you losing more contracts than you have in the past? Are you pushing properties out that don't meet the standards? Just help me understand what's going on in the managed system. Obviously, franchised is going really well, but on...","Arne M. Sorenson","So it's really a -- it's a tale of 2 worlds in some respects. I think the managed portfolio has been growing the least or maybe even declining in the United States for the longest period of time. And generally, outside the United States, the managed portfolio is and certainly will continue to grow. When you look in the United States, the fee levels are actually not that different. Franchise fees tend to be a higher percentage of rooms' revenues than management fees, at least for base management fees. And so when you look over time, the base and incentive fees are roughly equivalent to the franchise fees. But I think the biggest driver for this is -- I guess I'd identify 2 issues off the top of the -- on top of my head. But one would be that there is a fabulous development in the expertise and quality of our franchise partners, which has been a steady evolution over 20 years or so. They run excellent hotels. And I think as a consequence, there is -- has been an increasing share of capital interested in investing in hotel real estate in the United States, which prefers franchise to the managed formula. I think the second thing that we're seeing is, in the United States, as some of our hotels age, that we're seeing the ability to either we kick them out of our system. So in the quarter, we lost 2,200 hotels, I think?","Carl T. Berquist","2,200 rooms.","Arne M. Sorenson","2,200 rooms, excuse me. That would be a problem. We lost 2,200 rooms. I would say about 60%, 65% of those rooms left the system because of product quality. We really didn't want those rooms in the system. And because 20 years ago or 15 years ago or 25 years ago, whenever those hotels entered our system, we were much more predominantly managed. We are tending to lose, because of age and quality issues, more managed hotels than we're losing franchise hotels, which obviously has an impact in that number. And to some extent, to the extent those hotels can be saved, they often require new capital to come in, a new owner to come in and say, \"We're going to substantially reinvent this hotel and bring it up to current standards.\" And again, because there's a lot of capital interested in the franchise model, we are seeing that often, those projects convert from managed to franchise. Net-net, that's all reasonably good news, because it means the capital is coming in, the hotel is getting reinvented. And it's representing the bands -- our brands really well, and we continue to earn essentially comparable fees what we've done in the past. And if they don't, we're culling the system of the weaker hotels, which obviously is in our interest to do.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","So I think that makes a lot of sense. So just tell me, as we think out to 2014 and beyond and you've given some color on where your system is going to be growing, should we assume that the trends that we've seen over the past couple of years persist where managed rooms stay relatively flat? Franchise is driving the vast majority of your growth? And then as you think about international, if the domestic market is so different than the international market, are there risks some of the stronger operators domestically? I know interstate and affiliation with Jin Jing have looked in China. Are you seeing larger third-party operators start to pop up in China and really trying to push the franchise model?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, it's a big world out there. I mean, I think today, I don't think we franchise a single hotel in China. Let's see, I'll double check this while we're talking. But we I believe we manage every single one. And I suspect it will be some number of years before there's meaningful franchise involvement in that market. That is a question ultimately of what companies are set up with institutional expertise to run good hotels. And we'd be happy to see that evolve particularly as we think about expanding in the mid-market in China. So far, our growth has been very much on the high end. And I think franchise partners confirm there's not a single franchise with some in the China. I think when you look forward in the United States, we are committed to continuing to grow the managed portfolio, but I think we'll continue to see that the franchise portfolio grows faster than the managed portfolio. We do know that we'll have -- you take that Marriott Marquis in Washington, D.C. as an example. That's roughly 1,000 rooms that will be managed, which will be opening roughly at the beginning of the second quarter next year. And I think we'll continue to see that we add occasionally big urban or a high end resort destinations which are Marriott managed. And hopefully we'll see that those numbers grow the managed system in the United States as we go forward.","Carl T. Berquist","I think the area where we'll see franchise growing at rapid pace is in our select-service brand, where most of those that are coming on, are coming on as franchise property.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joel Simkins of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Joel H. Simkins - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In terms of the domestic incentive fees, can you just remind us what percentage have paid out a fee in the third quarter? And also as we think about just the overall backdrop of increase of hotel profitability, should this start to be viewed as a step function increase into 2014?","Arne M. Sorenson","The...","Carl T. Berquist","Total domestic paying fees in the quarter was 16% compared to 12% in the prior year.","Arne M. Sorenson","That's percentage of all managed hotels in the United States. And recall that when you look at numbers of hotels, we've got portfolios like that Courtyard portfolio, which we've talked about many times in the past, which is about 120 hotels. Not one of them is paying incentive fees. It's actually their -- a pooled formula.","Carl T. Berquist","100 [ph].","Arne M. Sorenson","So we'll go from 0 to 100% at some point in time. But until we do, that's a big number that will keep the total percentage down. I think as we go forward, we expect that 2013, when the dust settles on the year, we will post nominally higher REVPAR than 2007 for most of our brands and most hotels. That's nominal. So we've had 6 years worth of wage and health care benefits and other cost growth, which means our hotel-level margins are still lower than they were in 2007. And it will probably be still another couple of years before we get back to margins, which are comparable to what we had in 2007. That would get us back to the same dollar level of incentive fees if no incremental capital had been invested in those hotels. And we know that, for example with that Courtyard portfolio, we've got new capital that's been invested and that capital, under the U.S. incentive fees formulas that prevailed, will deserve its return before we start to get incentive fees. All of that tells us that we'd expect to get back to the same dollars of incentive fees in the United States as we had in 2007. It's probably still a bit beyond that couple-year target for margins. And is it a linear function between now and that time 3 or 4 years from now or a step function? We'll have to see how that evolves. I would think the portfolio is big enough that, that's probably more linear than it is a dramatic shift in any particular year.","Carl T. Berquist","I think the only thing I would add there is as sad as you look at the portfolio, with all the growth outside the U.S., the incentive fee growth from international properties will continue to accelerate during that time period. So although you ultimately get back to the nominal dollars that Arne was talking about domestically, you'll also substantially increase the incentive fees from the international growth during that time period. Where in fact, we see over the next couple of years, the international incentive fees being larger than the domestic fees as a percentage.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Greff of JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Your prior comments dovetail nicely with my question. Looking at your commentary about Asia Pacific growing mid-single digit constant dollar in 2014, what would that translate into Asia Pacific year-over-year in incentive management fee growth? What's the operating leverage there? Just to get a sense of that.","Arne M. Sorenson","That's good question. I'm not sure we can give you that answer. The mid-single -- sort of low-single-digit growth would imply incentive fees on the same-hotel basis growing at only about the same percentage as revenues. So if you said REVPAR was growing 3%, margins are probably flattish. And as a consequence, you get incentive fees on a same-store basis up about the same as REVPAR numbers. And then in addition to that because of the way the international incentive fees work, which is we tend to get paid our share from the first dollar of profits, the new unit growth should almost immediately start to drive incremental incentive fee performance. And our new unit growth in Asia will be faster than our average unit growth for the company as a whole. We're probably talking about high-single-digits unit growth in Asia. And so that may drive something like 10% to 15% I suppose all-in incentive fee growth in some of those Asian markets, even on a 3-ish kind of REVPAR growth.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Excellent. And then just going back to definitely a more positive group commentary than just a quarter ago. When you look at the mix of the group that's booking at a much faster pace, is that still a -- is there still a wide divergence between sort of the smaller group and the larger groups?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think the smaller the group, probably the stronger. But we're seeing improvements really in all segments. I think what we've seen this year -- across our system, we know that we're taking significant group share. So our group business has meaningfully outperformed group business with the industry as a whole. Where we see the strongest performance is in our core hotels. So that's full-service hotels, but full-service hotels that are between 250 and 400 to 500 rooms. And they have obviously on average groups that are a bit smaller than the hotels, which are 1,000 to 2,000 rooms. A piece of that is also probably about the markets that they're in, because those core hotels are going to be maybe a little bit less long-haul markets, a little bit less national-driven group markets and a little bit more regional markets and that -- and probably a bit more corporate business as opposed to association business. And that's where the relative strength is, but the improvement is a generally across the group spectrum.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Arne, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned operating leverage a couple times, which I think is kind of a new addition to the script. Could you talk a little bit more about maybe some of the drivers on that in 2014? Specifically, I think you said, kind of core administrative costs up 5% this year, which still, given kind of the tepid economic growth that we're seeing out there, seems a little high, so to me at least. So I was just kind of wondering, do you think that number is lower? Or is it more on lapping some of the growth initiatives that you're doing in the new brands in international development that starts to bring the SG&A growth down.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I agree with your comments. I mean, I think the core 5% growth that we're estimating for 2013, we're saying that, that core admin growth, we expect to grow more slowly than that in 2014. And we are committed to driving some operating leverage through our P&L in addition to the hotel P&Ls that we manage and hope that we can do that in 2014. We have made a very deliberate effort in 2012 and in 2013 to invest in growth. And you heard us talk a lot about that this morning in the prepared remarks, a significant chunk particularly when you look at 2013 has been the investments we've made in growing our development pipeline. That's both investing in new brand platforms like MOXY and AC Hotels in the United States and Fairfield in India. It's also about investing in our development team, and they are going to have a spectacular year this year. So they're going to do well from a compensation perspective, and we're thrilled to be able to pay them that for the production that they've delivered. I think more in '12 than in '13, but it has -- it continues in '13, we've also invested in our teams around world. So a few years back, we were not staffed with senior continent-based presidents and integrated teams around the world. We have them now. We think they are delivering benefits in both way they're driving REVPAR index performance in their existing portfolios around the world and the way that there delivering growth. I -- we're optimistic that those kinds of investments are a bit more of a step function made in '12 and '13 and will not require us to continue to increase on that sort of steady basis going forward. And so that we should get more G&A leverage in '14 and beyond.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. And then I guess just -- as the follow-up there, so when you think about our -- the growth component of those investments, there are things on the horizon that you are still looking at to kind of complement the brand portfolio and whatnot? Or is 2014 a year in which you can really kind of focus on what you -- focus on what we have in driving the performance, because you got all the kind of pieces in place?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, we continue to look always at things. You've all heard me say this before, but when asked these kinds of questions 5 years ago, about whether we were completing our brand lineup, I would have said, in fact, did say that I thought we were reasonably complete and I wouldn't see us adding a whole lot more. That's what I thought at the time notwithstanding that we've added AC Hotels, we've added Gaylord, we've added the Autograph, we've added MOXY. And I am optimistic that we'll continue to add brands. I don't think it will be 2 or 3 a year, which seems to be what we've done recently. But I suspect we'll continue to add some regional or local brands as we go forward to make sure we're getting as much of that global growth as we can. We're always going to be driven by whether or not those investments we think give us not just better returns from the customer capital, but really give us new platforms that allow us to get to a place where we can grow by adding units essentially with no capital investment or very, very slight capital investment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Looking at your REVPAR guidance for 2014, it's a little bit lower growth rate than some other guidance out there, despite the fact that you have greater exposure to the North American markets, which is performing better than the international markets in terms of REVPAR growth. So while I -- of course I would not ask you to comment anyone else's guidance. Is there anything in your assumptions -- it sounds like you mentioned that a potential shutdown is not in there. Is there a mix impact or something that makes it maybe not totally comparable, where the recent mix impact that is meeting some of your REVPAR growth?","Arne M. Sorenson","So it is almost impossible to comment on somebody else's forecast for 2014. We've seen some of the notes that many of you published the last 12 hours or so speculating on this. Some of it ascribes the difference to our greater D.C. distribution and\/or our greater reliance on group. Some of you have ascribed it to maybe we're a bit more conservative than some others who are in the industry. It's hard to really say what went into the calculus that somebody else did. We've looked...","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I know, if I didn't say [indiscernible] I was saying specifically, I realized that you wouldn't comment on that. It's really more your assumption.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, and so we've done the best we can, looking at group business on the books, looking at where we think transient rates are going to continue to move, and looking at how we can continue to shift more and more of that transient business towards higher-rated segments in the hotels, which we expect we'll do. We think we'll probably continue to see that our special corporate account shrinks in terms of volume contribution to the U.S. hotels as we try and yield out some of the weaker accounts and push them more towards rack rating that greater business. But 4 to 6 is the best indication we can give you now.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just to clarify, is there any mix impact that is negative in that forecast?","Arne M. Sorenson","No, I don't think so. In fact, there is some implied positive mix impact in there. I don't think it's dramatic. And as you can tell from our prepared remarks, we expect that most of that REVPAR growth is going to be rate driven.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nikhil Bhalla of FBR.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just focusing a little bit on the trends by the select service and the full-service segments. If you look at year-to-date, your full-service segments are outperforming the select service, which wasn't the case so much last year, I think. And then select-service tends to have more transient type of business, and full service obviously has a group mix, which as we know has been kind of the lagging part of the business. Could you give us some sense of what the dynamics are? Why is it that full services hotels now outperform the select-service hotels?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I can say if you look at the year-to-date figures -- excuse me, look at the 3-month figures for -- excluding Ritz-Carlton. We've got full service up in the United States by 5.3% and limited service by 4.9%. Not a dramatic difference between the 2. And on the year-to-date numbers, again, excluding luxury, it's 5.4 system-wide full service compared to 4.6 for limited service. And I think you got a couple of things going on there. One is the group mix is growing less quickly than transient. And so that means full service is on average a little less frothy than it would be if it were simply looking at transient only. I think the second is you get, in the limited-service portfolio particularly, a relatively broader distribution in markets other than the top 25 markets in the United States. And the top 25 are still driving outsized REVPAR growth. Obviously, not all 25 are the same. Washington is quite weak but you look at San Francisco, you look at Houston, you look at Chicago year-to-date, you look at a number of these cities and they're performing extremely well. And the full-service portfolio will be skewed more to those higher-performing markets.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it. So that explains that. And just one follow-up question on the group base for 2014. If you were to go back and look same time last year for 2013, I think you had said something about group pace being up 7%. So I mean, is the interpretation correct that maybe your group base for 2014 isn't shaping exactly at the same stance level as it was same time last year looking into 2014 or is that not the right way to look at things?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I don't remember off the top of my head what we said at the end of the third quarter in 2012. We can pull that out as we talk. But if you're right, obviously, it means we have relatively less on the books today for '14 than we did then for '13. Having said that, '13 obviously got hit in the year for the year bookings because of really 2 government crises that took place, the sequestration early and then the government shutdown later in the year. And hopefully, we won't have those same threats going forward. I think the better news is that we've increased from the 2% to the 4% or 4.5% is really where we sit for the Marriott brand, up today, compared to just about the 2% we were up a quarter ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from Smedes Rose of Evercore.","Smedes Rose - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I think most have been asked and answered. I just wanted to ask you, just back on your group outlook, last quarter, you mentioned that you are seeing a lot of corporate caution. In it sounds like that's changed a lot now. And just wondering, when you talk your folks that are booking the group meetings, is that more a function of timing that we're just that much closer to '14? Or do you feel like kind of corporate America has changed its tune a little bit, I guess, in terms of booking these meetings?","Arne M. Sorenson","It's a good question. I think it's probably a little bit of both, but maybe more the inevitability of timing than it is a throw caution to the wind, that kind of attitude. So we've seen improvements to be sure. We're gratified by that, but I don't think we should overstate it. I think we still got companies broadly out there, who are a bit fearful about the status of the government and what's happening with government and a bit more cautious than they would be if the recovery, economic recovery were even stronger. You can see that a little bit in the F&B revenue growth in the quarter, which is not as strong as rooms growth, it was up about 3% compared to the plus 5-ish on the REVPAR. And so I think that's sign that people are still being deliberate about making these decisions. But again, incrementally better than it was a quarter ago.","Smedes Rose - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then I just want to ask you. I think this is first time or maybe at least haven't noticed before when you break out rooms awaiting conversion as a piece of your overall pipeline. Is it typically running at around that percentage? I think maybe 5%. Or is this elevated in this environment, or kind of maybe just a commentary around that?","Arne M. Sorenson","I don't know if this the first time we've done that or not. I think often we've talked about the number of rooms we've opened that are conversions from other branded hotels. I think we've been helped. We've always done well converting other hotels to our brands because of what we offer in terms of REVPAR premium and in cost leverage, particularly around the cost of our reservations platform, marriott.com and the like. I think the addition of the Autograph brand has accelerated that meaningfully, where we are -- that is overwhelmingly a brand which we see existing hotels join and convert to. And I think we continue to see the Autograph momentum built.","Carl T. Berquist","I think the other thing on conversions, they're not in the pipeline that long as compared to other types of hotels, given that once the hotel decides to convert, it's sometimes just months while they're in there before they actually come out of the pipeline and they're open with the brand.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust.","Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if you can break out -- when you talk about group revenue pace for 2014 and what's happened also in the third quarter, how does that break out by occupancy and rate growth? And then secondly, what was the group booking pace for the Gaylord brand?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, we won't give it to you for the Gaylord brand. You'll have to wait for Gaylord's conference call to get that. The -- but the 4, plus 4% or plus 4.5% for next year is overwhelmingly volume, not rate. So I would think rate is up very modestly, 1-ish or 0 to 1, something like that. And the most of that we've got it in the books there is driven by volume. There's good news and bad news in that. The bad news is obvious, which is it would be even more profitable to have higher rate on that business which is on the books. The good news though is it suggests a greater compression in the hotels, which should aid to pricing both transient business and the group business that has yet to be booked, which is about 40% of the total group business we would expect to stay in 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","In fact, this morning, I was watching you on CNBC. And you mentioned that in China, some of your developers are having trouble getting financing, and I was wondering if you could talk about that a little bit more. And then Carl, could you just go through again the issue was with the lower tax rate in the third quarter, and what that means for the full year?","Arne M. Sorenson","First.","Carl T. Berquist","I'll do the tax first for you, Steve. We had 2 things in the tax rate. One was, as we filed the international tax returns, you have true-ups to bring the accruals in line with the actual tax due. And we recorded a benefit as a result of that, about $7 million. That's a onetime item. In addition, we've been able to manage our tax rate down a little bit. So historically, several years ago, we were in the 33%, 34% area. And we are now starting to run closer to 32.5% in that area. For the full year this year, we will probably 31.8% or 31.9%. That's just because that blends in all these items for an effective rate. But for our future run rate, I think we've been able to trim about 0.5 point off, maybe a little more on a go-forward basis as we strategize our mix of international, domestic taxes.","Arne M. Sorenson","A big chunk of that, beyond Carl and his team's great work, is a higher growth of the international portfolio which tends to come in at lower effective tax rate than the domestic business does. I don't remember, Steve, I may have said something. It's always a bit frightening to go on those channels and not know which you're talking about. But don't really remember talking about difficulty for our owners in getting financing in China.","Carl T. Berquist","In India.","Arne M. Sorenson","Oh I may have something said about India. That's right. Carl's reminded me. India is a difficult market. I did talk about India because there you've got interest rates which continue to be up in the mid-teens for our real estate partners there. It's very expensive debt. And I think we'd anticipate that the new deals coming into the pipeline in India, particularly at the luxury end, are going to slow a bit here over the next year or 2. We probably will see Fairfield continue to perform well, maybe Courtyard performed well. But India is a complicated place for a financing perspective at the moment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Crow of the Raymond James.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First topic, Arne, is as we think about 2014, would you be surprised for even disappointed if you didn't return at least another billion dollars to shareholders? And to what extent with the share price have an influence your decision?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, let's see. It's -- the team is giving me evil eyes here because we don't have a budget yet and as a consequence, it's really hard to give you much more in terms of the dollars that we would anticipate returning to shareholders. But the model is working extremely well. You can see the cash that the engine is producing from fee business around the world, and that will continue to grow next year. And we ought to see that not only should we be hopefully close on the sale of the London EDITION this year but hopefully, we'll get Miami out the door next year as it opens. New York will be interesting. It could be late '14. I think probably the best guess is that it will probably be early '15. But all of that would be good news as well. And so I would expect that we are to continue to deliver healthy capital back to our shareholders through dividends or share repurchases. In the fullness of time which I would interpret to include a full year, when you look at a full year, stock price is not a huge factor. Stock price will be a factor in the shorter-term way. So if we're looking at an individual quarter or over maybe even a couple of quarters and we see the stock running aggressively, we're probably less likely to chase it. But fundamentally, what we're doing is returning capital to shareholders and keeping the leverage levels at a position where we think our cost of capital is ideal. And I suspect we'll continue to do that even as the stock price continues to appreciate. And there are folks who obviously asked after 2007, we got into the depths of 2009. Don't you regret the purchases you made in 2006, 2007? And of course, it's hard to say no, because when you sit and look at it from 2009 when the stock, I think it hit a low of about $11 if I remember right. You'd love to be able to have all those dollars you spend in prior year so you could snap up as much of it is you can. But we're not really in a position, I think, where we can be that much smarter than the market. And so while we will pay attention to the stock price, fundamentally, what we're talking about doing is returning the excess cash to shareholders on a relatively current basis.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. The second topic quickly here, on group, any trend changes on cancellation and attrition? That's point one. And point two is we're hearing that there is increased activity in both Aurora and suburban Phoenix of Gaylord development. Can you give us any update on those 2 properties?","Arne M. Sorenson","There's no real change in the trend lines on attritions or cancellations. Obviously, in the Washington market, you got the whole government shutdown and the impact of that. We\u2019ll have to dissect that for you when the dust settles, which presumably we'll talk about a quarter from now. But I think generally, we see again, positive building trends in the group space. We don't have much to say on Aurora or Mesa. I think Aurora is a bit farther along, it is something that the state and the local government would very much like to see happen if a deal can be put together on economic terms. We'd obviously love to see it happen. The hotel owners Downtown Denver don't love the notion of a big hotel opening in Aurora, and so you hear some noise around that occasionally. But we have good partners who are working particularly on the Aurora project to see if we can get a deal put together that makes sense, and we're hopeful about it. But it's certainly way too soon to be even assessing on that.","Carl T. Berquist","And that we will not build that on our balance sheet.","Operator","Your final question comes from Ian Rennardson of Jefferies.","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I was wondering about the shape of REVPAR over the quarter. Was it pretty steady? Or was it like some of the other people that reported stronger in July and August and weaker in September?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I think like others and certainly when you think about the United States, generally, stronger in July and August and bit weaker in September. I think a piece of that is the threat of the government shutdown, which became more apparent in September. And would not ascribe a deteriorating trend line from a calendar perspective because of that.","All right. Christy, anybody else in the queue?","Operator","We have no further questions.","Arne M. Sorenson","All right. Thank you all, very much, for your time and attention today, and we appreciate your interest in Marriott and look forward to welcoming you into our hotels, get on the road."],"13924":["Marriott International, Inc.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will open the call for questions.","It is now my pleasure to hand our program over to Mr. Arne Sorensen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Marriott International. Sir, the floor is yours.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","Before we get started, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today, February 16, 2017, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","Before jumping into our results and guidance, let me acknowledge the obvious. We've thrown a great deal of information at you in our press release and in the Form 8-K we filed late yesterday. Collectively, we are challenged by two things; first, the need to bring two companies together and create a baseline for all of us to have, to compare our guidance and then results against the past. Second, in the first year or so, we will have a number of incomparable or transitional matters, especially around integration costs and the speed with which we capture the G&A and other synergies post-merger. These factors make 2017 a bit noisy. We will do everything we can to help you understand the underlying results and to help you build your models. Thank you for your patience as we work through this together.","We were very pleased with our performance in 2016. We purchased Starwood Hotels & Resorts on September 23, linked our loyalty programs, Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and Starwood Preferred Guest on the same day, and immediately began the work to realize synergies in the combination. On a combined basis, we grew systemwide rooms by more than 5% net in 2016, increased worldwide constant dollar RevPAR by 2%, and increased EPS by 16%.","We are also excited about our prospects for 2017. We expect to grow rooms by 6% net, and we anticipate returning $1.5 billion to $2 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the year with likely upside from asset sales. Our RevPAR and unit growth guidance implies an impressive 15% to 20% EPS growth in 2017 compared to combined 2016 results. So, let's talk about the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter North American systemwide RevPAR rose 1.1%, just above guidance. RevPAR growth was strong in Washington, Atlanta, Toronto and Montr\u00e9al. Leisure business remained healthy across the system, particularly in our luxury brands. Overall, North American Retail transient RevPAR rose 5% in the quarter.","For our corporate customers, sales to Legacy-Marriott's 300 largest corporate customers in North America rose 1%. You may recall, sales to these customers were flat in the third quarter, while sales to Energy and Financial customers continued to weaken, we were pleased that our sales to manufacturers strengthened, increasing 4% in the fourth quarter. Group RevPAR at North American hotels declined 1% in the fourth quarter. Much of this was due to the calendar comparison as the shift in Jewish holidays pushed group business into the third quarter. Gross profit margins for company-operated hotels in North America increased an impressive 50 basis points in the fourth quarter, despite company-operated RevPAR being up only one-half of 1%.","Looking ahead to 2017, we continue to expect a steady-as-she-goes economy in North America. For the 2017 full year, North America group revenue pace for company-operated full-service hotels across the combined portfolio is currently up about 3%. Roughly 80% of special corporate business for 2017 is already priced at a low-single digit rate increase for comparable customers, but we are also signing up more accounts. We continue to aggressively market to leisure guests, and we're adding contract business at attractive rates.","At the same time, we continue to see modest levels of corporate transient demand and somewhat hesitant short-term group bookings. Therefore, for 2017, we still expect North America RevPAR for the combined portfolio will be flat to up 2%. The obvious first question, of course, is do we feel more optimistic about 2017 than we did a quarter ago? The short answer is yes. There is considerable data that shows broad expectations for stronger GDP growth in 2017. We have also completed our budget since our last quarterly call, giving us greater confidence in our range than we had before.","A somewhat longer answer to the question starts with our data. Looking at group booking trends and special corporate negotiations, and of course at Marriott and industry RevPAR data, we do not yet have clear enough proof that GDP is in fact growing at a higher rate, or that the greater prevailing optimism is impacting our business. For this reason, we have left our guidance for North American RevPAR at 0% to 2% for 2017, consistent with the budgets that roll up from our properties.","Outside North America, RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America region declined 3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting weak economic conditions in much of the region, and continued anxiety about the Zika virus in the Caribbean. For 2017, we are modeling a low-single digit percent increase in RevPAR in the region. We expect strong economic growth in Mexico, modest economic growth in Brazil and improvement in the Zika situation in the Caribbean. In the Middle East and Africa region, fourth quarter RevPAR declined 1%, constrained by a tough oil market, lower government spending, new hotel supply and concerns about political unrest, offset a bit by stronger results in South Africa and Cairo. For 2017, we are modeling flattish RevPAR growth for that total region.","Fourth quarter RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region increased 1%. RevPAR was strong in India, Shanghai, and Malaysia while RevPAR was weaker in Hong Kong, Macau, and tertiary China markets. For 2017, we expect our Asia-Pacific region should see strength in India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Australia, more than offsetting weakness in the Macau and South China markets, yielding a RevPAR increase at a low- to mid-single digit rate.","And finally, for Europe, fourth quarter RevPAR increased 2% with strength in the UK, Germany, Spain and Russia, somewhat offset by continued weakness in Paris, Brussels, and Istanbul. For 2017 we expect a low single-digit RevPAR growth with stronger results expected in southern Europe and easier comparisons in Paris and Brussels. All-in-all we expect worldwide systemwide RevPAR will increase 0.5% to 2.5% in 2017, a bit more bullish than our guidance in November.","Owners and franchisees are pleased with the performance of our brands and are developing more hotels under our flags. New owner and franchisee signings last year totaled 136,000 rooms, twice the level of gross room openings, taking our development pipeline to more than 420,000 rooms. If you look at deal approvals instead of signings, our 2016 results included almost 150,000 rooms. Congratulations to Tony Capuano and our development team around the world.","At year end, the combined Marriott and Starwood brand portfolios accounted for just 14% of all industry rooms opened in North America. Yet according to STR, we had an industry-leading 36% of rooms under construction in North America and 22% of rooms under construction worldwide. Financing for new construction remain tight and construction costs are increasing. While STR data for 2016 revealed a 33% increase in U.S. industry rooms under construction, the data also show only a 10% increase in rooms in final planning. By the way, we have nearly a 40% share of those final planning rooms in the U.S. Developers are clearly favoring projects with strong brands.","It's been 147 days since our acquisition of Starwood. Prior to the transaction completion, Marriott Rewards and Ritz-Carlton Rewards adopted several SPG firsts for Platinum members, including late check out, upgrades, and concierge services. At transaction closing, we immediately allowed guests to link their Marriott Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest accounts. In September, we launched our 30-brand worldwide advertising campaign. You may have heard the ads, which we call You Are Here as you were awaiting the start of today's call. They are currently running in media markets around the world and can be viewed on Marriott's YouTube channel.","In October, we announced an industry-first benefit for holders of our co-brand credit cards, allowing them to earn bonus points for stays at hotels across all 30 brands. Our owners and franchisees are hearing from us often, thanks to a robust communications platform established in November and we are hearing from them as well as many are participating in new owner-advisory boards. The first Starwood Hotel began to purchase goods and services for Marriott's procurement partner, Avendra, in December, and last month we rolled out our guest satisfaction tracking system, Guest Voice, to over 1,300 hotels.","We also launched an innovation lab for our Aloft and Element brands at the American Lodging Industry Summit a few weeks ago to crowd-source real-time feedback on some of the exciting brand enhancements being considered. We expect to showcase these brands again at the NYU Lodging Conference in June. At the property level, we are leveraging Marriott contracts to reduce OTA and procurement costs for hotels. In addition, we are encouraging hotels to buy locally and in-season to further reduce costs and enhance quality. By the way, our procurement contracts also help new hotel development as lower prices for equipment and fixtures reduce the cost of new hotels too.","In revenue management, we have identified opportunities to improve the mix of higher-rated business in many hotels. For the Element brand, we believe a greater focus on extended stay sales will improve both the top and the bottom line. In operations, we have identified opportunities for collaboration among our managed hotels, from negotiating more favorable service contracts for hotels located in proximity to each other to jointly chasing group leads. We also anticipate savings as more hotels participate in above-property shared service arrangements.","In our hotel development organization, we've combined Marriott's deal philosophy with Starwood's great brands, which we believe will yield more secure and longer-term agreements as well as enhance relationships with owners and franchisees. And finally, we have seen significant investor interest in our owned hotels. We completed the sale of the San Francisco St. Regis in the fourth quarter and are encouraged with the progress of several other deals. We won't, however, declare victory or model them into our guidance until the deals close.","All-in-all, we are pleased with the pace of integration. Our people are working very hard but they've made amazing progress. I'm incredibly proud of them. The underlying strategy of bringing these two companies together remains sound, and we are excited about the increasing benefits of the transaction for owners, franchisees, associates and of course, our shareholders.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny for a review of our financial results and some additional color on the first quarter and 2017 outlook.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you, Arne. Good morning. Given this is the first full quarter of combined Marriott and Starwood results, let me take a minute to describe our earnings release disclosures. Pages A-1 and A-2 of the earnings press release include GAAP reported results, including Starwood's results beginning only on September 23, 2016. Pages A-3 and A-4 reflect the combined Starwood and Marriott business performance in both years. Specifically, the presentation of adjusted results excludes merger-related costs while the presentation of combined financial results exclude merger-related costs and assume the Starwood acquisition and spinoff of Starwood's timeshare business occurred on January 1, 2015.","Combined financial results also use the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities as of the actual closing date of the acquisition. We've also provided hotel RevPAR statistics on pages A-8 through A-11. These statistics are prepared on a combined comparable basis, including Marriott and Starwood brands for the quarter and the full year, although we've highlighted only the largest North American brands. Fourth quarter reported diluted earnings per share totaled $0.62. GAAP results were constrained by $136 million of pre-tax merger-related costs, including $55 million of severance and retention costs, $59 million of transition costs, and $22 million of transaction costs. Adjusting for these items, diluted EPS totaled $0.85, at the high end of our November 7th guidance.","Compared to the midpoint of our guidance, we outperformed about $0.02 in fees, largely due to better-than-expected RevPAR growth and incentive fee performance; about $0.03 on the owned, leased and other line related both to better-than-expected owned hotel profits and stronger branding fees from our credit card business and residential sales; and about $0.01 on the G&A line due to lower administrative costs. All partially offset by about $0.04 on the tax line, largely due to a tax rate change in France and an unfavorable mix of earnings.","Fee revenue totaled $713 million in the quarter compared to combined fee revenue of $688 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 4%. Fee revenue was $13 million higher than the midpoint of our November 7th expectations. RevPAR growth was at the high end of expectations for the quarter, and operations did a terrific job by increasing house profit margins by 30 basis points worldwide.","Fourth quarter owned, leased, and other net of direct expenses totaled $169 million compared to combined results of $165 million in the 2015 quarter. The flattish year-over-year results reflect higher credit card and residential branding fees and strong results from owned and leased hotels, particularly the newly renovated Sheraton Centre Toronto and the Marriott Charlotte City Center, offset by lower termination fees and the impact of the sale of Starwood Hotels. We outperformed our November 7th guidance on this line by $16 million, due to better-than-expected results at owned and leased hotels, as well as better-than-expected branding fees.","General and administrative expenses totaled $234 million in the quarter, $4 million better than our guidance and $50 million better than the prior-year combined amount. Compared to fourth quarter 2015 combined G&A, the 2016 fourth quarter benefited from general and administrative cost savings, an $8 million favorable legal settlement, and $4 million in net foreign-exchange gain. Depreciation and amortization totaled $71 million in the quarter compared to 2015 combined D&A of $81 million. The $10 million decline year-over-year was largely due to the impact of hotels that were sold or moved to assets held for sale during the year. To sum up the results, our fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $577 million meaningfully exceeded our guidance of $530 million to $555 million.","On the tax line, the fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 35.6%. As I mentioned earlier, the rate was higher than the 32.5% expected largely due to an unfavorable mix of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions and the impact of a tax rate change in France. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA, which excludes merger-related costs, totaled $756 million, an 11% increase over the prior-year combined amount. Full year 2016 combined adjusted EBITDA totaled nearly $3 billion, 9% over the 2015 combined results.","So let's talk a little bit more about 2017. In addition to our earnings release, we also filed an 8-K yesterday with combined information for our businesses by quarter for 2015 and 2016. It also includes combined RevPAR statistics by quarter for both years.","The 8-K disclosures and the 2017 guidance presented in our earnings release reflect a slightly different income statement presentation than the 2016 actuals presented in yesterday's earnings release. In the 8-K and our 2017 outlook, we have re-classed credit card and residential branding fees, which totaled $210 million in 2016 from the owned, leased and other revenue line to the franchise fee line. We're making this change because we believe branding fees are more akin to franchise royalties than bottom line hotel profits in the owned, leased line. Incidentally, application and relicensing fees as well as timeshare fees were historically shown in franchise fees, and they will continue to be there, while termination fees will remain in our owned, leased and other line.","For the full year 2017, we expect fee revenue will total $3.175 billion to $3.245 billion, reflecting roughly $35 million to $40 million of foreign-exchange headwinds and flattish incentive fees year-over-year. Fee revenue from application, relicensing, credit card, residential and timeshare totaled $350 million in 2016. Of this amount, roughly 49% was earned in our credit card business, 28% came from timeshare royalties, 13% came from relicensing and application fees, and 10% was earned from residential branding fees.","On a combined basis, we expect these various fees will grow to roughly $400 million in 2017. These fees typically grow with increasing new hotel development, residential project sales, credit card spend and hotel real estate transaction activity. In 2017, owned, leased and other net of direct expenses should total $345 million to $360 million, compared to $426 million for combined results in 2016. We expect lower termination fees in 2017. This, along with the lost earning of hotels already sold should reduce our results by about $38 million in 2017. Year-over-year, we also expect the weak Brazil and New York City markets will further reduce our results by roughly $20 million.","Our 2017 owned, leased expectations include $170 million to $175 million for the 14 legacy Starwood-owned hotels. We estimate that a 1 percentage point change in our worldwide systemwide RevPAR outlook in 2017, assuming it was evenly distributed, would be worth about $35 million in fees and roughly $8 million on the owned, leased line. Our 2016 G&A number isn't meaningful given the delays in closing the Starwood transaction and the significant number of positions that remained open during the year as a result. We've estimated a more normal combined G&A for 2016 of $1.080 billion, calculated by assuming a typical 4% growth rate over the combined 2015 G&A amount.","We expect G&A in 2017 will total $895 million to $905 million, a savings of $175 million to $185 million over this normalized 2016 level with such savings to be relatively back-end loaded during the year as integration proceeds. We expect to demonstrate a run rate of $250 million of annual G&A synergies by mid-2018. We estimate depreciation and amortization will total roughly $280 million in 2017. Purchase accounting rules provide a timetable of up to one year from the date of acquisition to update allocations based on new information learned about the asset values as of the date of the acquisition.","As we mentioned in our press release, we expect to adopt Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017. The amount of the windfall tax benefit will depend on the number of stock awards vested or exercised in the year, our stock price at that time, and the share price when such awards were granted. We have assumed the windfall tax benefit will add approximately $0.10 per share to our EPS in 2017 with all of it recognized in the first quarter. Our earnings guidance assumes a 2017 book tax rate of 30.8% or 32.7% excluding the windfall tax benefit. We expect our cash tax rate in 2017 to be roughly 28%, excluding the impact of asset sales and transition costs.","All-in-all, we expect 2017 fully diluted EPS will total $3.79 to $3.97, an increase of 15% to 20% over 2016 combined EPS. We expect 2017 adjusted EBITDA will total $3.075 billion to $3.175 billion, up 3% to 6% over 2016 full year combined adjusted EBITDA. We estimate a one percentage point change in the value of the dollar, assuming it was evenly distributed among all currencies, would be worth about $10 million in EBITDA. Today, one half of international fee revenue is denominated in just five currencies, and we hedge about one-third of our exposure in these currencies.","We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchases. Investment spending could total $500 million to $700 million in 2017, including about $175 million in property maintenance spending and $100 million for systems and corporate CapEx. We repurchased 8 million shares for $573 million in 2016. For the full year 2017, share repurchases and dividends could total $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Successful asset sales could take our cash returns estimate higher. For the full year 2016, Marriott recycled capital totaling nearly $285 million from asset sales and note collections and prior to the acquisition, Starwood sold assets for $316 million.","We continue to expect more than $1.5 billion in dispositions of Starwood-owned assets over the next 24 months, including the $175 million we received in the fourth quarter of 2016 for the sale of the San Francisco St. Regis. Our approach to selling owned assets reflects the importance of getting full value for the hotel, as well as a strong management agreement and property improvement plans where needed. While we do expect to sell some hotels in 2017, our earnings guidance does not assume we will sell any of these hotels. As Arne said, our balance sheet is in great shape. Excluding merger-related costs, our debt ratio at December 31 was at the low end of our targeted 3 to 3.25 times adjusted debt to combined adjusted EBITDAR credit standards.","For the first quarter of 2017, we're modeling RevPAR growth of 1% to 3% in North America, 1% to 2% outside North America, and 1% to 3% worldwide. First quarter RevPAR will benefit from the January inauguration week in Washington, D.C. and the shifting Easter holiday. We expect fee revenue will total $740 million to $750 million in the first quarter. Fee revenue will face about $6 million in foreign exchange headwinds, a tough comparison to last year's leap year and a 10% decline in incentive fees largely due to the impact of renovations, recognition of deferred fees in prior year and timing.","Combined fee revenue from application, relicensing fees, credit card fees, residential fees and timeshare totaled $88 million in the 2016 first quarter, and we expect such fees will be flat in the first quarter 2017, largely due to a spike in residential fees recognized in the 2016 first quarter. We expect owned, leased and other net of direct expenses will total $60 million to $70 million in the first quarter. Year-over-year, we expect $13 million of lower termination fees and $4 million in lower profits due to the previous sale of hotels.","With the $0.10 benefit of the tax windfall, we estimate first quarter diluted EPS will total $0.87 to $0.91. We know that you're eager for more information about the combined company, and we hope you can attend our New York City Analyst Day on March 21. As you can tell, for now we feel very good about our brands, our business and our progress in integrating Starwood.","Now, let's get to your questions. So that everyone gets a chance to participate, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hi, guys.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, Harry.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, Harry.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning, Harry.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Good morning. I wonder if you could give us some thoughts on the number of brands that you have that \u2013 ones that might benefit from some rationalization or consolidation? And if there are any, would that increase the management focus and clarity also for your owners?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Thanks, Harry. Basically, the short answer is, we're going to keep them all. We do have a \u2013 it's obviously a big portfolio of brands. I think we would acknowledge that if we were starting with a plain piece of paper, we wouldn't necessarily start 30 brands. But having 30 brands that already have distribution with strong owner investment in hotels that carry those flags, and recognizing that our principal tool for going to market is the portfolio and the loyalty programs. We think offering more choices and in some respects more brands is a positive, not a negative. To state the obvious, we will, over time, work with owners and franchisees to crystallize each of the brand positionings as much as possible so that we draw distinctions between them, and we're very much underway with that including with our owners and franchisees.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Very good. And a follow-up on your comments about incentive management fees for 2017. I would've expected them to grow somewhat just given the number of managed hotels, particularly internationally, that you'd expect to open. Can you give us some thoughts about what might be holding the growth of incentive management fees back for this year?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure. At the end of the day, Harry, we definitely will see some growth, but what you've also got is a bunch of things impacting going the other way. And FX is the biggest one, really, when you look at that, and could be as much as $15 million year-over-year. And then you add to that, we've got some renovations going on as well as the fact that terminations of some of those hotels also are going to impact year-over-year incentive fees.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Are the terminations \u2013 is that a trend that is worrisome? Maybe a little bit more color around that? And that'll be it for me. Thanks.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, no. Really not anything above the normal \u2013 kind of the normal trend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Robin.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Just looking at the percent of your pipeline that's under construction, I think it was 38%. That's a little bit lower than either Marriott or Starwood sort of on a legacy basis, as you were usually sort of closer to 50%. I'm just curious if there's anything in particular that is making that look a little bit lower than kind of what it typically might?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","That's a really good question, Robin. I think pieces of this are about the shift towards more international from domestic. And maybe to some extent, even when you're in the U.S. looking at select-serv assets, probably a shift more towards urban and away from the prototypical suburban assets. Obviously, the more you get to urban or full service or international, the more the preconstruction period lengthens because permitting takes a little bit longer, the projects tend to be custom and therefore, the architecture and design work takes a little bit longer. And I think those would be the \u2013 probably the principal factors that would bring that percentage down a little bit.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. No, great. That's helpful. And then just my follow-up is, your projected cost saves from the integration hasn't changed at all from \u2013 it seems like you had perfect visibility several quarters before the closing of the transaction. So, I guess I'm just sort of asking...","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","That's really nice of you to say. Filling my ear (33:24).","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, so that \u2013 it's just perfect. But just curious if you think there are sort of still things to work through. In other words, is every dollar identified at this point? Are there areas that you haven't \u2013 I guess I'm just sort of asking in a different way like, if there's potential upside to that?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","So a couple things, and thanks for the question because it is worth mentioning a little bit about the timing as we think about the way these synergies will roll in. As integration progresses, we definitely will see during the year, we would expect to see the difference between \u2013 when you look at the combined a year ago quarter-by-quarter, we would expect that these savings progress during the year and into 2018. So as we move forward, by the time we're kind of in mid-2018, we feel comfortable that, that $250 million, we can ring that bell. And obviously, we're going to keep looking. This is an ongoing process. It's not kind of a one-stop shop, so we will continue to explore everything we can do. But for the moment, we feel good about the $250 million.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Joe.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Morning, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning, guys.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Morning, Joe. How about that?","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Arne, you mentioned that part of your confidence or increased confidence or optimism in your 2017 guidance is rooted not just from looking at macro factors, but also from a ground-up forecast and budgeting process with your guys in the field. When you look at that, is there a big difference between RevPAR growth expectations for legacy Marriott branded properties versus what you acquired in Starwood?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","No. There are some differences, obviously, in the distribution of the portfolio. Starwood portfolio still tends to be skewing much more international toward the higher end chain scales. Obviously, their distribution of select service was less robust than the legacy Marriott brands. And so, that rolls up to some extent in different ways through those portfolios. But when we look at like-for-like markets, we see very similar RevPAR expectations.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then, Leeny, you talked about G&A and cost cuts. What's surprising and maybe you can just talk about it somewhat differently is if I look at your 1Q G&A guidance and full year G&A guidance, it kind of implies basically that G&A is sequentially flat on average, 2Q through 4Q versus the 1Q, which somewhat surprised me. Can you just talk about that and what \u2013 I guess not driving more of an incremental sequential improvement or reduction in G&A?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, so first of all, this kind of gets back to how we thought about putting together the kind of more comparable numbers of the \u2013 how we think about the improvements in G&A. The combined company numbers, when you look at those going quarter-by-quarter to 2016, you were really looking at a company that was already starting to get some of those synergies as you moved through the year. And so when you look at Q3 and Q4, you had a bunch of open positions and you were actually, in some respects, really getting those synergies in 2016. So then when you look at 2017 compared, we're going to continue to get synergies but again, you're looking at a combined company in Q3 and Q4 of 2016 as frankly, already getting some of those synergies given the merger was kind of semi-closed, not quite closed. A bunch of open positions.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I think the other factor you've got going on here is there are, at times through this process, a bit of a step function. So when you look at G&A synergies against the baseline, I think we would say fourth quarter shows more synergies than the first quarter, for example. And it's through the end of the first quarter we will be beginning to sunset some of the transitional efforts that were continued after the date of close. I think we'll also get into early 2018 and there will be a time when we would also sunset some of the duplicative systems. And until we get to those points where we're actually flipping off some of those switches, we don't achieve final phases or the next phase of some of that spending. But Leeny's comment certainly is right. We have some comparison issues here, too, in the sense that we \u2013 Starwood started to achieve savings really in the second half of 2015 and both companies in anticipation of the close were already starting to look at synergies in advance of the closing.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","If you \u2013 Joe, if you look at kind of more of the way that I'm describing, looking at the two companies kind of premerger and normalize them with a 4% increase for 2016, and use that as your run rate, you will actually see that Q1 we show savings, call it, of 10% relative to those numbers. And by the time we get to Q4, we're at 25% on a more normalized basis. And that, so you actually are seeing a real progression in the savings, but it's just again, it's depending on what you're comparing them to.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And just one follow-up on that just so I'm thinking about this correctly and not to ask you to provide guidance for beyond this year, but just think about it in the big picture. Would you expect that incremental of $70 million of G&A synergies that, if we think that you finish this year at $900 million in G&A, does that grow with inflation and then you reap the benefit of $70 million? Or is there any incremental inflationary pressure to think about looking ahead to modeling that G&A number?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, so a couple of things. We are, in many cases, talking people here, so we are talking the reality of people that will be continuing to help us put the two companies together. But I will also say that as you get through 2018 that by the time we're in the third quarter of 2018, I think you will see the run rate reflect kind of the savings that we've talked about. Now, the timing of some of these integration costs of exactly \u2013 we call them wind-down, they're not perfectly predictable. So, kind of exactly the $250 million with 3% inflation, we'll have to see how that goes. But we're determined, when we think of it, as $250 million in 2017 dollars that obviously then overtime will grow. But I would expect that it's more kind of in the back-half of 2018 where we've kind of really been able to say the companies from a fundamental running standpoint are truly integrated and combined.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, folks. Leeny, this first question is concerning the $1.5 billion of asset sales you referenced. How many of those assets are with brokers are actively being marketed today? And is there a rule of thumb you can give us on sort of gross first net proceeds we should expect to the extent those are sold? I'm just thinking about things like taxes or any sort of mortgage debt or things that would impact net proceeds.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure. Well, we're obviously talking to folks in the market about all of them. So these were assets that were in many cases under active discussions before the transaction closed and as a team, we continue to march forward and then on several, but at that point, we're not \u2013 we're talking to folks in the market. Now, they're obviously all in various stages because each of the assets is different and each has its \u2013 kind of a separate situation whether you've got to look at ground leases or kind of elements that you're comparing on the PIP, et cetera. So, I can't really give you a prediction in terms of timing of the asset sales, but we do continue to feel good about the environment and good about our ability to get it done in the timeframe that I described. The other thing I would say, on the gross versus net proceeds is, they're going to really vary. They're going to vary quite a bit asset-to-asset and I would say that a good proxy to use is about 20%. But again, I will say that could be very different asset-to-asset.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just a second question is, I don't know if you guys might have...","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Just to be clear, when we think of our cash flow model, we've been taking that into consideration all along.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And just one other question is, New York experienced something of a unique and maybe unanticipated lift in November and December that's continued a little bit into this year. And some folks think it's like a post-election bounce, and others kind of attribute it to sort of short-term \u2013 like, new legislation against short-term rentals, like Airbnb. I guess my point is, to the extent it was the latter, legislative-related, the implication is that Airbnb has actually had a stronger impact on the hotel industry than maybe has been originally surmised. I was just curious if you had any color or insight on some of those trends? And maybe do you guys think differently about maybe what drove some of the lift in New York in the back half of 2016?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I think we remain generally cautious on New York, and that's not really about an Airbnb impact either before or more recently in the wake of some of the legislative activity that's been underway. New York was, in our fourth quarter, just slightly negative on the top line. I think our expectations for 2017 would be that New York would remain ever so slightly negative, not positive. That is actually remarkably good performance in some respects, given that we've got supply growth at nearly 5% in both 2016 and 2017, which would suggest basically that we've got demand growth growing at nearly the same pace. And when you look at the last few months of last year, you look at what's happening in January, these are historically fairly soft periods. I think it is dangerous to draw many conclusions from them about nature of supply and demand in New York including the impact of shared economy platforms. Obviously, we'll continue to monitor that as we go forward, but we would expect that we will continue to have a pretty modest performance.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Smedes.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. You touched on this at the beginning, so I'm sorry if I missed it, but I noticed that the pipeline, while it's still obviously very large, was flat sequentially, and typically you show growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And I was just wondering if you could touch on that, of why it was flat?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, every year, we do a careful culling of the portfolio, the pipeline, as we get to year end to make sure that they are reflective of deals which are very much still in progress. Obviously, it was the first time we had a chance to do that since closing the Starwood transaction. I don't think we brought different standards to bear than we've brought historically to it, but we did call a number of thousands of rooms out of that pipeline in the fourth quarter as we got towards the end of the year.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then I wanted to ask you too, you mentioned that asset sales could bring in additional cash over the course of the year. Is there also an opportunity for some sort of loyalty program monetization that we've seen? I think Starwood had a deal with Amex several years ago, and Hilton talked about it a little bit yesterday on their call. Is that something that you might look to do this year or next year?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Absolutely. As you probably remember that we've talked about before, we've got two co-brand credit card partners, SPG with Amex, and JPMorgan Chase Visa for Marriott Rewards. And as we think about combining the loyalty program over the long run, we obviously are in discussions with both of those companies about these co-brand credit cards. So we'll be talking to them this year, re-looking at the entire deal between the companies. One credit card agreement expires in 2018, the other one expires in 2020. And we're very excited about, frankly, the possibilities there, but wouldn't be in a position to be able to quantify anything at this point.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I don't know if you...","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Morning.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning. I don't know if you've gone over this yet. I'm just curious on your raise for the international RevPAR, specifically what locations are driving that? And secondly, is it partly driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar with Americans traveling internationally going into your assumptions? Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, those are all good questions, and I think it probably starts with neither of those suggested answers but simply that we have done the budgets. And a quarter ago when we did our earnings call, we of course had started the budget process and was looking at the data that we had. But since that point in time, all of our teams around the world have had a chance to build these budgets from hotel-by-hotel perspective. I think if you compare beyond that to sort of general expectations, we're maybe a bit more bullish in Latin America and optimistic that the Zika epidemic is getting behind us in terms of its impact, at least. It's obviously not over. And maybe we're just a tinge more optimistic about Europe too, although that is an up-and-down market. You've got places like Istanbul, which are in a world of hurt and other places, which seem to be performing a little bit better. On average, I think those two markets would probably be the place where we have a slightly more positive view.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. Just, Arne in your prepared remarks you talked about how energy and financial customers weakened in the fourth quarter. Can you just elaborate on that comment? Just seems a little strange given the dynamics in those markets.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I think, there might be one place where the greater optimism would hopefully come to pass. You look at energy and finance, I think there is some optimism that the energy patch bottomed and that while we may not be seeing strong signs of a rapid recovery out of that level that we're not necessarily seeing further decline. I think we did see further softness in Q4, but the anecdotes and the comments that are coming out now are a bit more encouraging. I think secondly with respect to finance, matters are changing so quickly, almost on a day-to-day basis, but it's really the first of the year where you start to get this building momentum that there will be strong regulatory relief in the financial world and the optimism that is in some respects derived from that. If that optimism shows up in greater performance of those two segments of our economy, obviously that will be good demand from those customers.","Unknown Speaker","And it was encouraging to see manufacturing turn up after being weak for a very long time.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","That's right.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone. To \u2013 maybe just to touch once more on the synergies and I apologize, because I know this can be a little bit confusing probably for this type of Q&A, but just specifically, Leeny, as we think about the baseline of $900 million of kind of combined G&A for 2017, I guess the question we keep coming back to is, is they really closer to the $65 million to $70 million of remaining opportunity or because the baseline is higher, I think we did the math on that kind of $1.080 billion that you talked about and grew it a little bit. We'd be coming out a lot closer to only maybe $25 million remaining. Again, not trying to get you to give us guidance or explicit guidance but just trying to understand of those two ranges, which one is probably closer to what's remaining?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I think your first one. Your first one.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","I think the larger number is the better and more accurate way to both look at it and to what we expect.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect. Thank you. And then my second question is \u2013 the other question we've gotten from some folks is a little bit around the EPS guidance and specifically wondering could you just give us a little bit more color on your thoughts around sort of the both buyback timing and perhaps just general cadence because I think for some people they're probably expecting maybe their slightly larger buyback assumption or more importantly a different weighting as you thought about it across the year and obviously it's got an average impact in that number. So just any thoughts around sort of how you thought about that or modeled that would be helpful.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure. Absolutely. So as you know, predicting the timing of asset sales is pretty difficult. So that's the main reason that we wanted to basically give you guys a model that assumes no asset sales. And obviously, to the extent that we're having asset sales during the year, that could obviously change the impact and the timing of share repurchase for the year. But when you think about other than that, I would say, probably relatively speaking the way we do it would be fairly steady during the year and wouldn't surprise you. The only counter to that, I would say, is that as you remember, we do have cash balances that we are going to be able to avail ourselves of, if you think about where we were at the end of Q3. And when our balance sheet comes out, you'll see the cash number has come down by about $200 million that we've been able to avail ourselves of cash.","And I'll use that opportunity to tell you guys that it's likely that the 10-K will be filed after the weekend, a little bit later than our typical filing, because of the all the purchase-price accounting work that we've got to do, we want to make sure that we've buttoned everything down so it will be a few days later. But when we think about those extra cash balances that we do expect to be able to have available to us for general corporate purposes, and end up the year, end up 2017 with a more normal, call it, $200 million to $300 million level of ongoing working capital cash needs. I would say, we think that we'll have the use of that cash in the first half of the year rather than the second half of the year, which would give you a little bit of weighting towards the first half in share repurchase. But other than that, pretty much steady as she goes.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks, and good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, Felicia.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. So, Arne, in your prepared remarks earlier you gave us some nice color as to the reiteration of your RevPAR growth in North America, flat to up 2%. I'm just wondering, what do you need to see to get more bullish with that guidance? Is it just as simple as acceleration in GDP? Or are there other things? And then, I was also wondering how much corporate transient demand growth you would need to see in order to get to that high-end or even above of your North America RevPAR growth target?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I mean, obviously, upside can come from any one of the drivers of our business. Group, or business transient, or leisure. I think when we look at the year from today's perspective, we would say leisure feels the strongest to us. Probably then group, and probably then business transient. Again, business transient, if it improved, that would be a positive thing. I think the beginning of your question was, what you need to see before you start to articulate some sort of upside? GDP tends to strengthen a bit before it shows up in our business. In other words, we lag probably a little bit, not massively, but it could be a month or two or three, something like that.","I think we're going to be cautious about claiming that we're in a different world until we start to see, either through bookings or through the stayed-and-paid actual RevPAR numbers, the kind of performance that would allow us to say, you know what, actually, that optimism is proving to be real. And we just \u2013 I think today you can, if you want to go out and find anecdotes to prove a point of view that things are better, there are some anecdotes out there. But if you actually go and look at the data with a cold, clear gaze and say, are you really seeing the kind of data that would show that our business is performing differently than we thought a quarter ago? We don't see that clarity yet.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And just since you guys \u2013 the transaction's closed, I'm wondering what you've learned regarding the Sheraton brand? And when do you think you'll be able to be making changes there?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","We are already engaged. We pulled together our U.S. owners, for example, full-service owners in November or early December, I've forgotten the precise week. But pretty quickly after we closed the transaction. And that's a group of a few hundred of our principal owners of managed hotels and owners and operators of franchised full-service hotels. Won't surprise you to know that a big chunk of that conversation was about the Sheraton brand, and particularly with the owners of the Sheraton assets, to engage with them about where that brand should go. And that is about defining brand standards, but doing it in a way that's collaborative with them. And then it is about making sure those brand standards get implemented. And implementation means that for hotels that don't meet those standards, we move with due speed, I'm talking about due speed in a second, to either get them on to brand standards, or to get them out of the Sheraton brand.","Due speed, I think, means not that you can publish a brand standard and then a month later start to have a public execution because that would not be fair to our partners in this. These partners are extraordinarily important to us. They need to have some time to understand those standards to assess whether or not it is economically rational for them to meet them. And if it is, given the opportunity in order to make arrangements for the financing and make arrangements for the work actually to get done in order to meet those standards. I suspect, however, we will see in 2017 that some of the hotels that are most obviously at the bottom end of the brand; in other words, they didn't meet whatever standards were in place already; they don't meet any likely standard that we end up with, that we'll see that renovations actually occur in some of those or some of those actually leave the system. So we are expecting to see some progress being made in 2017.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then, once you kind of go through that process, how long does it take to cycle through your financial performance?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I'm not sure if I know exactly what you mean by that. I think \u2013 obviously, the RevPAR index numbers are non-GAAP, so they're not coming through our P&L but they are a really important measure of the way a hotel is performing against its competitive set or the way a brand is performing generally across the market. The Sheraton RevPAR index is a bit lower than fair share, not massively but a couple of points maybe below fair share. And we're going to try and move those numbers steadily from here, including hopefully, some progress in 2017.","Obviously, our fee contribution from those hotels will rise, not just with market RevPAR performance but with whatever index growth we can take. Offset, however, by whatever loss of fees we will experience by the deletion of hotels that don't meet that standard. So, we'll work through that. Everything that we can predict with some clarity is built into our 2017 model. When you get into years 2018, 2019, 2020, that's obviously an area where we will try and illuminate more when we're at \u2013 together for our Analyst Conference in March. But we'll just continue to keep you updated as our thinking evolves with that.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. So this seems like a catalyst for a little bit in the future.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","From your lips.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Stephen.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","This is a little bit less of a modeling question, but Arne, I've heard you talk about how critical the richness of the travel and lodging experience is and will be in driving the business. While I recognize combining Starwood and Marriott is a huge task on its own and people are rightly focused on those cost synergies, what are the key benefits and opportunities you're excited about longer term from combining these two organizations as it relates to the customer experience specifically?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, I think \u2013 the two things I would call out there are loyalty and then the emotional power of the brand portfolio. So the loyalty program, SPG and Marriott Rewards are absolute juggernauts. We have been \u2013 we've talked about this in a number of prior calls and in other contexts, but we have been very impressed by the enthusiasm and the dedication that the SPG loyalists, particularly, the elites have to their program. We see in it a sort of comparable level of commitment that we've seen in the Marriott Rewards program for many, many years. And while Leeny talked about credit card companies, we've also got great partnerships with the timeshare companies. We've got a technology platform that we've got to work through. What we can build with this loyalty program we think is going to be extraordinarily exciting and should help us draw a broad connectivity to a very large group of customers and a higher share of wallet from their travel. And that's long-term upside for the company.","I think the second thing is around the brand portfolio. And it's obvious to all of us, Starwood in many respects with the launch of W nearly 20 years ago was the first big company to get into the lifestyle space. And that brand continues to be a very strong one. You look at the pipeline of hotels that are coming into that brand, it is both strong and they are extraordinarily exciting hotels. But then you look at not just Aloft and Element which Starwood added also in the lifestyle space but you look at EDITION, and Moxy, and AC Hotels and the number of entrants that we brought into the lifestyle space as well. And when you think about luxury and lifestyle particularly, these are places that travelers, when they dream about travel and when they think about the experiences they most intensely want to have, they are focused on brands like that. And I think the strength we'll have in that space when combined with the loyalty program should really enable us to not just work on the nuts and bolts of the integration but really on the emotional connectivity to the traveling public. And that, as you can maybe tell from my comments turns us on.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Fair enough. That's helpful. As a quick follow-up on the loyalty program specifically, how should we be thinking about the timing of the joint kind of program going forward? Is that tied to the credit card negotiations or are you thinking about it otherwise?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","It's tied to all of it. It's tied to all of it. I mean, we obviously got to get \u2013 the technology work is underway, there are two separate technology platforms and we've got to do the work necessary in order to have one platform. It is possible we could have one platform with two different program sitting on top of that platform depending on where we are with our partners. We've also then got a whole bunch of questions around the customer proposition, the programs have somewhat different rules around qualification for Elite level, around the Elite bonuses, around other things and we want to work through with our customers. And then of course, we've got the credit card and timeshare companies. And there are some issues which are relationship driven and some that are contractual driven. But we're going to work through those. You certainly should not expect that we will have one program anytime in 2017. Whether we will in 2018 is something we will work to maximize the chances for, but we don't have a date to give you yet.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful. Thanks again, and good luck this year.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. I know it's late so thanks for taking my question.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Ryan.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yeah, I just wanted to ask a little bit about, I didn't think I heard it in your prepared remarks, the member pricing initiative. I guess a couple of things related to that. Number one, are you seeing any impact on RevPAR growth? Obviously, I would imagine it would be negative because of the discounting aspect, that's showing up over the past quarter or two. And then number two is, if you are, are you seeing any type of opportunity for RevPAR growth to maybe reaccelerate as you lap some of that impact later this year? And are you getting the benefits you are looking for in terms of being able to increase the loyalty program members?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, it's an interesting question, particularly the latter half of that. I think it's going to get harder and harder for us to have a calculation about what the impact of member-direct rates are, in truth. We \u2013 the last two quarters have talked about a roughly 30-basis-point impact to RevPAR, so that would have been in Q2 and Q3 2016. But the closer you were \u2013 we were to implementing that program, the more you had some sort of current baseline data, which allowed you to do some calculations. The farther you get away from it, you start to already have a bit of a difficult time knowing exactly where the booking would have come otherwise. And we're now in a business in which essentially these member-direct discounts are common across all the branded platforms.","So our principal competitors are doing the same thing. That makes assessing what it would be like if we didn't have it more and more difficult to do. We are encouraged by the growth in sign-ups to the loyalty program since we've rolled out the member-direct rates by the awareness of these kinds of discounts, which we remain convinced will drive good behavior from our perspective, from our customers and the way they book. And as a consequence, I suspect we'll see that this continues much as it is in its present form. Does it impact? Do we lap it at some point? I suppose we do. I suppose in Q2 we start to lap it. But again, our calculation was 30 basis points or thereabouts in Q2, so it's not a massive number. And whether its additive or not, sort of Lord knows. I guess I would say it's built into our model, but I'm not necessarily sure that we focus precisely on that question either.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, you guys talked a lot about asset sales. Thanks for giving us an indication on San Francisco St. Regis as well. Have you thought at all about portfolios? Obviously, REIT stock prices have come back pretty meaningfully. Seems like there might be an opportunity to do a bigger portfolio transaction, but it also might come with a REIT, other than maybe one or two that might need to pay in the form of stock. Would you be willing to, A, do a portfolio transaction? And should we expect one? And then, B, would you be willing to accept stock for a transaction?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","So thanks for the question. We certainly are willing to entertain all comers and happy to listen to anybody who's got an idea, and have thought about that. And frankly, we've spoken to a number of potentially \u2013 investors that would be interested in either part of, a partial portfolio or all. As you might imagine, in many cases, those are international buyers. But the reality is, we've got a really interesting kind of diverse group of hotels, and whether they are located in Buenos Aires or Canada, or they have ground leases or they have PIP needs, every single one of them has its own story. And I think we are now fairly firmly \u2013 never say never, but fairly firmly of the view that it's going to be much more onesies and twosies is going to be the best way to maximize the value of this portfolio.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. And then willingness to accept stock?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Again, we haven't contemplated that. I would say, not very.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I can't imagine that even if a buyer had to use stock that we'd necessarily have to take it.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","They can figure out a way to put the stock in the market the same \u2013 they did it (1:09:52).","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Fair enough. Just wanted to make sure I understood correctly. Thanks a lot.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","We're looking for cash.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Beckel with (sic) Sanford C. Bernstein.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks a lot. I just wanted to quickly touch back on terminations that were mentioned as a headwind to IMF growth. I think last quarter, you mentioned that you expected unit growth, but I don't think there was any mention of terminations. So first question would be, did anything change? And then, how big of a drag related to terminations do you expect this year? And should we expect a, sort of, persistent drag based on your earlier comment going forward?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","We won't have anything to say this morning about future years, but our expectations for 2017 are about the same number of \u2013 deletions is actually probably a better word than terminations from our system. We've been experiencing roughly a point, I think Starwood was a bit more than a point.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","We're a little bit under.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","We were a little bit under, they were a bit over.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","And we still think that's about the right area. Now those stories, they are one hotel at a time. The most typical deletion is a hotel that doesn't meet our standards, and it does not make economic sense for it to be re-invented to meet our standards. And so we take it out. Now, we don't take it out without consultation with our owners and franchisees. But we essentially work towards taking that out of the system so that it can land someplace else in the probably lower tier of the hotel business typically. There are other circumstances in which we're subject to termination from an owner who doesn't want to keep us, or who is selling it to somebody else and they have different plans for it. And so, every story exists in this, sort of, annual model, but it's not at different levels, at least that's what we're anticipating in our guidance. It's not at different levels than what the company has experienced in the past.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","And, David, keep in mind that when we talk about unit growth on a net basis, we're really addressing it there.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right. Right. No, that's really helpful. I appreciate that. And just as a quick follow-up, if I could, I don't think we discussed the effect of travel ban at all. I think, Leeny, you had mentioned something last night, but could you just fill us in on what you're seeing with respect to maybe corporate traveler or corporate planners and their reaction to the travel ban and how that may or may not impact their plans going forward?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, we don't have a lot of data yet that would say that this is a big deal in terms of stayed-and-paid experience in our hotels. Obviously, the seven countries that are called out in the Executive Order are not places where there's a lot of travel that comes to the United States. And obviously too, the Executive Order has been suspended by a ruling of the court, so it's not in effect. We, as a consequence, don't think that by its terms, it's a massive deal. Now saying that, we should stop and pause for a second. You've got individual stories of families who've been waiting for a long period of time to get visas or other permission to emigrate. And for them, there is no bigger story in the world than having those rights up-ended and uncertainty sort of race back into their lives.","Having said that, there is a broad sense, particularly across the Middle East but across much of the world that the Executive Order is a really big deal and that the symbolism is wrong and that it is effectively a communication from the United States to the rest of the world that you should anticipate that either you're not going to be welcome here or that you may have difficulty getting in. And we think that's what has motivated the handful of stories that we've heard about already, which are typically group stories. And they are not, of course, international groups where folks are saying, you know what? I'm not sure I want to take the risk of trying to bring an international group into the United States, whether it'd be for a wedding or for a meeting because my whole group may not be able to get in.","And so, we have some anecdotes about folks who have reached out to us and said, you know what? Rather than focus on that hotel in the U.S., why don't we look at what you've got in Canada? Or why don't you look at what you've got someplace else? And if we're hearing a handful of those anecdotes already, I'm sure there are a number that we're not hearing, which are groups who had not yet contacted us but who would have contacted us were it not for this Executive Order. But instead are maybe going directly to one of our hotels in another country or they're simply deferring their efforts to plan that business.","So again, I don't think this is a measurable impact today. I don't think it is necessarily a substantial impact. I wouldn't expect, by the way, that it would have much impact on business transient at all because that tends to be the kind of travel that is most resilient. But I do think it is a place where to the extent we need to do things around security or around immigration, we should do them quickly so that we can get back to communicate to the rest of the world that subject to the revisions in those policies, we really want people to come here and see us and do business here and vacation here and take back their fond memories to their homes.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's really helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Telsey Group.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, David.","Arne M.

Thanks for staying on late here.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Bill.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Bill.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Arne, I want to take one more shot at the G&A topic. If we just set aside the synergies, assume you're going to achieve those, how do you gauge the absolute level of G&A expenditures? And I'm curious whether your company as it continues to sell assets, you've exited timeshare, increased the focus on franchising relative to management, whether you've got an opportunity to maybe reengineer G&A to a lower absolute level, even after these synergies are completed.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, it's a good question, and I think there are a number of different answers to it. Leeny has been very strong in helping guide the company through this area before close and after close and trying to build models, which essentially say, here is what we think we have capacity to spend and here's what we think we need to spend. Both those questions are relevant and they're different questions. And has essentially allocated around the business allowances, if you will, for the level of effort we think would be required to run this bigger platform. And that is, of course, it was influenced to some extent by our target to get to the $250 million of synergies. It also guided our settling on $250 million as a number that seemed to work. And so that planning is a piece of it.","I think a second piece of it is simply listening to our teams and sensing the level of intensity and their demand for more resources, which obviously comes up frequently in companies all around. I would say one other thing, and that is I think in this last recovery, looking over the last three to four years, legacy Marriott has really done a fine job keeping admin cost growth at very, very low levels, and if you look over a 25- or 30-year period of time, where G&A has grown at meaningfully higher than 3%-ish kind of growth rates through other economic recovery cycles, in this one, we've been keeping an awful lot of focus on this, and keeping the growth rates down. And I suspect we'll continue to do that.","Even when we can ring the bell to use Leeny's phrase, about hitting that $250 million target, we won't be done. We'll continue to look for efficiencies in the platform. I don't think getting rid of owned assets is likely to be terribly significant by itself because the bulk of our spending is about running a global public company, governance reporting, et cetera, that relates to that. It is about overseeing thousands of managed hotels and thousands of relationships with owners of managed and franchised hotels, and it's about the work we've got to do to refine and strengthen brands and provide the oversight of all of that. And that's not work that is likely to get any more intense in the years ahead.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. All right. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me on here. So as you look to integrate your loyalty programs within the next year or two, are there any incremental costs associated with that? And do you anticipate any challenges in this process?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Oh, there are plenty of challenges. The technology and the partnerships would be probably where we would start. I think we've got good relationships and we've got good plans, and so we're quite optimistic about being able to navigate through all of that. But it's a lot of work, and don't hear our confidence as being a sign that it isn't. Because we've got many people that are focused on this and getting it done right. Are there any costs associated with it? There are, of course. I think the bulk of the costs associated with it, like the bulk of the costs of the program are really paid for by the system as we go through it. We need to make sure that those costs don't balloon and harm our owners and so we're doing everything we possibly can to manage that. But I wouldn't expect this to be a sort of regular impact to our P&L. Other than through the upside of hopefully larger share of wallet.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","As said (1:21:57), the synergies, at the end the day we see much more upside than we do downside in terms of on the cost and revenue side related to loyalty.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on your credit card comments. I realize you don't want to talk about any future contribution from any reworked deal. But can you just help me size up the current agreements? So if you're doing $3.1 billion in EBITDA in 2017, how much of that is coming from your current credit card agreements?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","We said in the call, about 49%.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Right. So, about 49% of the $350 million that we talked about being this kind of pot of fees that are not tied directly to the RevPAR of hotels. And so, if you say roughly half of that is coming from the credit card relationships. And those are again, those are driven by credit card spend.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Okay.

Good morning, everyone. There has been a little bit of uptick in optimism, but what are the hotel revenue managers thinking right now? Are they still going with the defensive heads-in-bed strategy?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I think so. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that we are adding some special corporate accounts to what we had last year. We think it is sensible to do that. Really what we're doing is we're running the business with an expectation, so this is about cost management, it is about driving top-line with an expectation that we're going to continue to slug it out in a pretty low-growth GDP environment. If there is strength in GDP, it's all upside. But if there is no strength in GDP, we want to make sure we're delivering the best results we can.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.

During the speakers' prepared remarks, all lines will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","It is now my pleasure to hand today's program over to Carl Berquist, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today, October 29, 2015, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","So, let's get started. Third quarter diluted earnings per share totaled $0.78, $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance of $0.72 to $0.76. We beat EPS guidance largely due to lower-than-expected G&A spending, favorable G&A timing, the beneficial impact of a joint venture true up, and the favorable net impact of share repurchases. These items more than offset weaker than expected incentive fees from hotels in North America and the Middle East.","Third quarter worldwide system-wide RevPAR increased 4.5% on a constant dollar basis, 2.2% on an actual currency basis. In North America, system-wide RevPAR increased 4.2% in the quarter, reflecting the unfavorable holiday pattern and difficult comparisons, evidenced by the fact that over the last two years combined, North America third quarter RevPAR increased 13%.","In Europe, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR increased over 9% in the third quarter, benefiting from the weak euro and strong special events in Germany and Amsterdam as well as greater Middle East travel to Berlin, Munich, and London. Travelers from the U.S. made up nearly half of our occupancy improvement in the region.","In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR rose 5%. Strong demand drove India and Indonesia RevPAR up at double-digit rates. RevPAR at hotels in Mainland China increased more than 4%, with Shanghai RevPAR up more than 9% alone. Mainland Chinese outbound travelers filled hotels in Thailand and Japan in the quarter, but they did not favor Hong Kong, where occupancy rates declined. In Korea, the MERS outbreak earlier in the year continued to constrain lodging demand.","In Africa, RevPAR for our recently acquired Protea Hotels in South Africa rose nearly 9% system-wide for the quarter. While Protea RevPAR stats are not included in our comparable RevPAR results, they still show the strong performance of this new brand.","For our comparable hotels in the Middle East and Africa region, third quarter RevPAR increased 4%, which was lower than expected due to that region's instability and the impact of an unscheduled extended holiday period in September. Across our managed hotel system, house profit margins benefited from improved productivity and lower food and utility costs, increasing 40 basis points domestically and 50 basis points worldwide.","Global fee revenues totaled $465 million in the third quarter, 4% higher than the prior-year. Foreign exchange reduced fee revenue by approximately $8 million. Incentive fees alone were reduced by $4 million from foreign exchange.","Our year-over-year growth in incentive fees reflected strong limited service performance in North America and the addition of our Delta Hotels in Canada, offset by the foreign exchange headwinds, renovation impact and the modest RevPAR growth among significant incentive fee paying hotels, including hotels in Hong Kong and Seoul.","Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of expenses totaled $54 million in the quarter. Results reflected strong credit card branding fees offset by the impact of renovations at our Charlotte City Center Marriott Hotel and lower year-over-year termination fees.","General and administrative expenses improved to $149 million in the third quarter, compared to $172 million in the prior-year. Prior-year results included a net $4 million Venezuela currency devaluation charge.","Compared to guidance, G&A expense in the 2015 third quarter benefited from solid cost control, lower-than-expected Delta transition costs, and some favorable timing on initiative spending. For the full-year, our G&A spending is roughly on target, 6% lower than 2014.","Turning to our fourth quarter outlook for North America, our long-standing strong group revenue pace in the fourth quarter supports our 5% to 7% RevPAR guidance. Outside North America, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR will increase 3% to 5% on a constant dollar basis.","Our fourth quarter international outlook is about 100 basis points lower than our last guidance, largely due to political disruption in the Middle East and weaker results in Hong Kong. Globally, we expect constant dollar system-wide RevPAR will increase 4% to 6% for the fourth quarter. Combined with continued unit growth, fourth quarter fee revenue should increase 7% to 9% and earnings per share should total $0.74 to $0.78 compared to the $0.68 in the prior-year.","For the full-year 2015, we anticipate EPS will total $3.12 to $3.16, a 23% to 24% growth rate over the prior-year. Full-year adjusted EBITDA could reach more than $1.7 billion for the year or a 13% to 15% increase over 2014.","For the full-year 2015, investment spending could total $700 million to $800 million, including about $140 million in maintenance spending. We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchase. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we've recycled nearly $800 million in proceeds from asset sales, loan repayments, and the like.","Given the considerable amount of capital recycling this year, combined with strong operating cash flow, we expect to return more than $2.25 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends this year, a new record. Year-to-date through today, we've already returned over $2 billion to shareholders.","Now to talk about our development pipeline in 2016 outlook, let me turn it over to Arne.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. I spent early October in China attending the HICAP Hotel Investment Conference and visiting hotels around the region. Early October includes Golden Week in China.","This year, an estimated 750 million Chinese citizens traveled during that week. Airports, highways and train stations were packed. Chinese tourism is booming, and we are seeing the impact all over the Asia Pacific region, particularly in Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia.","Strong demand at our hotels throughout the region is also driving hotel development, particularly outside of China. Over the last 12 months, our rooms pipeline in the Asia Pacific region has grown 14%, with more than half of the region's pipeline expansion coming from outside China. We are seeing growing development interest in our brands in Japan, Indonesia, Korea, and Australia, and we opened our first hotel in Taipei in the quarter.","In the Middle East, we are likely to sign a record number of deals in 2015. We just opened the Ritz-Carlton, Cairo and plan to open the Palace Hotel in Jeddah as a Ritz-Carlton in 2016. We also recently signed agreements to convert the historic landmark Mena House in Cairo, located near the base of the Pyramids in Giza. After renovations, the property will open partially as JW Marriott and partly as a Marriott Hotel.","In Africa, the integration of the Protea acquisition is nearly complete. Today, we have roughly 100 hotels as a result of the acquisition with more locations coming. Just this month, the team signed a Marriott Hotel and Marriott Executive Apartments in Johannesburg, our first Marriott branded products in South Africa.","In the Caribbean and Latin America, our pipeline totals nearly 12,000 rooms with a growing number of managed and franchised limited service hotels in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. In fact, with the strength of our pipeline, by 2018, we expect to increase our distribution in the region by 75%.","In Europe, our Moxy, Courtyard, AC, and Autograph brands are in particularly high demand. We've added more developers in that region with a focus on secondary and tertiary markets. As a result, our European pipeline has grown by a third in the last 12 months. For the Moxy brand alone, we already have 30 hotels in our European pipeline.","In North America, our development pipeline reached 144,000 rooms at the end of the third quarter, a 20% increase over the past 12 months. Our limited service pipeline in North America reached a record 1,000 hotels at the end of the third quarter. Our AC and Moxy brands are moving fast in North America with attractive locations concentrated in urban markets. Together, these two brands have 82 hotels in the region's pipeline.","Speaking of Moxy, this month I toured a sample room for two Moxy hotels that are expected to open in Manhattan in 2017. You can see a photo on Twitter. It's a very cool room that should resonate with younger, stylish travelers and those of us who just like to be.","Marriott continues to garner an outsized share of the new construction in the United States. Once again, this quarter with only a 10% share of existing rooms in the U.S., Marriott brands represent more than one quarter of all new U.S. construction, more than any other company according to Smith Travel.","We are doing well on conversions as well, globally, across all our brands. Year-to-date in 2015, we've converted 33 hotels with 6,000 rooms to our brands. Excluding M&A, we expect conversions will account for over 20% of our room additions this year.","We are also starting to see conversions to our Delta brand. We expect the first U.S. project will open later this year in Orlando after a meaningful renovation. We currently have six Delta Hotels in our North American development pipeline.","Our Autograph brand just passed its fifth-year anniversary, and there has been a lot to celebrate. Year-to-date in 2015, we've added 18 hotels to the brand worldwide, half of them outside the U.S. We expect Autograph will have nearly 100 hotels in the system by year-end 2015, making this one of the fastest brand launches we've ever seen.","Worldwide, given the strength of our pipeline and the hotels that have opened year-to-date, we expect to add 7% to 8% more rooms in 2015, including the nearly 10,000 room acquisition of Delta. For 2016, we expect organic growth to accelerate to roughly 8%. We expect to remove roughly 1% per year from our system in both years. New brand platforms help this growth. Nearly one-third of our newly signed rooms in the last 12 months are in brands we didn't have five years ago and roughly 30% are luxury or lifestyle rooms.","Owners agree that our brands have never been in better shape. We estimate owners and franchisees have invested $4 billion in the past five years in hotel renovations. New room designs and lobby renovations enhanced the value of our brands to our guests and returns to our owners. Since service innovations are ongoing, and Marriott mobile has taken off.","In the past year, our app has been downloaded over six million times and reservations through the app are up 27%. Mobile check-ins and check-outs have reached nearly six million in just over two years. We also continue to introduce new and exciting opportunities for our Marriott Rewards members, including exclusive access to concerts and top entertainment, chances to win a once-in-a-lifetime Super Bowl 50 experience, and member-only NBA events around the world during the NBA global games. And it's working. The Wall Street Journal recently reported survey results that rated Marriott Rewards as the best program in the industry.","We're also connecting with consumers and engaging with our customers like never before. At our headquarters, MLive, our real-time marketing brand newsroom and social media command center, has been busier than ever.","A dedicated team of marketers review social data in conversations in real-time, identifying opportunities for our portfolio of 19 brands to engage with guests. We address travel issues, special events, and trending topics. In fact, the MLive team is live tweeting our earnings call right now. We are expanding MLive globally and will be opening up MLive Asia Pacific in Hong Kong next month.","Now before turning to 2016 RevPAR, let me take a minute to reflect on current demand trends. It's obvious that many of you became anxious about our industry during the third quarter as STR reported softer year-over-year RevPAR numbers.","To some extent, the early reaction to our earnings release last night seems to be the same. To the more modest RevPAR numbers we posted in Q3 foretell a weakening of the demand driven growth that began in 2010. While we cannot be certain about many things, there are powerful reasons to conclude the sky is not falling. We have known since the beginning of the year that the third quarter with its challenging holiday pattern would be a weak quarter, particularly for group and business transient travel. The actual results prove that out.","Group nights were down modestly from the prior-year, as were special corporate rooms. The best indication that these statistics are driven by calendar and comparison issues rather than by fundamental demand trends is found in a few other real data points.","As of the end of the quarter, our group business on the books for Q4 for our U.S. managed hotels is up in excess of 7% compared to last year. Our group revenue for all of 2016 is also up over 7% compared to year ago levels for 2015. These strong numbers are not the result of historic bookings only.","In the third quarter itself, our North American system-wide hotels added in excess of 7% more group room revenue for all future periods than they did a year ago. And of course, we continued to post record hotel occupancies.","Similarly, when we look at early returns for the fourth quarter, the data is comforting. Based upon month-to-date figures, we expect RevPAR in the U.S. to be up roughly 6% in October. When all is said and done, what we see seems fairly clear. The demand led recovery that began in 2010 is alive and well. To it, we should see additional growth from existing new unit openings, where Marriott is one of only very few companies that are seeing strong unit growth trends.","So, let's talk about our RevPAR outlook for 2016. Our budget process is just beginning, and there are, to be sure, many uncertainties around the world. We are unprepared to offer EPS guidance yet, but we would like to share our early thinking.","In North America, we expect system-wide RevPAR will increase at a 4% to 6% rate in 2016. As I mentioned, group revenue pace for 2016 is up more than 7%, including roughly 3% increases in average daily rate.","We expect special corporate rates will rise at a mid-single-digit rate in 2016 for comparable customers, but also expect to improve the mix of our business, increasing the proportion of full retail rate business in our North American hotels.","STR is forecasting 1.4% supply growth in the U.S. in 2016 and 2.2% demand growth. With record occupancy in many markets, transient pricing is likely to rise as downtown demand compresses to suburban properties and peak season demands spills over to shoulder periods.","Outside North America, we expect our international system-wide RevPAR will also increase 4% to 6% on a constant dollar basis in 2016.","In Europe, weak demand in Moscow and Istanbul are likely to coincide with high supply growth in those markets. In Germany, supply growth should be modest, but fewer affairs in Germany should constrain RevPAR growth. For Paris, RevPAR should strengthen with the Eurocup in June and July. Strong demand in London and Amsterdam will likely be tempered by tough comparisons to special events in 2015. Given all this, we anticipate that constant dollar RevPAR will increase at a low single-digit rate at our European hotels in 2016. Europe contributed about 7% of our fee revenue in 2014.","In Greater China, we expect mid-single-digit RevPAR growth in 2016, reflecting continued economic growth in that market constrained by weak mainland travel to Hong Kong. Our Asia Pacific region generated nearly 9% of our fee revenue in 2014 with about half coming from outside Greater China.","And here the picture is brighter. South Korea should see much stronger results as hotels in that market face easy comparison to the 2015 MERS outbreak. Similarly, easy comparisons and better economic growth should help, Thailand. We expect the Indonesian economy will show strength due to significant infrastructure construction, and we believe growing international arrivals in Japan will drive RevPAR higher in that market. All combined, we anticipate mid-single-digit RevPAR growth in the Asia Pacific region in 2016.","For the Caribbean and Latin America region, we expect strength in Mexico and the Caribbean, will drive 2016 RevPAR for the region at a mid-single-digit rate. In 2014, the Caribbean and Latin America represented nearly 5% of our fee revenue.","For the Middle East and Africa region, a recent demand has been hurt by political instability in some markets and fewer international arrivals from Europe and Russia. For 2016, we are modeling a mid-single-digit RevPAR growth for the region, assuming stabilization in Egypt and continued economic growth in Saudi. The Middle East and Africa region represented 3% of our fee revenue in 2014.","We'll have more information to share with you in February; but for now, we are looking at worldwide system-wide RevPAR growth of 4% to 6% on a constant dollar basis and unit growth of roughly 7% \u2013 or excuse me, 8% gross and 7% net.","We know these metrics drive meaningful growth in cash flow and earnings and look forward to sharing with you guidance built after our full 2016 budgeting process is complete. For now, we are confident 2016 will be another good year.","We appreciate your interest in Marriott, so that we can speak to you, as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. So, Arne, thanks for all the color. Really helpful particularly, given all the lodging earnings calls we've been listening to for the past couple of days. Just had a question on October and we know from STR and we know for some comments that your peers have made, that October was weaker than expected due to lower than expected transient demand. Tough comps aside, I'm just trying to dig into the drivers here. Do you think that what's happened in October is a blip, and why do you think it's slowed? So, acknowledging that the visibility in your industry is kind of low, I'm just wondering if you expect that to improve.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. One of the dangers, of course, of all of this is, we've got so much data and it comes out really currently. So, you get Smith Travel coming out every week. You obviously are all struggling to get through one earnings call after another from participants in the lodging industry this week and next week.","And I know we're sort of piling up on you and it makes it seemingly that much more imperative to assess these day-to-day or week-to-week figures, which is a little hard to do, of course. And the fact of matters, we've got numbers through basically last Sunday, which are the RevPAR numbers we referenced when we talk about 6% growth in October.","And we can get anecdotal and, you know, some information about what's happening during the month on a week-to-week basis, but it's much better to analyze when the month comes to an end. What we see at this point is not very significant. Transient may be a touch weaker than we would have anticipated, but it's a touch. And, again, at 6% RevPAR growth, it still feels like a reasonably healthy number.","Obviously, also this morning, we've got GDP news, with third quarter GDP out at a sub-2% number. We know GDP is highly correlated with demand, and you shouldn't hear our optimism or, I suspect, any of the voices from the industry, suggesting per minute that we will perform in a way that is disconnected with GDP performance. So, you know, that could be a piece of that as well.","But, I think when we look at it, what we see is still strong appetite from group customers, still strong appetite from our corporate travelers, good performance from the leisure side, particularly when we're in holiday times of the year. And all of those things cause us to believe we should continue to see this RevPAR growth in this pretty healthy mid-single-digit range.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just something you said, was on group, was a good segue, so I'm just wondering, as you said, the group business remains really healthy. And just if you go back from your past experience and you look, think about all the past cycles historically, is it transient that's the leading indicator in the cycle, or is it group?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, neither really is a leading indicator; but transient is more or less coincident with GDP. Group would be very much a lagging indicator. At least when you look at group, stayed and paid, and of course, one of the \u2013 we now look, I think a little bit more than we did in prior cycles at group bookings in the quarter. But, the booking stats will probably be also coincident, I would guess, with the transient numbers. But, we still generally think we'd probably lag GDP numbers by, you know, a few months, something like that. Better would be looking at GDP data, I suppose.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning. Can we look ahead into 2016 and discuss your buyback plans? Your leverage ratio seems to be at the moment at the higher end of the comfort level that you've outlined. And so, as part of your response, can you also talk about what your CapEx plans are in 2016 versus 2015? Is there any shot that you can get to over $2 billion worth of share repo in 2016?","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we haven't done any of our budgets and planning for 2016 yet, so it's a little early to be looking out and trying to predict what our total share buyback would be in 2016. But I think, one thing you got to remember is that we had in 2015, Harry, we had a lot of asset sales, capital transactions in 2015, probably to the tune of about $800 million of capital was recycled, and the reality is we don't have a lot on the books today.","As far as our, you know, to sell for next year. As far as our leverage goes, we're sitting right about three times when you adjust for leases and guarantees and all that, which is about where we would expect to be as of the end of the third quarter.","So, as far as capital spending next year, right now, you would expect it to be what we average over the last several years. You know, we're always in that $500 million to $700 million range, $600 million to $800 million range. Some years it moves up a little bit, some years it's down a little bit, but you could probably count on it being somewhere in that neighborhood.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Very good. And then as a follow-up, Arne, if you could talk about there's an interesting disconnect between the performance in the base fees and the performance of the management fees or the franchise fees in the third quarter. And if you could talk a little bit about the reasons behind that. And to the extent, as you're signing new management contracts, are they at similar rates than your historic contracts?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, the answer to the second question first is a resounding yes. A couple of things going on in this. If you look at the combined base management and franchise fees, obviously, they are both driven by rooms revenues or gross revenues of the hotels. And when you look at actual dollar RevPAR in unit growth, you get a sort of implied growth of about 8.5%, something like that, in fees, and what we reported was a bit over 9%.","Now the 9% I'm using, by the way, is adjusted for the special items that were called out in the press release. So, if you look at the press release, description of base management and franchise fees, you see in there, the year-over-year numbers for some deferred fee collections, year-over-year numbers for relicensing fees and the FX impact.","So, you put those things together, you get the kind of growth, maybe even a little bit better than you would have expected from our unit growth and our RevPAR growth. Why a little bit better? Because sometimes you get some ramping in franchise fees, so as they get to year two or year three or year four, they're going up a little bit more than what they were before. That also is good confirmation about your second question, Harry, which is the percentages we're getting on these contracts for base and for franchise fees are remaining quite strong and stable, if not even growing a little bit.","And then you get your question about, I think what you were also asking maybe was about really the difference in RevPAR between managed and franchised hotels. Is that right, Harry, or were you asking something else?","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","No, no, that's right.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I think there, it's really a question of mix. We tend to be on average bigger in the managed portfolio than in the franchise portfolio. We tend to be more group reliant in the managed portfolio than in the franchise portfolio, and we tend to be more urban, more business destination in manage versus franchise. And all of those things play out with the weaker, relatively weaker group in Q3, and relatively weaker business, special corporate business in Q3, which, you know, relatively depresses the managed RevPAR numbers compared to the franchised.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Got it. Thanks very much.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. So, I had a question about the unit growth. You talked about the 8%. It looks like it's down about 50 basis points from the last call, and I know the release mentioned some delays in openings. And so, just kind of doing the math on that 50 basis points maybe slipping into 2016, is that when you talk about accelerating unit growth in 2016, would that still be the case if it weren't for the property openings kind of delayed? I guess, mathematically, it looks like that shift of 50 basis points is what makes 2016 accelerate.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Good question, Robin. Good morning. We have had, I don't know whether the 50 basis point is right, maybe, Carl or Laura can check as I talk about this for a minute. But we have had some openings shift from late 2015 we think into 2016. As we've scrubbed those, we think very few of those are projects that are actually at risk long-term. But there has been some slippage. I think there are different reasons for that in different parts of the world.","As I mentioned, I was in China a couple of weeks ago. China conditions obviously have been less bullish in many aspects of their economy in the last quarter or so, and I think it's causing folks to rush a little less to get things completed, and as a consequence, we'll see some of those deals open in 2016 that we initially expected to open in 2015. And there are always some dynamics around the world, where things take a little bit longer than maybe we initially anticipate.","That net-net could be positive for 2016, but I suspect we're also anticipating that some of the same dynamic will occur in 2016, so the bulk of the reason for our 8% organic growth number gross in 2016, is less about shifting of openings and more simply about the maturing of the pipeline. So at 8%, you're talking about, you know, roughly 60,000 rooms opening in 2016.","Recall we signed 100,000 new rooms in calendar year 2014; and this year, we're obviously not done yet, but I suspect the numbers are going to be close to that figure; and so if anything, we should see that 2017 and 2018, we continue to perform at good, if not even growing gross opening numbers.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Bill.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","A couple of questions, Arne. First of all, I think that what has happened in the investment space here is that investors are demanding actual proof that the cycle is not ending as opposed to taking it on faith when we hear commentary by you and Chris and other people. And I think over the last week, we've kind of shifted our expectations of proof into the first quarter of next year, given October commentary. Is there anything we need to be aware of for the first quarter of next year? Very difficult comps, maybe holiday shifts, anything else that might further delay this evidence that things are healthy?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","New Year's Day is on January 1 in 2016.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, yeah.","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Easter will fall on a Sunday.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I don't. It's a good question and you can tell from my quip that maybe I don't know for certain about that. When we look at group bookings by quarter for next year, I mentioned we're up a bit over 7%. We're a little, a tiny little bit weaker than average in Q1 in the 5% to 6% range. Q2 is a bit stronger than the average for the full year.","And then it looks like, and we have to go look at the calendar, but it looks like we're having a bit of a shift back of the fall holidays in favor of Q3 and maybe a little bit against Q4, because we've got a sort of gonzo set of numbers on the books for Q3, and a relatively weaker set of numbers on the books for Q4. When you average them all out again, we come up well above 7% for group bookings. That all suggests to me that the calendar issues are probably of significance more likely in Q3 and Q4 than in Q1 and Q2.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. The follow-up question really revolves around the development pipeline. We're seeing construction costs and labor costs, land costs increasing pretty dramatically across other parts of the real estate sectors. What are your developers telling you? What is the cost inflation out there, and how might that impact the growth of your pipeline?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I mean, they are certainly seeing both land and construction cost inflation. I think it varies significantly by market. The urban big destinations are seeing more of that as our sense than the suburban markets.","And remember, a lot of our, the U.S. pipeline is this 1,000 hotels we talked about in our limited service brands. Some of those are urban projects like most of the ACs and Moxys that are getting underway now. But many of those are still in secondary and tertiary markets. And I think that the cost pressure there is meaningfully less.","The other thing, we've got to keep in mind is projects still start notwithstanding that pressure, because you have both of the benefits of continued relatively cheap debt, and you've got better returns, because the results from these hotels are getting better every quarter.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Arne M.

Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Joe?","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Joe, are you there?","Operator","If your line is on mute, you need to, please unmute it. I'm sorry.","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, guys. How are you?","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Shaun.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Shaun.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, Arne, I'm going to apologize in advance for nitpicking on something so small, but just flag the comment and I think you sense the investor fear out there around some of the near-term data points. So, in the Q4 outlook, you made the comment that right now based on what you see, you're looking like you're probably closer to the low end of your range. And I was curious, with it sounds like October coming in at 6%, if you could elaborate at all on that. And again, this is just in the spirit of people who are, I think really looking for any real-time read on what's going on?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's a fair question. And I think somebody put out. And no, I don't remember who it was last night that, you know, if you thought you're at the lower end of that 5% or 7%, why didn't you just come out with a different number.","And one of the fundamental points here is, we provide a range so that we can sort of contemplate a relevant, but a potential difference in the way the actual numbers ultimately come in. And we don't torture ourselves, and we don't torture our teams to try and change those models every time you get a new weekly data point. We do, you know, October is the most significant month of the three months in the quarter, so that 6% number, if it ultimately comes to pass is a comforting one.","By the time you get into December, you've got less group reliance and much more transient reliance, which makes it a little harder to predict. And as a consequence, it's a little harder for us to sit here and say we can guarantee you what the December numbers are going to be, because a lot of that depends on transient business that has yet to show up.","December is, of course, by contrast, the weakest of the three months in the quarter, because you slip more and more into non-travel periods and leisure times. We'd expect, though, that leisure business is going to be healthy, both in Thanksgiving and the end-of-the-year holidays, because you've got \u2013 that's what we've seen over the course of the year.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And I appreciate that. My follow-up is sort of a bigger picture question. But obviously all year long and really for pretty much the entire cycle, you guys have been very active on the stock buyback side of the capital return. But as we approach at least by duration standards made in later part of the cycle and we continue to hear a lot about strategic alternatives elsewhere in the sector, I'm kind of curious for, is there a time at which you start to think about perhaps dialing back and preserving some cash for opportunities that might emerge on the consolidation landscape? And maybe at a high level, if you could talk about how you're thinking about that, it would be great.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We've obviously participated, at least, in a small way, in some consolidation over the last few years, although those deals have always been like $200 million deals, nothing terribly significant.","And we've obviously done some things around real estate, particularly as a way of getting some of the new brands off the ground, the three additional hotels we developed being the most significant of those. All of you have heard us talk in the past about not only being willing, but in some respects being eager to use our investing capacity to invest in growing in our business.","If we can do it in a way that creates value for our shareholders, which means not simply chasing whatever the market prices are, that are out there, and it certainly does not mean doing real estate deals if our real estate partners are aggressive about doing real estate deals in delivering the growth to us in the organic way that we love so much.","Carl mentioned, our leverage ratios at the end of Q3 were about three times, I think technically they were 2.93 times or something like that?","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Just low.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so even though, we've been really aggressive in buying back our stock, we thought it was a stunning buy in Q3, which is one reason the numbers were so big that we reported this morning.","We are by no means over levered. We still have a machine that produces lots of cash, and we think we've got the ability to both be aggressive in buying back stock in the years ahead, but also be aggressive in whatever opportunities pop up, if they pop up, to participate in growing our business through our use of capital.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Can you hear me okay now?","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey. There you are. You figured out the phone, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Figuring out the phone is almost as difficult as forecasting RevPAR correctly. But when you think about 2016, I know you characterized it, Arne, as sort of early thinking on 2016. When you think about the performance of the incentive management fees in 2016 versus 2015, would you say they have a sort of more historical base trend or relationship with RevPAR, particularly given the relatively easy year-over-year comparison in 2015? And then further on the net unit growth forecast for 2016, how are you thinking about that in terms of full-service versus deluxe service? Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So let's see, incentive fee growth, think about \u2013 let's just think together about 2016 versus 2015, because we don't really have a number to give you, and won't until we get through our budgeting process.","Obviously incentive fees have been impacted meaningfully by FX this year. Hopefully, we will not have that same pronounced impact next year, which would suggest that more of the constant dollar RevPAR growth as opposed to the actual dollar RevPAR growth should be coming through and helping that incentive fee number grow.","We have had weakness in some big incentive fee markets this year in the U.S., New York, and Washington outside in markets like Hong Kong, Seoul, and some of the Middle Eastern markets. Is New York going to be a meaningfully different story in 2016 and 2015?","I wouldn't think so. I think we'll continue to see in New York very high occupancy, good strong rates, and in absolute terms, a very healthy market. But it's a market that will continue to see supply growth and as a consequence, we wouldn't put that at the average level of RevPAR growth for the U.S., for example, today.","Washington group bookings look better next year, which is a little bit unusual, because usually an election-year in Washington is not a great year for the hotel business, because the politicians are out on the hustings; but group business, I think if I remember right, is up in the 5% to 6% range for Washington.","And so, Washington might be a little bit better than it's been in the past. Seoul will be better, I would think, assuming they don't have the MERS crisis. They do still struggle with their dominant company is Samsung, which is, responsible for nearly half of their economic GDP I think, and Samsung is in a very competitive place today. But I'd be interesting to see how they perform. Japan should perform well. The team in Hong Kong is not certain what the fate for that market looks like. Certainly, there has been much less inbound business from China in 2015, which has had an impact on our China numbers and particularly our incentive fees.","I don't know that there's much we can look at that will help us decide whether that's going to do better or worse in 2016 and that will be relevant to fees. But sort of going through all of that, I would think that the numbers for incentive fee growth will be better than what we've seen this year, but we'll still have, you know, dependency on where exactly is that RevPAR growth coming through, and is it coming through in the markets which are bigger incentive fee contributions than others?","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the other question about full-service versus...","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Other questions about full-service versus limited service openings. I would think rough order of magnitude that, oh, it's 50%-50%-ish U.S. versus rest of the world in openings, maybe 55%, maybe a little over 50% in the U.S. and a little bit less in the rest of the world.","Of the U.S. portion, I think it's something like 80%-20%, maybe even a little higher than 80%-20% in favor of limited service hotels. So, it's still a relatively rare full-service opening. We do have, and again, I don't remember off the top of my head, what full-service hotels are well under construction now and opening next year; but I suspect we've got a couple of big ones that are getting near opening by the end of next year.","Unknown Speaker","Joe, you might also take a look at our Analyst Day last year. In Carl Berquist's presentation, we showed you the relative market sensitivity of incentive fees.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","By geographic market.","Unknown Speaker","By geographic market, yeah.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered. The one thing I wanted to kind of get some color on was it looks like Moxy and AC have 82 hotels signed. That's obviously a pretty sizable chunk for new brands to the U.S. Can you give us some color on, are you guys offering any incentives, are you doing anything to really drive those brands? Obviously, we've seen some competitors try to launch new brands in ground-up developments here in the U.S., and they haven't gotten that many openings in 10 years. So, what do you think you're doing differently that's really leveraging that to drive those, and also is there more upside for more new build brands in your portfolio?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, that's two or three questions, but thank you, that's good. I think the AC story is the one that I think is easiest to sort of boast about a little bit, but not just from a perspective of Marriott's role, but the perspective of the way that has evolved with our partners in the United States, and none of this is new, of course.","We bought AC a few years ago thinking it would broaden our distribution in Spain, where we were weak. We thought we were getting a brand and an operating company at a relatively low point in the economic cycle, and both of those things caused us to think it was a deal worth doing and we did it.","We didn't think at the time, it shows you maybe how dense we are, but we didn't think at the time that AC was at all relevant to markets like the United States. We thought maybe we could get some growth in other markets in Europe, but nothing really beyond there.","To some extent, it took our franchisees, some of whom had been to Spain and seen these hotels, to come back and say, you know what you ought to grow AC in the United States, we'd love to grow it with you. And what they saw was a lifestyle upscale hotel that could fit nicely within our brand and our strategy to grow a lifestyle portfolio of brands.","And so, they pushed us, and we ultimately thought that was a brilliant idea and so we launched it. But in many respects, we launched it with our partners. And what they see is a brand that fits wonderfully in our lineup already. They know how our brands perform. We did very detailed work on costing this with what the model rooms should look like and what the general approach to the operating model and public space was. And in short, it became clear that this was a project that broadly penciled. So, folks could get in, build it at fairly economic terms and drive strong projected cash flow returns. So, while we haven't been out there trying to grow AC for very long, we've got five open, as we speak, and a very strong pipeline, and if anything, that momentum is building a net pipeline.","Moxy, to some extent, is a similar story, but it's a year behind AC. So, we obviously started that as a brand-new brand in Europe with two significant partners there. We're off to a good start in Europe, and similarly our folks in the United States said this is pretty interesting. Why don't you think about bringing it here? And so, we've done that.","Now for neither of them are we doing anything significant in terms of promotion. I know that some of the early Moxy deals are in Manhattan, and we are participating in a few of those with some mezzanine debt financing, which is not dramatically unusual in a market like Manhattan, but it probably was maybe a little bit more necessary because it was a brand-new brand. But other than that, I can't think of any incentives that we've applied to that.","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Nothing unusual.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In terms of your last question, is there more upside for more new brands, hopefully one day yes, but we have nothing that we've got up our sleeves at the moment in terms of new organic brand launches in the United States.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","And how about any holes in the portfolio that you think might be filled nicely by incremental tuck-in acquisitions like you've done recently with Gaylord and Delta and Protea?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think many of the deals we've done recently give us a broader distribution in markets where we've been weak. And so, the brands are as much geographic as they are completion of gaps in the brand lineup. We don't see many gaps in the brand lineup, but hopefully we'll see opportunity in the years ahead to continue to grow in some geographic markets where we are relatively less distributed, and some of that growth may come with brands that we don't already have.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Arne.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, Arne, Carl and Laura. Just a couple of questions. First, the Autograph collection had relatively weak RevPAR growth of 1.6%, while independent hotel RevPAR in the third quarter was strong. Is this what we should expect from Autograph? I think there are some larger properties there that might be moving that around, but maybe you could explain that. And second question is, what sort of markets are you seeing new supply in? What would you call out major cities or major geographic regions?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So a couple of things here. The reference to Smith Travel independent hotels, I think it's really important to know that Smith Travel independent hotels is not a segment of the industry, which is a lot like the Autograph brand.","Look at the average rates and average occupancy of that segment as reported by Smith Travel, and you'll see that they are posting significantly lower rates and significantly lower occupancy than upper upscale or luxury or even upscale for that matter.","Independents in that report are mostly about hotels that no longer can carry a quality brand and so have in some way fallen off of it or in some way are operating in markets which are different than the typical market. So, I don't think that comparison fits.","Now at the same time, Autograph is, while it's grown quickly, is a relatively small portfolio. We have in the Cosmopolitan, for example, in Las Vegas a 3,000 room hotel that is a \u2013 can have a significant impact to the RevPAR numbers that we report year-over-year.","We know when we look at the way the Autograph collection is performing, that that portfolio has taken about 10 points of RevPAR index since converting from being independent to being part of Marriott's Autograph collection. And so, we are absolutely certain we are driving outsized market results with the conversion of those hotels to our brands.","Question two from Steve?","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.","It's about supply.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Manhattan would be the first, of course, New York. That market has seen 30% of their supply growth over the last handful of years. I suspect we will see continuing supply growth in New York for the next few years, so that would be one. I think Miami is certainly in the luxury space, has seen supply growth, and I suspect we'll see some more of it in the next couple of years. But probably not in a way that is as dramatic as what's happened in New York. Carl, any other U.S. cities you can think of?","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","U.S., nothing like New York...","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Nothing that comes to mind is significant. Then you get overseas, of course, Dubai, and some of the Middle Eastern markets are significant with supply growth. We called out Istanbul. Istanbul and Turkey have seen significant supply growth. I think those two places would be the ones that come top of mind.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. Sorry if I missed this, but any color on how corporate rate negotiation is going for next year? And then also Hilton touched a little bit high level on recent OTA negotiations. Can you give any color if you've had similar? Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We did have in our prepared remarks some comments about special corporate rates for next year. We think mid-single-digit RevPAR growth, so in the same range as the RevPAR range we provided for the full shop.","I suspect we'll see that some \u2013 we continue to call some of the lower rated special corporate business. We've done that a little bit in the last few years. I think we've been probably as aggressive as any in the industry in both driving those rates and to some extent being willing to take a little bit more risk by saying to some of the lower rated special corporate accounts that we're simply not going to take you and we hope that you will come back and participate in our hotels at a rack rate.","And I suspect we'll do some more of that next year. But it's still early in the process, and so I would take that as directional comments not necessarily as something that's totally proven, but mid single-digit.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","OTA.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Our comments would be a bit like Hilton's yesterday. There's nothing that we can publish specifically about the results of negotiations. We do think that the kinds of principles they've talked about are the same sorts of things we've talked about, which is we want to make sure we have as much ability to yield our rooms on various channels so that at fuller occupancy times we have the contractual right not to have every room available on every channel, no matter how expensive those channels are for us.","We also want to make sure that we've got the ability to do what we've been doing, which is deliver value to Marriott Reward members booking directly with us, which we've done through free Wi-Fi and other tools like that in the past year or two. And so, we continue to pursue similar kinds of philosophical aims and feel like we're making good progress on that.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, on other Asia Pacific, you said you expected that to be up mid-single-digits next year, but all your commentary seems pretty positive. I just wanted to see if I'm missing something.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I mean mid-single-digit we would say is reasonably positive. So, that...","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I mean, I guess compared to other regions, other regions you kind of highlighted like, there's some gives and takes versus other Asia Pacific it was all pretty positive. And I mean, using your peer, Hilton again, they, I think, guided more to the higher end of the range.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. One thing important to keep in mind, China is obviously a significant market when it comes to the region as a whole. Probably roughly half of our total distribution in Asia-Pacific is in Greater China. We talked about Hong Kong being weak-ish. We talked about Q3 China numbers being relatively good, particularly in markets like Shanghai and (59:56).","But when you look at China, you see different stories from place to place. And it's really important to keep in mind that portfolios of hotels depending on their maturity can have reported numbers in a quarter which are very different.","The longer somebody has been in China with broad distribution, the fewer ramping hotels they'll have. Ramping meaning newly comparable. And so, when we look at our numbers in Greater China this year, we see less contribution to our RevPAR growth from ramped hotels than we have in most of the last few years because our portfolio has gotten to be quite sizable.","But we still see that we have grown RevPAR index in China by four to five points in 2015 alone, building on top of some great years in the past so that our RevPAR index is now in the 125 range, which is a huge premium over competing hotels in the market.","A long-winded way of saying, our RevPAR at mid-single-digit next year for China is still a very strong number. We will be even more mature in China with hotels that we've got open than we were this year, and so we'll have less of that ramping effect.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citigroup.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to circle back on your third-quarter RevPAR performance in North America at 4.2%. I understand the whole industry was impacted by the calendar shifts and things that have been spoken about. But your RevPAR gains were so far below what Smith Travel put up for the third quarter and below the other companies that have reported. And I was just wondering if you could comment on any kind of market share shift or maybe concentration that maybe hurt you more than others or anything you're seeing along those lines?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely. I think it's a perfectly fair question. It shouldn't surprise you to know that when we look at market share, which is the best measure to look at, it's not in comparison against Smith Travel, I'll talk about that in second.","But when you look at market share numbers, we lost a little bit of market share in Q3 in exactly the kinds of hotels that you would expect. Group business was weak, and therefore, our convention center hotels, which we have more of than most of the industry by a significant measure, were hotels that lost a bit of market share, why? Because often a big 1,500 or 2,000 room hotel will have within its competitive set hotels which are meaningfully smaller and, therefore, are less reliant on group business than the market than we are.","And if you adjust for that and a bit of renovation activity, we see our performance as being roughly comparable to the market. Now when you compare it with Smith Travel, Smith Travel is reporting every single hotel open in a given market and how that RevPAR compared to what happened in the past.","We report RevPAR only for comp hotels. So, those are hotels that have got two years' worth of stabilized comparative performance. And when you do that, you are taking the fastest-growing RevPAR, year-over-year RevPAR growth hotels out of a comparative point. So, we have tried to calculate what our RevPAR would be, if we use Smith Travel numbers, and basically those growth numbers would be a point to two higher than what our reported numbers are.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. First question, when you think back to the scenarios that you gave on your Investor Day a-year-and-a-half ago, would you look back and say that, for example, net income for 2017 at this point looks on target, conservative or aggressive?","And also other metrics such as incentive management fees. I guess if you were to go back in time, would you say, wow, these are too conservative given what's happened and what we expect or they are in line with those original expectations. And again, I understand that that wasn't guidance, it was just scenarios, but if you could give some thought on that?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'd suspect we find some things that are a bit better and some things that are bit worse. But all-in-all, it's probably still a model which is relevant. Now we should be careful in saying that. I don't want to communicate for a second that we've got a brand-new three-year model, which is sitting in my right, which shows that the numbers for 2017 are the same as what we published for you last year.","But just thinking about the drivers, I would think that unit growth is probably a bit stronger than what we had. I would think that the share repurchase activity that we've done and the impact of that is a bit better than what we had in that model. In other words, not only have we bought significantly, but we probably bought at marginally better pricing than we had in that model, and earlier. And so, I think both those things are positives. RevPAR itself, I'd have to go back and look at that \u2013 look at the forecasts we used.","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We were at 4% to 6%.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We were at 4% to 6%, and we kind of tapered the RevPAR growth just because we thought with each year of economic recovery we should obviously expect a bit less. But I would think we're maybe not far off, certainly within the same broad range. So, put all those \u2013 by the way, incentive fees, my guess could be a bit lighter. Because when you look at what we will actually report in incentive fee growth this year, substantially impacted by FX which we would not have anticipated when we did that model that we published for you a year ago.","I suspect we would see FX impact on fees generally being tougher and probably the incentive fee growth numbers being a bit weaker than what we had in that model. But put all those things together, I suspect you're probably still with the relevant model.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then my follow-up question, when we think about incentive management fee growth for next year, you know let's just hypothetically say, for currency neutral in a currency neutral scenario and let's say occupancy is flat next year, what level of ADR growth would you need to have in order to at least be flat year-over-year for incentive management fees?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't know that I can give you that. I mean I think in the U.S., you probably need to have, I don't know, three percentage RevPAR growth.","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","3%, I would think just to break even.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","3% to have flat margins.","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Flat margins on 3% revenue growth means your incentive fees are growing 3%.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","If you get to the rest of the world, the formulas differ. And by the way, in the rest of the world, we'll have a number of full-service hotels that are in year two or three or four of their operation, which means they're probably growing faster. And hopefully, if you've got flat FX, we'll see reasonably healthy IMF fee growth next year. But we're going a little far afield here in the sense that we're building on things that we really need to go through our budgeting process in order to give you...","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That's still more complex thing. Yeah.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...something that's reliable.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Do you mind if I sneak one last question in?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You can give it a try.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Just what is your income sensitivity, what is the latest income sensitivity to one additional point of net room growth? I know you've given that in the past. What is that currently?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Net room growth or net RevPAR growth?","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","No, room. One additional point of, percentage point of room growth in say 2016 is worth how much in net income? For example, you know, you said you've given the outlook. Was it 6% or around 7%?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All I would do is say that's worth one point increment in fees.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And probably the admin \u2013 if your base model has got admin in it, you probably don't need to add any admin to go with that. And so that drops down and run it through your normal tax rate that Carl has got in the P&L model, and that would be your number.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Perfect.

I'm curious about the tone of your discussions with corporate customers during rate negotiation season. Do you get a sense that their plans consist of stepping up, maintaining or reducing travel as we head into next year?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's maybe stable to up a bit. We don't hear a regular commentary that would suggest that they're going to try and cut back on travel. At the same time, it probably shouldn't surprise you that not many special corporate people come in, in the context of a negotiation and say we're going to dramatically increase our volume next year. But I think on balance, we see continued good tone in that group of customers.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Helpful. Thanks. And then second on the topic of OTAs, could you provide an update on how the Trip partnership is progressing?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's off to a very good start, but we're not going to share any statistics with you yet. And whether and how we do in the future, we'll have to see. We announced it I don't remember precisely the date, I would think about the beginning of the third quarter, maybe a little bit before.

Can you estimate for us how much that might have helped occupancies, and maybe what plans you have for 2016 to broaden either the hotels that applies to or any plans to expand that policy to be even more restrictive?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We followed most of our competitors. I don't know if I can tell you exactly where every single person is, but we saw most of our competitors move to a 24-hour cancellation window from a same-day cancellation.","And we did the same thing roughly first of the year, if I remember right. And what we've seen that is particularly gratifying is a reduction in the number of folks that get walked. So, that's a little bit different point than the one you raised.","So, in the past, with same-day cancellations, you actually didn't know who's going to show up into your hotel until the day ended. And as a consequence, you had hotels all over the place trying to say, all right, we know that some percentage of our customers won't show up, because they've got free ability to cancel until the last minute. And so, let's do some overbooking in order to make sure that we've got guests to fill those rooms if somebody cancels.","And we've seen that because of this 24-hour cancellation rule, we've got a lot of that walk the business down, which obviously is not something that anybody likes, if you are being forced to walk. The other thing what we see is, we've got high occupancy days, meaning days above 96% that are 5% more of those days than we did a year ago.","And I think that's also driven by this. I think for those that were less aggressive about overbooking and risking having to walk folks, they've now got that much more clarity to put business on the books and drive the occupancy even higher. But I think also this is driven by good healthy demand as well, so it's not purely a function of the cancellation policy.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. And just I'm curious what are the industry and economic variables that maybe push you to the top or bottom end of your 4% to 6% outlook for the U.S. market next year? Are there specific thresholds to GDP or other variables you need to see?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think so, no. I think about demand and GDP as being correlated. So, the better GDP is the better chance we have it being towards the higher end of that.","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's actually on transient.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And maybe just one last question on advertising costs. I'm just curious, as you ramp MLive and others social media channels, can you curtail more traditional advertising channels, or is it all kind of incremental at this point?","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, that's what we're doing. We have essentially a fixed percentage that is contributed to pay for sales and marketing initiatives from hotels. We do have more dollars coming in because of the number of units that we're adding to the system, but we're not increasing the charge-out rate in given hotels. We are spending in areas that we haven't spent in the past to do things like make movies and do social media and do all sorts of fun stuff, which we think actually is succeeding very well. But we are \u2013 to find dollars to do that, we're having to spend less in some areas that we've spend money on before. That would certainly include traditional TV advertising.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","Our final question comes from Chris Agnew with MKM Partners.","Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Chris.","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC","You talked about your share of U.S. supply growth versus room share. Can you provide same data points for Europe and Asia? I know that encapsulates a lot of different stories, but can you give us a broad overview, and also what is industry supply growth in Europe and Asia, if you can share that? Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Those are all good questions, Chris, and I think you're going to stump us here on the last question. This is a little bit different measure than you talked about, but we do try and track in Asia-Pacific, our market share of new deals that the industry signs. And it's a little hard to get, but a number of our principal competitors are willing to share through a clearinghouse, okay, how many deals did you sign in the quarter across particular regions of the world, and we think we are doing great, that we've got \u2013 this is not \u2013 the industry as a whole necessarily this will probably be the bigger lodging companies, and what share of the total signings of all those companies do we have?","And we think in a market like Asia-Pacific, where we have been certainly in the full-service and luxury tiers where we are most focused in that part of the world that we are in first quarter or second quarter after quarter and that our share is dramatically higher than our current distribution.","So, that's an example of the kind of data that we see that causes us to believe that we are seeing some of the same kind of dynamics that we see in the United States, where the data is much more available. In the United States, you've got both STR and lodging econometrics that look at essentially all new industry deals, and it gives us all an ability to both have a third-party measure but also look at it with our own eyes.","Europe, I don't have, at least not top of mind, quite the same insight, but our teams see that our pipeline is growing well, and we think the brands are competing well. So, I'm sure, we're taking meaningfully more share in the development side than we have of the existing hotel distribution.","Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks. And maybe just one more, hopefully a quick one. Can you give us any color on transient demand maybe by source demand in terms of different industries? Thanks.","Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't have that. If you give us a call, we can help you with that.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, give a call. The only thing I think we know is that the weakness in oil makes some markets like Houston weaker than other markets. And obviously, you can identify which markets that the industry segment is most relevant to, and there we see some customers that are under pressure, and we see demand trends which are weaker than in the rest of the world.","But if you look at technology, you look at finance, both significant customers of ours and what you see is good health. And I actually think that the data around RevPAR by market is less about the industry of customers than it is about supply in some of those markets. The demand trends still remain quite strong.","Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC","Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you all very much for your time this morning.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Arne Sorenson. Please go ahead.","Arne Sorenson","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","First, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued earlier today along with our comments are effective only today August 6, 2019, and will not be updated as actual events unfold.","In our discussion today, we will talk about results excluding merger-related costs and reimbursed revenue and related expenses. GAAP results appear on Page A1 of the earnings release, but our remarks today will largely refer to the adjusted results that appear on the non-GAAP reconciliation pages. Of course, you could find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks also on our website.","Before we move to specifics about the quarter, let me make a few observations about our results. Global economic growth is clearly slower than we anticipated when the year began. Demand growth for the U.S. lodging industry as reported by STR reflected the weaker U.S. economy with lodging demand in the quarter up less than 2% year-over-year, about 50 basis points lower than the past couple of quarters.","Combined with a relatively higher supply growth in the largest 25 U.S. markets, STR\u2019s RevPAR growth in these markets increased only 0.2% in the quarter compared to plus 1.6% in secondary and tertiary markets. ","Marriott\u2019s North American systemwide RevPAR rose 0.7% in the quarter and our systemwide RevPAR index in North America increased 100 basis points with improvement across all luxury premium and select service portfolios. Despite the business climate, our North American sales team had a solid quarter. Gross group booking \u2013 gross group revenue bookings made in the second quarter for all future periods increased 6% and booking pace for the next 12 months is up at a low single digit rate largely related to strong corporate demand.","New group bookings at our legacy Starwood Hotels were particularly strong in the quarter as these hotels benefited from the completed integration of our sales organizations that occurred in early 2018.","North American group sales were even stronger in July. On the transient side, we have seen meaningful and steady improvement in legacy Starwood Hotel performance since the cut over to Marriott revenue management systems in the fourth quarter of 2018. We believe there is additional RevPAR growth upside as we further fine tune performance of these brands. With continuing trade disputes, RevPAR in Greater China rose 2.6% in the quarter, reflecting moderating RevPAR growth in manufacturing markets like Shenzhen and Tianjin and incorporate destinations like Shanghai. Political demonstrations in Hong Kong also constrained RevPAR growth.","At the same time, our RevPAR index in Greater China rose sharply again in the quarter. Elsewhere in Asia, demand for our hotels in Japan and India continued to show robust trends with RevPAR up nearly 7% in the quarter. In Europe, transient room nights booked by U.S. travelers rose 8% as tourists enjoyed the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup and the Biennale in Venice. By the way, congratulations to Megan Rapinoe and the entire U.S. women\u2019s national team on an impressive tournament.","Europe also attracted a greater share of the strong outbound business from China, as our Chinese guests are enjoying more personalized hospitality through our Li Yu service programs. Room nights sold to Chinese guests traveling to Europe increased 34% in the quarter. Our hotels in Malaysia, Egypt, and Mexico also saw significant increases in Chinese demand. ","Globally, comparable hotel RevPAR on a constant dollar basis increased 1.2% in the second quarter and global RevPAR index increased by more than 100 basis points, our strongest performance since our acquisition of Starwood.","We remain focused on delivering leading profitability for owners and franchisees. Labor and benefit costs are rising in many markets, even as RevPAR growth moderates. Despite this, in a second quarter, we maintained flattish house profit margins across our company operated system as we leveraged our scale and increased productivity.","In addition to significant savings and procurement and lower loyalty charges, our hotels benefited from lower commission rates on group intermediaries and a growing proportion of lower-cost direct transient bookings.","Systemwide direct digital hotel revenue increased over 20% in the second quarter and now represent nearly one third of property revenue globally, 38% of transient revenue alone. In China, our successful Alibaba joint venture helped to increase our direct digital revenue bookings in that market by 36% in the second quarter. Property revenues booked on OTAs worldwide declined 2% in the second quarter.","Our new programs and services fund structure is also improving margins at our hotels, launched at the beginning of this year, owners and franchisees are now paying a single amount that covers roughly 20 programs and services including reservations, sales and marketing and technology support.","The simplified pricing is easier to understand and forecast and we expect it will generate savings for the vast majority of our owners. This focus on owner returns and transparency is helping drive our share of new hotel development. Our global system totaled roughly 1.35 million rooms at the end of the second quarter and our worldwide pipeline reached a record 487,000 rooms, nearly 5% higher than a year ago and 3% higher than last quarter.","Owners and franchisees are continuing to sign new deals at a rapid clip. In the second quarter, we added 29,000 rooms to our pipeline and open more than 16,000 rooms. Over 20% of room openings in the quarter were conversions from competitor brands. At our expected pace of openings, our under-construction pipeline represents the equivalent of 2.5 years of embedded gross rooms growth. The remainder of our pipeline represents another 3.5 years of growth.","In 2019, we expect our worldwide rooms\u2019 distribution will increase by roughly 5% to 5.5%, net of 1% to 1.5% room deletions, a bit more modest than our prior guidance, reflecting opening delays in North America and the Middle East. We have not seen project cancellations for 2019 openings. Over the past few years, lengthened construction periods reflect labor shortages, a larger proportion of room and properties and increasing number of new projects using multiple brands. While construction delays have moderated our near term rooms growth in 2019, our under construction pipeline totaled 213,000 rooms in quarter end. Given the significant depth of our under construction pipeline, we expect openings in 2020 will accelerate meaningfully.","We continue to expand our lead in luxury lodging. We have over 700 luxury properties with 175,000 luxury rooms opened or under development, nearly double the luxury portfolio of our next leading competitor. A 60% of our 200 luxury pipeline properties are already under construction. As far in 2019, we have opened 15 luxury properties around the world and expect to open another 15 luxury projects by end of the year. Worldwide leisure transient demand was solid in the second quarter and we believe leisure offers a meaningful and incremental growth opportunity.","Today, Marriott Bonvoy tours and activities offer 200,000 leisure experiences in 1,000 global destinations and our homes and villas by Marriott International, which launched in May now has nearly 2,500 homes in the Americas and Europe. In early 2020, we expect our Ritz-Carlton Yacht will set sail on its first cruise from Fort Lauderdale to Barbados. Cruise bookings are running ahead of expectations.","And in addition, yesterday, we announced our intention to grow in the all-inclusive space. After signing new management agreements for five new build, all-inclusive resorts located in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. These projects will be added to our first all-inclusive project in Costa Rica, which joined our portfolio when we acquired Starwood. The all-inclusive market is growing rapidly and our Marriott Bonvoy members would like to see us in this space. We expect to expand our all-inclusive portfolio in popular, leisure destinations in the Americas, Europe, and Southeast Asia with both newbuild projects and property conversions, leveraging our well-established full service and luxury brands.","Marriott Bonvoy has a key element of our leisure strategy. Marriott Bonvoy membership totaled roughly $133 million at quarter end with strong signups in the Asia Pacific region in the quarter. Year-to-date, member occupancy penetration increased 160 basis points and in the second quarter alone bookings on the new Marriott Bonvoy app rose 70%. We are bullish about Marriott\u2019s future. We continue to leverage our scale for the benefit of our guests, owners, franchisees and shareholders.","Our strong brands are getting better. Owners and franchisees continue to add hotels to our already broad distribution and most important our culture focused on people remains front and center.","Before I turn the call over to Leeny to talk about our second quarter performance and outlook, let me give you a quick health update. I have almost completed chemo treatments and they have gone well. The doctors are pleased with my progress so far. I still have radiation and surgery ahead, but so far everything is unscheduled. I appreciate all the kind words and support from so many of you.","Now Leeny for the second quarter.","Leeny Oberg","Thank you, Arne. For the second quarter of 2019, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.56 compared to a $1.73 in the year ago quarter. This was slightly over the midpoint of our guidance of a $1.52 to a $1.58 despite global RevPAR growth below the midpoint of our guidance. Recall that in the 2018 second quarter, adjusted EPS included $0.26 from gains on asset sales.","Gross fee revenues totaled nearly $1 billion in the quarter, up 5% over the prior year, largely due to RevPAR growth, unit growth and higher branding fees. Credit card fees totaled $104 million up 12% driven by new credit card signups and higher spend. With a stronger U.S. dollar, second quarter fee revenue reflected $7 million of year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange net of hedges. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of expenses totaled $87 million in the second quarter, a $2 million decline from the prior year, largely due to the net impact of sold hotels and renovations.","Termination fees totaled $11 million in the quarter compared to $5 million in the prior year. Owned, leased and other profits were stronger than expected in the quarter due to timing of non-operating expenses. The second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $952 million consistent with our guidance. Our year-over-year growth and adjusted EBITDA was constrained by $6 million and lower profits from hotels under renovation and $8 million in unfavorable foreign exchange impact net of hedges.","While not included in adjusted EBITDA, we recorded a $126 million non-tax deductible accrual in the second quarter for the fine proposed by the UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office related to the data security incident we disclosed last year. We have the right to respond before the amount of the fine is finally determined and as we have said, we intend to respond and vigorously defend our position.","Looking ahead, we expect our North American RevPAR will increase 1% to 2% in both the third and fourth quarters, albeit at the lower end of that range in the fourth quarter.","The third quarter should be helped by the impact of the shifting Jewish holidays and strong group business on the books, while the fourth quarter should be helped by easier comparisons to last year strikes.","In the Asia Pacific region, we expect low single digit RevPAR growth in the second half reflecting cautious corporate demand in China and continued political demonstrations in Hong Kong.","At the same time, we also believe there could be demand upside in India and Japan where we have significant distribution. We expect RevPAR growth in the Middle East and Africa region will be flattish in the third quarter, helped by the timing of Ramadan and modestly lower in the fourth quarter.","For Europe, we expect U.S. travel to the region will remain strong in the second half, but tough comps to last year\u2019s World Cup in Russia will likely hold Europe RevPAR growth to a low to mid single digit rate in the second half.","In the Caribbean and Latin America region, we expect RevPAR will grow at a low single digit rate in the second half on easier comparisons in Mexico and strong ongoing leisure demand in the Caribbean.","In summary, we expect worldwide systemwide RevPAR will increase 1% to 2% in both the third and fourth quarters yielding 1% to 2% RevPAR growth for the full year. For the full year 2019, we believe gross fee revenue will total $3.82 billion to 3.85 billion, up 5% to 6% over the prior year. This is $50 million lower than our last guidance at the midpoint due to a modestly more conservative RevPAR outlook, negative foreign exchange impact and fine tuning of our credit card branding fee estimate. We believe credit card fees could total $400 million to $410 million for the year. Incentive fees could be flattish for the full year, reflecting the impact of hotel renovations, modest RevPAR growth at full service hotels in the U.S. and China and unfavorable foreign exchange.","Owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expense could total roughly $295 million for the year, reflecting roughly $35 million in lower termination fees compared to 2018.","G&A should total $920 million to $930 million for 2019 consistent with our prior guidance. These assumptions yield $5.97 to $6.06 diluted earnings per share for 2019. Recall that the full year 2018 included $0.65 in gains from the sale of owned and joint venture assets.","Adjusted EBITDA in 2019 should total roughly $3.586 billion to 3.626 billion, 3% to 4% increase over 2018 adjusted EBITDA. Our year-over-year growth rate and adjusted EBITDA reflects unit growth, modest growth in RevPAR and higher branding fees.","At the same time, we estimate lower termination fees and negative foreign exchange impact combined create more than $50 million of headwinds, depressing our full year adjusted EBITDA growth rate by more than a 100 basis points.","Our press release outlines our earnings expectations for the third and fourth quarters. Third quarter incentive fees will likely decline due to a tough comparison to last year\u2019s World Cup and continued modest RevPAR growth in the largest U.S. markets.","We also expect a decline in residential branding fees in the third quarter. In contrast, fourth quarter incentive fee should increase benefiting from easy comparisons to last year\u2019s strikes in North America and international unit growth and branding fee should move higher. As always, are 2019 guidance does not include merger-related costs or reimbursed revenues and expenses. ","Total investment spending for the year could total $650 million to $750 million including roughly $225 million of maintenance spending and $200 million to 250 million that should be reimbursed or recycled over time.","Our renovation of the Phoenix Sheraton Downtown is well underway and includes new designs for the hotels, public space and rooms and should be completed by early 2020. We have already begun marketing the hotel subject to a long-term management agreement.","Marriott Bonvoy point redemptions are running ahead of expectations in 2019 as members explore the new locations and experiences offered by the significantly improved program.","As a result, we expect the net cash impact of the loyalty program will be a few $100 million more negative in 2019 than we expected at the beginning of the year, but should improve significantly in 2020.","We repurchased more than 12 million shares from January 1 through August the second for 1.6 billion and we expect cash return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends will approach $3 billion in 2019. This assumes no asset sales in 2019 beyond those already completed and reflects our current EBITDA guidance.","Our balance sheet remains in great shape. At June 30, our debt ratio was within our targeted credit standard of 3 times to 3.5 times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR.","So let\u2019s answer your questions. So that we can speak with as many of you as possible we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. We\u2019ll take your questions now.","Arne Sorenson","Operator, are you there?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.","Shaun Kelley","Thank you. Hi, good morning, everyone. Arne, glad to hear a positive update on your health. Maybe we could just get started with the unit growth side and a little bit more color there. I think last year, towards the end of last year in Q4, ran into a similar issue on some of these contraction delays that you guys described at the Analyst Day. Can you just give us a little bit more color on confidence levels around both your sort of longer-term three-year outlook for overall net unit growth? And then why specifically should we be super comfortable in an acceleration for next year? What are you guys seeing in that data that should allow this to improve materially?","Arne Sorenson","Well, obviously notwithstanding the fact that we're bringing the growth assumptions for the year down a little bit, 25 basis points essentially to the midpoint from a quarter ago, makes it feel like we don't have much predictability here. We actually do have a fair amount of predictability because we can see what the pipeline looks like. And based on hotels under construction and projected earnings data, we can see that the openings in 2020 and in the couple of years beyond should accelerate meaningfully from what we're experiencing in 2019. That doesn't mean that we can be exactly precise about that when these hotels open. And I think in many respects, what we've experienced this quarter is an indication of that.","We do have obviously very tight construction markets, tight labor markets. And I think when you look at our U.S. portfolio, what we see is even in the limited-service segments, a bulk of what we're doing or at least a bit over half of what we're doing is non-prototypical work. So we're not talking about a suburban Courtyard that looks the same from market to market to market. But we're tending to talk about an urban Courtyard or an urban AC or an urban Aloft or an urban Moxy that is very much a custom job. And in the tight labor and tight construction cross-markets, probably exacerbated a little bit by the modest RevPAR market, we're seeing that the construction time lines continue to increase.","I think the other bit of good news in this, which, of course, we put in our prepared remarks, is when we look at our quarterly adds and deletions from our pipeline, we don't see a change in the cancellation portfolio that \u2013 from prior quarters. Middle East is obviously something that also we've called out here. I think the two primary areas are North America and the Middle East. Middle East is a big market, highly diverse. You've got some markets like Saudi and Cairo performing extraordinarily well. The Emirates have a lot of supply growth and very modest, in fact negative RevPAR growth in the market now. And I suspect that the combination of negative RevPAR growth is further extending the construction time line in those markets.","Shaun Kelley","Thanks, Arne. And then just as a follow-up, just to be a little bit more precise, have you factored like a longer construction time line into the 2020 forecast? But still even with that, can you see some sort of acceleration, just assuming this is kind of the new normal? ","Arne Sorenson","Yes and yes.","Shaun Kelley","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Hey, good morning to everyone.","Arne Sorenson","Good morning.","Leeny Oberg","Hi.","Wes Golladay","Looking at the results \u2013 hi, looking at the results in China, you definitely have some strength versus competitors. How much of that is due to the Bonvoy marketing versus the partnership with Alibaba, the Fliggy?","Arne Sorenson","Well, that's \u2013 that is \u2013 probably as much of that is \u2013 will be coming in the future as opposed to delivered already. I think the Alibaba partnership is off to a great start. We're about a year into it. And if anything, we're seeing ramping performance and we're very optimistic about the future. And I think it probably has had some impacts so far. But I actually don't think that is as profound as the portfolio that we've got in China. When you look at we're 50 hotels roughly open in Shanghai, very much a great strength in the luxury and full-service spaces. The business is principally Chinese business, even in a market like Shanghai, which we've talked about before.","And I think when you look across the markets, you see that we have a really powerful luxury and full-service portfolio. We are expanding in the select service space, but that has been much more recent for us. And I think with the portfolio we've got, we've got strong brand familiarity, strong loyalty program and strong Chinese customer preference so that we continue to take really quarter-after-quarter for the last number of years strong increases in our RevPAR index performance in China.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then quickly looking at that loyalty program, you mentioned the cash usage this quarter \u2013 or this year, but it will grow next year to a benefit to you. What is going to drive that?","Leeny Oberg","So if we \u2013 look, typically our loyalty program generates cash on an annual basis. Because the cash that we take in as folks earn points is more than needs to go out the door for either redemptions or the cost of the loyalty program. This year, we had several things that were a bit unusual. First of all, you had some integration expenses timing that fell into 2019 versus 2018. Second of all, you had \u2013 if you remember the introduction of Bonvoy, of the combined program. We did a pretty meaningful marketing spend in the first half of the year that was unusual relative to typical timing. ","And then third and certainly not last is \u2013 and certainly not least is that redemptions have been higher this year as we've seen folks introduced to the new combined program trying out hotels from the various portfolios. And we do expect over time that, that starts to calm down and not have some of these unusual items next year.","Wes Golladay","Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s all from me.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley","Great. Thanks. Two questions. One is just on the credit card fees lower than the previous guidance. Is that fewer sign-ups or less usage or just lower fee rate negotiations? And then just as a follow-up. just following up on the comment about the redemptions being higher than you'd expected and your expectation that it will come down over time. Will you raise the cost of award nights? Or what will you do to kind of maybe get the redemptions in line with where you want them ideally? Thanks.","Leeny Oberg","Thanks, Robin. So first of all on the credit cards, we've actually surprised with the growth in new card sign-ups this year. They've been higher than our expectations across the cards. We've been particularly pleased with the no fee card that we just introduced. And from that standpoint, the business that has gone really well. This is really just fine-tuning of the money that's coming in the door relative to the credit cards and the overall \u2013 the combination of the overall spend in the sign-ups, so really nothing in the fundamental trends in that business. And then as you look on the redemptions side, I think if you remember, we've got the combination of the two business \u2013 of the two programs into one and a huge systems integration of the loyalty platforms.","And as we move into 2020, we can already see that there is a bit more of folks kind of settling out into a more normal pattern. But we did see some trends of not only higher numbers of redemptions but at more expensive properties at high-occupancy periods. And that obviously means that the cash going out the door is a bit higher than expectations. But we are confident that the balance of that will even out over time.","Robin Farley","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.","Arne Sorenson","Good morning.","Jared Shojaian","Can you just \u2013 good morning. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the magnitude of the full year incent management fee reduction? I think you cited some renovation impact. But maybe relative to your last thinking, what changed? And then as we think about next year and sort of a low RevPAR growth environment, is it realistic that the IMF line can still grow at, call it, a unit growth plus RevPAR growth plus RevPAR growth kind of rate? Or are you close to hitting some of the hurdle rates on the owners' priority? ","Leeny Oberg","So, let me first talk the percentage of owners \u2013 of hotels earning incentive fees because I think that's helpful to your question. And that \u2013 this year is in Q2 was 61% versus 65% a year ago. So you can see that the impact of environment is meaning that fewer hotels are hitting that threshold. I think for the full year, we would expect that in the U.S., given our RevPAR guidance, that you would actually see margins slightly but slightly down for the year in 2019, which will impact that percentage a bit. ","Internationally, we've got both great new rooms growth as well as stronger RevPAR growth on a relative basis. So I think there you'll actually see continued strong numbers on the penetration side for IMF. And I think next year, it's too soon to say where we are on RevPAR. And that obviously will have a bearing. As we get into the budget process, we will be able to talk more about that. When you think about from a guidance standpoint on the IMF, the reality is that you've got FX being more of an impact than we had expected on the back half of the year as well as lower RevPAR overall. And when you put those two together, that's where you get the change from the incentive fee guidance that we gave a quarter ago.","Arne Sorenson","I think the other thing to keep in mind, I'd just add one thing here, is we talked about the difference in Smith Travel industry RevPAR numbers for the top 25 markets and then the rest of the United States, top 25 being down 0.2 and the rest of the U.S. being up 1.6 points, which is a number of factors going into it. But significant one is higher supply growth in the top 25 markets than we're seeing in the rest. It shouldn't surprise you to know that a big chunk of our incentive fees come out of those top 25 markets. That's where we tend to have disproportionate distribution of the managed portfolio as opposed to the franchised portfolio, is where many of the convention center hotels are. And when you look at more modest RevPAR growth and margin performance in those markets, you get the kind of impact on incentive fees that Leeny talked about.","Jared Shojaian","Okay, great. Thank you. And then Arne, you noted you haven't really seen any incremental project cancellations. What's a normal level of attrition for your pipeline, specifically a percentage that never actually comes online? And maybe how has that evolved over time? And can you talk about how that attrition compares to what you saw in 2008 and 2009 and how that \u2013 how we might expect that to look in the next recession?","Arne Sorenson","Yes. I mean it's a small percentage, which attrits. And in some respects, you can't \u2013 you've got to be careful about limiting the time frame you look at this. Because we would see, for example, in a deep recessionary environment, more projects cancel out of our pipeline than we would in stronger times. But gratifyingly, many of those projects come back when the economy comes back. Because you've got partners of ours, who have control over the land, and they may have decided not to proceed with the project during the recession. But if you hang around the hoop long enough, suddenly they're taking a shot again and moving forward with it.","I would think in the fullness of time, you're probably in the 10%, 15% range of projects that will cancel or indefinitely sort of defer. And of course, every quarter, we go through our pipeline and we are signing new deals and approving new deals, which are adds, but we're also culling deals. So the comments we made are not to suggest that there are zero cancellations, but we are not seeing a change in the cancellation pace from prior periods of time, including the last many number of years.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. Thank you very much.","Arne Sorenson","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joe Greff","Good morning, everybody.","Arne Sorenson","Hi.","Leeny Oberg","Hi, Joe.","Joe Greff","Two questions. One is on the development pipeline, nice to see that sequential increase there. Can you talk about what brand and what geographies are driving that beyond the new all-inclusive deals announced this morning?","Arne Sorenson","It's very global. The \u2013 I think essentially every region and every segment are up. I'm just sort of double-checking the notes here to make sure I'm not overstating this. But by and large, we are seeing very strong appetite for development across the segments and across the globe. That's not necessarily to say that every country is seeing that because you've got some countries which are obviously experiencing either tougher economic times or tougher industry times, if you will. But you look across most markets and you see pretty darn healthy growth.","Joe Greff","Great. And then back to, Arne, your comments on the construction delays. How many projects are you talking about with those delays? And how does it break out between North America, the Middle East and Africa regions?","Arne Sorenson","Well, we're monitoring about 3,000 projects in that development pipeline. And if you look at where they're spread, obviously the U.S. is still the biggest market for us and probably is nearly 50% of those projects. So you're talking about 1,500 projects roughly in the United States. I'm doing the math a little bit as we talk here, but they are disproportionately select service hotels. And that is where we're seeing probably two thirds of the impact, if you will, in the United States and maybe one third in the Middle East and Africa.","Joe Greff","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays.","Anthony Powell","Hi, good morning.","Arne Sorenson","Good morning.","Anthony Powell","You talked a lot about how the top 25 markets that have been slower in the U.S. We've seen a strong growth in international outbound travel from the U.S. over the past few years. Do you think travel is just substituting Europe and other destinations for the top 25 markets? And could that have a negative impact going forward?","Arne Sorenson","It's possible on the margin that, that is an impact that maybe in the summertime. I do think it's probably the biggest impact. I think more of this is just the industry data. We look at top 25 supply growth versus rest of the U.S. and you see about an 800 basis points difference. These are Smith Travel numbers. Rooms available, in other words, supply growth were up 2.5% in the top 25 markets and they were up 1.7% in the rest of the markets. And interestingly, rooms sold in both top 25 and the rest of the U.S. were up 1.9%. So you look at the relative difference between those. And I think that probably explains the bulk of it. I think it's possible during peak leisure times that you've got a little bit of movement of the American traveler abroad, maybe that we've lost a little bit of share to the U.S. of the international travel coming here, too. But I don't think that's very clear. And I would think that the supply dynamic is probably more significant than anything else.","Leeny Oberg","Anthony, the share of international visitors coming from outside to the U.S. had stayed really stable between 4% and 4.5% over the last year. So although we're still seeing tremendous growth from places like China, that's still down well under 0.5% of the travelers. And then Europe as an example, close to two thirds of those visitors in Europe come from Europe. So while at the margin, there's maybe a little movement here and there, the numbers are fairly steady.","Anthony Powell","Got it. Thanks. And you've highlighted improvement in RevPAR growth at the legacy Starwood brands. Do you think all the various integration issues are behind you and just the new brands actually start to outperform over the next few quarters?","Arne Sorenson","Generally, yes. I think the integration has very much stabilized. And obviously, we look at this week-by-week. We've been gratified to see that the SPG \u2013 legacy SPG portfolio has grown index 10 of the last 11 weeks. And it's a good sign that the system has stabilized, the hotel teams are increasingly getting comfortable with those systems. Whether they're operated, managed hotels or franchised hotels, sales force has stabilized. And so we're quite optimistic about the future. ","Anthony Powell","Great. Thank you.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. ","Smedes Rose","Hi, good morning.","Arne Sorenson","Good morning.","Smedes Rose","I wanted to ask you a little more about your expansion into all inclusive space. Now that you have this kind of a multiyear project underway, we will tuck-in resort. Would you anticipate that other independent owners in that space will come to you with conversion opportunities? Is this kind of a platform that Marriott will look to support and grow as you\u2019ve done more, with some of your new brand initiatives?","And how do you see that unfolding over the next couple of years?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, we don\u2019t have a forecast for you today about how bit this business will get over time. But we do know that it is increasingly popular among leisure traveler. Broadly Caribbean Basin is the biggest market in the world for it, but you\u2019ve got growing markets in the Mediterranean area, as well as Asia-Pacific. And obviously our brands are well-known in those markets as well. I think as we talk to our development team we should see both conversions of comparator branded hotels, we should see new builds that join our system. And I suspect we\u2019ll see a few hotels in these markets that, where all-inclusive is popular, convert if the physical setting allows from a European point of hotel, so all inclusive hotels.","And so I think we\u2019ll see that this is organic growth. We have over the last number of years looked at a few M&A opportunities in this space have not managed to score them really at this point in time and have decided to proceed with their organic growth with some very strong partners that we\u2019re excited about proceeding there. And I think we\u2019ll have good performance in this space in the years to come.","Smedes Rose","Okay. And then I wanted to ask you if there\u2019s few months of home sharing on to your belt may be you could just talk about what you are seeing in terms of the overall additions to the platform? And anything you are hearing from owners on their positive, negative, or may be not or just neutral?","Arne Sorenson","Well let\u2019s start by recognizing how recently we\u2019ve got into this business and how small it still is. We said 2,500 homes in our prepared remarks that is tiny compared to many of the other platforms that are out there. Although interestingly, when you look at various portfolios of home rentals folks have tried to slice them into higher end portfolios, and those higher end portfolios tend to be meaningfully smaller than the gross numbers that are out there. ","I think what we\u2019ve discovered so far has by and large confirmed our thesis. And it is firstly that our leisure customers are already experimenting in the home sharing space and they are very appreciative of having a loyalty linkage, firstly. And secondly, they're very appreciative of having brand and quality service behind it. And too often we've heard from those customers that when they are traveling with groups or a larger family or in circumstances in which a home rental makes sense it's far too often just a crap shoot about whether the experience will be a good one or not.","And what they're telling us is we really want you to have more choice, for us because, we think you can deliver and are delivering something which is got a quality associated with it that makes it not a crapshoot, but something we count on. And we're seeing the overwhelming majority of bookings. Again, they're relatively small so far, but coming out of the Marriott Bonvoy program and with the loyalty linkage, I think, our owners, particularly in the United States are interested in how this will grow and whether this sort of ends up being competing supply if you will. And we're working our way through that. I think at the moment, 95% of our units are two bedrooms and above and which are obviously quite distinct from a hotel room.","But we'll be transparent with them about this and make sure they understand how we're growing. And we're optimistic about the future, but we don't really have any forecast for you yet.","Smedes Rose","Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies.","David Katz","Hi, good morning everyone.","Arne Sorenson","Good morning David.","David Katz","Arne good to hear your voice.","Arne Sorenson","Thank you.","David Katz","I wanted to maybe ask a bit more of a general question about the quarter. We are all trying to sort of process what exactly is sort of happening in the economy. In your case there is an integration in a broad range of initiatives underway. And I just wonder if any of that second category is having any impact whatsoever on some of the adjustments that you've made in the guidance today and whether that's something you could talk about?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, I mean, Leeny jump in here and tell me whether you think differently. I think the Q2 numbers for obviously the quarter we've reported, came in a bit light compared to what we anticipated certainly for a midpoint a quarter ago. But I would attribute, 100% of that or very, very, very heavy majority of that to economic conditions, demand conditions, particularly not to anything that's integration related. And similarly, when we look at Q3 and Q4, we've obviously never given anybody guidance on Q3 or Q4 specifically until this quarter where because we've only got two quarters left, basically both quarters come out with specific guidance.","But I think the adjustments that we've made in EBITDA and EPS for the balance of the year are very much driven by the economic environment, lower RevPAR expectations being by far the most significant piece of that. It does have, an IMF flavor in some markets because of the U.S. RevPAR coming down a little bit. And it's got an FX piece that is a little bit worse too. But I think they are not in any material respects related to our continuing integration efforts or sort of internal story. Leeny you disagree?","Leeny Oberg","Yes, no agreed.","David Katz","And if I can ask one other short question more and more we hear, read and actually hear you talk about sort of the notion of alternative accommodations. And just trying to think through where the boundaries are in this opportunity, are we \u2013 we\u2019re looking at home rentals, right and more and more we're hearing about hybrid models. How big a opportunity is this really? Or are we just engaging in it in more of a temporary faddish way?","Arne Sorenson","I mean, I think the reason we're in it is we've concluded it is not a temporary fad. If you look at Expedia booking in Airbnb to name three obvious players in the home rental space, the way these got millions of units on their platform and some are making quite decent economics from these platforms. Yes, I think this is a space in the broader travel sector that we and other lodging companies, as well as other participants in the sector have been watching for the last number of years. And it's become painfully clear, crystal clear to us that this is not some fad that's going to disappear tomorrow, but this is something that is here to stay. I think we are seeing at the same time the evolution of a number of these platforms, either from home sharing to other spaces if they've started at home sharing or broadening into other aspects of the travel sector because of the usefulness of technology across different elements of that travel sector.","And for us, particularly the value of the Marriott Bonvoy and loyalty program, to sort of provide an umbrella, if you will, across a number of different areas of travel. And we said this a quarter ago and we probably said it last year actually when we started our pilot in the home sharing space, when we look at Marriott Bonvoy members, we see probably approaching 30% that had already experimented with home sharing. And were giving us feedback about the value we could bring to this space and we thought this was a good space to get in.","So we got into it not as a fad and not simply as a test, but we got into it because we think it's a place where we can have a presence, we can provide more solutions to our loyalty members when they travel for different purposes. And we think we can make good economics over time.","David Katz","Thank you very much. Good luck.","Arne Sorenson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Just following up on the economic environment, you highlighted that demand was a bit softer than expected in the quarter. But you also had really strong group bookings for future periods, I think, you said up 6% in 2Q. Can you explain why those two things are happening at the same time, they don't totally logically make sense to me. Thanks.","Arne Sorenson","Yes, I mean I think that's a fair question. And here is something which is, I think, probably at least in part internal and by the portfolio we've built, I mean, obviously if you look back over the last three or four years, you see a Starwood which was put up for sale with a auction process in early 2015, ultimately culminating in our signing of acquisition agreement in November of 2015, if memory serves. Not closed until almost a year later. And as a consequence you end up with some distraction inevitably. And then some post-closing change to their way the salesforce works in which is particularly relevant to group. And that distraction and disruption if you will, is well behind us. We've got a sales team which has been integrated and stabilized and they're lapping in some respects. The organization has been put in place because it was more than a year ago.","And then the second thing, I think, as you look at the portfolio, we've got a group space in the United States and we've got the ability that our customers increasingly see to offer not just a handful, but a couple of handfuls of alternatives within our system that give them some price variability and location variability, brand variability and the like. And I think all of those things roll together our propelling, if you will, the group bookings that we are beginning to experience.","I think when you look at year-over-year performance we've also got to factor in that there has been a shift in group commission payments from roughly 10% to roughly 7%. So we look when we're measuring this, not just at what the comparison was to 2018, because depending on the month you're looking at, that can be helped or hurt in year-over-year comparisons. But we're also looking at the comparison of 2017, which will sort of stabilize here in some respects. And we see good healthy growth against both of those baselines.","So, we're encouraged by it. I don't think \u2013 I think it's probably more our story than it is industry dynamic because of the two factors I've talked about. But it's something that we were gratified by.","Thomas Allen","That makes a lot of sense. Thanks Arne. And then just as my follow-up, when we look at the pipelines you had approximately 40,000 rooms approved, but not yet signed. Last quarter you had 25,000 rooms. So I have about 60% we\u2019re expecting that there\u2019s a big addition I assume from the all-inclusive, but anything else going on there that's worth highlighting?","Leeny Oberg","Yes, as you know, Thomas, they kind of bounce back and forth. If you look last year at the second quarter, for example, that same statistic was 41,000 rooms. So in terms of approved but not yet signed. So they kind of go up and down depending on exactly the timing of the final signing of the contract.","Thomas Allen","Makes a lot of sense. So on the closing that kind of the beginning in it at the end of the year and beginning versus the middle of the year.","Leeny Oberg","Exactly, yes.","Thomas Allen","Okay, thank you.","Arne Sorenson","Because of timing of the franchise certainly you often sign fewer deals in the first quarter than you did at the second.","Thomas Allen","Totally makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with Suntrust.","Patrick Scholes","Hi, good morning everyone.","Arne Sorenson","Good morning.","Patrick Scholes","Just taking a look at the property level RevPAR results, especially for the company operate in North America, it looks like Sheraton was a bit of an underperformer. I'm just curious how much of that can be explained by any property improvement plans that you folks are pushing on those hotels? Thanks.","Arne Sorenson","Yes, it's a good question. I would encourage you first to look at the Sheraton system wide numbers not the Sheraton managed numbers, particularly in North America. The Sheraton managed portfolio is quite small as a percentage. And so you're going to get numbers there which are significantly impacted by the precise location of that portfolio, which is the risk in any smaller portfolio. But to be fair, I think, if you look at North American and Sheraton performance, I think, we reported 0.8% negative for the quarter. You've got a number of things going into that. I think it's probably worth mentioning that globally the Sheraton brand is performing quite well with index about flat in the quarter. And that's probably a better sign of the strength of the brand than the North American numbers.","I think in North America you've got some shifting we've jettisoned some probably more hotels in the U.S. proportionally than outside. And we do have some renovation activity which is underway, which may or may not be substantial enough to pull those hotels out of the comp set. And then of course, we've got a single loyalty program. And so we've got customers now that have got more choice across more brands and they're experimenting a bit with that. And I think we will see over time that these brand numbers probably revert a bit more towards the mean.","Patrick Scholes","Okay. Thank you. Then just a quick lighthearted follow-up question. There's been a little bit of a media tension about tipping housekeepers. Arnie, I'm wondering, do you a tip your housekeepers?","Arne Sorenson","I absolutely tip housekeepers, business and leisure travel and have for many, many years. And I can't imagine that. ","Patrick Scholes","Okay. Thank you.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Steven Grambling","Hi, thanks. Two quick follow-ups.","Arne Sorenson","Great.","Steven Grambling","Good. First on owned assets, as international markets such as Europe and South America been holding in a bit better, I think you had previously kind of put on hold some of the asset sales, particularly in South America. How are you thinking about the additional owned assets and potentially selling?","Leeny Oberg","So thanks Steven. We certainly do expect additional assets sales in the future. As you know they're impossible to predict in terms of timing. We talked about the fact that we've got Phoenix on the market and we've got several others that we continue to work very hard on. I think the reality is there are still probably some markets where even though there may be some improvement, it's still probably not ripe in terms of not just the RevPAR environment, but just as importantly the transaction environment, what the buyer and financing environment looks like. And I think you'll probably still find that several of the ones in South America fit that category. And the other thing I'll point out, Steven, is we've got a couple of these assets that have interesting characteristics to them, like unusual ground leases, et cetera, that aren't as much based on geography of the asset. But something in the structural part of the asset that makes it a bit more challenging to sell. Not to say we don't think that we ultimately can't, but that we just got to work through some of those issues.","Steven Grambling","Fair enough. And maybe changing gears a little bit, you had called out India Today and had referenced it on some other calls, bit more it seems like in the past. Can you give us a bit more detail on that market as we think about how significant it could become? And perhaps talk to how contracts and owner base there is similar or different to other markets?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, we're about \u2013 we can check this maybe if they've got the details. I think we're probably about 115 or 120 hotels open and operating in India today. And probably another few dozen that are in the development pipeline. We have got a good stable of owners, many of which have got multiple hotels with us. They tend to often to have a power within a particular region or city of India as opposed to across the country as a whole. It's obviously a very big and very diverse country, and the economy and culture. And so you end up with somewhat different partners from place to place.","I think the bulk of what's happening in India is the growth of their economy, which obviously is a fairly small, at least in per capita terms, quite small, compared to China and the United States, but it's growing meaningfully year-over-year. The lodging business is still small. I mean, I think one of the stats I love to talk about when I'm with our friends from India is that there are maybe 175,000 hotel rooms in the country of India. The Indian expatriate community in the United States owns over two million hotel rooms in the U.S. And it just gives you a sense of how much growth is yet to come from India.","So we are very bullish on it. We think we are getting a leading market share both in terms of hotels open but also hotels coming in the development pipeline, brands are strong and we think that the prospects for that economy are quite strong in the years ahead.","Steven Grambling","Great, thanks so much.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research.","Vince Ciepiel","Hi. I wanted to come back to group versus transient. I think last quarter group was up three and transient was flattish. And maybe I missed those, but I was curious what they worked for 2Q. And then as you think about this full year, how do you think group and transient checkout within their 1% to 2% targeted domestic range?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, for Q2 group that is a North American number not a global number. Obviously these dynamics vary very much from part of the world to the part of the world. But in Q2 group was modestly negative, call it minus 1%. And so the transient both the business, and leisure transient and group would make up the difference between that and the RevPAR numbers we posted. ","Vince Ciepiel","Great, thanks. And then maybe getting a little bit more into the second half outlook it implies a pick up. Just curious how much of that's related to easier compares and have you already started to see that come through in July?","Arne Sorenson","So the most significant thing in terms of comparisons year-over-year would be the strikes that we experienced in the United States, which was by and large and Q4 phenomenon. I can't tell you that there was no strike activity at the tail end of Q3, but if there was, it was extraordinarily modest. We do have some shifting holidays. Q3 has helped a bit by timing of Jewish holidays. Fourth quarter is hurt a little bit by the timing of those holidays. And of course we called out the Russian World Cup, which is relevant to the European numbers that we will post this year.","I think those are the principle comparisons. But by and large, none of those factors are yet at play in the third quarter.","Leeny Oberg","Believe it or not in Q3 you've also got a bit of a day of week shifting.","Arne Sorenson","Okay.","Leeny Oberg","Not only holidays, but you've got a day of week shifting in Q3 that is also helpful.","Vince Ciepiel","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James.","Bill Crow","Good morning, Arne and Leeny.","Leeny Oberg","Is it \u2013 good morning. ","Bill Crow","Is it unreasonable to ask if the increased redemptions on the leisure front points redemptions is a leading indicator of weakness on the consumers\u2019 part?","Leeny Oberg","I don't think so. I think if anything we've continued to see the leisure business be robust. And in general worldwide for our properties. I think, again, you see this in general economic trends as well, which is that although, for example, in the U.S. you've got lower GDP growth and expected, you are also seeing very strong consumer spend and low unemployment. So from that perspective, people are taking vacations, they're feeling good about their prospects. I'm told that recently the stock market was doing pretty well. And we are seeing people go and stay in our hotels on their vacations.","And I think when you had the merger of the programs, you had a tremendous opportunity for SPG members to try out great new legacy Marriott hotels and vice versa. And we have seen that in the data that that is exactly what's happening. So I also think, given their staying at expensive hotels, I think, there was a view that there was an opportunity to get in and make some bookings for your vacation early using your points and make sure you've got those great hotels. So we don't see it as a sign in particular of a weakness.","Bill Crow","Sounds like my summer vacation.","Arne Sorenson","Thank you Bill.","Bill Crow","Arne, I think making any predictions is a crapshoot today clearly. But is there anything out there that you could see today that would tell you that the industry should be anything different than a 0% to 2% RevPAR environment as we look into 2020? ","Arne Sorenson ","No. I mean it is our best \u2013 it's our best set of estimates obviously or we wouldn't put them out there. Now we haven't obviously said anything other than in our analyst conference about 2020 and 2021. We'll get to that probably a quarter from now. I think the thing that's interesting and one of the internal debates that we have is we have not had a long period of time in which we've had really low single-digit RevPAR growth quarter-after-quarter. And on some basis, we're in a little bit uncharted territory. And it's going to be interesting to see whether or not we can continue to the sort of run that balance, which is if you look at the industry numbers or you look at individual hotel company numbers in Q2, we've got in the U.S. a modest increase in ADR and a modest decrease in occupancy. And that requires a fair amount of balance, and we've got lots of folks who are involved in pricing hotels in the industry and aggressively competing on a day-to-day basis.","And whether that precise balance stays or not is going to be something we watch and learn together. I do think that the strength of GDP is still the single most important thing for us to look at. And obviously, obviously, 2% GDP growth is not as good as 3% or 3.5% GDP growth. But the question we all got to ask ourselves for 2020 and beyond is, \"Where's GDP going? Is it going to stabilize at 2%? Or are trade wars or something else going to bring it down? Or are we going to get some clarification around these things that we get back to a more normalized sort of 3%-ish environment?\" ","Bill Crow","Alright, thanks for your thoughts. I appreciate it.","Arne Sorenson ","You bet.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Brian Dobson with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Arne Sorenson","Good morning.","Brian Dobson","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Some of your competitors have called out weakness in China as well. Do you think you could elaborate on what you're hearing from your people on the ground there regarding trends heading into next year?","Arne Sorenson","We don't have anything that's terribly insightful, I think. Obviously, our RevPAR numbers in China were meaningfully better than the industry as a whole. And I think that's a sign of our strength. But the RevPAR numbers in China were not as good as they were a quarter ago and they were not as good as they were last year. And so I think that's a sign that when you look at the averages rolling up across that very big country, you're seeing somewhat more modest economic growth. ","We\u2019ve got very topical things right now, trade war with China being one and Hong Kong, I think, being another example. Hong Kong performed fairly well in the second quarter, but obviously what's happening on the streets in Hong Kong today is not a positive sign for travel into that market. And so I suspect we'll see that Hong Kong weakens. And I think when you get to the trade war, the biggest question there is what does it mean for Chinese GDP growth? Not what does it mean for exports and imports, but what does it mean for Chinese GDP growth?","And that has to be evaluated in the context of a shift by China towards more of a consumer-driven economy than they have experienced in years past. And I think that makes our industry perform a bit better in China and for China outbound markets than other industries in China. But I think all of those things put together and you've got some obvious risks in China, but you've also got some good albeit more modest, but you've got still continuing GDP growth. And China has got levers to pull to make sure that they continue to try and stimulate their economy. ","Leeny Oberg","The only thing I'll add to that is that our rooms growth there continues to be really robust. So as we look at the general pace of these rooms openings and our signings, again continues to be strong demand on the part of owners for new hotels of ours.","Brian Dobson","Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then in terms of your balance sheet, would you consider getting a little bit more aggressive to retire shares?","Leeny Oberg","You probably noticed in our comments that the quarter we made a slight moderation in our comments from at least $3 billion to approaching $3 billion. And that's really a reflection of not a fundamental difference in our point of view on capital return but more just the reality that our loyalty program is going to use a bit more cash than we had expected. And as you know, we dropped EBITDA a little bit. But we continue to refine our working capital numbers. We also refined our investment spending numbers a little bit. So generally I would say that our approach is quite similar to where we were a quarter and we\u2019re comfortably in our 3 to 3.5 leverage range, which is where we want to be. ","Brian Dobson","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bellisario with Baird.","Michael Bellisario","Good morning everyone.","Arne Sorenson","Hey, good morning.","Michael Bellisario","Just to follow-up first on a prior question, is there any Marriott investment in the all inclusive deal?","Arne Sorenson","There might be some modest key money, I don't remember in the context of that, not material, certainly.","Michael Bellisario","Okay. Got it. And then just kind of along the same lines and maybe how you're thinking about using your balance sheet, any change in thinking about jump-starting growth or needing to invest dollars to get projects across the finish line?","Arne Sorenson","No. In terms of the organic pipeline, no. We continue to work with our partners. And I think the majority of our deals come in with essentially no financial participation with us \u2013 from us, excuse me. I think there are a couple of places where we would like to do some things to reposition brands. I mean the Phoenix Sheraton obviously is the most recent one that we've done. I think we could see taking a calculated bet or two, albeit quite modest in terms of the size of our balance sheet, to prove some proof points that we would like to prove on some of the brands that we are trying to reposition and strengthen. But nothing that I think would be material in any long-term sense.","Michael Bellisario","Thank you.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company.","Kevin Kopelman","Great, thanks for taking my question. ","Leeny Oberg","Good morning.","Kevin Kopelman","Just a couple of follow-ups. On online travel agents, they were down 2% globally for you, how did that look in terms of North America versus international? And how are you thinking about the OTA channel in the back half as you the roll out of your kind of more advanced yielding programs?","Arne Sorenson","I suspect it was down more in the U.S. than the rest of the world but somebody should test me on whether or not I've got that exactly right. But it is very much about what the factor you've talked about, which is yielding. And we are working with our OTA partners to make sure that we are getting business from them when we most need it and not necessarily taking it when we don't. And generally, I think that's working well. ","Kevin Kopelman","Do you think you'll keep yielding down even as you kind of even as you kind of lap over that?","Arne Sorenson","Yes I don't know. I mean we'll have to watch that as we go forward. We did talk about the growth in our direct digital channels, we've talked about the growth in our Marriott Bonvoy penetration. I think both of those things over time if those trend lines continue the way that we think they should continue should make us less dependent on third party platforms. I think at the same time that you've got an underlying economic story here, which we'll have to watch and sort of evaluate. But I think we are trying to do the best we can in order to take business from these partners when it is particularly valuable to us, but essentially not take it when we don't need it.","Kevin Kopelman","Thanks. And then just a, just a quick follow-up on the pipeline. Can you talk about trends or gross new approvals and signings? Last couple of years, you're about 125,000, I believe. First half of this year, strong but down a little bit. Can you just give us kind of an update on the environment for approvals and signings and outlook for the year?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, I think generally we've been pleased by how robust the incoming in the pipeline is globally. And I think there is a continued shift towards us, maybe not towards us alone, but certainly Marriott has got a portfolio of quality brands. And I think we are seeing folks, particularly in more moderate economic climate, saying we've got to make sure we've got the right quality. I think also the brand lineup has been really powerful in the last few years. When you look at AC by Marriott, you look at Moxy Hotels, you look at Aloft and Element and what\u2019s happened with those brands since we closed on the Starwood acquisition, they are relatively underrepresented or unrepresented the end many markets around the world, including in North America.","And I think we're seeing a number of our partners who say, that's a pretty interesting brand for me. It's now in the Marriott portfolio. So I get the benefit of the loyalty program and the reservation system and the like. And I want to be the one to take that brand in a given market. They are good brands for urban. There's obviously more value in selective element in urban markets as opposed to suburban markets. And so I think that's one of the reasons that the pipeline demand has stayed as robust as it has.","Kevin Kopelman","Fantastic. Thanks Arne. Thanks Leeny.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Leeny Oberg","Take care.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Chad Beynon with Macquaire.","Chad Beynon","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk broadly about trends domestically with your booking window on leisure and transient? We've heard from many of your competitors that this continues to compress and it's making it harder to forecast RevPAR and really maximize gross profit margin. Any major changes that you've seen in the past couple of months there?","Leeny Oberg","Certainly not major, I mean it does at the margin on the transient side narrow a little bit. But I would really say not enough to be noticeable. ","Arne Sorenson","And I think you've got \u2013 if anything, you've got a little bit of probably lengthening of the group window, I think, the group bookings as we've talked about have been good. One of the frustrations for us over the years is we don't have that much forward-looking data because transient business, particularly business transient business is very near term in its booking. It always has been. Leisure transient can be quite a bit longer and group even longer still. And by and large, when we put together our set of expectations for Q3 and Q4, we're looking at the data that we have, which obviously is more relevant to Q3, for example, than it is to Q4. But we don't have that much that gives us certainty about what's to come.","Chad Beynon","Great. Thanks. And then on China there's a couple of things. There's the trade war and then there's the economic declines that are going on. You've talked a lot about the RevPAR. What about food and beverage sales? What are you seeing there? And do you think that's more closely tied to what's going on with the GDP picture? Or could that reverse after a trade war resolution is finalized? Thank you.","Arne Sorenson","Yes, we're seeing F&B probably grow at modestly higher rates than rooms revenue in China. I think the food and beverage is going to skew even a bit more towards the Chinese consumer. And again, that's a sign of the probably shift towards a consumer economy and the importance of that from a local population, particularly in the key cities, has got resources to do some of these things and they didn't in years past. So I don't think there's incremental risk in the food and beverage space compared to the rest of the hotel, maybe just the opposite.","Chad Beynon","Thank you very much.","Arne Sorenson","Alright thank you everybody for your time and patience this morning. We appreciate your interest in Marriott and look forward to welcoming you on your travel. Come stay with us.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Arne M. Sorenson","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Carl Berquist, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future events -- future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, July 30, 2014, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","Our second quarter results were outstanding. Both worldwide comparable hotel RevPAR and gross room additions increased 6%. Carl will address our RevPAR performance. I want to talk today about why we place such a significant focus on growing distribution.","While broad distribution obviously drives sales, it also allows us to leverage our sales and marketing resources, our branding efforts, our reservation system and our frequent traveler program. It provides our customers with greater choices and better products wherever they choose to travel, and it delivers greater efficiency and profitability to our owners, all of which drive higher shareholder value.","In recent years, we ramped up our efforts to drive distribution. We decentralized our development organization, opening local development offices to get closer to the market, to customers and to our owners. We added resources. Since 2009, we increased our number of developers and support staff worldwide to more than 35%. We welcomed more than 400 new franchisees to our system, and we added more franchisee training and support. We introduced new brands to our portfolio, specifically 5 brands since 2009: Autograph, MOXY, Protea, Gaylord and AC Hotels. We entered emerging markets abroad and expanded to new tertiary markets at home, and we invested capital. We have used the strength of our balance sheet to complete a $210 million acquisition of Gaylord; a $200 million acquisition of Protea; a temporary investment in 3 spectacular company-developed EDITION hotels; and most recently, a recyclable loan for the Atlantis hotel, which will joined the Autograph Collection, all examples of how capital investments can help us enter new markets and fuel our growth, and the results speak for themselves.","Year-to-date in 2014, we have opened 25,000 rooms worldwide compared to 11,000 rooms in the prior year. We signed contracts for 46,000 rooms in the first half of this year compared to 24,000 rooms in the prior year. To be sure, we picked up a significant number of rooms with the Protea acquisition. But even excluding the impact of that transaction, room signings are up 45% this year. This allowed our development pipeline of under construction, signed or approved rooms to reach a new record of nearly 215,000 rooms at the end of the second quarter, a 37% increase over the year ago pipeline.","In the last year, in North America, our full-service pipeline increased by 7,000 rooms, reflecting an increase in our Autograph pipeline. While we continue to see little new full-service hotel construction in the United States, of what there is, we are getting much more than our fair share. In fact, our flags are on 30% of the roughly 50 upper upscale and luxury branded hotels currently under construction in the U.S., more than any competitor.","In the last 12 months, our North American limited service pipeline increased by 23,000 rooms, reaching 96,000 rooms. 30% of upper midscale and upscale branded hotels currently under construction in the U.S. will fly one of our flags. We are pursuing secondary and tertiary markets, and roughly 60% of the rooms in our U.S. limited service pipeline are outside the top 25 MSAs. But urban markets are [Audio Gap] and AC Hotels. In the past year, we've added more than 5,000 AC Hotels rooms through our North American pipeline alone.","Despite this tremendous North American growth, there is no need to panic. We don't believe the strength of our North American pipeline is an indication of an overcharged industry supply. In fact, Smith Travel is still forecasting U.S. supply growth of 1.2% for 2014 and 1.6% for 2015. Rather, it is our market share that is expanding. To be sure, the North American resale market is strengthening with many hotels being marketed, particularly limited service properties with strong track records. The CMBS market is stronger and financing is getting easier to find. Eventually, higher values of these existing hotels compared to construction costs, along with easier financing and a growing economy, will fuel greater new hotel development. But once such industry development begins, it will still take years for the new hotels to open. In the meantime, supply growth is modest. In our view, we are only midway through this cycle in North America.","Our Asia Pacific pipeline is up 30% to more than 60,000 rooms, reflecting the strong economic growth from the region, coupled with Marriott's strong brands and operating expertise. The number of Ritz-Carlton, Marriott Renaissance and Courtyard hotels is growing in China. While construction pace in China remains on track, we are finding deals take longer to execute as we concentrate our development effort in large secondary markets in the West.","In India, it is our Ritz-Carlton, Marriott Courtyard and FairField brands which are expanding. With the election in India complete, we hope that greater stability and strength in that economy should help further hotel development. The room pipeline in the Caribbean and Latin America has nearly doubled in the last 12 months, albeit off a low base. Today, we have 35 limited service projects underway in the region. Development is particularly strong in Brazil and Mexico.","Europe's pipeline is up 45% year-over-year. AC and MOXY are taking off in Europe with 5,000 AC and MOXY rooms already in the pipeline across 9 countries. The first MOXY hotel is scheduled to open in Milan in the fall. We are also bullish about conversion opportunities in Europe, particularly for our Autograph brand.","Our pipeline in the Middle East and Africa is 35% ahead of last year. Even excluding the Protea deal, we have new full-service deals in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and markets in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our acquisition of Protea is big news in the region, and we expect it will enable us to accelerate our Sub-Saharan growth going forward.","Worldwide, for the full year, given the strength in room signings, particularly conversions, and the pace of construction, we are now estimating 2014 rooms growth at 7% gross or roughly 6% net of deletions. We operate under the maxim. Success is never final. Over the past decade, we introduced new room designs and new lobby designs to drive guest satisfaction and hotel profits higher. We rolled out a more effective approach for group sales in North America, driving group RevPAR index up and meeting planner satisfaction higher.","We introduced the Marriott mobile app for tablets and smartphones and booked over $1.6 billion of mobile reservations in the last 12 months alone. Mobile online check-in and online checkout is already available at 1,000 of our hotels, and we expect it to be rolled out to more than 4,000 hotels by year end.","We launched 5 new brands, we introduced our addition EDITION brand and, since 2009, recycled nearly $900 million in investments. We are now a leading company in the luxury and lifestyle space for MOXY to Ritz-Carlton with over 450 luxury and lifestyle hotels.","Through M&A, we solidified our leadership in North American group business, with the acquisition of Gaylord, and became the leader In sub-Saharan Africa with the addition of Protea. We decentralized and empowered our continent leadership to allow us to grow faster and be more responsive to the customer.","And finally, with the spinoff of our timeshare business, we refocused our efforts on what we do best: develop, operate and franchise the finest hotel brands in the world. We did this all in the last 5 years, while still returning nearly $5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends.","The last 5 years have been terrific. We're hosting an Analyst Meeting on September 8 in Washington to talk about what's next for Marriott. The meeting will be webcast on marriott.com, but we urge you to attend in person so you can see our 4,000th hotel and meet the outstanding Marriott associates who make these strategies successful every day.","Now the success -- to discuss the second quarter, here's Carl.","Carl T. Berquist","Thanks, Arne. For the 2014 second quarter, worldwide systemwide RevPAR increased 5.8%, the high end our expectation. Adjusting for certain items I'll discuss in a minute, diluted earnings per share totaled $0.71 compared to our guidance of $0.63 to $0.68, a $0.06 peak to the midpoint of our guidance. Roughly $0.01 to $0.02 came from better fee revenue, primarily incentive fees. Roughly $0.01 to $0.02 came from the owned, leased and other line with better-than-expected branding fee and about $0.03 to $0.04 came from G&A, largely due to the favorable timing of development spending and lower bad debt expense. Adjusted operating income rose 21% in the quarter and our adjusted operating margin increased to 47%.","We adjusted our second quarter reported earnings per share with 3 items totaling $0.07: a $7 million pretax foreign currency loss associated with the Venezuelan Bolivar on the G&A line; a $15 million pretax impairment on the depreciation, amortization and other expense line; and an $11 million pretax litigation reserve on the equity line.","In North America, second quarter systemwide RevPAR increased 6%, at the high end of our expectations, a particularly impressive performance given the roughly one point negative impact of the shifting Easter holiday. Systemwide room rates increased nearly 4%.","Our RevPAR growth in the Western U.S. was strong. We saw improving trends in many East Coast markets. Our company-operated hotels in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, Nashville and Boston, all reported RevPAR growth in the second quarter, north of 9%. RevPAR in Greater Washington exceeded our expectations, rising 2%. RevPAR in Greater New York increased over 3% despite significant supply growth in the city.","Group demand is looking very good. Marriott hotel group bookings made in the second quarter for the next 12 months increased 8%. Meetings that took place in the second quarter, attendance exceeded expectations, and cancellations were below trend. Our Marriott Hotel brand reported group RevPAR up roughly 3% in the quarter, but we estimate it would have been up roughly 5%, excluding the timing impact of the shifting Easter holiday. For full year 2014, group bookings pace for the Marriott brand in North America remains up above 5%.","In the Caribbean and Latin America, second quarter systemwide constant dollar RevPAR increased nearly 11%, with strong resort demand and the benefit of the World Cup in Brazil. For the full year 2014, excluding Venezuela, we are modeling high-single-digit RevPAR growth for the Caribbean and Latin America.","RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region increased 5.6% in the quarter. RevPAR growth was strong in Japan, Indonesia, and India, offset by lower year-over-year RevPAR in Thailand. RevPAR in Greater China rose over 7%, while at our very strong portfolio of hotels in Shanghai, RevPAR increased at a double-digit rate. We expect RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region to increase at the mid-single-digit rate for the full year.","RevPAR in Europe increased 1.6% as strong results in Germany, Austria, Italy and Spain were offset by a weak economy in France and cancellations in St. Petersburg and Moscow. Growth was also constrained by the impact of property renovations in the lower Middle East travel to Europe due to the timing of Ramadan. We are encouraged by improving business conditions in Italy and Spain as our comp RevPAR in those countries increased 7% in the quarter. For full year 2014, we expect Europe's RevPAR to grow at a low-single-digit rate, reflecting the tough economy in France and the significant political tension impacting Russia.","In the Middle East and Africa, RevPAR increased 4.9%, a bit ahead of our expectation. Year-over-year, strong results in Bahrain, the UAE and Saudi Arabia offset lower results in Egypt. For the full year, we expect our comp hotels in the Middle East and Africa region to increase RevPAR at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting easier comps for Egypt later in the year.","Total fee revenue increased 11% in the quarter, and incentive fees increased 28%, benefiting from strong RevPAR, continued unit growth and, to a lesser extent, favorable timing of fee recognition. We're on pace to deliver a high-teens growth rate for incentive fees for the full 2014 year.","Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses totaled $70 million in the quarter, 8% higher than the prior year, driven by stronger results at our leased hotels, the addition of Protea and easy comparisons of the cost of lease terminations in the prior year and the benefit of our recently purchased hotel in Charlotte and higher credit card and residential branding fee. These were offset by $13 million in lower termination fee.","We've put a great deal of focus on our general and administrative expenses. We feel good about our progress. G&A expenses totaled $159 million in the quarter, reflecting the impact of a $7 million expense due to the revaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar for the year. Excluding the FX impact, a significant decline in G&A reflected a $5 million performance cure payment in the prior year, lower bad debt expense and favorable timing of development and other lower overhead expenses.","Depreciation and amortization increased to $47 million in the quarter, largely due to a $15 million pretax impairment on our Miami EDITION hotel. You may recall that we entered into an agreement to sell our 3 company-developed EDITION hotels earlier this year, with a fixed price transaction following approximately $800 million, subject to valuable long-term management agreement, with closing scheduled upon the opening of each hotel. We've already received roughly $230 million.","In the case of the Miami EDITION, the project includes both the hotel, which is subject to the sale agreement; and 25 residences, which we are marketing independent of that transaction. While the estimated cost of the total Miami project is unchanged from last quarter, we fine-tuned the cost breakout, resulting in lower allocation of development cost for the residences and a higher allocation of development cost for the hotel. Since we have a fixed sales price on the hotel, we recognize the higher cost allocation as an impairment in the second quarter.","Looking ahead, our P&L will benefit from the lower development cost of the residences as these contracts close. While we are likely to close on at least a portion of these units in 2014, our guidance assumes an immaterial P&L impact and no cash proceed in '14.","We repurchased 5 million shares during the quarter for approximately $300 million and another roughly 800,000 shares for approximately $50 million since the end of the quarter. Our average fully diluted share count in the quarter was 5% lower than the prior year.","Looking ahead, we expect third quarter RevPAR will increase 6% to 8% in North America. Our group booking pace is very strong in the third quarter, while fourth quarter pace is less robust, given the unfavorable shift in the timing of holidays in the fourth quarter.","Third quarter international RevPAR is expected to increase 4% to 6%. Worldwide, we expect fee revenue to total $425 million to $435 million in the third quarter, including strong franchise relationship fees. Franchisees are taking advantage of the very strong real estate market to sell their hotels subject to new franchise agreement. In addition to driving relicensing fees higher, this also benefits us as such transactions are typically accompanied by a property improvement program.","Owned, leased and other is expected to total roughly $50 million in the third quarter, including $4 million in termination fee. Last year's third quarter benefited from $7 million in termination fee. We expect third quarter G&A will total $160 million to $165 million, reflecting Protea integration cost and incremental Protea admin, as well as higher development cost. All in all, we expect third quarter EPS will total $0.59 to $0.63.","For the full year, we are increasing our worldwide RevPAR guidance to 5% to 7%. We expect rooms growth to total roughly 7% gross or 6% net, driving fee revenue to $1.685 billion to $1.725 billion. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expenses, should be helped by stronger RevPAR, our newly purchased hotel in Charlotte, the addition of the leased Protea hotel and higher branding fees, more than offsetting the roughly $25 million of termination fees we recognized in 2013.","We continue to expect G&A for the full year to be flat to slightly down versus last year's level despite the unexpected $7 million currency charge in the second quarter. For the full year, better-than-expected fees; owned, leased results; and G&A take our full year expected EPS up by about $0.07 at the midpoint, while the second quarter adjustment item I discussed earlier bring us down by about $0.07. Therefore, for the full year, we expect fully diluted EPS will total $2.40 to $2.51.","We expect adjusted EBITDA will total roughly 1.65 -- I'm sorry, $1.465 billion to $1.515 billion in 2014, an 11% to 14% increase over 2013. Investment spending could total $800 million to $1 billion, including about $150 million in maintenance spending and roughly $200 million Protea acquisition. We will remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchase. We expect to recycle $500 million to $600 million from asset sale and loan repayments during 2014, including the sale of the London EDITION and the Barcelona Renaissance, transactions of which are already complete. We expect to return $1.35 billion to $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends this year. Year-to-date, we've already repurchased nearly 13 million shares for approximately $700 million.","We appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] We plan to stay as long as you want. Laurie, we'll take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It was a great quarter versus your guidance. I wonder if you could give us a little color, though. When you look at North American RevPAR, up 6%, and we look at Smith Travel data for the U.S. up about 8%. So I don't know if it was the Canadian currency that caused the kind of seemingly relative underperformance, or if you could just give a little color around that.","Arne M. Sorenson","You're right. There's a lot of things that go into this, Robin. The Smith Travel numbers are not a measure of comp store performance. They're essentially a measure of the industry in a given market. And obviously, that is probably the biggest apples-to-oranges comparison. Now beyond that, of course, you get geographic distribution and some other things which go with it. We use one market to illustrate that. in New York, we had comp RevPAR growth for our hotels of plus 3.5%. If we included non-comp hotels that are in New York, in our system, our RevPAR number would've been plus 7.4%. Smith Travel was about plus 5%, if I remember correctly -- 5.5%. And Smith Travel, essentially, is doing a measure, which is more like that 7.4% measure to us. That's not a fair measure for us to look at the way our hotels are performing, because if you include non-comp hotels that are ramping dramatically from prior year performance, simply because they're brand-new, we're not really getting a fair measure of what comp hotels are doing in the market. And so that is a big distinction between what we report and what I think most of the other companies in the industry report compared to what Smith Travel reports. We've talked about this in prior calls, of course. We look at RevPAR index as being the most important measure of the relative performance of our hotels. That is a rolled up figure. Each hotel has got a typically comparative group of about 5 hotels that it measures its performance against. And when we look at our brands in the United States, every brand we have is posting higher RevPAR index year-to-date than prior year. So we think we're performing extremely well and in no way losing ground to the industry.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That is helpful. I wonder, do you have a rough estimate of what your non-comp RevPAR growth will be? In other words, the New York City example was helpful. I mean, do you have a ballpark for what your U.S. would've looked like on that basis?","Arne M. Sorenson","I don't at my fingertips, but that may be something we can provide you supplementary later.","Operator","Next question comes on the line of Nikhil Bhalla of FBR.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just a question on the franchised select service space, so your RevPAR on the company-operated numbers -- on the company-operated stores was a little bit higher but still below where STR was. And then the franchised hotels themselves, non-company-operated, was even lower. So can you just give us some color around what the dynamics may be?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I mean, you can notice that you have that aspect in the limited service and you have the opposite in the full service. So I think the Marriott brand, for example, the franchisees posted higher RevPAR than we did with the managed portfolio. And the biggest factor in both of those circumstances will be geographic distribution. We are relatively richer, both with total distribution and with managed distribution in markets like Washington, and our franchisees are. And so that has an impact there. That is less pronounced in the limited service space. And as a consequence, you can see a shift in the other direction.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So in the select service space, your numbers were just quite below where STR was. I think STR, for the quarter, was around 8.5% in the upscale space. Your -- so franchise hotels were more in the 6-plus percent range. Was there a specific geography, like Washington, D.C., that impacted those numbers in or around that? Or is it just something else going on?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, it would be both inclusion of the Smith Travel numbers of our non-comp hotels, which we do not include in our numbers, as well as geographic distribution and differences in the portfolio. Again, I think RevPAR index is a much more telling indication of performance than the headline comparison of our brand numbers to the Smith Travel's industry numbers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So Arne, we've seen the limited service segment outperform luxury and upper upscale all year, both industry-wide, and certainly within your portfolio. Just wondering what do you think is driving the outperformance and how sustainable do you think it is?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I think -- good question. We look at those figures and do not interpret them as relative weakness in luxury and upper upscale. And I think that's probably the first thing to point out. Luxury business seems to be strong, seems to be growing. Index is growing. We see that both in the U.S. numbers and global numbers. I think beyond that, you kind of -- probably a couple of things which tend to drive this a little bit. In Q2, we have our group business, for example, growing only 1%, and we suspect that group business would've been more like 5% if Easter hadn't been in Q2. That has a disproportionate impact on group business compared to transient and leisure business. That's going to tend to impact the higher end more. Obviously, the Courtyards and the limited service hotels have some group business, but it tends to be more of a leisure quality, to the extent they have it and they have much less than a service hotel has. And then lastly, I think we see in the Courtyard brand, as an example, some great momentum that is coming from the completion of the renovations of that brand's lobbies. I think we've got 800-or-so that have been redone. Customers are reacting very well to that, and we are getting some outsized growth. I suspect that to be as good as well.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And Carl, regarding your capital return, you increased that by $100 million. Just wondering what drove that. And I know it's likely a board decision, but what's the likelihood of further increases later in the year? I'm greedy, I'm greedy, sorry.","Carl T. Berquist","All right. It's just, as we look at our model and as we look at our capital allocation strategy and policies, we've been pretty disciplined on that, and we look at what we're going to invest over the next 12 to 24 months. We look at growth in EBITDA, our debt capacity, and we look at -- with that stronger EBITDA and our disciplined leverage, we had an additional capacity, and that's why we moved it up a bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker of MLV & Co.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick things. One, I was hoping you could talk about your 3Q outlook for North America of plus 6% to 8%, you mentioned that group is expected to be stronger in 3Q. Is that driving that uptick in North America for your expectations? Or is it that the transient is coming in much stronger than maybe it was last quarter?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I think it's more really about group than transient, although in saying that, let's recognize that transient was strong in the second quarter and we expect it to continue to be strong in Q3 and Q4. I'm just trying as I answer this to pull out, to make sure that I have the right data in front of me. We see almost 10%, 9% and change group bookings over and above last year's bookings for Q3. And Q4 is meaningfully weaker on the group side. So as we sit here today, we would guess that in North America, RevPAR will be higher in Q3 than in Q4 because of group. Now we'll see how group fills in for Q4 between now and when Q4 actually takes place, but that group business is a big reason for the 6% to 8% guidance that we've given for Q3.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one other quick question. So your incentive management fees were up a very robust, I think, 28% in the quarter. You mentioned -- Carl mentioned in his initial commentary that we're looking at high-teens incentive management fee growth this year. I guess, how do we think about what was driving that robust 28% growth in the quarter? Is it this RevPAR? Is it the fact that -- does North American RevPAR up 6% to 8% in 3Q drive outsized incentive fee growth in 3Q as well? How should we think about things going forward this year and then into next year in terms of what a run rate growth rate is for those IMF?","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. If you think about the second quarter, I think you had, as we mentioned, we had more hotels paying incentive fees in the second quarter. We also had timing. You have the seasonality in the second quarter, so you have some timing in those incentive fees as well, which would drive benefit in the second quarter, and that -- that'll come back as we go through the rest of the year, bring it down to mid to high teens. I think those were the 2 big major items to think about.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","And is mid to high teens a good run rate at RevPAR levels like what you're seeing this year?","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, and in fact, at the investor conference on September, we'll talk a little more about our expectations of incentive fees over the next couple of years to give you a little more feel for how we see the long-term playing out relative to incentive fees with all the growth. If you think about, in the second quarter, the 40% of our hotels that we're paying, the gross from last year's number, which I think was 30%...","Arne M. Sorenson","34%.","Carl T. Berquist","34%. International hotel is still about 2\/3 of them are paying. They were 2\/3 last year. Now we have more international hotels, and we have more physical hotels paying. There's about 2\/3 of them, whereas the domestic hotels, more of those started paying as we continue to grow our EBITDA, so to speak. But we'll give you more color on that at the investor conference, what we see over the next 3, 4 years.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Carl, maybe just a follow-up on incentive management fee, not to steal your thunder for September, but the question we get a lot is just where are we in the progress of some of the limited service portfolios? And I think, it was already mentioned, you are starting to see some very strong limited service RevPAR growth. So are we starting to get to the point where margins on some of those portfolios are reaching that owners' priority level and starting to kind of get into the money on incentive management fees? Or we're just not quite there yet?","Carl T. Berquist","No. In the second quarter, we had an increase in the number of incentive -- a number of limited service hotels paying versus last year, albeit it was not a big increase. You got to remember, each hotel, the amount being paid is that significant. But as you have growth and as RevPAR continues to grow, those margins expand. And as I said, Shaun, we'll get into some of that for you in September at the meeting.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I guess my follow-up or second question would just be, Arne, in the prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about some of your commitment behind SG&A and your continued focus on cost. It seems like you did a good job of finding some offsets to the currency impact. Could you just talk a little bit about -- I mean, as you look forward to more like 2015 and 2016, do you think that a lower overall run rate is possible as you focus on development, but maybe find other areas to kind of -- to maybe not trim, but certainly remain pretty disciplined on? Or how do you see SG&A trending in a slightly longer period of time?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. There is obviously, aspects of our business, which are quite complicated and are hard to describe real pithily. But the financial model is very, very simple, and really, that is about driving same store performance, which is really RevPAR growth. Obviously, margins is impactful as it relates to incentive fees. It's driving unit growth. It's getting leveraged through G&A, and then it's using the balance sheet and the capital that we've got available for it. And we have a very simple focus on each of those 4 things, including G&A, and we are absolutely committed to growing G&A lower, meaningfully lower, than we're growing the fee line, so we get that P&L leverage and the impact of that on earnings per share. We'll give you a 3-year model when we're together in September, and that 3-year model is going to tell you how we think, under a range of scenarios, those 4 things perform, how does RevPAR perform, what happens with EBIT growth, what kind of range for G&A kind of growth and what are we going to do with all the money that we produce between now and the end of that 3-year period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Carl, were going to have one more go at the incentive management fee question. What percentage of your hotels that aren't paying an incentive management fee today would be paying if you got another 5% to 7% lift in RevPAR?","Carl T. Berquist","I don't have that in front of me, Harry, so I don't want to hazard a guess on that. So I think we'll just wait until September and give us the opportunity to give you this information in context about the overall model, the 3-year model, and what we see.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Then on to the next question. You commented about the outlook for group, and up 5%. I wasn't sure if that was for '14 or '15.","Arne M. Sorenson","Carl had in his prepared remarks one statistic. I'll give you a second one. But in Q2, group business booked for the next 12 months, so that will be Q3 and Q4 this year and Q1 and Q2 next year. It was up about 8%. Business booked also in Q2 for months 13 to 24, so that would be the last 2 quarters of 2015 and the first 2 quarters of 2016, is also up about 8%, a sign that the group bookings are really coming in at a very healthy pace.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So if we parse -- I'm sorry. Go ahead, Laura.","Laura E. Paugh","S","Booking pace for 2014, over 2013, is up 5%.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, that was the number. So my question was, then, if we extend that out to '15, how would that pace and position look like for '15?","Carl T. Berquist","Right now, pace for '15, it's really early to be computing pace for '15. But it's about 5% single digits. Clearly, mid-single-digit, maybe a little lower right now, but right about that neighborhood. It's early.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And it typically accelerates as we get closer, correct?","Arne M. Sorenson","Hopefully.","Carl T. Berquist","Hopefully.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So it's interesting that you're optimistic on your RevPAR being driven by group, as 3Q is typically a slower period for conventions and group bookings. So can you give us any color on why that's changing and maybe on any metrics you can give us on kind of what percentage of room nights are you expecting to be group in 3Q '14 versus the other quarters this year, and then what's the typical seasonality behind -- typical seasonality between quarters?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think your comments are generally right. I mean I think obviously, Q3 is July, August and September. July and August are not huge group months. Now remember, group is sometimes corporate group, which tends to be much weaker in the summer than it would be in the spring or the fall. So you've also got association business, some of which is more value-focused, and as a consequence, you pick up some of that, even in the summertime months. But you're right that group tends to be less in those 2 months. September is a fine month for group business. It's a fine month for business travel as well. I mean it's back-to-school for that age, but it's also back to work in many respects for the rest of our society and economy. And just as -- I said this before, but group is strong with that 9-plus percent increase from last year for Q3. But transient is strong as well. And both of those things, we think, will be contributing to that 6% to 8% growth in Q3.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just quickly on your leverage position, there's a big debate, with longer periods, around what kind of what the right leverage for them is. Just curious for an update on where you feel you are in the eyes of rating agencies versus where you want to be? And also just with the addition of apartment sales, do you have plans for the use of the cash there once you do realize it?","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. When we look at our leverage, as you know, we're a rated company BBB, and we wanted to stay rated. That keeps us in the commercial paper market, gives us a very efficient capital structure to finance our business. So we manage part of our capital allocation strategy to maintain that rating. To do that, we believe a 3 to 3.25 adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. As we've talked about before, the rating agencies adjust for leases, guarantees, et cetera and adjust the EBITDA accordingly, and they published that calculation, you can get it. So we managed to that. But we may float up and down between 3 and 3.25 and all that, depending on where we are in the cycle and all that. But we're pretty disciplined to stay within that area.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And do you have an estimate for where you are right now?","Carl T. Berquist","We're probably right around that 3%.","Arne M. Sorenson","3x.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, 3x, not 3%. 3x. And then your question on the proceeds for the condos that we're selling down in Miami, we don't have anything on our '14 guidance relative to the cash related to those condos. We expect the total sellout to generate somewhere between $150 million and $175 million in that neighborhood. Those things will close as we sell them probably well into '15. And cash is fungible relative to how we use the cash, so that will go into our model relative to our capital allocation strategy, no different than any other recycled cash.","Arne M. Sorenson","I suspect we've had conversations not just with all of you in these calls, but many of you in smaller settings, probably 90% of you over the last decade or so, about leverage levels and returning capital to shareholders. And I think, for us, it's a very steady approach. Carl talked about the 3 to 3.25x debt to EBITDA. We have always factored in lease exposure and guarantee exposure as we do that calculation. We have, in the fullness of time and the cyclicality of our business, looked at whether or not we could bring those leverage levels down as we get farther in an economic recovery or economic growth period. We've reflected, I think, with many of you, about whether or not we could have, in hindsight, been better about not buying back stock in the final year or 2 of the growth cycle, so that we have more dry powder in the down cycle. And I think, in all fairness, we do not pretend to have expertise around timing the market or timing the economic cycle. In lots of respects, that's your job more than it is ours, particularly when it comes to a broader economic aspect as opposed to our business by itself. And so what that means is, I think that we think at 3 to 3.25x, it leaves us plenty of flexibility, even in the downturn, so you look at how far RevPAR fell in 2009, our 3 to 3.25 drove us only about up to 3.8, 3.9.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, about 4.","Arne M. Sorenson","And within -- because of the cash we produce in our business, we were quickly back down to 3 and 3.25 and we've put the company in absolutely no pressure, and we are extremely comfortable that at those leverage -- levels, virtually, anything that we've seen in the past, if they were thrown at us again, we think we'll be well equipped to handle. And we are a bit more bullish at this point than we've been at prior times because we no longer have a capital-intensive timeshare business, which has volatility that the lodging business, particularly in base and franchise fees, does not have. But many of you have already tried to talk with us about incentive management fees this morning, and we know why you're interested in that. But one of the things that's interesting observation is our fee stream is much less risky today than it was in 2007 or in 2000 because the percentage of fees that are being contributed from U.S. incentive fees of our total fees is much lighter than it was before. And so we think even in a similar RevPAR environment that we suffered in 2009 or in 2002 as an example, our performance, P&L performance and cash flow performance should be less volatile than it's been before, and that gives us even more comfort that are 3 to 3.25, we are exactly levered the way we should be. And we'll continue to use the leverageability that comes from growing EBITDA and the cash flow that comes from recycling capital investments and from annual cash flow contribution of our business gets returned to our shareholders, to the extent it's not able to be invested in value-enhancing investments that we could think.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Choles of SunTrust.","Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","You considered this quarter and the last quarter, that's a slowdown in the fourth quarter on group. And you briefly mentioned that it's possibly from the holidays. I'm just curious if there's anything else you think might be going on there, because I can understand, with the timing of holidays in October, but I don't see it in November and December and even in January. Why the big deceleration in group RevPAR in the fourth quarter?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, there is a different timing of Hanukkah, obviously, and that has some impact, but it's not massive. We talked about this internally, and one of the jokes I like to say when the team says it's a holiday pattern, I say, okay, that's because Christmas is on the 25th this year. Obviously, that holiday does not change. I think to some extent, there is a -- over time, you get some strong months and some weak months, and there's not a very strong explanation for it. There's not a very clear explanation for it. I think it would be concerning if we weren't seeing the kinds of bookings that we saw in Q2 and even prior quarters. And what those bookings tell us is, fourth quarter is a little bit of a sport. It's been weak for a while. It's a little bit weaker. I suspect, even though we may reclaim some ground, that we'll see that group business is, when the fourth quarter is over, was weaker in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, and that'll have some impact on RevPAR. But I think we'll head into next year and we'll have strong quarters and the group business that we're booking now will show up and we'll do really well.","Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I definitely agree with you there. We always see sort of ebbs and flows in the up cycle here, and now it seems that fourth quarter is sort of the bit of softness and bouncing back.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So 2 questions. First, can you just broadly discuss the need for sliver equity in mass financing to get hotels to join the system? And I guess the reason I'm asking is the Atlantis was surprising that you put capital into that one to get it to join the Autograph because the Autograph is such a great way to get independence to join, so it was a little odd to me to see that, and I just wanted to understand a little bit more on that, how big that could become, other -- whether you'd be doing other deals like that. And then separately, just because people have been asking about it, what about including the RevPAR index for the brands on a go-forward basis, maybe revisiting that issue, I think years ago you used to include it.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. Well, let me sort of put the simplest answer on the Atlantis first. If we could do for them, we would do more of them gladly. We're thrilled with this deal. It is not just a big property which will be profitable for us, but it's a great property, and many of our customers, I think, will love having that as part of the system, whether it is to go and pay for a room or whether it's to redeem reward points and stay there. And obviously, that transaction happened in the context of a refinancing of that hotel by its owner, and we were glad to be able to participate in it with a $100 million mez loan, which will be repaid over time, and we'll retain a franchise contract which separately delivers strong returns to us.","Carl T. Berquist","I think it's a good example of the strength of our balance sheet and how we can be opportunistic to take advantage of once-in-a-lifetime type opportunities out there, because we have that flexibility and that power in our capital structure.","Arne M. Sorenson","Right. I think generally, on the more typical deal, we're not seeing a meaningful shift in the need to put in capital. Now we do have some competitors who are trying to build brands that have smaller distribution, that are being aggressive about throwing capital around to try and influence the growth aims that they've got, and in some individual circumstances, we lose a deal or 2 because we're not willing to do that. But fortunately, in the broader scheme of things, our brands have got significant strength and they really -- the franchise contracts, particularly see first limited service hotels in the United States, by and large, require very, very little capital. With respect to your suggestion that we print RevPAR index every quarter, we'll keep our ears open on that. But I don't think we'll make any commitments at this point in time, but that may be something that we should be talking about as an industry.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Joe Greff of JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just on your -- Carl, with respect to your high teens you have in '14 incentive management fee growth, if we were to bifurcate that between North America and international, what would those year-over-year growth rate targets look like?","Arne M. Sorenson","Growth rate would be higher on domestic than it would be on international. In part, that's simply a function of the fact that domestic has been hit much harder than international has, because that's more volatile. And Carl was asked before about limited service contribution as an example. We're still getting less than 20% of our limited services managed hotels that are paying us incentive fees. And over time, hopefully, we'll see that, that grows. I don't have that year-over-year percentage growth, but I'm sure it's 20-plus in domestic land, and it would be probably be a little like low teens in international land.","Carl T. Berquist","Right.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then when you look at the top 3 drivers for North American incentive management fee growth for this year, how critical, how important has been the group? Was it really the group is not yet contributing much to that growth?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think transient has been stronger, year-to-date stayed and paid, compared to group, which is what you should expect at this stage of the cycle. And so I think it would be probably not accurate to say that our incentive fee growth that we've experienced year-to-date is disproportionately driven by group. On the other hand, group has got an F&B contribution that transient doesn't have, and so that group growth is really important, probably it's about equal weighting, I guess.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Arne, I wanted to focus on unit growth, but before I do that, could you just clarify how much of your group business has accounted for Gaylord branded properties today?","Arne M. Sorenson","What do you mean?","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Well, if you just looked at group as a total, how much is actually conducted within the Gaylord brand?","Arne M. Sorenson","I don't know. But just to be clear, I'm not sure it's really relevant. So when you look at our bookings this year, we talked about bookings being up 8% in Q2 for the next 12 months and another 8% for 2013 to 24 months out, those are comp hotel measures, so that's not a measure of all of the group revenue we put in, even on a bigger hotel base than we did a year ago, but it's essentially looking at -- taking that precise circumstance, we're probably looking at the Marriott hotel and resort brand in the United States. Comp hotels last year plus comp hotels this year, and that number increased by 8%.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got you. Yes, I think you had mentioned the Marriott branded hotels within that group commentary.","Arne M. Sorenson","Right.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. On the -- just help us understand on the new unit growth, how have your return expectations changed this cycle compared to last cycle, the time to achieve that sort of return hurdle that you're looking for. Anything that's changed?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, generally not. I mean, we try and pay attention to the sort of fee contribution we get from hotels that are entering into our system, and obviously, we make more the higher the rate or the higher the RevPAR for any given hotel. So a Ritz-Carlton room is going to give us more dollars and fees that a FairField room, to state the obvious. But when we look at the sort of average contribution across the system, international versus domestic, new hotels versus old hotels, by and large, we're seeing a pretty steady contribution. We might be, depending on the stage of the cycle and the stage of the content, we might be getting a little bit more limited service growth in some markets than full-service growth. That will have an impact. But when you look at limited service versus existing limited service or new full-service versus existing full-service, we see a pretty steady contribution. And I think in terms of the ramp of hotels, that's heavily driven by demand trends in a given market. I was fascinated to see that a market like Shanghai, where we have 21, I think, comp hotels open, almost 8,200 hotel rooms in that city alone. Carl's comments indicated this, but RevPAR in Q2 in Shanghai for us was up over 12%. RevPAR index for our hotels was up almost 6 points in the quarter. But that, in Shanghai, I was looking into the details of the data, we opened a Marriott hotel in Pudong East last year in January. That hotel ramped and was over its fair share within 5 months. And we're now only 18 months into the performance of that hotel, and it's almost at 2x its fair share in the market. And that's a function both, I think, of our brand strength and our sales and marketing strength, but I think it's also function of the demand that's in that market.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. So finally, Arne, any subtle changes just to pipeline, the makeup of the pipeline, less China, more U.S.; less limited service, more full service, anything like that, that we should be aware of?","Arne M. Sorenson","Not dramatic. I mean, you look at -- obviously Protea, as that comes through the pipeline and now open to the system, skews the Q2 numbers significantly towards more international and towards more Africa or Middle East and Africa than prior numbers. But when you look at our 215,000 room pipeline, we're about 50% U.S. and about 50% international. And our view is that the world is rich with opportunities. We see Asia continuing to grow, a big market that's continuing to grow quite well, but we would no sooner write off the United States than -- we would fight against writing off the United States because we think there's great growth that's available here. We do -- we are pleased to see that the new brands we've started over the last 5 years or so are really gaining traction. We talked a lot about AC Hotels in the U.S. in last quarter's call, but that continues to grow extremely well. Autograph is growing particularly in Europe and the United States extremely well. MOXY is off to a great start. Additionally, we've now got 10 hotels in the pipeline, and we think that the relaunch of that brand is going very well. And so there may be a shift a little bit, or maybe a disproportionate amount of the growth is coming from this luxury and lifestyle brands that we've added, but we're really gratified to see that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Actually, just building on maybe Bill Crow's question on unit growth. And you might have touched on this, but was the driver behind the increased outlook in net room additions driven by transactions, like Protea? Or does it speak to maybe some component of it coming from a more confident outlook or a robust outlook for a new construction or conversion in this year and potentially longer?","Arne M. Sorenson","Protea was in the numbers before. But if you think about Atlantis, Atlantis is 3,500 rooms, so that's 1\/2 of 1% by itself.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And so it's more acquisitions than it is necessarily sort of increased demand?","Arne M. Sorenson","It's -- I mean, it's both. You look at -- we held out this number of 290 hotels and 46,000 rooms signed year-to-date. It is a really powerful number. And the momentum that our development team has got is, I think, building as we speak. And so the Atlantises are sort of big and lumpy, and the Proteas are big and lumpy, in a good way. I don't mean that to sound negative. But you've also got, in the steady-state development space, good, really positive momentum.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And actually on Atlantis, do you feel that the affiliation with Cosmopolitan in Vegas and now, Atlantis, might open the door for you a little wider to consider more affiliations in the casino business or even a casino company out right?","Arne M. Sorenson","I don't know. We are -- we've probably got a dozen casino hotels in our system when you look around the world. We have never been unwilling to do that. I think, obviously, we can deliver the most value at those hotels in guest room and group. We are not a casino company, and so to the extent, somebody's looking to us for a book of gamers or deep insight in the consumer business, I'm not sure that we would -- that's something we can offer. But if the hotels are good and they meet our brand standard and we can deliver real value on the group side and the transient room side, we'd be happy to take more.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just one last question, just concerning Venezuela. I recognize you have just, I think, 3 hotels there. But did you have much cash in Venezuela? And how much of an impact do you think it's going to have to you in future quarters?","Carl T. Berquist","I think going forward, it's still going to be lumpy. They have -- that economy is very hyperinflationary economy. And every day, you read a little more about it and there are struggles and everything. We're not building a significant amount. I think our total investment after this revaluation is about $10 million right now, and -- or as of the end of the second quarter. And so obviously, that has risk, depending on what the government does and everything. We're managing close, but it's not a significant investment, so to speak.","Operator","The next question comes from Carlos Santarelli of Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. But I was wondering if you could just maybe briefly walk through some of the G&A changes in the quarter and how exactly and what will be shifting into the second half?","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. I think we have some timing items and development costs. In the second half, we have some integration costs that will be incurred relative to Protea. But probably 2 major items that we have in the second half timing that are different than the first half.","Laura E. Paugh","For Q3 versus Q4.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, more towards -- yes, you're right, Laura, especially the integration cost.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Understood. And just on the dollar basis, some of the timing, some of the lower-than-expected spending, would you guys be able to quantify that for the 2Q period?","Carl T. Berquist","You mean, where? Well, it's more in the administrative departments, what we call a direct and indirect administrative. We just didn't incur as much as we thought we were. It wasn't a specific item so to speak, but more of just, as you look at your run rate, what you're incurring.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Chris Jones of TAG.","Christopher E. Jones - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Just a quick question here, Arne. Just in the space of overall consumer, lodging has been sort of a relative bright spot, and certainly, RevPAR continues to be very strong here. So with that as a backdrop, how do you -- what sort of confidence do you have, that as ADR sort of continue to rise here, that we're going to continue to see sort of strong trends in demand that customers aren't going to sort of cry uncle here, as prices continue to push up, particularly in North American market?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I mean, there's no real sign of that kind of resistance. Now it's important to keep in mind that when we drive rates, so when we report a 3% or 4% ADR increase, that is both a like-for-like increase in rate, but it's also significantly a mix shift. And so one of the things we've seen, particularly mid-week, which is business travel time, is a shift of volume away from contract and special corporate business towards RAC rated business. And that mix drives a significant increase in the reported ADR for a hotel, even if the RAC rate itself has not changed very much. Now if you're a special corporate customer who no longer has special corporate access because you're too low rated before in a given hotel, you might not like that. As an example, not especially corporate one, but take government business as an example. In many markets, with the way occupancy has move, government rates are no longer available in full-service hotels in those markets. And as a consequence, government travelers have to end up at a Courtyard or Residence Inn or maybe they end up in a suburban Marriott. And that's sort of a natural part in the cyclicality of our business. I think we'll continue to see that rate growth will remain steady. And on some level, we talked about this in the last few quarters, at some level, we've been really surprised and very pleased to see occupancy continue to grow. We're at very high occupancy levels. And the higher they get, actually, the more ability we'll have to drive rate as opposed to last year.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Mr. Sorenson, are there any closing remarks?","Arne M. Sorenson","All right. Thank you, all. We appreciate your time and attention this morning and look forward to welcoming you soon into our hotels as you travel, and hope to see many of you in September for our analyst conference. Enjoy the rest of the summer.","Carl T. Berquist","Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you for participating in Marriott International Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.

[Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.","Arne M. Sorenson","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Carl Berquist, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","For those of you who joined our call early, we hope you enjoyed the soundtrack from our film, Two Bellmen. This short film, highlighting the JW Marriott Hotel L.A. live premiered on March 10. It's already clocked over 5 million views on YouTube. It is innovative and a big part of our receiving the Brand of the Year Award at the Cannes Media Conference in April. If you haven't seen Two Bellmen, we urge you to take a break from the busy earnings season for 17 minutes of fun.","Our second film, French Kiss, launching next month is set at the Paris Marriott Champs-Elysees Hotel.","Consumers are enthusiastically embracing the use of technology and social media as a means to obtain information and enjoy entertainment. And we're doing the same, offering exciting content that features our company's brands and the opportunity for unique experiences in an entertaining and informative way.","Technology is an important part of the lodging business today, but it's not just about bookings. While we delivered over 72 million room nights through marriott.com last year, we were also the first hotel company to launch mobile check-in and mobile checkout systemwide. You can see our 1 millionth check-in flash mob celebration on YouTube. We were the first company to use Oculus Rift to showcase travel experiences. And we were the first to begin testing Apple Pay at select hotels. Across the company, we remain focused on innovation. More is coming, so stay tuned.","In the meantime, as we will discuss earnings this morning, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, April 30, 2015, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","Two months ago, we opened the JW Marriott Mumbai Sahar. This is our second JW Marriott hotel in Mumbai and our 28th hotel to open in India. With 585 rooms, this luxury property covers 15 acres and offers fabulous indoor and outdoor meeting space. I was there for the opening and also attended the South Asia Hotel Investment Conference in Delhi. The election of Prime Minister Modi has ramped up optimism about the business climate and the economy in India.","Lower interest rates are helping too. Many expect that the rate of economic growth in India in 2015 could exceed China's. Today, tourism in India accounts for nearly 7% of GDP, and is the third largest foreign exchange earner for the country.","Just 5 months ago, India launched e-Tourist, a visa-on-arrival program for travelers from 43 countries. The number of countries included in that program should increase dramatically during 2015. The hotel owners and developers I spoke with are bullish about India. We have over 45 properties in our India development pipeline and more are in discussion.","Recently, I traveled to Toronto to welcome Delta Hotels to Marriott. The transaction closed on April 1. With Delta, we obtained a terrific full-service brand with significant growth potential and the largest full-service hotel market share in Canada. We plan to grow the brand globally, and franchise offering documents for Delta should be available in the next few months.","In Europe, hundreds of investors, lenders, developers and owners turned out for the Berlin International Hotel Investment Forum in the first quarter. They were bullish about Europe and so are we. We are accelerating our European expansion with additional development staff and a broad number of brand offerings.","Our development pipeline in Europe increased nearly 20% in the last 12 months, driven by owner demand for Courtyards, Residence Inns and Moxy Hotels, as well as our full-service brands.","Our worldwide development pipeline totaled over 240,000 rooms at quarter end. Openings are accelerating.","In the first quarter, we opened over 10,000 rooms compared to nearly 6,000 rooms in the prior year's quarter. We are on pace to grow our global system by roughly 8% in 2015, including the 10,000 Delta rooms.","Net of deletions, our system size should grow by 7% in 2015. This is no fluke. Given the substantial number of rooms under construction in the pipeline, we also expect our organic rooms growth will accelerate in 2016.","To be sure, room growth is an important measure of success. However, we also know that not all rooms are created equal. Real economic value is linked to annual fees, length of contract, amount of our invested capital, skill of the operator and the quality of each hotel asset.","Further, as we are building a highly-valued portfolio of hotels and brands, the impact of new hotels on the system is also relevant. It's also why the incentive compensation for our development organization is based on both net present value of the contract signed, as well as the number of rooms delivered. We are succeeding on both measures.","Our hotel distribution skews to the highest RevPAR markets and our share of those markets is increasing.","We've talked a lot about our room share gains in the U.S. The numbers worldwide are as impressive. On a worldwide basis, we estimate a 4.5% share of rooms today. In the largest 100 global markets, we have a 6.4% share. And in those largest, most valuable markets, our share of rooms under construction is nearly 16%.","Our development effort is successful in part because with our broad and growing brand portfolio, we can offer the right brand for each asset and market. This means we can play in more sandboxes than many of our competitors, winning the highest value opportunities.","Our brands are strong and delivers significant RevPAR with our sales and marketing engines, including Marriott Rewards and marriott.com delivering meaningful demand.","We've demonstrated this with Autograph conversions. At the end of 2014, the 21 North America hotels converted into the Autograph Collection that had been part of the Collection for 2 full years have enjoyed absolute RevPAR gains averaging 29% compared to their pre-conversion performance.","8 other Autograph hotels in the Collection, for just one full year, saw their absolute RevPAR boosted by 32%.","Premium RevPARs yield premium fees. Our effective royalty rate on U.S. franchised hotels totaled 5.3% of room revenue in 2014. And U.S. royalties continue to move higher. While royalty rate increases only apply to new signings, relicenses or renewals, if we apply our newly published stabilized royalty rates to the same topline, our average franchise royalty would total 5.8% of room revenue.","Looking at this more broadly, on a worldwide basis and including both managed and franchised hotels, we signed deals with nearly 17,000 rooms in the first quarter. We expect these new managed and franchised rooms worldwide will deliver over $38 million of annual fee revenue in their third year of operation.","And they should deliver these fees for a very long time. We estimate our existing contracts have an average of 17 years remaining. The length of our newest contracts average 20 to 25 years.","Our capital commitments to new development and -- are targeted and modest. Since 2010, we have invested roughly $300 million per year in our lodging business, net of asset sales. Nearly half of this has been invested in relatively small M&A deals.","In this time period, we have increased our worldwide rooms distribution by more than 20% and increased our fee revenue by nearly 60%. Having a strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage when it's employed judiciously.","Across the U.S., financing availability continues to ease, particularly for our limited-service products. In many smaller U.S. markets, strong demand and rapid RevPAR growth encourages franchise development. In large urban markets like New York, high absolute room rates and high labor costs offer a compelling limited-service investment pieces as well.","Outside the U.S., rapidly growing demand attracts hotel investment in emerging markets.","But there are also restraints to development. With strong limited-service hotel returns, there are few full-service hotels under development in the United States. High equity requirements, increasing construction costs and likely increasing interest rates discourage development in weaker demand markets. In fact, we have seen declining oil prices shelve some product -- projects in Texas and North Dakota.","In New York, while the long-term outlook is still very bright, the recent rapid supply growth is causing some developers to reconsider new projects in that market. In some cases, attractive alternative investments constrained supply. For example, in San Francisco, real estate developers are focused on the very attractive residential and office opportunities, not hotels, despite very high RevPAR growth in that market.","All combined, STR expects U.S. supply growth of only 1.3% in 2015. We believe the U.S. industry could reach the long-term average of roughly 2% supply growth by 2017.","But this does not, in itself, signal the end of the cycle. In fact, in 1996, the U.S. industry's supply grew by 2.4% and continued to grow in excess of 2% for the next 5 years. Despite these 5 years of supply growth, the industry also continued to grow RevPAR until the economy turned down in 2001.","While rapid supply growth can constrain performance in a given market for a time and, on a macro basis, can make a downturn more painful, we've never seen a change in supply trigger the end of the cycle. Rather, cycles end due to a declining economy and\/or an external shock.","By the way, from 1996 to 2001, Marriott increased its market share of rooms in the U.S. from 5.5% to 7.8%. And we are enjoying the benefits of that expansion even today.","Now, I'd like to turn things over to Carl to talk more about our outstanding first quarter results. Carl?","Carl T. Berquist","Thanks, Arne. For the first quarter of 2015, lodging demand was very strong and constant dollar worldwide systemwide RevPAR reached the top end of our guidance.","Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.73, $0.03 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance of $0.68 to $0.72. Roughly $0.03 came from better-than-expected fee revenue. We picked up a penny on the owned, leased line largely due to strong results in Tokyo. And $0.02 of outperformance came from favorable G&A, largely timely -- timing related. Our strong results were partially offset by roughly $0.03 of impairments recorded on the depreciation line.","With first quarter RevPAR growth at the high end of the range, better-than-expected incentive fees for the year and the addition of Delta, we increased our fee revenue outlook for 2015.","In North America, systemwide transient RevPAR rose 7%, with room rates up 5%. We successfully reduced the volume of special corporate business in favor of a greater volume of higher-rated retail business.","Group RevPAR in our full-service hotels in North America rose more than 5%, including 4% from higher room rates. Demand from smaller groups was particularly strong.","Systemwide RevPAR at our limited-service hotels in North America increased more than 8%. We saw strength in both transient and small group demand at Courtyard and greater short stay business at Residence Inn.","Looking across the markets. We saw double-digit RevPAR growth at our hotels in Boston, Tampa, Dallas, San Diego and San Francisco. Our systemwide RevPAR in New York declined 1% as a result of snowstorms, tough comparisons to last year's Super Bowl and continued limited-service supply growth. It was the only market of our top 20 in North America that showed a RevPAR decline.","Looking ahead, we expect North America systemwide RevPAR to increase 5% to 7% in the full year, with continued strong transient and group RevPAR. Our full-service hotel group booking pace for the remainder of 2015 is up roughly 4%.","You probably recall that the third quarter of 2014 benefited from shifting holidays and very strong group business. In 2015, group business in the third quarter will face these tough comparisons.","Outside North America, first quarter systemwide comparable RevPAR rose nearly 7% on a constant dollar basis, well ahead of our expectations. On an actual dollar basis, international RevPAR was flat year-over-year.","In the Caribbean and Latin America region, systemwide constant dollar RevPAR increased 6%, with strong performance in Mexico and at resorts and leisure destinations in the Caribbean. For the full year, we expect RevPAR will increase at a mid-single-digit rate, but a tough comparison to last year's World Cup in Brazil.","In Asia Pacific region, first quarter constant dollar systemwide RevPAR rose more than 6%, with particular strength in Japan and India and easy comps in Thailand. Systemwide RevPAR in Greater China increased modestly, reflecting strong results in Shanghai, but lower RevPAR in Hong Kong. We believe these Asia Pacific trends will continue, yielding full year RevPAR growth at a mid-single-digit rate for the region.","One of the best positive surprises in our first quarter was the 7% comparable hotel RevPAR growth in Europe. This growth was well ahead of our expectations due to strong attendance at group events in Germany and higher leisure business in London and Amsterdam. Room nights from U.S. travel to our European hotels increased 9% in the quarter.","Despite the strong first quarter, we expect a mid-single-digit growth rate for the full year. The economies of France and Russia are weak, and Central Europe comparisons get more difficult late in the year. Nevertheless, we still hope to see a strong U.S. summer tourist season in Europe.","In the Middle East and Africa, constant dollar RevPAR rose more than 9%, partially due to the improving political environment in Egypt and strong government and group business in Qatar. The full year, we expect a mid- to high single-digit constant dollar RevPAR growth.","The shift in the timing of Ramadan could result in very modest RevPAR growth in the second quarter and outsized gains in the third quarter.","Turning to margins. Cost profit margins at the company-operated hotels in North America increased 120 basis points. Utility costs declined and productivity improved. Worldwide house profit margins also increased 120 basis points.","Our house profit margins reflect the new accounting guidelines for the lodging industry, which requires service charges to be included in property revenue. Excluding the impact of this accounting change, we estimate our North America house profit margins would have improved 150 basis points in the first quarter.","Total fee revenue increased 18% in the quarter. Base fees rose 6%, reflecting higher managed hotel RevPAR and unit growth. Incentive fees increased 25%, with better-than-excepted results at Ritz-Carlton and Marriott Resorts in Florida and the Caribbean. In addition, roughly $3 million of the higher incentive fees were related to the timing of incentive fee recognition at one resort, and $2 million was related to a very strong performance at our North America limited-service hotels.","Worldwide, 48% of our managed hotels paid incentive fees in the quarter compared to 35% in the year-ago quarter. In North America alone, 35% of managed hotels paid incentive fees compared to 21% in the year-ago quarter.","Franchise fees increased 25% in the quarter. Roughly half of the increase was higher royalty payments associated with unit growth and RevPAR improvement. The remainder of the growth was due to higher relicensing fees associated with hotel transactions.","With a robust hotel resale market, we relicensed over 250 franchised hotels during the quarter. Typically, the new agreements reflect higher stabilized royalty rates than previously, and frequently include a commitment to make property improvements.","Owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses totaled $63 million in the quarter, 29% higher than the prior year, driven by $5 million from the Protea transaction and a favorable $3 million impact from expired leases.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $44 million in the quarter compared to $36 million in the prior year. The increase was largely due to the first quarter impairments, as I mentioned earlier.","General and administrative expenses declined in the quarter due to favorable litigation resolutions, partially offset by higher guarantee reserves.","Foreign exchange reduced our pretax income in the first quarter by roughly $4 million, largely in fee revenue. For the full year, we expect FX to reduce our pretax income by $20 million to $25 million. These amounts do not reflect the impact of exchange rates on travel trends.","For Marriott International, our adjusted operating profit margin in the first quarter increased from 42% to 48%. We repurchased 5.5 million shares during the quarter for approximately $431 million. Our average fully diluted share count in the quarter was 6.5% lower than in the prior year and nearly 25% lower than 5 years ago.","For the second quarter, we expect worldwide RevPAR to increase 5% to 7%. Our fee guidance for the second quarter includes roughly $4 million from the acquisition of Delta. Incentive fees are likely to be flat year-over-year in the second quarter. We continue to expect strong incentive fees from limited-service hotels in the quarter, but they are likely to be offset by the impact of full-service hotel renovations and a shift in timing in fee recognition at one resort that benefited the first quarter. Foreign exchange should also be a headwind. All in all, we expect incentive fees will grow at the mid-teens rate for the full year.","Our owned, leased and other results in the second quarter reflect property renovations and preopening expenses for the New York EDITION.","Turning to the full year, we expect worldwide RevPAR will increase 5% to 7% in 2015. Combined with unit growth and the acquisition of Delta Hotels, we expect our fee revenue will increase 10% to 12% to roughly $1.9 billion.","Our fee guidance for 2015 is up roughly $15 million from our last forecast. This reflects our very strong performance in the first quarter and the addition of Delta fees to our forecast, offset by roughly $10 million in weaker fees associated with delays in new property openings and foreign exchange.","Owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses should increase slightly year-over-year, reflecting higher credit card branding fees, offset by lower termination fees.","We expect depreciation and amortization to total roughly $150 million, including the $12 million of impairments booked in the first quarter and approximately $3 million of incremental amortization for the Delta transaction.","We expect our full year general and administrative expenses will decline to $635 million to $645 million, reflecting modestly higher core admin costs and the addition of expenses associated with Delta operations. These should be offset by the impact of favorable legal settlements, an easy comparison to the 2014 Bolivar revaluation, higher deferred development costs and a favorable impact on foreign exchange.","The G&A outlook does not include transition or transaction costs associated with the Delta acquisition.","All in all, we continue to expect fully diluted EPS will total $3.00 to $3.12 in 2015, an 18% to 23% increase from 2014. This includes the unfavorable $0.03 of impairment discussed earlier, which was not included in our previous full year guidance.","We expect adjusted EBITDA will increase 14% to 17% for 2015. Investment spending could total $600 million to $800 million, including about $140 million in maintenance spending and $135 million for the Delta acquisition. We will remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchase.","We expect to recycle roughly $650 million from asset sales and loan repayments during 2015, including the sale of the Miami Beach EDITION, the New York EDITION and a Courtyard in Paris, transactions which are already complete.","We expect to return at least $1.75 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends this year.","There are a lot of exciting things going on at Marriott. After investing north of $800 million to build 3 EDITION Hotels, and then successfully monetizing all 3, we are celebrating completion of these projects with the opening of our New York EDITION Hotel.","As many of you will be attending the New York University Hospitality Conference in early June, we are hosting tours and a reception for the investment community at the New York EDITION on the afternoon of June 2. Give Laura Pearce and investor relations a call or e-mail if you'd like to join us.","We appreciate your interest in Marriott. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Laurie, we'll take your calls now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Arne, you talked a lot about organic growth in your prepared remarks and how the breadth of your company's portfolio is a major driver of that growth. And you know that -- as you know, there's been increased discussion of M&A in the lodging sector and it's certainly taken on increased vigor now that Starwood announced their strategic view -- their strategic review, pardon me. Can you just help us understand the role Marriott plays in this M&A discussion?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, obviously, we've been reasonably active in the last 4 or 5 years in doing these smaller bolt-on acquisitions, probably starting first with AC Hotels, but then including Gaylord and Protea and, most recently, Delta in Canada. They all have some similarities in the sense that they are $100 million to $200 million transactions, something like that. On average, about 10x EBITDA, sometimes a little bit lower multiples than that. As a consequence, they turn out to be essentially flat on -- in first year results and accretive fairly quickly thereafter. And obviously, there's a decent arbitrage between our valuation and the valuation we're paying on those acquisitions.","But beyond that, each one of those also gives us an incremental platform for organic growth. And it is crystal clear that there is nothing like organic growth in this business. By and large, the strength of the brands delivers management and franchise contracts at very light capital costs, if any. And that provides essentially nearly infinite returns. And that's what we want to remain focused on.","We would love to do more deals if there are more deals in the market that meet those kinds of parameters.","Obviously, your question refers to Starwood and the strategic review announcement they have made yesterday. For obvious reasons, we won't talk a lot about that. But I think if you can compare the attributes of the deals I've just talked about are having done in the last few years, with the attributes that would be associated with a deal with somebody like them, you can see that there are quite profound differences between the deals that we've done and that hypothetical transaction.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's really helpful, I appreciate that. And then, just as a follow-up, we've seen a continued divergence in RevPAR growth for your select service hotels versus the full-service hotels. And clearly, that's a function of the cycle and the earlier recovery of the full-service hotels. But when you look at the RevPAR growth rates of those full-service hotels this point in this cycle, are there programs that you're employing to, perhaps, generate faster growth there as we progress?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I think the -- I think one of the things that's happening with those limited-service brands, particularly Courtyard, we've done -- a lot of capital has gone into our portfolio of hotels. And I think, Courtyard is just on a roll, for example. And it is always been a very strong brand, but its index is moving up with the capital that's gone in, and we think the brand is doing extremely well. And I think we've done things with the other C first brands as well, which had been a little different from brand to brand. But generally, has been ramping up renovations and ramping up new model rooms and marketing efforts, all of which, I think, are benefiting those brands.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just another way to ask a question. So I guess, how would you think about just theoretically sort of increasing your exposure to the luxury segment more when we're this late in the cycle? Is that -- if something were at the right price, and even though that's not what we've seen you do in terms of the last couple of transactions, do you have a view on, this late in the cycle, that, that would be something you would want to do? Or is it just that the period where you are in the cycle not impact that view?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. Obviously, it's less about cycle than it is about value, I think. And any transaction we do, we are going to be, in the first instance, focused on whether or not we're creating value for our shareholders. And that goes to questions about what multiple are we paying, what kind of upside is there post transaction, either because of cyclical factors or because of upside that we can deliver on either revenue or cost synergies.","I think there have been some questions not asked yet this morning about luxury RevPAR growth and whether the lighter numbers in luxury RevPAR growth are somehow a harbinger of weaker times to come. We don't believe that to be the case at all. The -- most of the luxury industry numbers, and to a significant extent, even our Ritz-Carlton performance in Q1 is driven mostly by the disproportionate distribution of luxury in New York. New York, as everybody on this call knows, I think, is the weakest RevPAR market in the United States today, and it has a substantial bit of the luxury product in the United States that impacts those numbers.","We see luxury as continuing to be a strong performer. We think the Ritz-Carlton brand is, obviously, an extraordinarily powerful brand.","But we also love what's happening with EDITION, which is a luxury boutique product, and Bulgari and JW Marriott, which is now, what, 75, 80 hotels, if I remember correctly, and growing very quickly. And we think the future for luxury is pretty bright.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe if I could just ask a clarification. Just to square, in your opening remarks, you made a comment that the change in supply growth is the one that triggers the cycle. But then, you also just kind of talked about the declines in New York, which seemed clearly driven by supply there, which is also going to continue next year as well. I guess, how to think about if it's -- just to square those 2 comments, I guess.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. I mean, I think New York is, obviously, gotten supply growth of, I don't know, 5% or so a year for the last 4 or 5 years. And I suspect we'll have supply growth in that range in the next couple of years. I don't think that means that the cycle is in -- is over in any respects. I think we'll see that demand continues to build for New York. New York has had too few hotel rooms, maybe take that with a grain of salt from a hotel person. But I think in many respects, New York has been a hard place to hold a meeting, its been a very expensive place to visit because there has not been enough capacity. And I think with the redevelopment of the West Side in Manhattan and with the strength of international inbound travel, New York will easily absorb this supply over time, and I think continue to perform very well. And so the comments on New York in no way suggests that that's a sign that the cycle is over, if you will. I think New York will continue to do well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Arne, in the prepared remarks, you mentioned an acceleration in unit growth in 2016. And I know it's still a little far out. But could you just give us a little bit more color on what's driving that? And I guess, would that be accelerating off of your sort of organic base of -- this year, which would be probably around 6% on a net basis?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. We're really talking there about organic growth, likely the openings pickup in 2016. And while not in the script, I suspect 2017 will be even better. I'm not going to give you a number yet today because we've still got planning to do. And we don't, obviously, every one of these deals is being done by a third party, essentially not us. So we are dependent on them for information. And to some extent, we guess on precisely the opening dates.","But I'll give you just the statistics that show why this is an obvious comment. Signings in the last 5 years, these are essentially organic signings. We signed a bit over 30,000 rooms in 2010; I've been over 40,000 rooms in 2011; I've been over 50 -- a bit under, excuse me, just under 50,000 rooms in 2012; almost 70,000 rooms in 2013; and excluding Protea, again, over 90,000 rooms in 2014.","Obviously, signings are an event which occurs 2 to 3 years maybe on average. 2.5 to 3 years, I suppose, would be a more narrow average before hotels open. And so as we get farther into this cycle, we'll see that the openings that are near certainty from the signings that we've done the last year will continue to step up.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's great. And then, my follow-up would be -- and I'm not sure if this for you, Arne, or for Carl. But you mentioned separately about the royalty rate and that there was a pretty significant number of hotels that were, I guess, relicensed during the quarter, and that your blended royalty rate on the new contracts, I think, was 5.8%. So my question is because I don't think we get clarity from our models exactly where your kind of existing average royalty rate is, what's the difference between those 2 numbers? And how much of it increasing on kind of a year-on-year basis?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, let me try this. And then, Carl, jump in if you want to add something different. The existing -- it's actually 2014, not first quarter of '15.","Carl T. Berquist","Right.","Arne M. Sorenson","But the 2014 numbers were 5 -- U.S. franchised hotels, 5.3% of rooms revenue, that was achieved. That is based on the royalty rates that then applied. And it would not be rare for the first year or 2 for there to be some ramping in royalty rates and maybe not get into a full royalty rate until the second year or the third year. It will depend a little bit by brand and the strength of that brand.","The other number we gave you was this 5.8% number. And essentially, that's a number that -- it's theoretical at this point, but essentially means that if the stated royalty rates that we now have in our franchised circulars applied to every hotel for each of those brands also in the U.S., we would achieve 5.8% of rooms revenue as our royalty rate. So in effect that difference of 50 basis points is the potential as the whole system renews or relicenses or signs to management contracts.","In all likelihood, it will be many, many, many years before you ever get to that because some hotels will, essentially, never sell. And so you are decades out maybe before you would get to renewals or something else of this sort.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Nomura Securities.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","A couple of quick follow-ups. Carl, you mentioned that the incentive management fees benefited from $2 million more in limited-service incentive management fees. Was that the Courtyard brand?","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, it includes the Courtyard brand. It's all on our select service brands combined. But Courtyard is a big player in that.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Yes, the reason I ask is that because of the significant renovation program at Courtyard through 2008, '09 to '10, your royalty rates or your IMF hurdles had to go up.","And so specific to the Courtyard brand, which is where there may have been over a $50 million shortfall in IMFs because of that higher royalty rate, how much closer to you are, are you today in achieving incentive management fees, where over the past, say, year, you really were much farther away?","Carl T. Berquist","Well, I think what you're seeing is more and more of our limited-service hotels that are starting to break through and earn incentive fees. I was just looking for the number here as to what percent of our select service hotels now earned -- I'll just get it here, give me a minute. I think it's 31% in the first quarter. And now, we compare to what last year, Betsy?","Betsy Dahm","13%.","Carl T. Berquist","13% last year. So you could see we're starting to see an acceleration of the managed select service hotels starting to pay.","Now, the caution I always give with that, that's hotels, that's not dollars as much. And so if they only paid $100 during that number, but nonetheless, with RevPAR growth that you're seeing in the limited-service area, that is causing us to break through those hurdles, and despite the fact that a lot of capital was put into the Courtyard brand in those previous years.","Laura E. Paugh","If I can add to that, Carl. At the peak of the last cycle, we made about $80 million on limited-service hotels at the bottom of the market. When things were so tough, it got down to about $5 million. Last year, we made about $20 million. So we've already seen a nice bounce off the bottom. And this year, we could do as much as $30 million to $35 million.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. That's the number that I was after, Laura.","And then, my second question had to do with the group pricing. You mentioned that it was up about 4%. But given the high occupancies that you're seeing in many of your group markets, why aren't your revenue managers getting even more aggressive on their future pricing?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I think they are. I mean, if you -- we didn't hang this out there in our prepared remarks. But if you look at bookings we did in the first quarter of '15, for the next 12 months, pricing -- room rates were up 6% and room nights were up 3%. So 9.5% of revenue growth for the bookings in the quarter for the next 12 months.","And when you look at the next 12 months, so essentially 2 years out, 13 to 24 months out, you've got about the same, 5.5% rate of growth and 3.5% room night growth. And so in fact, we are seeing that dynamic very much in play here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you just talk a little bit more about the international side of things, inbound international travel demand for U.S., Europe, given FX movements, so Europe to Europe or international into the U.S.?","And then, maybe on the development side, you had very, very positive things to say about India and the opportunity there. Can you talk about what you're seeing in China? Is it getting harder to develop there? Are you becoming a little bit more cautious given some of the dynamics we're seeing in some of the Tier 2, Tier 3 cities?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. The -- we look at our first quarter data. It's hard to get industry data that's real-time, so I think it would be a little while before we can get the industry data for the first quarter.","But somewhat surprisingly to me, we see inbound travel to the United States up 1% year-over-year. Now put this in context, international arrivals to the United States account for about 5% of the U.S. lodging business. I was a bit surprised not to see a bit more decline.","When we tried to drill into those numbers to see what was coming from Europe, we see Europe actually maybe minus 1% in terms of room nights, but essentially flattish, which is, again, it's better than I would have expected. I will confess that I've got maybe some cautionary language about whether that data is really hard and how precise we can be or how confident we can be about its accuracy.","To the extent it's right, and I think it's probably -- it's explained in part that the arrivals in Q1 are probably more business travel than they are leisure travel. And as we get to summer, we may see a bit more significant impact on that.","I suspect another thing that's happening here is we are seeing a relative strength in the developing world, probably offset a bit of the weakness in market -- coming out of markets like Europe. So stay tuned for that. But so far, we see kind of flattish performance, which we are encouraged by.","You look at China and -- I'd just to give you a couple of figures. The -- China was interesting. When you include Hong Kong in our China numbers, RevPAR for Q1 was up only 1.5%. If you exclude Hong Kong and look really only at main line -- mainland China, RevPAR was up 4.5%. All things considered, not bad. And with greater strength in markets like Shanghai, Beijing, not awful, but not as strong as that number. And then, in some markets in the south you've got a little bit more weakness driven probably more by supply than anything else.","So China is not, by any means, falling apart from an operational perspective. We continue to think we'll see mid-single-digits kind of RevPAR growth from mainland China for the year as a whole.","Food and beverage performance is a little bit ahead of that actually, so that's encouraging.","On the development side, I suspect we'll sign fewer deals in China this year than we signed last year. I think we will see that our real estate partners in China will be a bit more cautious because of the relative health of the residential market, particularly in a number of cities in China. And that may have some impact on openings a few years from now. It may cause a little bit of delay on the hotels that are under development, but the hotels that are under construction should still perform well. And we continue to remain pretty bullish that this is a patch that China will get through, and will return to probably pretty healthy growth at some point in time in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So focusing on Europe a little bit. You stated in your prepared remarks that your penetration or your market share of worldwide rooms has earned 4.5%. But I believe your exposure in Europe is anywhere from 1 -- maybe even less than 1% to 2%, depending on kind of data sources you use.","So you have this history of doing kind of bolt-on acquisitions to kind of grow your presence in markets like the Protea deal in Africa, can you just talk about that in the context of Europe? And is anything different about Europe than other markets that could -- that impact your decision?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. I mean, we did one deal with AC. And I think that was 2010, Carl?","Carl T. Berquist","2011.","Arne M. Sorenson","Which was a -- one of these bolt-on acquisitions which I've talked about a bit ago. That was initially, by us, viewed primarily as a way to get into Spain with a very high quality of portfolios that Antonio Catal\u00e1n had developed. And only later did we think about that as being a platform for growth in the United States and other markets in the world -- around the world, which we, of course, since launched. And that has gone fabulously well.","We could have 100 ACs in the development pipeline in the United States by the end of the year. Our developers may shudder to hear me say that because it puts some pressure on them. But it does -- the brand is doing extremely well.","When you look across Europe as a whole though, there aren't many brands like them. There aren't many portfolios like that. You still have 65% to 70% maybe of all hotel rooms in Europe which are unbranded. And often, they are sort of true independence that are smaller, that are harder to convert.","The Autograph brand has been one of the tools we've used to go after hotels like that, and we've succeeded really well with that. And I think as we look over the next foreseeable future, we think that with Autograph, with Moxy, with retrofitting towards the European market Courtyard and Residence Inn, we've got brands that should set us up for accelerated organic growth across Europe. And by mentioning those brands, I don't mean to take anything away from Ritz-Carlton, and Marriott and Renaissance, that we think will continue to grow.","But we will not see a lot of new build full-service development in most European markets, at least not to the point of opening, I think, for still a good number of years. And so the opportunities are likely to be more in that -- those initial limited-service brands.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then, for my follow-up, just kind of switching topics altogether. But you -- so I don't know what you call it, it's -- one of the lodging REITs talked about kind of the new 24-hour cancellation policies. I think you're leading the charge there. Can you just talk about what type of opportunity that is? And is that something that everyone needs to get on board to kind of work? Or is it something that just the larger guys can start pushing in and it will work?","Arne M. Sorenson","I would -- I actually say, we're not leading the charge there. We probably were the last one to the party. I can't say that without exception. But I think many of our principal competitors had already had in place a longer cancellation window than we had. Our cancellation window until first of this year roughly, I don't remember precisely the day it went effective, was 6:00 PM the night of your stay, which just actually means you can cancel until the absolute last minute.","And particularly in a high occupancy market, that created greater risk of overbooking. And hard to predict -- harder to predict, harder to revenue manage the hotels. And so we followed most of our principal competitors and went to a 24-hour cancellation, which really means midnight the night before day of arrival.","I believe most of the industry is now at 24 hours or longer. And whether that continues to move or not, we'll have to see how that develops.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Joel H. Simkins - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two quick questions. I guess, the first would be, Arne, you've seen some peers jump into the hotel collection segment a little bit more aggressively. How do you continue to think about Autograph, given that you've got that up to roughly 80-plus hotels? Is this a several hundred unit opportunity over time?","And then, just a second follow-up on the development front. One of your large competitors continues to sort of think about a new way to solve for economy or a really pure mid-scale lodging. Is this something you guys continue to evaluate as well?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I am not sure if I understand the second question, but let me just start with the first and maybe I can ask you to rephrase the second.","Autograph, we think it's still got great momentum. So we're at 80-ish today. I'm sure it's in the -- in our release, the precise number here some place. Autograph, 46 plus 35, so 81. And we continue to sign deals. I think the track record -- we've hung out some of the statistics on the RevPAR increases that have occurred 2 years out and 1 year out from conversion. Those were total RevPAR growth numbers. But if you look at RevPAR index numbers, and we're seeing double-digit increase in index for Autograph hotels after they have joined the Marriott portfolio.","I think, in the pipeline, we've got another 40 or so Autograph hotels. So there -- that's good growth, well through the 100 mark. And I don't see any reason why that should slow. I think, in fact, as the track record continues to perform well and broadens, we'll see more and more folks that step in.","And the fact that other competitors are getting into this space is, I guess, we're flattered by. Hopefully, we'll be able to continue to sell our track record, which we'll be that much further ahead because we've been doing it longer.","And what was the second question?","Joel H. Simkins - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I think the second question is really, I think, you have helped in some other folks looking at ways to sort of solve for a new franchising concept within pure, really, economy. I wouldn't say Moxy. It's certainly not a C [ph] or really, economy. It is a more upper mid-scale or upscale. But is there a way to kind of reimagine pure economy lodging as a starter entry point?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. I don't see us going -- and we've got Fairfield, obviously, which is 800 or 900 hotels, I suppose, today.","And Moxy, we're moving on now with tremendous speed. Moxy will be a smaller room than Fairfield. Obviously, more of a lifestyle design. But I think, rate-wise, it will trade -- in part because it's more urban, the rate will be higher than Fairfield. I think that we have ultimately put in the books. But there aren't that many Fairfields in urban markets, and so to some extent, that's a little bit of an unfair comparison.","I don't see us, in the near-term, trying to do something beneath that level. We've looked at it for many decades. You've obviously got some brands out there that are of size. By and large, because the rates and RevPAR are low in those markets, it's really hard to make much money as a franchisor without owning the real estate. And you're -- so you're really working hard for a very small return. And it probably doesn't do that much for the brand portfolio strength either.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Greff of JP Morgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have 2 questions. One relates to your comment about looking at next year and expecting to see an acceleration in organic unit growth. It's because if we were to remove the word organic, would you still make that comment?","And then, when you think about that organic unit growth next year, is there a big difference in terms of the brand and the geographies driving that growth relative to what you were expecting for '15 and last year? And then, I have another question.","Arne M. Sorenson","That sounds like 3, Joe. The first question, when you say if you remove the word organic, I think all that implies is will we increase our growth enough to offset Delta, which is 10,000 rooms this year. It's obviously the only thing that we have that is predictable. And that's getting a little too precise for us at this point in time.","It might -- it may well be that organic growth grows by more than 10,000 rooms, openings between '15 and '16. But bear with us a few quarters until we can really do the ground up work that we need to in order to give you a number for '16 that is a bit more reliable. Second question.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, that's the second question. But I also was asking the brand and geographies that are driving that organic unit growth next year relative to this year and last year. Is there much of a difference?","Arne M. Sorenson","Shouldn't be much of a difference. I suspect we'll continue to see good openings in the United States in the 50%, 55% range, but good growth internationally as well.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then, with regard to your comments about the royalty rate opportunity, I get that. But on average, how many franchise rooms come up for renewal or relicensing?","Carl T. Berquist","We had 240 franchised hotels relicensed, I guess, in the first quarter, was it? Yes. So what you see, Joe, is a lot of the big portfolios may trade. And in fact, those numbers are because a couple of big portfolios traded. But there is, especially with a real estate market, the way it is today, you're seeing hotels changing hands, and that drives a lot of the relicensing, which goes to the new rate. It also results in property improvement program where you'll get capital put into the property.","Laura E. Paugh","And you've got a growing number of new hotels that are opening that are coming in at the higher rates.","Carl T. Berquist","Right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research Company.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Company","My first question is on the upper upscale full-service category, just in general. Could you talk a little bit about the Marriott brand, specifically in North America, and what's the opportunity for that brand over the next few years? Have you been pleased with its performance and market share? Then, I guess, is bigger box, full-service an area where you can or even want to affect change and consider investing more resources?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I -- we've got great work underway with the Marriott brand. And we've had, obviously, more visible growth in the biggest boxes, whether that be the Gaylord hotels we've added or some big Marriotts that we've added.","So we've opened, obviously, the Marriott Marquis in D.C. last year. We opened a big, a 1,000-room JW Marriott in Austin during this first quarter of 2015. And we've got a number of those big boxes that are in the development pipeline and well under construction. So we'll be opening over the course of the next few years.","I think the biggest convention center hotels are strong performers. To some extent, they are protected from cyclicality because of the long-term nature of much of their group business. They are quite profitable. Obviously, we are working constantly to make sure we are balanced in our delivery of great guest services and deliver of high profitability to our owners. And we will continue to be focused on that. I think -- but I think that, by and large, is a easier set of questions in some respects than the smaller, if you will, 300 to 500-room full-service hotels.","There, I think, we've got to make sure that we get the capital into the hotels. And particularly in urban markets, there is a challenge on profitability around food and beverage, particularly if it depends on restaurants as opposed to group catering. And so we continue to look at ways of dealing with that. How do you provide simplicity around room service, with good profitability enhancement? What's the right approach to lobbies and to restaurants? To what extent do you outsource restaurants? Those sorts of questions, I think, continue to look -- take time from our operating team. And I think they have made good progress with it.","I think when you look at the RevPAR numbers, we're quite pleased with what we've accomplished with MHR. You'll note in our first quarter that the full-service RevPAR numbers were a bit lower than the limited-service RevPAR numbers. There are some reasons for that. But one that, I think, is probably worth noting, we have been aggressive in calling out contract business from our full-service hotels. Think of airline crews as maybe the primary example of that. Contract business can often be at a significant discount to the average rate in a full-service hotel. Because of the way occupancy is moving, we have pushed that business out of many of our Marriott hotels, in the first quarter particularly, given seasonality. That costs us a little bit in terms of RevPAR in higher demand quarters, like the second and third quarter particularly. We'll see that, that business gets replaced by rack rate business and it will be pretty powerful in driving better performance. And so those are signs of strength, I think, that should perform well for the full-service brands.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Company","Great. And then, just quickly on the fee guidance. You guys are now looking for 10% to 12% growth. You took it up to $15 million, and then called out the $10 million headwind from delays in FX. So really, a $25 million raise.","Your improved incentive fee outlook seems to account for about $10 million of that. So could you help me with the last $15 million? Is it core growth? And how much of that maybe is Delta added in?","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. Well, when you look at it, Delta fees would be in there, as well as the RevPAR growth in the second quarter -- or for the full year, I guess, is what you were looking at. Delta is about $12 million in the full year number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nikhil Bhalla of FBR.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just shifting back to the focus to domestic a little bit here. Washington, D.C., I wanted to kind of get your sense of what was going on in 1Q? It looked like the downturn market maybe was a little bit softer compared to the D.C. Metro. And just your outlook for the balance of the year, what do you think about D.C.?","And the final question I have there is what's -- if you could just remind us, what is the percentage of D.C. and New York as opposed to fees today?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I've got both of those spends. The -- you're right, downtown was modestly negative in Q1 and suburban was modestly positive. Those are for managed hotels, which tend to skew more full-service.","If we look at our systemwide, which includes a lot of limited-service hotels, we end up with sort of mid-single-digit positive for the Greater Washington, D.C. markets. So all things considered, not bad. A bit lower certainly than our average for the United States, but not a train wreck.","And I think we'll see Q2 be better than Q1 maybe by a couple of points. I think that is driven as much by group dynamic as anything else. I don't have for you anything for Q3 and Q4. Although my guess is that for the year as a whole, we ought to see the same kind of performance that we saw in the first quarter.","You're looking at 2016. I think, if I remember correctly, the group bookings for the city as a whole are reasonably good for 2016. On the other side, it's -- it will be an election year. And in election years, transient business tends to leave Washington to follow potential candidates as they hit the stands.","Mix, 4% to 5% of fees come out of D.C., and 4% to 4.5% come out of New York.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. If I may just a quick follow-up question on government travel and government business. We knew that a couple of years ago that business was seeing significant headwinds. What are you seeing in that business now?","Arne M. Sorenson","We're seeing, actually, some growth in government business. I think we're coming out of that trough, which probably was the most severe in 2012 or 2013. I would think we're probably up in the high single-digits now. Remember, government business is not a huge piece, particularly to full-service hotels anymore. But we're building from that significantly lower based than we would have had many years before.","Carl T. Berquist","So in 2014, government group made up about 1.5% of our full-service group business, to give you...","Arne M. Sorenson","That's group.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, that's group.","And on transient, I think, I don't have the transient.","Laura E. Paugh","In total, it's about 4% of management.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, total is 4%.","Laura E. Paugh","It used to be around 7%. So it has not come back as -- it has not come back completely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Loeb of Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about Delta and where you see that fitting in, in the U.S. and globally? What -- basically, what's your thought about the brand positioning there?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I think maybe it's simplest to compare it to a couple of other brands. I think -- look at DoubleTree and look at Sheraton, these are -- they're different brands one from another. But they are full-service hotels with -- good quality hotels, but maybe with a little less stringency in the capital requirements for conversion that we might apply for the Marriott brand, for example, or the Renaissance brand. And they've been -- could be a good conversion vehicle for us. We'll see how that goes. As we talked about Delta, obviously, up front, we thought the value associated with that transaction for what we were getting in Canada was quite strong. And we're quite pleased with that, even without any growth, but we think we'll have some growth that will deliver some good upside.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then, just if I could follow on, generally on franchising. You guys have been a little more open about franchising even your higher end brands. And I wonder if you had anything to say about the announcement not from you guys, but from, I guess, from an owner that the Ritz-Carlton Chicago will be going from Four Seasons management to a franchised member of Marriott's system. That's the first time a Ritz has been franchised, right?","Arne M. Sorenson","That is, I believe -- no, we have a Ritz-Carlton in Montr\u00e9al that has been franchised for many years, and I'm not exactly sure for the historic reasons for that one.","Chicago has been one of those bizarre anomalies where the Ritz-Carlton in Chicago has always been part of the Four Seasons Hotel Company. And I think in part because of that history, it is now joining, in a real way, the Ritz-Carlton system, but we've never run the hotel. And this was a deal that seemed to be the best deal that worked for the owner and for us.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Does it give you free access to telemarking? [indiscernible]...","Arne M. Sorenson","I don't think it's a -- likely to be much of a precedent.","I talked over you, David, sorry. What did I miss?","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. I'm sorry to interrupt you. Does it give you free access to that brand in the Chicago market now?","Arne M. Sorenson","The Ritz-Carlton Chicago will be our Ritz-Carlton in Downtown Chicago. It will be part of our system.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You mentioned a potential slowdown in Texas and North Dakota developments. What is the exposure for Marriott of the 240,000-rooms currently in the pipeline?","Arne M. Sorenson","I don't know. It wouldn't be significant. We'll get that for you if you wouldn't mind calling back in. But I'm sure it's quite insignificant.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James & Associates.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Arne, you guys have done Gaylord, AC, Protea, Moxy. Delta. How many more similar situations internationally or in the U.S. have, I guess, your team identified that you might pursue?","Arne M. Sorenson","That's a very artful way of putting that question. I wish there were more. And I wish we could sit here and tell you that we've got a stable of -- a handful of these things that are just waiting to be done at good value-enhancing terms. But I don't think that would be fair. We obviously keep our eyes open and look around. And we've got teams spread around the world that are doing their best to observe the opportunities.","There are not that many, and there are even fewer that ever become available on the market. And most of these deals that we've done, we were approached by the seller in effect and encouraged to take a look at. And we don't have anything like that we can talk about now.","But again, as we've said before, we'd love to do more of these deals if there were more.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, the follow-up real quick is we heard yesterday from Starwood and they're trying to fix a number of things, including the relationship that they have with the owners. And we've recently seen some of their higher profile assets change flags. Do you sense an opportunity here to increase the number of conversions by taking advantage of maybe some challenges with other brands?","Arne M. Sorenson","We are -- we, obviously -- I don't know what our conversion number was in Q1.","Laura E. Paugh","It was 20%.","Arne M. Sorenson","20%. And we, obviously, are always interested in converting the right assets if the owner has the right to convert, and if they work from a product perspective for our brands. And we'll continue to look at whatever opportunities come to us if they meet those terms.","Okay. Laurie, anything else?","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Baird & Co., Inc.","Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Marriott International Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During our presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will open the call for your questions.","It is now my pleasure to hand our program over to Arne Sorenson, President and CEO of Marriott International. Sir, you may begin.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","Let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued yesterday, along with our comments, are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold.","In our discussion today, we will talk about results excluding merger-related costs, and we'll compare 2017 results to prior year combined results which assume Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business were completed on January 1, 2015. Of course, comparisons to our prior year reported results are in the press release, which you can find along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","So, let's get started. This has been an eventful quarter, from Hurricane Harvey and its historic flooding in Texas, to hurricanes Irma and Maria and their relentless pounding of the Caribbean, Florida and parts of the southeast, to two earthquakes in Mexico and then the devastating fires in Northern California, all within a quick seven-week period. We have a presence in these communities, and our crisis management and property teams have worked tirelessly to ensure associate, guest and property safety.","Not only have these events damaged property and upended lives, they have also impacted local economies, many of which are very dependent on tourism. As these areas repair, rebuild and recover, we encourage you to support their efforts. One Sonoma restaurant owner recently said to a New York Times reporter, there are so many people who want to do something. The most important thing we can do is to tell people we're open, we're here and we want them to come.","So, let's talk about our quarter and the trends we are seeing in the business. Worldwide, system-wide RevPAR rose 2.1%, just above the high end of our worldwide RevPAR guidance. In North America, system-wide comparable hotel RevPAR increased 0.4% in the third quarter, a bit better than our roughly flat guidance in part due to the favorable RevPAR impact from the hurricanes. In the third quarter, leisure demand was strong and association group business was better than expected. While corporate, group and transient demand remains cautious, we've seen few cancellations, little attrition, and our funnel of new but unsigned group bookings is improving.","Combined, the shifting Jewish holidays, the tough comparisons to last year's political conventions, and the day of the week shift in the July 4th holiday reduced our third quarter North American system-wide RevPAR growth by about 100 basis points, while the disruption associated with hurricanes Harvey and Irma increased North American RevPAR by about 25 basis points. Five hotels remain closed in Florida and another five are closed in Texas.","In the third quarter, the Caribbean and Latin America region experienced two major earthquakes, three tropical storms and four hurricanes. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were particularly hard hit. As a result of these efforts \u2013 events, we no longer include 18 properties in this region in our comp set for purposes of calculating RevPAR performance. We're excluding eight hotels because they have sustained severe damage and are taking few guests, and we are removing 10 properties because they are closed. For the revised comp set, system-wide comparable RevPAR increased 2% in the quarter largely due to solid RevPAR growth in Central America and better demand in Argentina.","Third quarter RevPAR was flat in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting higher RevPAR in Egypt, moderate growth in South Africa, and an 8% RevPAR decline in the Middle East. Sanctions on Qatar have reduced travel into and out of that country while weak oil prices and lower government spending have constrained RevPAR growth in other Middle East markets.","In the Asia-Pacific region constant dollar systemwide RevPAR rose 8% exceeding our expectations largely due to strong leisure demand. Comparable hotel RevPAR in Greater China increased nearly 11% driven by strong GDP growth, while RevPAR in India rose 7%. The strength in the China economy is being felt outside that country as well, where room nights sold to Mainland China travelers increased nearly 20% in the third quarter.","In Europe third quarter RevPAR rose nearly 9% with strong leisure demand in Spain and Italy, and great fare (05: 59) business in Germany. Room nights sold to U.S. travelers visiting our hotels in Europe increased 11% in the quarter. Istanbul continues to recover with strong Middle East demand on easy comps.","For the fourth quarter we expect RevPAR will increase 2% to 3% in North America as we benefit from the holiday shift and continued hurricane-related demand in Texas and Florida. North America group pace is up 5% for the quarter. For international markets, we expect RevPAR will grow 3% to 5% and worldwide we expect RevPAR will increase 2% to 3% in the fourth quarter. With the benefit of the third quarter's actual RevPAR and expected fourth quarter performance, we now expect full year 2017 worldwide systemwide RevPAR to grow 2% to 3%, up from 1% to 3% a quarter ago.","We are only partway through our budget process for the upcoming year, but the early indications are that 2018 RevPAR growth will be similar to growth expected for full year 2017. In North America, we expect special corporate rates currently in negotiation will increase at a low single-digit rate, and in the absence of accelerated economic growth, special corporate volume for comparable customers is likely to be flat.","Government per diems for 2018 vary considerably by market, but overall in the U.S. should rise 3% to 4%. Today's 2018 group revenue booking pace for our full-service hotels in North America is up nearly 2% and we believe that is a fair estimate of how group will perform. Assuming continued cautious corporate demand, we expect 2018 North American RevPAR will be flat to up 2% largely driven by room rates and slightly stronger in full service than in select service.","For those of you who are modeling quarter-to-quarter RevPAR performance, recall that 2018 first quarter lodging demand will have tough comparisons from the 2017 inauguration and women's march in Washington, D.C. and an earlier Easter and Passover in 2018. For our international markets, we expect RevPAR will increase 3% to 5% in 2018 with strong mid-single-digit growth expected in the Asia-Pacific region, low single-digit growth in Europe, Caribbean and Latin America regions, and slightly positive RevPAR growth in the Middle East, Africa region. This should yield worldwide systemwide RevPAR growth of 1% to 3%.","Turning to development, in the third quarter our worldwide development pipeline reached a record 450,000 rooms, which is 36% of our current system size, and worldwide room openings totaled 23,000 rooms, a new single quarter record. Our brands continue to be preferred by developers and lenders alike. Based on STR industry pipeline data, our brands continue to represent a leading 35% of hotels under construction in the U.S. and one in four hotels under construction worldwide. With eight leading brands, our worldwide pipeline of luxury rooms totaled nearly 50,000 at quarter end or more than 40% of our current distribution. In the third quarter alone, we signed or approved seven new luxury projects including the new Luxury Collection Hotel in Japan, a Ritz-Carlton resort in St. Lucia and an EDITION hotel in Arizona. Our worldwide pipeline of upper upscale rooms totals 132,000 with about half located in the Asia-Pacific region. The Marriott Hotels and Sheraton brands are particularly strong in Asia, while the Autograph and Delta brands are building a meaningful conversion pipeline in North America.","Worldwide, our limited service pipeline totals 270,000 rooms with growing interest from owners and franchisees around the world. Five years ago, only one-quarter of our pipeline outside North America consisted of limited service rooms. Today, such rooms represent over 40% of our international pipeline. In the last 12 months, Marriott's gross room additions totaled 6.6% and deletions were 1.1%. New hotel signings remain strong, and our pipeline has grown 7% in that same period. We are not seeing project cancellations or any hesitancy to sign new deals, but shortages of skilled tradesmen, contractors, and subcontractors are delaying openings. This is particularly true of high-value, complex projects such as dual-branded hotels, urban properties, high rises, and large custom projects. Today, these non-prototype projects make up over half of our limited service openings in the U.S.","Looking ahead, we believe the high demand for construction talent in hurricane, fire, and earthquake-damaged areas, continued political disruptions in the Middle East, and a growing proportion of complex limited service projects in the U.S. could further lengthen average construction periods by a few months. Despite these issues, we believe our leading 1.2 million room worldwide system will grow by nearly 7% gross in 2017 and roughly 7% gross in 2018.","As you may recall, we have typically deleted about 1% of rooms each year. Today, we are estimating deletions across our entire portfolio will total 1% to 1.5% in both 2017 and 2018. This unusual level of deletions is largely related to the Sheraton brand. We expect 6,000 Sheraton rooms will exit the system in 2017 with another 4,000 rooms departing in 2018.","We have launched a full-court press to improve the Sheraton brand. We are working to increase accountability, quality assurance, and capital investments while applying Marriott's systems and programs to drive the top line and reduce costs. These are still early days, but we believe we are making real progress and owners are noticing. In fact, we signed 3,500 new Sheraton rooms in the last 12 months alone, with representation from all of the continents.","We've never been more optimistic about our business, our underlying competitive strengths and our long-term growth potential. The Starwood integration is on track. We have identified more synergies and more business opportunities than we anticipated. We continue to believe we will achieve $250 million of G&A savings and expect to do that in 2018 and we continue to improve our products, services, and systems to enhance the value of every room night.","To tell you more about the quarter, I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny Oberg. Leeny?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you, Arne. For the third quarter of 2017, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.10, roughly $0.12 ahead of the midpoint of our RevPAR guidance $0.96 to $0.99. On the fee line, we picked up about $0.02 of outperformance with about half due to better than expected hotel results and half due to better re-licensing and branding fees. Our owned, leased, and other line outperformed by $0.03 with about half from purchase accounting revisions for the Starwood acquisition with the remainder from strong hotel performance and higher-than-expected termination fees.","G&A was $0.03 better-than-expected, sourced roughly equally from a tax credit, favorable purchase accounting revisions, and timing. Our gain line was about $0.01 better than expected due to a transfer tax settlement. And finally, taxes were about $0.03 better than guidance due to greater tax benefits related to stock compensation.","Compared to the prior year, total fee revenue was $831 million, 8% over the prior year, and 2% ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. Base fees increased 1% over the prior year, driven by unit growth and RevPAR improvement and offset somewhat by negative foreign exchange impact and the impact of terminations and contract changes.","Franchise fees increased 13% in the quarter, reflecting unit growth, higher RevPAR, and growth in non-property fees. These non-property fees include application fees, re-licensing fees, and fees from our timeshare, credit card, and residential businesses which together totaled over $105 million in the quarter, 24% higher than the prior year. We expect these fees will grow roughly 20% in the full year 2017 from $350 million to over $420 million.","Incentive fees increased 7% year-over-year in the third quarter, largely due to strong managed full-service hotel RevPAR in Europe and Asia, and good margin performance at company-operated hotels around the world. Global house profit margins at company-operated hotels improved 40 basis points during the quarter. Hotels continue to benefit from synergies associated with the Starwood acquisition, including OTA and procurement savings, revenue management improvements, benchmarking initiatives, savings on maintenance agreements, and insurance savings. Our hotels are also benefiting from a 10 basis points reduction in our centralized charge-out rate for our loyalty program, and we expect to reduce such charges by another 10 basis points beginning in 2018. We expect additional property cost savings as integration proceeds.","Adjusted owned, leased, and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $94 million in the third quarter compared to $116 million in the prior year. Since the beginning of the 2016 third quarter, we've sold five hotels, in each case retaining long-term management agreements. These properties contributed $15 million in profits in the 2016 third quarter, making a tough comparison for third quarter 2017.","Growth in the 2017 quarter was also depressed by the tough comparisons to the 2016 Olympics in Brazil, weak results in New York, and renovations at two leased hotels in Europe. Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of expenses, was $19 million better than expected due to $9 million of favorable purchase price adjustment, as well as higher-than-expected termination fees and better-than-expected results at hotels in Canada.","Adjusted depreciation and amortization totaled $70 million in the quarter compared to $81 million in the 2016 third quarter. The decline was largely due to the impact of hotels that we sold or moved to assets held for sale. Adjusted general and administrative expenses totaled $201 million in the third quarter, a $36 million decline from the prior year, largely reflecting continued cost reductions as the integration continues. Compared to our expectations, G&A was $17 million better than the midpoint of our guidance due to a $6 million state tax credit, a favorable $4 million of purchase accounting revisions, and timing.","In total, purchase accounting revisions in the adjusted third quarter income statement totaled a net favorable $16 million pre-tax. These represent the income statement impact of the final adjustments to the fair value of assets and liabilities, which we acquired in the Starwood deal. Congratulations and a big thank you to the finance team, who has worked tirelessly on this since completing the acquisition a year ago.","Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 7% over combined adjusted EBITDA in the prior year. The 2016 quarter included $15 million from owned assets that we have since sold.","For the fourth quarter, we expect fee revenue will total $825 million to $835 million on higher RevPAR, unit growth, and margin improvement. The 20 hotels that are closed due to the storms earned $2 million in fees in the fourth quarter in 2016 and $12 million in fees for the full year 2016. We expect owned, leased, and other, net of direct expense, will total roughly $90 million in the fourth quarter compared to $109 million in the year ago quarter. Profits in the 2016 fourth quarter included $21 million from four hotels that have since been sold.","Last month, we announced an agreement to sell Avendra, a leading North American hospitality procurement services provider. Avendra has been a terrific success and we believe the combination with Aramark should further increase scale and drive even better results to our hotels. We expect to receive roughly $650 million at closing for our 55% share of Avendra and such proceeds will be invested for the benefit of our system of hotels. We're currently developing these investment plans and will disclose amounts as they are spent. When the Avendra transaction closes, we will likely record a meaningful gain on the sale, but we expect to back out the gain from our adjusted EBITDA as a special item.","Assuming no gain in the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter diluted EPS will total $0.98 to $1, and adjusted EBITDA will increase 1% to 3% to reach $762 million to $777 million. This is a bit lower than the implied guidance at the end of the second quarter, largely due to delays in G&A spend, the impact of the sale of the Toronto Sheraton, and lower depreciation associated with reimbursed costs. The fourth quarter of 2016 included $21 million in EBITDA related to assets that have since been sold, as well as an $8 million favorable litigation settlement.","For the full year 2017, we expect adjusted diluted EPS will total $4.22 to $4.24, an increase of 28% over prior year combined results and we expected adjusted EBITDA will total $3.18 billion to $3.19 billion, an increase of 6% to 7% over 2016. Since the beginning of 2016, we've sold nine hotels, in each case retaining a long-term management agreement. These properties contributed roughly $90 million in owned lease profits in fiscal 2016 compared to $45 million expected for the full year 2017. Our 2017 outlook does not include any impact from the ongoing renegotiation of our credit card agreements with JPMorgan Chase and American Express. We expect to finalize our credit card negotiations by year-end or shortly thereafter, and won't likely be able to estimate the P&L impact to Marriott until early 2018.","We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investment and share repurchase. 2017 investment spending could total $550 million to $650 million, including about $175 million in maintenance spending.","We've already recycled more than $1.1 billion of assets since closing the Starwood acquisition, including the sale of the Sheraton Toronto for roughly $270 million and the receipt of a $65 million loan repayment early in the fourth quarter. We remain comfortable with our estimate of $1.5 billion of asset recycling proceeds since the closing of the Starwood acquisition to year-end 2018, but expect few additional proceeds will be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. With our success in asset recycling, we've already returned over $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through last week, and expect we will approach a record $3.5 billion returned to shareholders for the full year.","Compared to our expectations we discussed last quarter, our cash return to shareholder has increased due to roughly $350 million of incremental asset recycling, higher EBITDA levered appropriately, lower and a bit later capital spending, and higher working capital, including the impact from growth in our loyalty programs. The higher cash return is not related to the expected cash from the sale of Avendra. At September 30, 2017, our common shares outstanding totaled 366.4 million shares, 6.2% lower than the prior year amount. Our balance sheet is in great shape. Excluding merger-related costs, our debt ratio on September 30 was at the low end of our targeted credit standard of 3 times to 3.5 times adjusted debt to combined adjusted EBITDAR.","As we typically do in our third quarter release, we've provided our preliminary view of 2018 RevPAR and unit growth today. Our hotels' budgets are not yet complete and we're still quantifying the impact of FASB's new revenue recognition rules, which will be effective at the beginning of 2018. You'll find a general overview of the new rules described in our third quarter 10-Q that we plan to file later today or tomorrow. Bottom line, this is an accounting change. It doesn't impact cash or the economics of our business. We expect to release fourth quarter and full-year results mid-February, and will work to provide 2017 results by quarter under the new revenue recognition rules as soon as possible thereafter.","As you know, it's our practice to provide fulsome guidance for each upcoming quarter and current year. Given our continued finance integration efforts and the work to present 2017 results under the new rules, we expect our first quarter 2018 earnings guidance is likely to be a bit less detailed than usual. We appreciate your patience.","So that we can speak to as many of you as possible on today's call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Harry, how are you?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, Harry.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hi, fine. Good morning, everyone. My question is how can Marriott respond to the increase in pricing transparency apps, like Yapta and Tingo, particularly with respect to close-end bookings? To what degree is it impacting your ability to price higher than, say, the low single digits in an environment where GDP is actually beginning to accelerate? Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, it's a good question, Harry. I think, the \u2013 we obviously are taking a very careful look at the continued evolution of a number of these apps, and obviously, we live in a world with radical transparency in pricing, where prices are available for essentially every hotel at an instant notice. We are doing everything we can. I mean, obviously, the core platform for us is the loyalty program, and we continue to see that the room nights coming from our loyalty program are continuing to increase, approaching 55%, I think, across the world today. And that's a powerful thing. Obviously, some of these other booking platforms are not conducive to loyalty members, because they will not earn points associated with them.","I think beyond that, steps around the redemption formulas for the loyalty programs, which we want to continue to adjust, we've already made some changes so that hotel owners have less incentive to drop rates at the last minute in order to meet the high occupancy redemption formulas that exist, or historically have existed both in our platform and in many of our competitors' platforms. I think similarly that the extended cancellation window of 48 hours, which we put in place a few months ago, is another thing which deals with overbooking risks, but also to some extent addresses this last minute \u2013 these last-minute booking trends. But stay tuned on this. This is something that will continue to evolve, I think, in the quarters and probably years ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from \u2013 I'm sorry, go ahead.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","I'm sorry, I appreciate it. I was just distracted.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Okay, no worries. Go ahead, Paula.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks. I know it's only one question, so I'm sort of torn, I wanted to ask a little more about that group pace 2%, whether that was a volume and price combined, but if I only get one question, I will go with the \u2013 I saw the increase in your capital return, and I know in the opening comments you mentioned some of it had to do with extra $350 million in recycled proceeds, but just given that your outlook for 2018 is sort of very consistent with your outlook for 2017, so given there's not a big change in the outlook, it was a bit step-up in capital. Was there anything else behind that? Was it a decision kind of not to do something else? Or \u2013 just wanted to get more color on that.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Robin, just because we like you so much, we'll answer the second question that you very artfully asked, which is...","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","I threw in there, yeah.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","A 100% of the group revenue increase next year is ADR driven, not occupancy driven. But Leeny will talk about that.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","So, thanks, Robin. So, couple things. This is definitely solely a function that \u2013 repurchase this year of the results kind of turning out the way they are. This is not a function of something that we're looking out and seeing in 2018. I will say, to your point, in 2018, to remember that part of this really record high level of share repurchase this year is due because we weren't able to bring back (29: 11) roughly $500 million of cash as part of the Starwood acquisition that was sitting in a number of different structures that when we put the two companies together, we were able to bring home. We also had the reality that asset recycling is likely to be lower next year than it is this year. But I think, otherwise, you should \u2013 with the exception of those two things, you should look to see us continue to have very strong levels of share repurchase. And I should remember that Avendra, from the standpoint of Avendra, that the numbers that we're talking about here don't include the proceeds from Avendra and that when you think about the use of that cash, we will be giving you more detail about the timing of the proceeds. We're going to have to pay cash taxes on those proceeds, which will be meaningful, so, I wouldn't expect that they will have a dramatic impact on our share repurchase next year, and to the extent that we are able to use some of that cash, we will be able to fold it into the numbers that we give you guidance on.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, good morning, everyone.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Leeny, I think you gave a really good rundown of where you're at with the asset sales program, and I think, if I caught the numbers right, you said you had $1.1 billion that has been completed. That may have included some other recycling though, so could you just give us an update? It was a $1.5 billion target; how much is remaining for 2018? And then based on what you're seeing out there in the sale markets, is there reason or room to believe that you might have some things that you could kind of \u2013 there could be some room for upside to that number?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure, thanks very much. So, you're right, absolutely right. We're looking \u2013 let's just talk, for this \u2013 since the deal closed, yes, $1.1 billion. We had San Francisco, St. Regis was in the fourth quarter of last year. So, this year you're looking at total asset sale dispositions of, call it, $750 million and the rest coming from note collections for a total year-to-date of roughly $900 million, okay?","So, when you think about that relative to the assets that are left, then to get to our $1.5 billion, that would argue roughly $400 million would be in 2018. And as you remember, I've kind of talked about the three buckets of assets, and we feel very comfortable that assuming the ones that are either easily sold and then also can be worked out, that that would get us to our $400 million in 2018. I think, we still believe that that will leave us a handful that, because of the dynamics in their particular markets, be it Rio or Aberdeen, Scotland, that we may need to wait a little while. But the $400 million related to 2018, we feel good about.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Felicia.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I thought I heard at the beginning we have one and one follow-up, is that not true?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","I \u2013 that is what I said.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Oh, okay, good, I just don't want to break any rules. So, Arne, a question for you. So, your U.S. RevPAR growth forecast was a little better than we were expecting, and you highlighted some of the drivers behind that in your prepared remarks. But as we're thinking about the various segments of the U.S. both in terms of chain scale, and then also geographically, where are you seeing better growth than you thought you would see last quarter when you seemed more cautious and even a bit frustrated with some of the North American RevPAR trends?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I think, the \u2013 obviously, the third quarter itself is a bit confused because of the political conventions and the Jewish holidays, particularly. We talked about the impact on the full quarter RevPAR of about 100 basis points. You can see in the reported numbers between full service and limited service that limited service performed a bit more than a point better than the full service hotels, 1.5 point better really system-wide in the United States. And the reason for that, really, is about those two non-comparables in terms of the calendar. It's full-service hotels that bear the brunt of both the loss of the political conventions in Q3 2017 and are more likely to be impacted by Jewish holidays landing in the quarter.","The \u2013 also, because of those holidays, you end up, in the quarter, with relatively stronger leisure business. I think, when you look at the full year, not just the quarter, we would say leisure is the strongest. Secondly would be association group business, and then probably third would be all things corporate. And corporate remains \u2013 we used the word cautious in the prepared remarks. I think that's a very deliberate word to use. It's not weak in absolute terms. The hotels are performing well, and the corporate accounts are performing well, but I think there is a bit more focus on costs across the average corporate customer today than might have been the case in past economic recovery cycles.","I think, the last thing to point out, it's a little bit counterintuitive maybe initially is the impact of the hurricanes in Texas and Florida, not counting the Caribbean, were a net positive in September, not a net negative. Probably most dramatically so in Texas where that was one of the weakest markets we had in the United States for the last year or two years, and fairly quickly, within days, recovery efforts are beginning and people who are looking for housing are filling up hotels. And so, the Houston market and Florida market drove a bit of the outperformance in Q3.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. And Leeny, if we could just move on to a question about the credit card deals that you're working on, and I know you said you'll have something to announce maybe by the end of this year, early next year and you're not really prepared to talk more about that, but I'm going to ask anyway. I think that there's a narrative in the investment community about the incremental cash flow that you can get from those deals, and I just \u2013 we're kind of calculating something a bit lower than what I think others are saying, and if you look at the transaction that Hilton \u2013 that transpired with Hilton, and if you think about the multiples of size that your loyalty program is, I think, folks are coming up with an incremental cash flow to you of $300 million, $500 million. We're calculating something a bit lower than that. So, I was just hoping you could maybe clarify how you're thinking about that.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","So, let's go back just to a little basics on what we talked about last March, just as a reminder, that we talked about the kind of non-hotel revenue-related fees totaling $350 million, of which the credit cards were roughly half. So, call it roughly $173 million in the 2016 numbers. And we've talked about that \u2013 we talked today about how that $350 million will grow to over $420 million, close to a 20% increase, and that will be heavily driven by the strength of our credit card business which is \u2013 continues to grow really well.","But as it relates to the new credit card deals, I can really only say the following, and that is that we are working with our partners. We \u2013 as soon as we have a definitive deal or deals, we will talk about it. And that we had said that these agreements have been some time since they've been renegotiated. So, two things: number one, we would expect from the passage of time that the deal has got better economics. And then number two, frankly, as a result of our combined platform, we believe there's additional benefit there. So that we do believe there will be great economic value, frankly, for Marriott International shareholders, for our owners through a more economic loyalty program \u2013 from the contributions from the credit card companies, as well as, frankly, for the customers who are going to be using these credit cards. So, there's tremendous value. But to get into the specifics of where those dollars fall, it's just too soon.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So just to \u2013 is the \u2013 because we're all in the business of trying to anticipate these things, is the math wrong to kind of take what the incremental benefit that Hilton got and to kind of assume that perhaps your loyalty program is four or five times greater and just kind of do the math on that?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","You know, so the first thing should be not surprising, and that is that I really can't comment on Hilton's program. How exactly the structure of their deal and how they \u2013 how the credit card companies, what they're so-called paying for i.e., how many points that then need to be paid for as a result of the proceeds that Hilton is receiving, right. When you think about it, a credit card customer is obviously doing all this spend and they're earning lots of points when they use their credit card. Well, those points have to be paid for. And then the question becomes how much do those points cost in the various programs, and then what else are you using the proceeds for relative to strengthening the program, and also bringing profits to the shareholders.","So, I do agree with you. I think, a comparison probably doesn't make a lot of sense given that the programs are likely to be very unique relative to the businesses that Hilton has and the credit card portfolio that they have, as well as the one that we have. We're thrilled with the two credit card portfolios that we have now in terms of through Amex and JPMorgan Chase, and look forward to seeing what comes up when we are done with negotiations.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Greff of JPMorgan.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","We'll give you three, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's great. I have three questions, six parts each. My first question \u2013 good morning, everybody. My first question is, Leeny, in your full year 2017 owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expense guidance of $367 million, how much contribution in the first three quarters of this year is there from owned assets that have since been sold? Just so we have a base to think about for the next couple of years to grow up with?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, I'm going to have \u2013 I'm looking to Betsy, but if I remember the comments right, it's $90 million for the full year in 2016, and it was $21 million in Q4 from the assets that were sold. So, that's the \u2013 that's the delta \u2013 that's the contribution in each \u2013 in the three quarters 2016 and one quarter 2016. And then year-over-year we just know that we'll have what we have in Q4, which totals $90 million versus the $109 million \u2013 Betsy's handing me something. Let's see what we have. Yeah, Q3 year-to-date, yeah, it's not laid out the same way. But again...","Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.","Give us a call, Joe we'll get you...","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","We can talk to it separately, but I do think what you are looking for is the $90 million in 2016 and $21 million, and then year-over-year we do know that if we've talked about owned\/leased being $90 million versus what it was $109 million a year ago, you know that $21 million last year was contributed only as profits from those assets that are no longer with us.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then my second question, final question, is it fair to think that given your range of RevPAR growth and net rooms growth for next year, with some incremental asset sale benefit, that this $3.5 billion of cash return, or thereabouts, is a sustainable level, absent some macro shock that moves some of those inputs that you talked about for 2018?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, so, that's what I was trying to mention before, Joe. We clearly \u2013 the $500 million of excess cash that we were able to bring back is \u2013 that was a one-time gain, so, that obviously is not something I can recreate every year. And obviously, the asset recycling this year at, call it $900 million relative to what it would take to get us to the $1.5 billion next year is obviously also going to be less. But, you know, at the same time, I think we see tremendous opportunities for the growth in the loyalty program, which tends, as it grows, to spit off more cash. So, with the exception of those two items and with continued strong growth in the company's EBITDA, we clearly see great, strong numbers for share repurchase, but can't really get into \u2013 we're not at the point in our budget process to be able to put certain numbers behind it.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Appreciate the thoughts. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. I was just wondering, Arne, if you could just talk a little bit about the tenor of your corporate customers when you speak with them. You mentioned some caution going into 2018, and it's just interesting, when we continue to see business CapEx spending go up and GDP forecast pretty good, I mean, what is your sense of kind of what is keeping people on the sidelines from either funding more group business or just more corporate transient business?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, and we've talked about this in the last few quarters, and I wish we could be more definitive than we really can be, but I think when you listen to the stories out there you see a broad range of individual stories where you've got, obviously good average corporate profit growth, better corporate profit growth than revenue growth, but some companies are absolutely punting it, and generally we see from them the kind of behavior in travel that you would expect from those companies. In other words, that they are investing not just in capital items, but they are investing in operating costs and spending time with customers and coming together and using our hotels, whether it be for individual travel or for group travel. I think, there are also a number of companies where they are struggling to find revenue growth, and they are getting \u2013 putting pressure on themselves and maybe, to some extent, getting pressure from the investment community to squeeze out profit growth in a relatively anemic revenue growth picture. And that's causing them to be a bit cautious on their spending on all things, including, sadly, travel. And when you roll all those averages together, I think, we are seeing a bit more cautious behavior, on average, from companies today than we would have expected, given GDP growth.","And, obviously, one of the questions we get often today, given the GDP numbers of the last two quarters, the optimism in the market, people ask, are you seeing more healthy demand today from your corporate customers than a year ago for example, and I think, generally, we would say no, it's about the same. It feels to us like the economy is growing at more or less the same pace it was before.","Now, we don't have any reason to question the GDP \u2013 reported GDP numbers which do appear to be a bit better, so the only explanation we can come up with is that there is just a bit more caution on the corporate side because of the stickiness of revenue growth on average. And, again, if we see better GDP growth on a sustained basis, I think that's a positive thing. And we may see some better performance come from that, but a little bit of it will depend on corporate behavior and whether it gets a little bit more bullish in our space.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, thank you. And I just wanted to ask you \u2013 you guys announced this venture with Alibaba last quarter. Are you starting to see any benefits of that, or is it too soon? The RevPAR in China obviously continues to be very strong, is that helping (47: 09)?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","We're off to a great start with Alibaba. We were doing some great things with them even before we announced the deal in August. Of course, we've got 11.11 coming up here in just a few days, which is a major Alibaba Chinese consumer event, and I think, we continue to work with them on loyalty particularly, with great sign-up from the kind of Chinese consumers we want to have.","And so, we feel we're really off to a good start. The team is also working on some of the technology tools that are essential to drive even better performance going forward, but we're going to get great lift from this.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. Arne, in your prepared remarks, you talked about how in 2018 you expect full service hotels to perform better than select service. Can you just elaborate on that a little?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, that's our instinct at the moment. Again, we haven't done budgets year-to-date, and I wouldn't invite you to think that it's dramatically different, but I think, we are seeing generally there's a bit more supply growth in the limited service space than there is in the full-service space, and that's probably the easiest thing to look at for the explanation between the two. I think, group business, obviously we've seen revenues up about 2% this year versus last. I think that should hold through the year. There is \u2013 I mentioned in one of the earlier questions that is 100% rate-driven, not room night-driven, so that's a better place to be than having that be driven by room nights because that gives us some opportunity both on maybe some incremental group business or some transient bookings that would be taken away from us if it was occupancy-driven. But that's the \u2013 those are the primary things right now.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful. And then just as my follow-up, can you just touch on the direct booking push and the current relationship with the OTAs and the mix? Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, there's not much new to report. The \u2013 we are obviously continuing to focus on our loyalty program, which I mentioned earlier, and we are seeing the contribution to our hotels around the world continue to grow from the loyalty program. That is really fabulous news for us and we're going to continue to invest in the loyalty program the way we've talked about, and the way some of Leeny's answers already hinted at this morning. And I think that will continue to drive our loyal customers into our own channels as opposed to third-party channels.","We do want to continue to have a good relationship with the OTAs, where it comes to that occasional leisure traveler, and there are travelers who want to see that kind of range of pricing across portfolios, who are not particularly loyal to any system, and so we'll continue to do business with them. But I think, we will also continue to use the tools that we have to try and grow our own channels at faster rates than we've experienced the last couple of years. We're not in negotiations with any of the big OTAs until sometime later in 2018, and we'll obviously keep you posted on that.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful. Thank you.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. The first question is a bit of a hypothetical one around the tax cut legislation. Let's say hypothetically that did go through as proposed and you did see your cash taxes go down would you envision the use of that extra cash flow along the lines of dividends and repurchases, or would you see that more going to CapEx?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, as I'm sure you know, we first look to how we can invest to grow our business. So, the reality is the way that we run the shop is more to figure out what are the things that we can invest in, and then with what's left over, what's the best thing to do, which for us has been a choice to return it to shareholders, and we continue to believe that's the right choice. So, although you're right, we would expect there would be more cash, I think, the answer will continue to be that we want to invest in our business to grow and strengthen our platform, strengthen our brands, and add a lot more distribution, and do everything we can to make our equation for the customer the most powerful one in the industry. And from that standpoint we would look at it exactly the same way and then continue to return capital to shareholders.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, let me just jump in here and talk about this a little bit. Obviously, we have not been capital constrained in current times before tax reform, and so our approach has been essentially to do the kinds of investments Leeny described if they make economic and strategic sense to us. And to the extent there's not enough of those, and clearly there has not been enough of those because we're talking about returning $3.5 billion to shareholders this year, that tells you that there is that much extra capacity which is being produced by our company that we don't need to invest in our system.","If you wave a wand and say tax reform is done, and our tax \u2013 cash taxes and book taxes decline by a certain amount, I don't think that, by itself, is going to change our capital availability, if you will. I think, the longer-term question would be whether or not that has the impact of reducing our cost of capital, which could \u2013 in some respects could go into a calculation about whether or not there are investments that make sense for us to do. But I think that's a longer term, more theoretical question, and the shorter-term question is it's probably likely to go back to shareholders, and when it does that's likely to go principally to American shareholders, which gets the dollars back into the American economy, and the American economy should benefit from that. Obviously not by Marriott alone, but by that sort of story working its way through the American economy. And that growth, in turn, should create jobs and should create more capital investment in the U.S. economy","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","And more demand for our hotels.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hopefully.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very well said there. And then as far as my completely unrelated follow-up question, we're seeing InterContinental Hotels and Hilton making a push to get into sort of what we call the lower chain scale segment. Any thoughts on your end of opportunity there?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, we're obviously reading all the news that we can read. I mean, one of the things that is interesting to us \u2013 obviously we spent time at our analyst conference in March talking about the \u2013 our segment profile which is much more dramatically skewed to luxury and upper upscale and even upscale, and really, we're not playing in the midscale space at all. I thought it was interesting the statistic we put out in our prepared remarks that even in our limited service pipeline, 50% of those assets in the United States are really urban and much more \u2013 what \u2013 complicated, but that also means higher rated hotels than the prototypical suburban hotel that you might think of when you think about limited service.","And obviously we want to continue to be very strong on the higher end of the market. That doesn't mean we're going to ignore those suburban or secondary markets, but we want very much for our brands to be playing in the place where people are most inspired by travel and where they have the strongest memories, and coincidentally where we can get the most profit contribution per room. And I think, we'll continue to stay focused in that space for the time being.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, folks. A few of mine have been answered. I had a question actually concerning rewards redemptions. I've been hearing from owners that you guys are looking at revising from what I would call a threshold, sort of a phase threshold on redemption travel, and I guess I'm curious. I would think that cliff-type threshold would create sort of an adverse pricing behavior, and I'm just wondering if you think moving away from that is actually beneficial for rates in the industry, because I would think owners tend to discount to get over that occupancy threshold?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","And that's exactly what I was trying to refer to in one of the earlier answers. We have moved already some, but I think we'll continue to move. Right now, it depends a little bit on the brand. Luxury has got a bit lower threshold, for obvious reasons they tend to run occupancies which are a little bit lower than the upper upscale hotels or the upscale hotels, but essentially the way it works now is once you hit a certain percentage occupancy, your redemption rate is meaningfully higher. And so, if I'm one room away from hitting the 95% threshold, it's in my interest to fill that room almost no matter what rate I get. Now, we've already got some gates that preclude them from giving that room away, or giving it away at a discount which is too profound, but still it drives behavior which is dropping rates closer to stay, and I think, if we can avoid that sort of cliff feature, which I suspect we will do, we'll end up with that much less economic incentive for hotel owners to drop rates as we get closer to the night of stay.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Have you ever quantified how much of a drag that creates?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","We've looked at \u2013 we've looked at this and we've looked at the other third-party players that are out there. We don't think it's material, generally, today, but anecdotally we hear it pop up occasionally, and so, we think it's something we need to address.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And just one follow-up, if I could. Just one of your competitors talking about rebuilding their reservation system to incorporate, I guess I'll call it modern technology, and new forms of guest interaction. Do you think that the Starwood-Marriott combination allowed you to bring your systems to that level? I guess, I'd say sets a future standard? Or do you foresee the need, as you look about your own capital planning in the next three to five years to make a more significant investment in your back-of-house systems?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","We have had extraordinary levels of investment in new reservations or modern reservations approach, as well as in property management system and some of the other systems already for the last couple of years, and obviously, one of the reasons we did the deal is we think we can be much more cost-effective by using these dollars to support one program instead of two programs. And we'll continue doing that.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chad Beynon of Macquarie.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Just was wondering on RevPAR index, I know a big part of the merger, Leeny, you outlined the cost synergies, but there's obviously some revenue synergies. If you can move up the RPIs from some of the legacy Starwood assets, mainly Sheraton, wondering if you saw anything in the quarter that kind of portends positively for RPIs to go up? And then kind of a side question on that is, is anything assumed in 2018 in terms of higher RPI gains from the Starwood assets? And that's all from me, thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks very much and I'm glad you asked that question. In the quarter, we were up modestly in terms of RevPAR index, essentially in most segments and in most regions around the world. And we're quite encouraged by that. We've said before that the most powerful drivers of the lift from the merger are going to be driven by the combination of the loyalty programs and by the combination of the sales force and other efforts to drive top line. We are \u2013 we did, at closing, obviously drive good functionality between the two loyalty programs, but we are yet to merge them into one. We remain optimistic that we'll be able to do that in 2018, and I think when we get that done in 2018, there's every reason to believe we're going to drive better share of wallet.","On the sales side, the bulk of the sales forces have just recently been brought together, and I think that will be helpful, too. So we would expect that we will continue to see some improved index performance in 2018 and probably particularly after 2018 when we get the single loyalty program put together. We're really gratified that we're off to a great start because, as we've said before, this is probably the highest risk time because the revenue we're experiencing in hotels today is, to some extent, driven by group bookings and other things that were done in earlier periods, including times when the uncertainty of the acquisition was most pronounced. And to not have a dip after closing is really very encouraging to us and, in fact, to have some index gain is pretty powerful.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Beckel of Bernstein.","Apple Li - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hello, good morning. This is Apple speaking for Dave Beckel. Thanks for taking my question. Another question on the tax reform. From your corporate partners you talk to, do you get a sense that their spending will meaningfully increase if the tax reform passes by the end of the year? And if so, do you believe your North American RevPAR could exceed the top end of your 2018 guidance range? Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, and probably in the way you've asked the question, not necessarily. I have participated in a number of events with a whole bunch of our corporate customers recently, and I think generally the view from our corporate customers, not surprisingly, is if tax reform gets done, it will be a boost to the economy, a boost to their fortunes, and a boost to GDP generally. And in that sense I think they would be a bit more optimistic about growth. But we haven't necessarily said to folks, okay, if you get a tax cut, are you going to travel more? That seems a little concrete. There's obviously plenty of uncertainty about tax reform, both the timing and the details of what might get passed.","Apple Li - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone. Could I get your high-level views for international travel next year to the U.S. was sort of baked into your preliminary guidance, and we're seeing the Department of Commerce data showing international travelers are spending more money here but looks like the volume is actually down.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, to be fair, we are early enough in our budgeting process that I wouldn't say that we've been real specific about forecasting international arrivals to the United States as part of our budgeting process. A couple of statistics to remind you of. We think about 4%, maybe 4% to 5% of business in the United States is driven by international arrivals. You shouldn't be surprised to hear that the bulk of that is going to be in coastal destinations where international arrivals tend to be concentrated.","The statistics we have about international arrivals to the United States in 2017 are frustratingly difficult to get. We obviously can look at our own system. There's Department of Commerce data, there is data that comes through OTAs and credit card companies and others that we're all trying to triangulate to try and sort this out. It looks like, though, that there has been a modest decrease in international arrivals to the United States from all foreign sources in 2017. That's not really all that surprising. That is in the context of what we estimate to be something like a 7% increase in global international arrivals, in other words, travelers crossing national boundaries and landing someplace else. And so the U.S. is declining in a market that is increasing globally, which means the United States is losing share.","Does that change in 2018? We'll have to see. I would guess that we'll continue to see pretty powerful tailwinds which are driving growth in international travel. Think about China outbound business. We had some statistics on that earlier in the call; think about Asian GDP growth; think about European GDP growth. Both of those are positive areas and I think that will tend to drive travel, particularly leisure travel. We would love to see the U.S. while focused on security, which is perfectly appropriate, also continue to make sure that the rest of the world hears the voice that travelers are welcome to come and vacation here and do business here. And hopefully the U.S. won't continue to lose much share, but we'll have to watch that in the future.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, and then transitioning (01:05:36) last segment, for the Asia Pacific region, the consumer is quite strong, but are you seeing any uptick in business travel in Asia? Are you gaining corporate accounts? Are you gaining group accounts? Do you have a lot of share gain based on that high-single digit RevPAR this quarter?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, I mean, you could \u2013 yeah, the answer is yes. You can tell from the absolute RevPAR numbers coming out of Asia, the China numbers that we put out this morning, our index performance in Asia has been spectacular. I mean, we are at enormous RevPAR Index premiums to the competitive market, and we're growing them substantially year-over-year. So there's a ton of good news coming out of that.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Bellisario of Baird.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Just kind of thinking about 2018 but also more so just on a go-forward basis as you think about leveraging your larger platform today, what's the message that you're trying to send to owners, to operators as they're trying to push rate during corporate negotiations and enforce tougher group contract terms, for example? Basically how aggressive are you trying to be and are you taking more of a first-mover approach now given your bigger scale?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I mean that's an important question. Obviously, franchise operators are very much responsible for their own pricing, and we can make some revenue management tools available to them, we can use some tools which help them participate in corporate RFPs, for example, which we do. But generally they're going to make the decisions they think are the right ones to make. We are, though, in the context of that, trying to make sure that we do things like the 48-hour cancel, and whether that applies \u2013 should apply to the corporate accounts. And we obviously want to make sure that we are doing what we can in the managed portfolio to take advantage of the fact that we've got hotels that are running significant occupancies. And we think there is a pricing potential, particularly in these midweek nights when an overwhelming number of hotels are essentially full. And so we're doing the best we can to go through that.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. That's helpful, and then just one follow-up maybe for Leeny. Of the call it $510 million or so on the balance sheet, any of that left overseas or was everything bought back earlier this year?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","I think there's a little bit more that we do hope over time to be able to get but that is \u2013 for the moment, that was all done earlier this year.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from Chris Agnew of MKM Partners.","Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks very much.

In addition, the 2017 fourth quarter excludes the Avendra gain and the provisional tax charge resulting from recent tax reform, while the fourth quarter of 2018 excludes adjustments to the provisional tax charge resulting from recent tax reform. Of course, comparisons to our prior year reported GAAP results are in the press release, which you can find along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures on our website.","We've accomplished a lot since the acquisition of Starwood in late 2016. We recently unified all 3 loyalty programs into our newly branded program, Marriott Bonvoy. Our operations and disciplined teams are fully in place. We've created significant value through combining sales organizations, improving cost efficiencies and negotiating new co-branded credit card agreements. And we've realized more than $250 million of corporate G&A savings. Today, we truly feel like one company. These integration efforts required extraordinary planning and execution by our team, and I couldn't be prouder of their work.","In a transformation this large and all-encompassing, it would be surprising not to encounter some challenges. In late November, we disclosed a data security incident involving the Legacy-Starwood reservation database. Beginning with our public announcement regarding the incident on November 30, we rolled out a broad guest outreach effort. As we address customer issues, the number of calls through our dedicated call centers declined from over 40,000 in December to fewer than 6,000 calls in January and less than 3,000 calls in February. ","It was encouraging to hear on their earnings call in January, Stephen Squeri, CEO of American Express, note that his firm has seen no appreciable spike in credit card fraud resulting from this incident. Our forensic review of the incident is now complete, and as we said in January, the number of guest records involved is lower than we originally estimated. ","We are no longer using the Legacy-Starwood reservation system, and we have implemented additional security measures on the Marriott network. We do not believe there has been any material RevPAR impact from this incident. Our Board of Directors has been very engaged in this matter. All of us remain committed to learn from this experience, work to improve our information security systems and increase our ability to respond quickly to threats.","So let's talk about 2018. Membership in Marriott Bonvoy reached nearly 125 million members at year-end 2018, and it remains the largest and most valuable travel program in the hotel business. We have been adding, on average, 1.5 million members per month. Members are highly engaged. In 2018, reward redemptions increased 8% year-over-year and room nights sold to members increased 6%, both reaching record levels. Marriott Bonvoy members contributed roughly half of our room nights in 2018.","Our hotels continued to deliver the great service our guests expect. We now offer keyless entry at over 1,400 hotels, and today, mobile check-in and checkout is available at nearly all hotels. Our new Enhanced Reservation System or ERS was rolled out to over 800 hotels as of year-end and should be available at over 2,000 hotels by year-end 2019. ERS allows guests to select rooms based on a variety of room characteristics such as bed type, view, high or low floor and so on, with more photographs and hotel descriptions.","Worldwide 2018 full-service RevPAR rose 2.6%, and property-level house profit margins for our company-operated hotels increased 40 basis points despite labor costs rising roughly 4%. We captured cost savings at properties, realized procurement benefits and improved productivity. We reduced the amount of discounting at Legacy-Starwood hotels, and across our system, increased the proportion of bookings coming from our digital channels. In fact, in 2018, our direct digital room nights worldwide increased 11%, reaching 28% of all bookings while OTA share of bookings remained flat.","We believe the cost of our loyalty program is the lowest among our competitors in the hotel business while delivering the highest value to guests. While charge-out rate savings from our loyalty program differ by brand, on average, since the Starwood acquisition, the charge-out rate of our overall loyalty program has declined by roughly 50 to 60 basis points, benefiting from integration synergies as well as the new co-brand credit card agreements. Lower loyalty costs should also benefit hotel margins in 2019 since the charge-out rates declined most meaningfully late in 2018.","Just over 100 hotels left the Marriott system in 2018, which strengthened our overall system quality. The deletion rate for Legacy-Marriott product totaled 1.3% of total rooms while the rate for Legacy-Starwood product totaled 2.5%. Despite this, we grew our overall rooms distribution by nearly 5% net. By the way, RevPAR index and fees per room of the deleted hotels were, on average, meaningfully lower than the rest of our comparably branded hotels. We expect overall deletions to return to the more normal level of 1% to 1.5% of rooms in 2019, resulting in net system growth of roughly 5.5%.","On the development front, we signed agreements for a record 125,000 rooms in 2018, equivalent to nearly 10% of our existing portfolio. Even more important, the net present value of the signed deals also reached record levels. Our pipeline increased for the 26th quarter in a row to reach a record 478,000 rooms, with 214,000 of those rooms already under construction.","At year-end, our market share of worldwide open rooms was 7%. Our market share of STR's worldwide under construction pipeline was a leading 20%. In North America, alone, our market share was open room -- of open rooms was 15%, while our market share of STRs under construction pipeline was 36%.","We migrated Starwood Hotels to Marriott systems late in the year. In 5 waves from September to December, we shifted 11 brands encompassing roughly 1,500 managed and franchised Starwood Hotels on to Marriott's platforms, including systems for reservations, revenue management and sales and catering. This was a highly complex undertaking involving many people, processes and technology. While further fine-tuning and training is underway, this is a massive step to have behind us.","So let's talk about fourth quarter. Marriott's worldwide system-wide comparable RevPAR increased 1.3% on a constant dollar basis and North America RevPAR rose 0.2%. North America system-wide RevPAR growth was impacted by a more robust industry demand environment and by labor strikes. Looking ahead, for the first quarter of 2019, we expect system-wide North America RevPAR will increase 1% to 2%, with the favorable timing of Easter group business is expected to be stronger in March.","Encouragingly, North America RevPAR increased 50 basis points in January despite the government shutdown and some lingering impact from the strikes, particularly in Hawaii. For full year 2019, we continue to expect North America system-wide RevPAR will increase 1% to 3%. We expect group business will increase at a low single-digit rate during the year. Special corporate rate negotiations are nearly complete, and rates for comparable customers are also increasing at a low single-digit rate. In 2018, our North America region accounted for 68% of our hotel-based fees.","In the Asia Pacific region, constant dollar system-wide RevPAR rose more than 5% in the fourth quarter, consistent with our expectations. RevPAR growth in India and the larger cities in China remained strong, while new supply constrained RevPAR growth on Hainan Island in China and moderating manufacturing demand slowed RevPAR growth in Southern China markets. Food and beverage sales in China were weak, reflecting more cautious corporate spending. ","On the other hand, outbound China leisure demand remained robust, resulting in strong demand in leisure markets across the Pacific Rim. For the first quarter and full year 2019, we expect RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region will increase at a mid-single-digit rate, with continued strength in India and most major markets in China. Hotels in Japan should benefit from higher attendance for the 35th anniversary of Tokyo Disneyland. In 2018, our Asia Pacific region accounted for 15% of our hotel-based fees.","In Europe, fourth quarter RevPAR rose more than 5%, with strong demand from U.S. travelers in London. Centre City Paris hotel demand moderated due to yellow vest political demonstrations and the resulting closed tourist attractions. Barcelona demand was strong, benefiting from easy comparisons to last year's Catalonian political issue. Looking ahead, assuming no business disruption from Brexit, we expect RevPAR in Europe will grow at a mid-single-digit rate, both in the first quarter and full year 2019. Last year, our Europe region represented 9% of our hotel-based fees.","RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America region increased nearly 7% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Strong RevPAR growth at resort hotels in the Caribbean, particularly Aruba and Grand Cayman, was helped by the lack of new supply in the region and strong holiday demand. In South America, RevPAR was aided by the G20 meeting and currency devaluations in Argentina and Brazil. We expect first quarter and full year 2019 RevPAR in the region will increase at a low single-digit rate as Caribbean hotels continue to reopen after the 2017 hurricanes. Our CALA region accounted for 4% of our hotel-based fees in 2018.","In the Middle East and Africa, fourth quarter RevPAR declined over 5%. RevPAR in Egypt increased sharply in the quarter on strong tourist demand. However, continued sanctions on Qatar and oversupply and the higher VAT in the UAE and Saudi Arabia continued to reduce RevPAR growth for the region, overall. With the challenging political climate in the Middle East, we expect RevPAR in the region will decline at a low single-digit rate in the first quarter and will be flattish for full year 2019. In 2018, MEA accounted for 4% of our hotel-based fees.","Beyond things I've already discussed, our 2018 successes on other fronts also give us greater confidence in the future. We'll talk more about these at the analyst meeting later this month. Our Homesharing Pilot in Europe attracted great interest from our loyalty program members and yielded significant learnings. We've made meaningful progress on transforming the Sheraton brand with new designs, higher guest satisfaction and better margins. We rolled out new co-branded credit cards and generated record branding fees. And we exceeded our expected bookings on our new Ritz-Carlton yacht. We believe that all of this, built on a foundation of industry-leading brands and the most powerful loyalty program in travel as well as our long commitment to service excellence, will continue to propel Marriott's success. ","With a highly efficient cost structure, we should deliver leading profitability for our owners and franchisees. For all of this, I'd like to thank the Marriott Associates, whose hard work made all of these possible and, of course, to our many guests who have remained loyal and patient through the transition. To tell you more about the quarter, I'd love to turn the call over to Leeny. Leeny?","Kathleen Oberg","Thank you, Arne. For the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.44, roughly $0.05 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance of $1.37 to $1.41. On the fee line, we picked up about $0.01 of outperformance, largely due to better-than-expected credit card branding fees and fees from new units. G&A was $0.01 better-than-expected and the tax line yield about $0.03 of outperformance, partially due to discrete tax items.","Compared to the prior year, base fees increased 1%. The favorable impact of unit additions and RevPAR growth was largely offset by the impact of properties that converted to franchise as well as hotel deletions during the year. Franchise fees increased 13% in the quarter, reflecting unit growth, including properties converting to franchise, growth in credit card branding fees and higher RevPAR. Nonproperty franchise fees, including application fees, relicensing fees and fees from our timeshare credit card and residential businesses, together, totaled over $140 million in the quarter, 24% higher than the prior year. Credit card branding fees alone increased 44% in the quarter to reach over $100 million for the quarter and $380 million for full year 2018.","Incentive fees declined 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, largely due to a $7 million impact from the labor strikes, as well as difficult comparisons in the Middle East and unfavorable foreign exchange. Incentive fees were helped by new unit growth and higher net house profit at most hotels.","Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $88 million in the fourth quarter compared to $89 million in the year-ago quarter. Since the beginning of 2017 fourth quarter, we've sold 7 owned hotels in nearly all cases retaining long-term management agreements. Compared to the prior year, these asset sales reduced our fourth quarter 2018 owned, leased results by $14 million. Termination fees are also included on the owned, leased line. These fees totaled $15 million in the quarter compared to $4 million in the year-ago quarter.","Depreciation and amortization increased to $62 million in the quarter compared to $53 million in the prior year. The increase was largely due to a $7 million favorable adjustment related to Legacy-Starwood IT systems in the 2017 quarter. General and administrative expenses totaled $242 million in the fourth quarter, a 10% decline from the year-ago quarter, largely reflecting continued cost reductions due to the Starwood integration. Partially offsetting these cost savings was a $7 million expense associated with our supplemental investment in the workforce.","Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 10% over adjusted EBITDA in the prior year. Compared to the prior year, fourth quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by $12 million from sold hotels. Fourth quarter expenses associated with the data security incident that we disclosed on November 30 totaled $28 million pretax, offset by approximately $25 million of insurance recoveries as of year-end. The net of these amounts is either in reimbursed expenses line or the merger-related costs and charges line. Therefore, these expenses did not impact adjusted EPS or adjusted EBITDA results. The timing of the expenses associated with the data security incident may differ from the timing of the recognition of insurance recoveries.","In the fourth quarter, we identified certain immaterial errors related to our accounting for our loyalty program, which resulted in the understatement of cost reimbursement revenue, net of reimbursed expenses, in the first 3 quarters of 2018. Our 10-K, which should be filed later today, will include revised GAAP quarterly amounts, reflecting the corrections of these errors, the impact of which is a $99 million increase to previously reported net income for the first 3 quarters of 2018 combined. ","In our 10-K, we will report a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to loyalty program accounting. We remain committed to maintaining effective internal controls or in the process of instituting a remediation plan. These accounting adjustments were limited to the cost reimbursement revenue and reimbursed expenses lines on our P&L and the related tax impact. The adjustments are noncash and do not impact our previously reported adjusted EPS or adjusted EBITDA amounts.","For full year 2019, we expect fee revenue will increase 5% to 7% to reach $3.83 billion to $3.91 billion. We expect to achieve this despite $15 million to $20 million of unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds, low single-digit growth in incentive fees and lost fees from terminated properties in 2018. We expect credit card branding fees alone will total $410 million to $420 million as a result of continued growth in the number of new cardholders and higher average spend.","In 2019, owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expenses, should total $280 million to $290 million compared to $329 million in 2018. We expect termination fees will be roughly $20 million or $45 million to $50 million lower than 2018. During the first quarter of 2019, we closed on the purchase of the remaining 40% joint venture interest in AC Hotels, resulting in the company owning all of this highly successful and fast-growing global brand. ","We entered into our original AC joint venture agreement in 2011. Since then, we've almost tripled the distribution to 265 AC Hotels opened or under development around the world. As a result of our purchase of the remaining interest, our joint venture earnings will be a bit lower in 2019, while fees and G&A will reflect our 100% ownership of the brand. We estimate general and administrative expenses will total $910 million to $920 million in 2019, a 1% to 2% decline from 2018 levels. Recall that full year 2018 G&A included a $51 million expense for our supplemental workforce investment.","Because of our outstanding capital recycling in 2018, our 2018 adjusted diluted EPS included $0.65 per share of after-tax gains on the sale of owned and joint venture assets. 2018 results also reflected an effective tax rate of 19%, reflecting the benefit from windfall tax and some discrete items. For full year 2019, we expect adjusted diluted EPS will total $5.87 to $6.10, a 2% to 5% decline from the 2018 adjusted diluted EPS of $6.21, reflecting a more typical effective tax rate of 23% for the year and no further asset sales.","To summarize, compared to our adjusted EPS for 2018, our EPS estimate for 2019 assumes higher fees and lower G&A, offset by lower year-over-year termination fees, lower gains, a higher tax rate and higher foreign exchange headwinds. We expect adjusted EBITDA will total roughly $3.62 billion to $3.72 billion, or 4% to 7% over 2018 levels. Our 2019 adjusted EBITDA will also face the headwinds from lower termination fees and foreign exchange. While we are hopeful we will sell additional assets in 2019, our guidance assumes no asset sales and no net expense from the data security incident.","We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investment and share repurchase. We returned nearly $3.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through year-end 2018. This reflected the company's strong operating cash flow, the benefit of $650 million of asset recycling, including joint venture sales of 2 hotels as well as loyalty program cash inflows. Our recent share repurchases have been modestly lower than we expected as we suspended share repurchases for a time while we worked through the data security incident and the loyalty accounting matter.","Speaking of the loyalty program, it generated several hundred million dollars of cash in 2018, more than is typical in most years. This was in part due to a large onetime cash payment received from the credit card companies upon signing of our co-branded credit card agreements. In 2019, we expect the loyalty program will likely be closer to cash flow neutral due to the timing of marketing and related costs associated with the launch of Marriott Bonvoy and higher redemptions.","2019 investment spending can total $500 million to $700 million, including about $225 million in maintenance CapEx spending. We've already recycled nearly $1.9 billion of assets since closing the Starwood acquisition, including $650 million in 2018.","Thus far in 2019, we have repurchased 2.4 million shares for $300 million. For the full year, assuming no asset sales, we expect we will return at least $3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our debt ratio on December 31 was within our targeted credit standard of 3 to 3.5 adjusted debt to combined adjusted EBITDAR. You will recall that our capital allocation strategy is built around our commitment to maintain a solid investment-grade credit rating. We've targeted this rating in recognition of the value of financial flexibility in a cyclical business. ","We also strive to maintain the right balance between minimizing our cost of debt and having sufficient leverage to enhance returns. We know you're always eager for more information. We hope you can join us on March 18, 2019, at the New York Marriott Marquis for our Security Analyst Meeting, where we will spend more time looking to our future opportunities. Please be sure to register for the conference with Investor Relations if you'll be coming. [Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun Kelley","I'd like to maybe start with the core SG&A. Obviously, there's a lot of moving pieces between everything you're working on in the integration, the new launch of Marriott Bonvoy and some of the other investments that you're making. I think when we do our math and we try and strip out the employee investment, we get something like roughly a 4%, maybe 4% to 4.5% growth rate in SG&A. And just wondering if you could kind of give us some -- a little bit of longer-term view. Is that sort of the right level for the business going forward? Or is that a little bit elevated based on some of these other things you're dealing with, just as we think about the model, long term?","Kathleen Oberg","Yes, no, it's a good question and thanks. I think it's one of the reasons we wanted to make sure to mention about the purchase of the AC joint venture. If you think about that going from being our equity line to now being fully consolidated, we're going to be adding between $5 million to $10 million of G&A that comes from moving the geography of that line item into our G&A. So actually, you need to remove a full point of the growth that comes from just that change in and of itself. But certainly, as we think about the long-term growth in G&A, we do continue to think that we will see additional operating leverage in the business as we move forward. And we look forward to talking to you more about it when we talk about our longer-term horizon at the Security Analyst Day.","Shaun Kelley","Maybe just a kind of follow-up, more as a clarification then. With the -- are there any sort of onetime expenses or anything that you guys are contemplating from, let's call it, some of the -- whether it's integration carryover and putting some additional property salespeople in to help Starwood owners or anything from the data breach? Just anything investors should be aware of as it relates to the, I guess, the number itself in 2019.","Arne Sorenson","Shaun, I'd jump in here for a second. The specific hypotheticals you raised are really not in that number in the sense that the cyber event, which obviously will continue to cost us some dollars, we think, will go mostly in the transaction cost, integration cost and reimbursed expenses buckets and will not be in that core G&A number. And, obviously, what we do with respect to sales force and the like would likely be treated very much the same way. But to be fair, while we are focused very much on making sure we continue to drive efficiencies in the business, we are continuing to invest for the future. And we've got exciting growth taking place across many aspects of the business, and, that does require some investments. I think we will continue to be able to grow our G&A expenses at a meaningfully lower pace than we can grow our top line.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","So Arne, can you just talk broadly about the demand environment and what you're seeing right now? I think the last call, you called out some demand softness in September quarter on RevPAR. Obviously, it came in a little bit lighter for various reasons. Can you talk about that, how that's progressed and really so far year-to-date now that we're through, I think, a lot of the government shutdown and some of the onetime things that we experienced in January, maybe you can just talk a little bit about how that's trended.","Arne Sorenson","Yes. So there's a lot I could unpack in that, and let me give you at least a superficial run through both fourth quarter and kind of the way we think about 2019. And then, obviously, over the balance of the call, we can probe any of this in more depth to the extent any of you would like us to. Fourth quarter, obviously, think particularly about North America, which is where my comments will focus, unless I sort of specify otherwise. But fourth quarter was lighter than we anticipated, without a doubt. And we have system-wide RevPAR growth of 0.2%. Obviously, we have coped and prodded at those numbers in every way we possibly can to try and glean as much learning out of them as we can. There are a couple of places where it's pretty clear what the impacts are. The first would be on strikes, which we called out in both the script and the release itself. Obviously, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we had strikes in 6 or 8 cities across the United States, including very significant hotels in markets like Boston and San Francisco and Honolulu, but also in a few other markets. And we can very easily zero in on that and see that those hotels alone caused us to lose 0.5 point of RevPAR index in Q4. So it's a pretty significant kind of impact. ","Obviously, that is, by and large, behind us. It's pretty clearly a onetime event. There's a little bit of lingering impact, particularly in Hawaii, because you do have some impact while the strikes are still pending on the bookings that are coming in for futures stays. But now that they're behind us, that should rebound fairly quickly. On the other side, one thing we think we've reasonably well excluded, we also put in the script, which is the impact of the cyber announcement on November 30. That, too, is a relatively easy thing to look at because you can look at customer behavior after a date certain when an event was announced. And we really did not see any move by customers in response to that. Now beyond that, we've looked at a number of other things, some of them logically seemed to us to probably, perhaps, have had some impact to the fourth quarter. Some -- it's a little hard to sort of separate them out in a way. But we've got -- we talked before about this over 2018. We have been a bit more aggressive in yielding our inventory off of some channels, which are less preferred.","And during the fourth quarter, it's quite conceivable that, that could have had some impact, the way it has had in prior quarters. Group intermediation fees, group commission fees, we had moved first, and while many of our principal competitors have moved similarly, we were exposed to having lower commissions for much of 2018. And we think probably in the year, for the year group bookings would have been most pronounced impact in Q4. And lastly, of course, as we mentioned, we had big integration movements in Q4, moving the Starwood Hotels onto Marriott's revenue systems, think about reservations and catering and revenue management. That is a big suite of systems that hotel teams and above-property teams have got to get used to using, which is about training and it's about calibrating the systems and some of those sorts of things, and we can talk about any of that. But it's quite logical that, that could have had some impact there, too. I go through all that in part because I think when we look into 2019, which is, in many respects, the most important question. Ironically, we're maybe as optimistic or maybe even a little bit more optimistic than we were a quarter ago. ","A quarter ago, we had not done our budget. A quarter ago, we didn't have the weaker Q4 that we were looking at. And notwithstanding that, we see, really, in the U.S. a sort of steady-state set of expectations for 2019. In fact, if -- we've talked in a few quarters, I don't think last quarter, but a few in the last couple of years. When we look at quarter by quarter, North American RevPAR performance and we adjust for holidays shifting from one quarter to another or hurricanes or inaugurals or the like, what we see is a sort of typical quarterly RevPAR growth in the high 1s, nearly 2%, in 2017 and 2018. And you can see in our midpoint for 2019, we're really looking at 2%. And so we feel pretty good and feel, again, probably just a touch more optimistic than we did a quarter ago.","Jared Shojaian","That's really helpful. And then, I guess, just shifting to unit growth. As we look at units beyond 2019, I imagine you'll dig more into this at the Analyst Day. But what's the right way to think about this over the longer term? I guess, really, 2 components, you've got the growth side and you've got the exits. On the growth side, how are you thinking about that 7%? And the pipeline showed another nice sequential increase this quarter. So is it possible that you could go beyond the 7%? And then, I guess, on the exit side, is 1% to 1.5% the right way to think about that over the longer term? Or do you think you have some room to improve on that?","Arne Sorenson","So we'll take you through a model of this at the analyst conference and give you a considerable level of detail about it. I think a couple of things are reasonably obvious here. One is, we'll continue to see some deletion behavior. We have obviously been in the business for a long time, and we want to see some number of hotels leave our system every year because of the importance of product quality. We think 1% to 1.5% is probably the right sort of steady-state assumption for now. But again, we'll take you through why that makes sense when we're together in March. In terms of future years' gross new openings, I think the most comforting thing here, I'm not going to give you another percentage other than what we've talked about this morning, is that 478,000-room pipeline is, as of the end of the year, net of all activity, all activity to include the incoming new deals, the openings that have opened into the system in 2018, but also the deals that we have called because they look less likely to open. And all of that, we still have, whatever it was, our 25th straight quarter, I can't remember precisely the number...","Kathleen Oberg","26th.","Arne Sorenson","26th straight quarter of pipeline growth. And we have a high level of predictability that those hotels are going to open into our system over the next number of years. And so I think that, that kind of superficial look tells you there's some good news in that number. But again, we'll take you through the model when we're together in March.","Kathleen Oberg","I think the only other thing I'd add is one of the things, I think, we've been particularly gratified by is that as we see these rooms coming on to the pipeline, is the NPV point that Arne mentioned earlier, which is that the value of the deals that we're adding and the strength of the contracts continues to be what we want to see for the long-term growth of cash flow for the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell of Barclays.","Anthony Powell","You started the call with some very positive data points on customer engagement with the loyalty program. Could you maybe focus that commentary on Legacy-Starwood loyalty members and Legacy-Starwood properties? Are those customers as engaged with the new program as your Legacy-Marriott customers? And are your Starwood properties seeing a similar increase in redemptions?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, so that's all a good -- very good question. The -- and again, here too, we'll take you through some of this, and considerably more detail when we're together in March and hope we'll be able to see you there. The level of change, obviously, for the legacy SPG member in the latter part of 2018 was meaningfully higher than for the Legacy-Marriott rewards members. The -- so, obviously, we transferred -- internally, we call it something LD1 and RD1. LD1 is loyalty day 1 and that was really in the latter part of August where we transferred, I don't know, 4 billion, if I remember right, customer records from the Legacy-Starwood system and Legacy-Marriott system. And while it went pretty well, there were some areas where the data did not translate accurately, and we ended up with call volume moving up and some wait time issues that were frustrating and probably disproportionately impacting the SPG members whose data was transferred. And so we've been working through that as we go along. I think the great news in this is even when we hear complaints from SPG customers, and we have some since the amount of change that they've seen, is that they remain extraordinarily passionate about the program, taking almost a co-ownership state to it. Why? Well, partly, it's their tradition and their history, but significantly, it's because of the portfolio of luxury lifestyle and resort properties, which Starwood had and which now we have on a combined basis at a dramatically improved level. And so when we see redemption behavior, when we see engagement behavior with those customers, they continue to see the strength of this portfolio. And again, for those that are frustrated, we're going to work through this and make sure we'd do well by then. But we're still quite optimistic that this is going to work the way we planned it.","Anthony Powell","Got it. Do you see any negative RevPAR index impact in the fourth quarter due to some of those changes you mentioned for the Starwood brands?","Arne Sorenson","Yes. And again, this is -- these are the efforts we've really done that sort of teased through those numbers. The strike commentary that I made, with 50 basis points impact on the entire portfolio, the Starwood and Marriott combined in North America in the fourth quarter. That disproportionately is driven by Starwood Hotels. They were -- they tended to be much more unionized. And so if you look in Boston and San Francisco and Hawaii and these other markets, you'll see that a meaningful majority of the hotels which were impacted were Starwood Hotels. And so that's one of the things that we start with. We have, on the other hand, looked carefully -- and it's hard to get some of this data, but we've looked at some share of wallet data to the extent we can get it. We've looked out some behavior patterns of SPG members. And while that data is not crystal clear, it is not sending alarm bells off. It does not look like we are sort of bleeding volume from the Legacy SPG member, even if we've got a bit of frustration that we've been working our way through. By the way, it's not all behind us, but much of that is behind us. Call wait times are back to normal levels, they have been for some time. The data issues are getting knocked off one by one and, by and large, are behind us. And so we think we're making good progress there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi.","Bennett Rose","I wanted to follow up just a little bit on your commentary on lifestyle and luxury hotels. You're -- obviously, you're growing at a very fast pace, and folks are going to look to redeem their points. I'm just wondering, in your CapEx guidance and thoughts about adding properties, maybe even more in the soft brand collections, are you more focused on resorts now than you may have otherwise been? Do you feel like that's something you need to improve in your overall portfolio? Or is the balance right where is it now?","Arne Sorenson","Well...","Kathleen Oberg","I was just going to say -- I'll talk about one thing first and then Arne can talk more broadly. Just from a CapEx standpoint, the numbers that we talked about, $500 million to $700 million, that does not assume any particular single asset purchases or built on balance sheet. Now it does include the CapEx PIP that we're doing for the Sheraton in Phoenix, which as we've talked before, let's call it, in the ballpark of $40 million and that is in our CapEx numbers. But in terms of including a fundamental asset purchase, those are not in our numbers.","Arne Sorenson","Yes, I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think our pipeline includes something like 400 luxury hotels across the globe. And it is, far and away, the biggest pipeline in the luxury space in the industry. And so we know we've got exciting openings, which are coming down the pike and which will further strengthen our leadership in this space. We obviously want to see those units continue to come into the system. We are overwhelmingly going to depend on our organic growth and organic partners to drive those deals. But we've got a lot of good news, which is baked into the pipeline and coming down the pike.","Bennett Rose","And I just wanted to ask you on the international side, you brought down your RevPAR outlook a little bit from your -- from the last quarter. I mean, are you actually seeing slightly weaker numbers? Or are you just sort of being more cautious on the international front, given what we've seen since the last time you reported?","Arne Sorenson","I think it's maybe a little bit of both, to be fair. China, as we looked at it over the course of the year in 2018, got weaker with each quarter. That's really not that surprising. I think though as we speak and maybe a part of this is that the China and U.S. seem to have stepped away from the brink recently on the trade -- looming trade war. But the emanations that come out of our team in China and, to some extent, come out of our customers in China feels a bit more optimistic today than it did 30 days ago. And when you look at individual markets in China, you see a story, which is -- has got some hopefulness to it. Hainan, we called out, I think in Hainan, which is Sanya, China, it's sort of China's Florida, if you will, where we must have a couple of dozen, I would guess, full-service and luxury hotels. That is partly supply and partly other factors, which have caused RevPAR to be pretty disappointing, I suppose, in that market. But you look at Beijing and Shanghai and some other key China destinations and they continue to perform pretty well. So while we're a bit more cautious than we would have been at the beginning of 2018, I think we remain pretty optimistic that China will be a positive market for us and continue to present exciting growth opportunities. You go to Europe and we continue to all watch the developments of Brexit. We called out the yellow vest demonstrations in Paris. I think Paris started fourth quarter, and France, as a whole, started fourth quarter very strong. By the time we got into December with the demonstrations and the rest, certainly, it's had an impact on leisure travel. So all of that goes into it, and I think we see some places where we've kind of had specific things that have caused us to be a little bit more modest in our expectations. And to be fair, we've also done the budgeting process over the course of the fourth quarter. So it's not a massive shift as we see it, but it's a bit more conservative.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes of SunTrust.","Charles Scholes","I'm wondering how you think about the mix in growth rates or declines for ADR versus occupancy for North America for this year. Just looking at Smith Travel sort of back of the envelope, it would appear through January and February for you folks, you're negative 1% to maybe negative 1.5% in occupancy. How do you see the rest of the year shaping up in the ADR occupancy mix?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, I would guess that it should be nearly 100% rate-driven in -- I'm trying to look and see if I can lay my fingers on our January numbers, which I don't see here. But the -- I think when you look at -- just take our midpoint of 2% for North America, I would guess that, that will be nearly entirely rate-driven. You've got supply continue to grow in the United States at nearly 2%. It might be 1.8% or 1.9%, something like that, but obviously, it means you've got to have demand grow in that range in order to have flat occupancy. And I think that's kind of what we've seen a bit in the last few quarters and probably what we'll see this year.","Charles Scholes","Okay. And then a follow-up question. I'd be interested to hear about where you currently stand with your IMF contribution from Asia Pacific and Europe as it relates to overall IMFs, kind of percentage-wise?","Kathleen Oberg","Yes, so we typically talk about this as international and North America. So just broadly, as you know, over time, we switched meaningfully from being heavier in North America to being heavier in international. So now actually, you see that we are almost not quite 2\/3 from international IMFs. And obviously, Asia Pacific, with its typical contract format, is going to have a big share of those international IMFs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff of JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff","My question relates to the North American limited-service segment, I guess, for the second quarter in a row, you posted a RevPAR decline. Can you talk about what you think has been going on there? And then as you think about 2019, how that segment performs? Would you expect it to perform outside or below the lower end of your full year '19 range?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, I think it's a really good question, Joe. Thank you for that. And if you look at the quarterly RevPAR numbers by brand, which are in our press release, I think it's a way of illustrating your question. Take a look at Courtyard, for example, managed Q4 Courtyard RevPAR was minus 1% RevPAR. And the system-wide Courtyard number was minus 0.2%, which we don't give you the numbers here but obviously implies that the franchise portfolio was probably a bit positive. And the average of those 2 things ends up being just a bit negative. What's driving that? What's happening there? There are probably a couple of different factors. One, to the extent there is supply growth in the United States, that 1.9% or so in the industry, it tends to be concentrated either in this segment or the segment below it. Some of that obviously is our supply growth, but our competitors are attempting to grow in upscale and upper mid-scale as well. So you've got a bit more of a supply dynamic there. And depending on the market, that can be significant that it is in the same segment. I think the second thing that's happening there is -- use those Courtyard's numbers as an example. ","The managed Courtyard portfolio of -- it's a couple hundred hotels and change tend to be our gen 1 Courtyards. And so these were mostly opened in the mid- to late '80s. They are rocksolid in terms of the construction and their performance still in absolute terms extraordinarily well. But increasingly, they're finding themselves competing against the hotels, which could be 1\/4 of a century younger or so. And we're doing what we can to work with our partners to make sure that those hotels get the kind of capital they need to have in order to compete well against brand-new product or if in that market, it doesn't make sense to do that, that they get, ultimately, that they leave the system. And so we'll continue to work through that. But I think both those factors are driving that. It varies a little bit by brand. Obviously, Courtyard Residence Inn, we've had the longest and would have some of that dynamic. When you look at some of the newer brands like AC and Aloft and the like, we don't have that factor working its way through the system.","Joseph Greff","Great. And then Leeny, can you talk about your anticipated recycling plans for this year?","Kathleen Oberg","Sure. We're certainly hopeful that we're going to have additional asset sales. As you know, we don't actually have any predictions in the model. As a reminder, we've got 14 hotels that we still own. Seven of them are Legacy-Starwood, including the Sheraton Grand Phoenix. They're generally in the Americas, three down in CALA [indiscernible] North America. And then we've obviously got seven Legacy-Marriott hotels. So the environment for the transaction -- for transactions for hotels continues to be strong. As we've told you before, as we worked our way through the Starwood assets, there were some that were very straightforward in terms of these simple situations. And then we moved into ones that are -- have more complexities, whether it is on the labor front, whether it is from a ground lease, et cetera, or frankly, being in Rio [indiscernible], whether it's economy or actually Mother Nature's events can make for challenging times. So from that perspective, we're hopeful for asset sales this year. Don't have anything in particular to report at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin Farley","I wanted to ask about credit card fees, which drove some nice upside. Just thinking about what the long-term growth rate is. I guess, your guidance is for about 10% this year. Is that driven more by spend or by new sign-ups? Just thinking about how much that growth rate would be sustainable once you have the rebranded credit card out there for a while.","Kathleen Oberg","So we will talk more about this at the security analyst conference, so I'm only going to talk a little bit about it today, but we will be talking about that then. Generally, it is a combination of both. Obviously, the credit card spend has to do with what's going on in the economy and general consumer appetite for spending on the cobrand cards. And when you have new cardholders sign up, there's a bit of a ramp-up if you think about it as they get up to having a normal amount of cardholder spend. So a little bit similar to a hotel opening. So it really is a combination of both.","Robin Farley","Okay. And then I have a follow-up question to the pipeline issue, and I know you'll be talking about that more at the Analyst Day, too. But just looking at your pipeline continues to grow but the absolute numbers of new signings, I think, peaked in 2016, it looks like, from what's in your releases. So I guess, just thinking about the acceleration and unit growth in 2019 that you're guiding to, is that just going to be from comping the higher deletions last year? Is that also helped by -- were there maybe some property openings that just didn't make it by December 31 that kind of end up driving a little bit higher in 2019 opening than what you would think but just kind of thinking about what's the -- again, the sort of the longer-term unit growth there?","Kathleen Oberg","So a couple of things going on is remember, in 2016, you were looking at the combination of kind of pre- and post-merger signings. So as you remember, we ended up needing to take a number of those deals out of the pipeline as we moved through '17 and '18 to make sure that we had the right numbers of what we really thought were going to be opening hotels. So from that standpoint, it's not necessarily a perfect comparison. But we definitely do see room openings continue to grow as we move into '19 and '20 with the fact that we've got, as you've heard us talk before, about delays in construction occurring rather than actually those hotels falling out of the pipeline. So I think we do feel good about seeing continued accelerated growth of our gross room openings as we move into '19.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","So I enjoyed watching all the Bonvoy commercials during the Oscars. Can you just -- can you talk a little bit about the strategy behind that campaign and any success metrics you've seen?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, that's a good question. I don't know that we've got metrics to give you yet except for eyeballs. And I'm actually less interested in eyeballs than I am in what it does to drive business. Obviously, the name is just out there. I think actually technically, it leaked before we announced it, and you could find some chatter about the Bonvoy name even before the year ended. And we then did announce it, but the sort of public launch, if you will, really coincided with the Oscars last weekend, which is something we've been working to get ready for, for some time. And it's obvious that what's happening here, we've got, most substantively, we are bringing these 2 powerful loyalty programs into one. And no longer will customers have to go through the step of having to transfer points from one program to another in order to redeem in the other program. No longer will they have to think about whether they're meeting their Elite night requirements by getting enough nights concentrated in one program or another. It's now much simpler. It's one number and the breadth of choice for earning and the breadth of choice for redeeming is simple for them to grab. And that's the singularly most powerful piece of what is happening in this space. Now to do that, we've got to make sure that people have a brand handle to call this program by something. ","And we, for obvious reasons, decided not to just make it Marriott Rewards and we've decided not to just make it SPG, but we wanted to come up with something which sort of set us up to explore something new and a bit more powerful. And Bonvoy is what came out of that. We had a great deal of fun internally and with a few smart external advisers coming up with that name. And one of the funnest parts of our business, whether it's a new name for a brand, for a hotel chain or a new brand for a loyalty program is just getting together and feeling those words and trying to think about how they inspire and connect with folks. And while there will always be some folks who say, \"Why did you pick that name?,\" I think generally, the response so far has been quite positive, albeit I think a big part of that is just we're glad we're finally at one program and we're really looking forward to using them. We will spend a significant amount of money this year. I can't tell you what it is in dollar terms, but compared to certainly what we've done in years past, we'll spend a significant amount of money promoting the program, getting it out there, making sure people know what it is called and know the value that's associated with it. And of course, that is set up and underway, so excited about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bellisario of Baird.","Michael Bellisario","Just back to the topic of market share. I think last year, you mentioned loyalty was over 50% of business. And if I heard you correctly, I think you just said just shy of 50% in '18. Could you maybe help us reconcile that difference in what you're seeing with customer behavior and booking patterns?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, we said about 50%. I don't know that I've got exactly the right number in front of me. But the program is doing great, absolutely great in so many respects. By the way, one thing I didn't mention in my earlier remarks, we talked a bit about our loss of share in Q4, the strikes being the most significant reason for that. We're really gratified to see that January, our share was up meaningfully across the combined Marriott and Starwood portfolio. And it's a bit of a caution to all of us that RevPAR index is something that we really ought to look at in a longer-term frame. I think when you look at 2018 as a whole for us, we were up modestly in RevPAR index across both portfolios combined. And we -- if the loyalty program continues to perform the way we anticipate it will perform, we'll see that index number should continue to move and we'll also see that program continues to grow with the system. There are complexities in calculating the percentage of room nights that the program distributes. One of the obvious ones is when you get into a big group house, and we are obviously much more group focused than the industry as a whole, some groups have fairly little penetration in the loyalty space, and that's going to have some impact in those numbers. There are also some technical things about when you have a guest that signs up for a program on their first night stay, do you count that as a program stay or do you not count it as a program stay? But what we're seeing is we're growing the system -- the loyalty system at, at least the same pace that we're growing our room system, if not a bit more. And as a consequence, we think we'll continue to see, at an apples-to-apples basis, increased contribution from the loyalty program to our hotels.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling","Arne, you had mentioned previously some interesting stats about a much more significant number of loyalty point redemptions through a smaller portion of higher-end properties. I guess, how has that played into how you think about driving the loyalty program and positioning the portfolio in the future? And would you see any -- see or sense any kind of capacity constraints if you don't grow in those higher-end properties?","Arne Sorenson","Yes. I mean, I think you can almost think of this as a bit of a barbell. You think of this almost as a bit of a barbell. The program is big, obviously, with 125 million members, and think about at 50% of all room nights, how many room nights that is being delivered by members of our loyalty program across the system of over 1.3 million hotel rooms. It is a big program, and not every one of those members is identical. They are, however, all advantaged by greater opportunities through a bigger portfolio to earn points, and they are all advantaged by a bigger portfolio from which to select their redemption options. And for the prototypical road warriors who are collecting significant amounts of points, who may be staying in higher-end hotels where they collect those points, the luxury resort lifestyle portfolio is hugely attractive. But for many, the ability to stay free in a Courtyard hotel in a Midwestern market, which is near family where they're going to spend a week in the summer or where they're going for the holidays and to be able to do that for free is also a huge and really important benefit. And so we saw in 2018 a significant increase, I think, 8% increase in total redemption behavior across both portfolios. And there were meaningful growth rates at both the high end and, if you will, in the select-service hotels as well. Because I think you see that play out. Generally, I think again, the breadth of choice on both earning points and redeeming points is a huge advantage, and we want to make sure we continue to drive that breadth of choice.","Stephen Grambling","Great. And one quick follow-up. Are you seeing any difference in sign-ups in the U.S. versus overseas or seeing any kind of change in response to the new program by customer segments?","Arne Sorenson","No. I mean, the -- Laura's reminding me that Analyst Day, we will spend a good chunk of time talking about this.","Laura Paugh","Otherwise, no one's going to have to come.","Arne Sorenson","And we'll have the loyalty team there to give you a bit more granular detail. The -- I don't think so. The Asia, of course, membership is growing quickly as our distribution and prominence in markets like China and India grow substantially. And our partnership with Alibaba is one that we're incredibly grateful for. And we've got strong synergies between their best customers and our best customers and we're doing things together, which are good to drive sign-ups. We are, at the same time, while we're doing about 1.5 million new members a month, we are very much focused on signing up people who think will deliver business to us. It's not simply about how many people can you sign up, because if you're signing up folks who are really not likely to be customers in a way that's even measurable, it's probably not worth a lot of focus in terms of signing them up. So we're running through both those things. I think generally, we were grateful that the pace has actually continued pretty healthy. Obviously, the quarter was noisy with the strikes and with the cyber event, and to continue the growth through that is something we're pretty grateful for.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel of Bernstein.","David Beckel","Had a -- just wanted to follow up about on your previous comment about how you're feeling more optimistic. You gave some good color there. But more specifically, I guess, from your conversations with corporate partners or corporate travel planners, do you get the sense that there is sort of like a degree of pent-up demand that's just waiting to be unleashed once some of the uncertainty in the marketplace starts to clear up?","Arne Sorenson","Remember, I said we're a bit more optimistic than we were a quarter ago, not necessarily that there's a pent-up demand that's about to be released out of the starting gate that dramatically changes things. I do think, and this is, I think, it's probably obvious to all of you. As we approach the end of the year, partly because of trade conversations, partly because of the way the market itself was performing, I think you could feel sort of rising anxiety or maybe even a little bit of pessimism. We've now seen in January and February the market strengthen. We've seen backing away a little bit from some of the trade dynamic. I think we've seen our corporate clients particularly get a little less fearful, a little less anxious. And therefore, in comparison to where we were before, it feels again a bit better. Don't overexaggerate this, but it feels a bit better than it did a quarter ago. And that's what's built into our model. It's -- it is not a wholly different stronger demand environment that we're anticipating but one that we think is steady because we hear from our customers they intend to be on the road and doing the business that they need to do. And we're, of course, happy to have them come and stay with us when they travel.","David Beckel","Great, I appreciate that extra color. And my follow-up, just wanted to get a sense for your ongoing negotiation with Expedia. Is there anything you can or want to comment on? Or more specifically, I guess, any deal points beyond just the commission rate structure that have prolonged this negotiation?","Arne Sorenson","No, nothing really to say. The teams continue to work and, as far as I can tell, make good progress. So we'll bring you up to speed when the time is right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.","Wesley Golladay","Just have a quick one on the marketing spend for Bonvoy. Will this be a big increase for the owners? Or will the new credit card agreement fund the majority of the increase?","Arne Sorenson","No and yes. I mean, it's -- that second question is a little bit of an oversimplification, but the -- as we mentioned, the charge-out rate for the owners, which is where they contribute to this program, has declined by 50 to 60 basis points, on average, for brands. And that's about 10% roughly, a little bit more than 10% actually of what the total cost of the program was to them. And those dollars plus dollars coming from credit card companies and timeshare companies and others who are partners of the program support the cost of the program, so we end up with the resources to market this new program and promote this new program and actually charge the owners less at the same time.","Kathleen Oberg","And we also got integration synergies from putting 2 loyalty programs together. So you've got, in addition to getting more funds from the credit cards, you've also got a more streamlined organizational structure there. And you put that together and as you remember, we were able to increase the benefits for the consumers, for the owners and also for the shareholders.","Wesley Golladay","Okay. And then one more quick one. For the Sheraton Grand Phoenix, when will that be completed?","Kathleen Oberg","It's underway. I think it's hard to predict exactly when it is. But like most normal PIPs, you could expect that it could take the balance of this year and into next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company.","Kevin Kopelman","Just had a follow-up on OTAs. They were stable in the mix in 2018 after increasing in prior years. Given this dynamic has changed, how do you see OTAs trending in the mix now for 2019 going forward?","Kathleen Oberg","Well, we'll also talk about that at the security analyst conference, so we won't -- no need to get too far ahead of ourselves. I think again, as you've heard us talk about all the work that we're doing on the loyalty program through Bonvoy, which brings people through us to direct channels as well as the OTA-yielding work that we've been doing, I think it's the first time in several years where that percentage has actually not increased by at least 1 full point. So from that perspective, I think it's indicative of the relationship with our customers that we have. And we'll obviously look forward to continuing to do as much as we can to have our consumers book directly with us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research Company.","Vince Ciepiel","Hearing some mixed things from owners out there. Some would point to integration issues related to this deal. You have others call out margin benefits from reduced travel agency commissions. So when you roll it all up, I mean, what are you hearing from owners today? And how has that feedback evolved in the last 12 months? And I guess, what are you hoping to hear a year from now as they look back on this deal?","Arne Sorenson","That's a really good question. It's obviously a really important area of focus for us. And as you all know, in many respects, our business model has 2 sets of customers, the customers we think of first obviously are the folks who check into our hotels or who hold their meetings there or who come and take advantage of our food and beverage facilities. But the other customer is very much our owners. They are folks who are investing capital in our system or have invested substantial amounts of capital in our system. And they are keenly interested in how the top line and bottom line performance of their hotels is driven by our behavior. And obviously, one of those recent events is how does the bringing together of Marriott and Starwood impact that. I think generally, our community would say that we have steadily been delivering cost synergies to them.","We've talked this morning about the cost of the rewards program and how that's been improved. But there are other areas in procurement and systems and shared services and other things we're doing that, some of which we could do right out of the gate and some of which take a little bit longer, but they have been steadily implemented since we closed the transaction in the fall of 2016. They also, however, want to make sure we're delivering top line growth because if we can do both things, it is a huge advantage for them and ultimately for us because we're that much more attractive to compete for their capital in the years ahead. And I think to be fair, we have -- and again, this is another thing that we will look at when we look at the RevPAR performance of the Legacy-Starwood hotels when we're together in March. And there's some news there already, but the biggest news is really driven by the final merging of these loyalty programs now into Marriott Bonvoy. That, we think, is the tool that is going to drive most powerful results with our frequent travelers. And we want to be able to prove to them that we are driving the top line through that vehicle. And again, if we can do both those things, it's going to be a home run.","Vince Ciepiel","Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the fee guide. If I just do a simple linear addition of the 5.5 units on the 1% to 3% RevPAR guide, and then when you consider that the credit card bump sounds like it should more than offset FX, what is -- is there conservatism in the 5% to 7%? Or is there anything going on with non-hotel fees that offsets that, that addition? Or is it just where we are in the cycle and where incentive fees grows? Just trying to better understand the 5% to 7%.","Kathleen Oberg","Sure. So a couple of things. One, I would definitely say I would look at IMFs. We've talked about IMFs as being low single digits in 2019, and that is a function of, as you've mentioned, part of it's FX but part of it is the reality that we've got little bit lower growth expectations in Asia Pacific than we had a year ago and when you think about RevPAR year-over-year between those 2 years in that continent. And then also, you've got the reality of the strikes. And that is as you move into January, while we're seeing recovery, you still had a bunch of wholesale bookings that when they were looking at booking into Q1, it was difficult to know. And so we're going to pay a little bit of a price in 2019 from that as well. So that's part of it. Then you've also got the impact of terminated hotels. If you remember, we actually ended up with a little bit below 5% growth rate in '18, and much of that then falls into '19 in terms of the growth. And then last but not least, we've talked about the reality that with higher labor costs, that's going to have a bit of an impact on your margins for your IMF-earning hotels.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Instinet.","Kathleen Oberg","I'm sorry. I've got one more to add to the last point and that is that residential branding fees, we do expect they're a little bit lumpy, and we actually do expect them to go down a bit next year, which is just a function of the timing of the sales of the units. Sorry, I interrupted.","Harry Curtis","Can you hear me?","Kathleen Oberg","Yes.","Harry Curtis","Very good, okay. Just a quick question on the restoration of the Sheraton brand. It would appear that you have roughly 90,000 Sheraton rooms. And what will that number probably contract to once you're done purging the system and how long will that take? And then the second question is looking ahead, what's the brand -- is the brand going to be an engine for growth? And how will you change the image? And what segment will it fit in as well as is it going to be more of an international brand, a U.S. brand or both?","Arne Sorenson","All right, all good questions, Harry. The -- we are making great progress with this. I don't have it by rooms but I have it by hotels. I don't -- I would guess that these -- there's no reason these hotel sizes shouldn't be about average. But -- so they should be translatable into rooms. We have done -- basically, we figure about 150 of the Sheratons, we have either fixed or the fixes are underway in terms of renovation behavior. And fixed includes getting rid of about 25 Sheraton hotels. So of the 150, about 25 left and about 125 are renovation is underway or about to be underway very quickly. When we look at sort of the portfolio, we've got -- I'm looking at a -- let's see, what is this, I'm trying to do the math in my head here, it's about 450 hotels in total. A little less than 200 in the U.S. or North America and about 250 internationally. About 75% of the rooms product and public space product when looked at separately are on track to meet standards. Now that includes hotels where renovation is not underway yet but where renovation has been committed to or where the work has already been done. ","So that -- it's leaving about 1\/4 of the portfolio, which we're still working on out of 450 hotels, that's 100-ish or 110, something like that. And so we're -- we've got these numbers on the run, and I think we're going to find that when we're looking back at this a few years from now, we'll see that there was massive capital that went into this and the average product quality of the Sheraton portfolio is meaningfully better than when we took it on. We are continuing to grow the brand even as we speak. Your question hints at this a little bit. It is probably stronger in Asia, and therefore, the pipeline's a bit stronger in Asia than it is in the rest of the world. But as we strengthen the product -- average product quality and guest service scores, which is already happening too in a material way, we'll see that the demand from our development partners for Sheraton increases as well. So we're feeling really quite good about it.","Harry Curtis","So following up on that, the Sheraton brand identification is very high with customers. So do you go on a campaign to reintroduce this? Are you gaining traction with developers?","Arne Sorenson","Well, the answer to both of those questions, I think, is yes. I mean, I think in different markets of the world, the need to prove progress is a little bit more important in terms of the development pipeline. But I think as customers see and experience improved quality in the portfolio, and as we get to a place where we've got more of it actually delivered, we will ramp up the sort of PR relaunch of the brand. A little bit dangerous to do it simply based on committed renovations as opposed to renovations that are completed and can't be seen by the customers.","Laura Paugh","Yes, and we'll talk more about it at the analyst meeting undoubtedly.","Operator","Your final question today will come from the line of David Katz of Jefferies.","David Katz","What we've learned over the years is that every cycle is different. What we have seen in other cycles, and it doesn't necessarily play out this way, is a sort of a plethora of brands entering the system or entering the mix. You obviously have a lot and we've seen others launching quite a few brands. What are you seeing? Or are there any concerns that you would help us alleviate or highlight for us in terms of just the population of brands, which seems to be growing quite quickly?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, it's a good question. The -- I think I would focus -- I'd encourage you to focus maybe less on the number of brands being launched than on the supply growth itself. And we have talked about this before. But I don't know of a turndown in the lodging business, which has been caused by supply. They may be exacerbated, to some extent, by supply and a bit depending on what that supply dynamic is. But in every instance in my 22 years, it has been driven by a demand -- a weakening in the demand side of the equation. And that is really about GDP broadly. You can look at other measures, which correlate with GDP but it really is about how is the economy doing. And that's the principle thing, I think, I would be focused on to the extent you think about the cycle here. The number of brands is less important than supply growth. Supply growth, we've talked about before, is at average levels.","We've not seen the kind of peak supply that we did in the last two growth cycles, which maybe means that to the extent we get a weakening demand environment, it might not be as bad. I suppose it's what we've seen before. But again, I would still be focused on demand. The only last thing I'd say about brands as opposed to supply in terms of rooms or hotels, and of course, you'll recognize that we've got a bias in here being an owner of 30 brands that are competing in this space. But the brand that is most important is Marriott Bonvoy because that's what binds our relationship with our customers across the entire portfolio. Now each brand hopefully says something. It's got a product definition, it's got a service definition and it schools expectations of our customers in a way that obviously, hopefully, we meet but lets them sort of understand something about what they're booking within our portfolio. But it's that Bonvoy umbrella branding, which is the most important thing. And I actually think if we had 35 as opposed to 30, it wouldn't be a meaningfully different story. By the way, we're not announcing the launch of 5 new brands this morning or even inviting you to think that, that's coming down the pike. But again, the portfolio branding is clearly the most important thing, and the more we've got choice within that or from a geographic price point and design sensibility, the better off we are.","Thank you, everybody, for your time and interest this morning. We appreciate very much your hanging with us. And of course, we look forward to welcoming you to our hotels as you travel. See you in March.","Operator","Thank you for participating in the Marriott International Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Arne Sorenson. Please go ahead, sir.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","I should note that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today, November 6, 2018 and will not be updated as actual events unfold.","In our discussion today about the income statement, we will talk about results excluding merger-related costs, reimbursed revenues, and related expenses, the year-to-date net adjustment to the tax charge related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the year-to-date adjustment to the Avendra gain. Of course, you can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks at www.marriott.com\/investor.","So, let's get started. We are now past the second anniversary of our acquisition of Starwood and just last week, we met with our North American owners at a largely upbeat Full-Service Owners Conference.","When we announced our intention to acquire Starwood in 2015, our hotel owners were supportive and upon completion of the deal remain so. They have provided great feedback throughout the process as we set our priorities for the integration. Today they are now reaping the benefits from improved cost efficiencies, higher guest satisfaction, and the upcoming impact of a more powerful loyalty program.","Over those last two years we have integrated our operations, sales, marketing, hotel development, and finance organizations and systems. We are halfway through moving legacy Starwood hotels on to our Marriott reservations platform and the process is going very well.","We've enhanced guest satisfaction by applying Marriott's deep operational know-how and made solid progress on product scores. Costs for both legacy Marriott and legacy Starwood hotels have been reduced as we captured synergy cost savings at properties, reduced loyalty program charge-out rates across the system, and realized procurement savings. We also lowered corporate, general, and administrative expenses meaningfully.","After two years of planning, we integrated our loyalty programs on August 18, creating one powerful unified program allowing our members to earn, book, and redeem across more than 6,700 hotels. This was an extremely complicated systems challenge as we essentially created a new loyalty platform.","While there are always unanticipated challenges with complex systems integrations, our loyalty and IT teams were driven to make this integration go as smoothly as possible. In the days following cutover, many loyalty members checked their online statements and some discovered errors. Telephone volume to our loyalty lines increased running up 35% at the peak. Our team immediately identified the problems and our loyalty telephone agents were quickly trained to help customers with these issues.","To be sure, wait times were sometimes too high. Today call volume to our loyalty lines is running roughly 2% to 3% over seasonal norms and wait times are back to normal. While we have solved the most significant problems, we are still addressing issues for some customers. For those loyalty members who were affected we appreciate your patience. One powerful learning from this aspect of the integration, we discovered just how passionate our members are about our loyalty program.","We are already seeing the positive results from the loyalty integration. Our total loyalty membership is now 120 million members. Post-program integration data reveals accelerated bookings from loyalty members, higher luxury redemptions and a growing proportion of bookings from our direct digital channels.","Notwithstanding our focus on integration over the last two years, we have not stood still. We entered into a joint venture with Alibaba in Asia, introduced a pilot of Tribute Portfolio homes in Europe, introduced new loyalty credit cards with JPMorgan Chase and American Express, expanded our mobile offerings to include food and beverage at hotels and began taking cruise reservations for the first Ritz-Carlton yacht.","Beginning in 2019, we are implementing a new program services fee structure for owners that will allow us to manage cost for programs and services in a manner that is simple and predictable. Under this new structure, we expect over three-quarters of hotels will see costs for these programs and services decline.","Our new Enhanced Reservation System which we call ERS has been rolled out to over 500 hotels. ERS allows guests to select rooms based on a greater variety of room characteristics such as bed type, view, high or low floor, corner room balcony, and so on with more photography and hotel descriptions allowing greater customer choice and more effective marketing.","Earlier this year, we reduced intermediary commissions for group business from 10% to 7%. Our largest competitors have followed albeit months after us which may have permitted them to temporarily benefit from some customer shift. While not all group business is intermediated, these commissions have been a significant and growing cost for large group hotels.","Group meeting customers choose our hotels because of our high-quality service, outstanding rooms and meeting space, and reasonable cost. Over the last 12 months our group RevPAR index is steady. And in the third quarter RevPAR at our largest group hotels in North America rose 3%.","In revenue management, we are focused on profitability as well as RevPAR. As a measure RevPAR is easy to understand readily available in weekly STR reports, but is a blunt instrument for measuring success. Some distribution channels are just too expensive for the value of the business they deliver.","In North America, our revenue management systems now consider these distribution costs when deciding which channels to open on any particular night. This has resulted in a decline in OTA business during peak occupancy nights and an increase in direct bookings.","On a worldwide basis OTA share of our room nights was flat year-over-year in the third quarter and declined in North America. We believe this likely had a few tenths negative impact on RevPAR growth, but a favorable impact on hotel profits.","Global RevPAR rose roughly 2% in the third quarter with a modest increase in North America and continued robust trends in most international markets. We expect global RevPAR will increase roughly 2% in the fourth quarter and based on our early budget work 2% to 3% for the full year 2019.","For North America third quarter RevPAR increased 0.6%. Group RevPAR increased over 1% with good attendance at meetings and fewer cancellations. While we anticipated a negative comparison to last year's hurricanes, the decline in U.S. industry transient demand in September was more significant than we anticipated.","October looked better than September with stronger transient demand and considerable group business on the books. We are nevertheless taking a slightly more conservative view as we enter the seasonally slow holiday periods, so we are forecasting North American RevPAR growth of 1% for the fourth quarter.","For 2019 estimates for U.S. GDP growth point to a slightly slower pace of growth than in 2019 \u2013 excuse me, 2018, which benefited from the tax cut earlier in the year. U.S. lodging supply growth is expected to moderate slightly next year largely due to shortages of skilled sub-contractors, higher construction costs and higher interest rates despite the continued favorable economic climate.","As we consider our 2019 outlook, we note that Group revenues on the books in North America for comp hotels in both 2018 and 2019 are modestly higher consistent with constrained meeting space capacity. Our sales organization is doing a great job.","We are negotiating 2019 special corporate rates with our largest corporate clients right now. And while only a few negotiations are complete, we expect 2019 special corporate rates for comparable accounts in North America to rise at a low single-digit rate.","Given all this, we expect RevPAR in North America will increase 1% to 3% in 2019, which reflects our continued steady-as-she-goes view of lodging demand.","Let me take a moment to address the strikes that are occurring at 21 of our hotels in six North American cities. This is out of a portfolio of 6,700 hotels. We have been negotiating in good faith for many months and we are making progress. We have already reached tentative agreement on national issues, and we have reached a number of local settlements.","Just this weekend, we welcomed our associates back to work after contract settlements in Oakland and Detroit. We hope to welcome more of our associates back to work soon. We don't expect the strikes to have a material impact on our earnings in the fourth quarter.","We are humbled by the determination and grace of the associates working today at these 21 hotels, who have been steadfast in their commitment to our guests.","And we are grateful to the associates across Marriott who have stepped up to work at hotels impacted by strikes including thousands of people who have traveled from other cities to help. Due to their efforts our hotels have continued to operate in many cases with full occupancy. I couldn't be prouder of the extraordinary dedication of our people.","Turning to our international regions. In the Asia Pacific region, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR increased 6% in the third quarter while RevPAR in Greater China rose 5%, constrained by the timing of the mid-Autumn Festival and Golden Week holidays as well as the Typhoon Mangkhut that struck Hong Kong, Macau and South China.","We expect our fourth quarter RevPAR in the region will increase at a mid-single-digit growth rate. Our hotels in Indonesia should benefit from a World Bank event and easy comparisons to last year's volcanic eruption in the fourth quarter.","For 2019, we expect Asia Pacific RevPAR will grow at a mid-single-digit rate reflecting somewhat more modest economic growth assumptions. In Europe, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR rose 6% in the third quarter driven by strong results in France, Turkey and Russia as well as greater U.S. travel to the entire region.","The 2018 World Cup doubled our RevPAR in Russia. We expect fourth quarter RevPAR in Europe will continue to grow at a mid-single-digit rate with easier comps in Spain and stronger demand in Munich, Vienna and Rome. For next year the World Cup will be a tough comparison, but we expect Europe RevPAR will grow at a mid-single-digit rate in 2019.","In the Middle East and Africa region system-wide constant dollar RevPAR was flat in the third quarter due to the timing of holidays, continued political tensions in parts of the region and considerable new supply ahead of Expo 2020 in Dubai. RevPAR in Africa alone rose over 7% reflecting strength in Egypt.","We expect RevPAR in the fourth quarter will decline at a low single-digit rate largely due to the new supply in the UAE and a tough comparison to last year's results of The Ritz-Carlton Riyadh. For 2019 we expect EMEA RevPAR will be flat year-over-year.","In CALA our Caribbean and Latin American region RevPAR rose 6% in the quarter with RevPAR at our hotels in the Caribbean up 13% as they continue to benefit from strong transient demand, as well as lower industry supply following last year's hurricanes.","We expect fourth quarter RevPAR in CALA will increase at a mid-single-digit rate benefiting from the upcoming G20 summit in Buenos Aires and favorable comps to last year's earthquakes in Mexico. For 2019 we expect RevPAR in the region will increase at a low-single digit rate.","Our brands are strong and continue to be preferred by developers and lenders alike. As of the end of the quarter our development pipeline totaled roughly 471,000 rooms including more than 212,000 rooms under construction.","According to STR we continue to have the largest pipeline of rooms under development in the world including more high-value luxury and upper-upscale rooms than our next three competitors combined.","Based on third quarter STR industry pipeline data, worldwide one in five hotels under construction will open under one of our brands. In the U.S. alone one in three hotels under construction will fly one of our flags. And in the valuable upscale and above tiers in the U.S. 50% of hotels under construction will be under a Marriott International brand. With this pipeline in 2018 we expect our rooms will grow by nearly 7% gross.","Deletions in 2018 should total nearly 2% of our existing portfolio. Our brand improvement efforts and owner workouts account for the unusually high level of deletions of legacy Starwood product in 2018.","In total we continue to expect net rooms growth to be roughly 5% in 2018. For 2019, we expect gross room growth will be similar to this year while room deletions should moderate to 1% to 1.5%.","Net unit growth should total roughly 5.5%. We do not see an economic downturn on the horizon, but given recent stock market volatility there is clearly uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy.","Regardless of the economy's performance, given long construction cycles our strong unit growth should continue for some time. In fact looking back at the last downturn our gross room additions totaled 6% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.","Our unit growth bottomed at 3% in 2012, but was back to 5% just two years later. We are committed to our asset-light business model by managing or franchising hotels rather than owning them.","Our unit growth is faster. Significant economies of scale benefit our owners and customers, our return on investment is higher and we generate considerable excess cash flow to invest or return to our shareholders.","For more about our business model and the third quarter here's Leeny.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Thanks Arne. Our third quarter financial performance was solid. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.70, 62% over the prior year quarter and $0.41 over the midpoint of our guidance.","Our gross fee revenue line yielded about $0.01 of the outperformance, largely due to strong branding fees. $0.04 came from better-than-expected performance on the owned and leased line largely related to termination fees, $0.03 came from better-than-expected general and administrative expenses reflecting continued synergies and favorable timing, $0.15 came from gains on the sale of assets including the sale of a hotel in a joint venture, $0.14 came from favorable discrete tax items and the tax impact of asset sales with the balance of the outperformance from depreciation, amortization and net interest expense.","Gross fee revenues totaled $932 million, a 13% increase year-over-year largely from unit growth, RevPAR gains and higher incentive fees and branding fees. Credit card branding fees alone totaled $101 million, including $6 million associated with the true-up of fees earned in prior periods.","Credit card branding fees totaled $59 million in the year-ago quarter. For our company-operated hotels, house profit margins increased 20 basis points worldwide on continued property synergy savings despite accelerating wage increases. Incentive fees increased 9% in the third quarter driven by strength in Asia Pacific and Europe.","Owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses totaled $82 million in the third quarter flat with the prior year. Property dispositions reduced owned\/leased results in the quarter by $23 million year-over-year. Termination fees totaled $23 million in the quarter compared to $5 million in the prior year. For owned or leased hotels that were opened in the third quarter of both years, profits increased nearly 5% in the quarter.","General and administrative expenses totaled $221 million, 8% higher than the prior year. The 2018 quarter included the company-funded supplemental retirement savings plan contribution totaling $7 million, while in the year ago quarter we recognized a $6 million tax incentive benefit.","Gains and other income totaled $18 million, including a $12 million favorable adjustment associated with the sale of two hotels in Fiji made earlier in the year and a $4 million gain on the sale of our interest in a joint venture. We also reported a $55 million gain on the equity and earnings line as one of our joint ventures sold the JW Marriott hotel in Mexico City. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA rose 12% to $900 million, despite a $19 million negative impact from sold assets.","Looking ahead given our worldwide RevPAR and unit growth assumptions, we expect gross fee revenue for the fourth quarter will total $900 million to $910 million, a 4% to 6% increase over the prior year. Year-over-year, we don't expect foreign exchange to have a material impact on our fourth quarter gross fees.","Fourth quarter fee revenue is about $30 million lower than the midpoint of our prior guidance. Unfavorable foreign exchange accounts for about $10 million of that decline. Our modestly lower RevPAR estimate accounts for about $15 million with the timing of residential branding fees covering the balance.","We expect owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses will total roughly $90 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to last year, results should reflect stronger hotel results and higher termination fees, as well as a $13 million negative impact from sold hotels. Our guidance assumes no further asset sales beyond those that have been completed.","G&A should total $245 million to $250 million in the fourth quarter, including roughly $6 million for our contribution to the company-funded supplemental retirement savings plan and associate support programs.","The increase compared to our prior fourth quarter guidance is largely related to timing. We expect net interest expense will total $90 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to our prior forecast, this reflects higher fixed-rate borrowings, higher interest rates and lower interest income.","These assumptions yield $1.37 to $1.41 adjusted diluted earnings per share and 7% to 9% growth in adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter. For the full year 2018, we expect adjusted earnings per share will total $6.15 to $6.18, and adjusted EBITDA should increase 10% to 11%.","We aren't prepared to provide guidance for 2019 as we've not yet finished our budget process. But as you consider your models for 2019, we want to note that our 2018 full-year forecast for owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expenses, includes roughly $70 million of termination fees largely associated with the rooms deleted in 2018. A more normal run rate for termination fees is $20 million to $30 million annually.","Year-to-date, we've recycled nearly $630 million of capital through asset sales and loan repayments, and recycled more than $1.8 billion of capital since our acquisition of Starwood. Compared to our last view of 2018, cash flow has improved due to lower cash taxes, lower investment spending and higher asset sales.","We repurchased nearly 21 million shares from January 1 through yesterday for approximately $2.7 billion, already exceeding our guidance for the full year 2018. As a result, we now expect to return roughly $3.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2018.","Our asset-light business model is attractive because of its low-risk profile with most of our cash flow coming from hotel base and franchise fees, typically earned as a percentage of the hotel's top line. Of course, incentive fees are sensitive to demand trends. This was particularly true for management agreements that include a priority return to the owner, which in a significant downturn can drive a property's incentive fee down meaningfully.","Marriott has limited exposure to this risk. Our incentive fees represent less than 20% of our total fees, and of those nearly two-thirds come from international markets, which frequently have no owner priority, and therefore hold up better in a weak economy. Over the last 10 years, Marriott fee revenue has become relatively less risky as we have increased our proportion of both franchise and international business.","You may recall that we spun off our timeshare business in 2011. In 2007, our timeshare segment alone accounted for roughly one quarter of our operating income. Today we only earn a largely fixed franchise fee from our timeshare business.","Overall while our business has been asset-light for many years, we have also meaningfully improved our risk profile with our growth strategy and expect to continue to do so.","Now, I'll turn it back over to Arne, who has a few more comments before we go to Q&A.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Thanks, Leeny. Before opening it up for questions, let me pause for one more moment to thank the Marriott associates around the world, who have worked so extraordinarily effectively on our integration journey. We have had thousands of associates working around-the-clock to pull these two technology platforms together. And based on their work and the work that precedes it by every measure, we can now say we are one company and we are very bullish about the long-term opportunities we can pursue.","We are excited about our future and plan to talk to you, the investors, more about it at our Analyst Day in New York, scheduled for Monday, March 18, at the New York Marquis. Please save the date.","Now, let's turn to your questions. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Christie, we'll take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And your first question is from Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, Robin.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about the deal with Host Hotels that they talked about in their release last week, where you'll be sort of guaranteeing some profits for \u2013 during disruption of renovations. And I guess, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about why you're doing that. It seems unusual. I don't recall you having done that before. And would that be like a reduction in your fee revenue, or somehow capital spend for you? Or just how we should think about that? Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Robin. It's a great question. Let me start just by saying that the relationship between Marriott and Host today is as strong as I've seen it in many, many years. The companies are working together extraordinarily well with high transparency between the two companies and a strong sense of collaboration about what we can accomplish together.","I think the deal that Host described in their call is just the most recent example of that, and an exciting one for us and for them, I think both. Obviously, there it is focused on 17 very prominent hotels in our system, including the New York Marriott Marquis, the San Francisco Marquis, the Orlando World Center, just to name a few.","And I think what Host and we saw together was that, by increasing the renovation capital that went into those hotels, we could drive better returns for Host as an owner, and if models are right for Marriott International as manager of those hotels. Because it was a substantial amount of incremental capital that Host was preparing to commit into these hotels and in light of numerous aspects of these deals, including our incentive fee formulas and base management fees, it was very much in our interest to participate financially in incenting that program.","We'll have roughly $80 million of key money which will be provided over four years, which is a partial incentive to Host to get that done. There will be a \u2013 adjustments in the incentive fee formulas which is quite typical in many respects, when new capital, in other words, capital over and above FF&E reserve gets put into hotels, typically an owner will get incremental owner's priority for that.","At the same time, we believe that if the hotels perform the way we anticipate them to perform, we will see an incentive fee formula that maybe gives them a higher priority, but actually produces more dollars for us as well as more returns for them. So, we're really excited about it and just can't wait to see the way these hotels will be transformed.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","That's great. Thank you. And maybe just as my follow-up. Just looking at your RevPAR guidance for 2019, it looks like the first time in many years that your range has only been 100 basis points and typically over the years you've given a 200 basis point range. So I'm just wondering given the \u2013 if anything, sort of, maybe increased uncertainty about next year, why the tighter range? Or what was the thought there? Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Maybe we just want to prove that old dogs can learn new tricks. The \u2013 it is \u2013 we obviously go through this carefully and probably we should start by restating the obvious here which is we have not done the full budgeting process so we're not completed. We have looked carefully at the preliminary things that we've got coming in and using the tools that we have. And what we see is something that we think looks a fair bit like 2018. And as we did the math, we thought two to three was a more relevant one point range to give you than to give you a two-point range that could be either below or above that. But neither of those seem to be as accurate as we wanted to be at this point in time. And so two to three is what we came up with obviously with a bit broader range in the U.S. guidance.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from David Katz of Jefferies.","David Katz - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning everyone.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, David.","David Katz - Jefferies LLC","If I can go back in the prepared remarks. Arne, I think, you mentioned some uncertainty around the economy, but that your unit growth should continue. Can we just sort of pick that a little bit deeper from the perspective that if the economy were and I'm not asserting that it will, but if it were to turn in a less positive direction wouldn't the implication be harder that getting projects open and on the board, et cetera, would become more challenging as well? Why are you comfortable with that?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, I think, the biggest reason \u2013 it's a good question David, but I think the biggest reason for that is that the near-term openings and I would think about those as being not just 2019 actually, but probably 2019 and 2020, are well underway. Overwhelmingly they are under construction today. And while it is not necessarily the case that they will proceed with that above \u2013 no matter what the economic environment, what we've seen in prior economic cycles is projects like that proceed towards completion and opening. And the intake of new deals into the development pipeline will for certain be impacted by a materially weaker economic environment, but probably will not impact openings until we get a few years out.","David Katz - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And if I can just ask on the heels of the impressive integration that you've gone through and talked about, and I apologize if you commented on this, but with respect to SPG members in particular there's been a focus on retaining and enhancing that relationship. What measurements or what are you looking at to feel comfortable that those people, those members are still on board? And is there any sort of data to support that?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, good questions. And obviously this is something that we will continue to be watching like a hawk. And ultimately we will have access to quite granular data which allows us to look at the spending patterns of SPG members and look at whether we see any signs that those spending patterns have increased or decreased in the wake of the merger of the loyalty programs. As a reminder, it was August 18 so we are a couple of months into it now, but it's still quite recent. We know and we put this in the prepared remarks, we know already that we are seeing a substantial increase in digital bookings \u2013 somebody's not got us on mute, I think. Sorry about that. I don't know where the laughing is coming from. We are seeing the substantial increase in digital volume. We are seeing more and more eyeballs look at hotels in the combined set. And so our preliminary data gives us considerable comfort that what is logically obvious will turn out to be reality and what is logically obvious is that by offering our customers more choice with more places both to earn and redeem points, and more of our customers going to one single site to see all of our portfolio that we will increase share of wallet from the customers as well as grow the loyalty program. But stay tuned for that. We'll have data over the next number of quarters, it will be particularly the most important thing we're looking at.","David Katz - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. And sorry about the background noise it was on my side. No one is laughing at you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from David Beckel of Bernstein.","Apple Li - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hello. This is Apple on behalf of Dave. Thank you for taking my questions.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Apple Li - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. Can you please give us an update on your home sharing trial? And do you think that will become a official project? And what feasibility needs proving out? Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. So we've been very pleased with the pilot so far. We started in London, I would say four, five months ago. Though I maybe a bit imprecise on the precise start date. And the plan in London was to work with a partner who essentially curates the units that would be available on our site. Those units would obviously have a linkage to our loyalty program. And we looked for units which were, A, big enough to be distinct from a traditional hotel room; and B, of a kind of quality that we felt good about having our loyalty program and brands associated with.","The first wave of that pilot was really about assessing what happened in London. And we saw really good results. For example, I think 85% of the folks that booked were our loyalty members. It looked like mostly leisure business which was not surprising to us. And it looked like it was accretive to our total business in the market, with by the way good synergy with hotel bookings too. So we saw people that would look at our home sharing units and ultimately many would book with those, but many would come book with hotel rooms too because they were looking at essentially both portfolios.","In any event, it went well enough that we have now expanded that to Phase 2 which includes Paris, Lisbon and Rome. So, we're in four markets in Europe, and we are very encouraged by what we've seen so far. So, stay tuned, we'll see where it goes.","Apple Li - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","So your net room guidance implies that the exits may have stabilized. Are you guys feeling more confident that the uptick in your guidance from last quarter, which I think was largely involuntary exits, but are you feeling more confident that that was more of a one-off? And I guess what sort of gives you that confidence going into 2019?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. So I'll let Leeny talk about 2019, but let me just make a comment about 2018 and what we saw in terms of deletions. Obviously, there was a lot of Q&A about this a quarter ago. I think, we brought up the numbers by roughly half a point in terms of number of units that would leave our system in 2018 compared to what we have talked about the quarter before.","And not entirely involuntary, I'll quibble with you a little bit on that. It's not as if every hotel leaving our system is something that we want to leave, but many are. And actually when you look at Q3 numbers, we deleted about 6,000 rooms in Q3 just a bit over that. There was a big portfolio of Gen 2, Generation 2 Fairfield Inns, maybe about 1,300 rooms, that we worked with our franchisee and hotel owner to have exit the system. And they \u2013 that was the right answer because those hotels did not justify the kind of capital they needed to remain competitive.","And we think from a product quality perspective and an ability to replace probably in a number of those markets that was a no-brainer for us. There was a story in Dubai, which I think is familiar to everybody, but an owner who really wanted to operate it under franchise contract and we decided to part ways with them. And we don't really have much more to say to that, but that was another 1,700 or 1,800 rooms.","And then there was another 1,700 or 1,800 rooms, which were in Las Vegas and that was a negotiation with the owner of those projects, but there's a significant quality aspect of those conversations. And I think, we are quite satisfied with the way all of those discussions came out.","The challenge, of course, when you have a few big ones like that whether they'd be a portfolio of Fairfields or a couple of individual projects is they can have an impact to what happens in the quarter.","I think we would have loved to have been able to say; I think you probably would have loved to hear from us that it was only about repositioning Sheraton, for example, which we are doing and making great progress on that. That would be a bit of an oversimplification. It is a mix of things but they do include in the fullness of the year, some about repositioning the Sheraton brand, significantly about product quality, and to some extent about discussions with owners that had been left unresolved for too long and we're now getting around to getting those resolved. But as we've looked early into 2019 and Leeny can talk about this, I'm \u2013 we're optimistic that we're going to sort of return a bit more towards normal levels.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Just to follow-on Arne's comments, we continue to do a scrub as we do all the time about hotels that are either coming to the end of their contract or discussions that we're having on ongoing product improvements, et cetera. And as we look through in each and every continent both legacy Marriott portfolio as well as legacy Starwood we do feel good about the 1% to 1.5% that we've described today.","If you remember what we talked about a quarter ago we talked about the more normal rate for the legacy Marriott portfolio of 1% to 1.5% in 2018 for deletions while a number of that would be well over 2% for the legacy Starwood portfolio.","And as we again described for a host of reasons to some extent kind of some issues that may have been hanging around since before the merger. While as we've worked through them and now look forward we see the number for the legacy Marriott portfolio in 2019, continuing to be the stereotypical 1% to 1.5% and the legacy Starwood moving down much closer to a more normal level as we look at the termination. So, overall looking at 1% to 1.5%.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And I just want to go back to the comments about a weaker transient environment in September. Do you think you just underestimated the calendar and the holiday impacts? Or do you think there was more to it than that? And I guess even though, October it seems like that was better, but it seems like you may be taking more conservative approach to November and December, if I'm hearing you right. So to what extent is that cautiousness towards the latter months of this year also extrapolated into your 2% to 3% RevPAR guidance for next year? Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","It's exactly the right question I think. The surprise, the disappointment to us in Q3 was purely about U.S. RevPAR performance in September. And it had an impact obviously in the Q3 RevPAR number. And it does impact in a way I'll describe a little bit more fully in a second, our expectations for Q4.","By and large it is not impacting our early guidance or early ranges for 2019. When you look at September RevPAR, let's start with Smith Travel, interestingly you see, luxury performing reasonably well at 1.8%. These are Smith Travel numbers for the month. Not surprising, because luxury often has got a bit more skew towards resort hotels than other segments of the market. And when you end up with some holiday performance for example, you end up with relatively better performance in the leisure space.","Upper-upscale was only 0.3% so barely better than flat. And all other segments, again these are Smith Travel numbers, were down 1%. Those are the RevPAR numbers. Our system-wide number in September was down 1% roughly. So, it was a disappointing month.","Now to let it all hang out there, our performance was better than two points worse than what we thought internally heading into September. And that's what gave us cause. And of course, when you see that, you say, okay, let's figure out everything that can happen. The most obvious explanations and we think are still probably the most relevant explanations are the tough comparisons in the hurricane markets in Houston and Florida and the mid-week Jewish holidays that occur in September.","So we had both the holidays shifting into September, but because they were mid-week they probably had a more significant impact on business transient travel. But when you miss by over two points, that's a little bit sobering. And so we've done everything we can to tease and test and sweat that data to see if we can figure out what happened. And there is a bit of September's numbers which were cautionary to us. It was a little bit slower transient pickup than we had seen in prior months.","And so we went into October with again some concern, not overwhelming because of the hurricane and holiday pieces of this, but some concern. The best news here is that October was by and large reassuring. We don't have that data in enough depth yet to be able to tease it and test it in the way that we've done for September, but the headline RevPAR number we think will be sort of back towards the prior trend line.","There still is though enough concern I suppose for us that as we head into November and December, which are weaker months of the year, less group business, more dependent on transient, obviously, you get into sort of quieter part of the year. We want to be thoughtful about that short \u2013 very short-term transient pickup and our assumptions are to be sure more conservative for Q4 than they would have been had we not had the experience we had in September, probably by about a point of RevPAR in Q4.","Again, it does not impact our expectations for 2019, in part, because we return to a stronger, more normal traveling months, in part, because when we look into Q1, we see fairly good group bookings on the books and all of this tells us that we should expect sort of a steady-as-she-goes for the whole year kind of numbers from 2018 as we head into 2019.","So, that's a long-winded answer, but I think it's an important question and it's one that I would say the sky is not falling, notwithstanding the weak September. We do think September was more an industry story than it was a Marriott story. In fact, when we look at our RevPAR index for the month of September, we held our own, which was very gratifying and so stay tuned. Let's watch it. We're a bit more cautious simply because September happened, but we're not particularly fearful.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on that line of questioning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning Harry.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Good morning. Year-over-year in November, December, do you find that you're up against some tough comps? I'm wondering if that might be part of the reason for conservatism.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, we have tough comps, of course, because of the hurricanes in Houston and Florida. Our expectation is that the hurricane comps hurt us by about a point year-over-year. And so while none of us loves putting a kind of 1%-ish number on the table as a guidance for a quarter, which is our expectation for U.S. system-wide, that number based on hurricane comps alone would be about two points, if it weren't for that.","And that's not far off of the kind of run rate we have seen. Again it does include a more conservative assumption about short-term transient pickup than we've had in place for the first three quarters of the year. And whether that turns out to be more conservative than needed or not, we'll have to see as the quarter comes to a close.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Okay very good. And then similarly in your sales departments conversations with your corporate customers, is there anything that they're seeing with respect to the fourth quarter and next year that would indicate that demand is at risk of softening?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","No.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Okay. That's good to hear.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Great. Is that enough?","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","I think no is a good answer. And just a similar line of thoughts, my last question is if corporate profits are still expected to grow roughly 10% in 2019 and your occupancy levels are pretty close if not at or above historic high, why not get your property managers to push the rate a bit more? Yeah, I'll stop there.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I'm entirely with you on that too, Harry. I think, the relative lack in rate given where we are in occupancy is obviously something, we have talked about in prior quarters. We are trading at essentially historic peaks in occupancy. We would have expected and probably still do expect more rate growth than occupancy growth going forward and are optimistic that we will see some occupancy growth particularly if we see the economy continuing to perform strongly.","Having said that, it is not just a question of the instructions we give to the hotels that we manage, but it is a question about the decisions that are made by thousands of franchised hotels in our system who are setting their own pricing. And obviously, we compete in a highly competitive industry. And so we've got \u2013 we would love to ignore the way hotels are priced by both independents and some of our competitors, but you can't really do that. And so we are doing the best we can to drive rates. I think, we're making some progress in that, but we hope to see more progress in the months ahead.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Okay. Good luck with it. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Greff of JPMorgan.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Arne, am I wrong in interpreting your North American 3Q results as indicating that maybe you lost a little bit of RevPAR index? I know you're reporting same-store North America and we tend to look at U.S. STR data, which isn't same-store. Maybe if you when answering the question, if you could sort of discuss the difference between limited-service and the North American full-service results?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, obviously you can see that in our press release. You've got our luxury system-wide numbers at about 3% RevPAR, upper-upscale at about 1.5% a little bit less. And then the limited-service at minus 0.5%. And that is obviously in a way looking at the relative strength of the segments. I think part of that is also a function of the kind of customers that essentially are most predominant in those hotels.","So the limited-service hotels are often particularly during the week dependent on the individual business traveler. The upper-upscale hotels are going to be dependent on that traveler, but also on group. And the luxury hotels as I mentioned before are going to have a bit of a skew toward resort and therefore are going to be a little bit more leisure-dependent. And in the sense you can look at that stack and see the relative strength during the quarter. And that is that leisure probably strongest, group next and the business \u2013 individual business transient traveler next.","And that plays through reasonably well. Now vis-\u00e0-vis Smith Travel, don't forget we've got different geographic areas of concentration compared to the industry. Because of our 91-year history in Washington, we are very strong in Washington. If you look at the Smith Travel RevPAR numbers by city, you'll see that Washington was the weakest big market out there for a mix of reasons. Obviously, today is mid-term election day. In the months before mid-term election you got a lot of politicians who are out in the hustings and there's not that much happening in Washington that drives business.","We also had during Q3 a hurricane warning that included Washington D. C., and a emergency I think was called here even though the hurricane never showed up. But it was called with enough advance warning that it had an impact on business.","And in Houston, we've got strong select-service distribution and that's a tough year-over-year comparison. So long-winded way of getting to your question which is, did we lose share in the quarter? Our share in the quarter actually I mentioned September, September we held our own and in the quarter we held our own. So this is not fundamentally about Marriott lagging the market. This is fundamentally about how the market performed by geography and by segment in both September and in the quarter?","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And I don't know if you gave \u2013 thank you for the answer. I don't know if you gave any specifics about October in the U.S. other than \u2013 you're saying it was better than September. But when we look at your 4Q, 1% U.S. RevPAR growth guidance does that assume in the next two months of this quarter basically flat?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I will say this October will be the strongest month of the quarter, based on our present expectations. And that's a bit about \u2013 it's a more normal travel time, it's a more normal group business time and to some extent, we knew it would rebound from September because some of the things that happened in September worked to the benefit of October.","So October we think will be stronger than November and December. Obviously, we don't have again really final numbers yet for October. We have some preliminary views, but it's not \u2013 we don't have final enough numbers to hang them out for you this morning.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Anthony Powell of Barclays.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning everyone.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Slower transient demand during holidays seems to be the systemic trend this year. Is there anything Marriott can do from revenue management or marketing standpoint to help \u2013 to make some better demand during these holiday periods?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, we \u2013 what we've talked about internally is whether or not we could lobby the government to force that all holidays happen on weekends. Obviously, we can't do that. But we have had kind of a funny year which is July 4, on a Wednesday if I remember right and the...","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Jewish holidays.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","...Jewish holidays midweek. And it's no surprise that when it's right in the middle of the week you end up with a temptation particularly around July 4th time to maybe take weekends on both sides, but maybe not to do any business travel during that entire week.","I think with the Jewish holidays, it's probably the impact on business travel not so much people taking 10-day vacations. We are doing what we can do around leisure promotion, where there are real leisure opportunities.","But in some markets, I won't pick on any particular city, but it won't surprise you that in some suburban markets you're not going to find a lot of leisure to replace the business travel that has disappeared. And you're going to end up with \u2013 you're going to do the best you can obviously but you end up with lower occupancy and that has some impact on rate too.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks. And on buybacks and leverage, does the increase in interest rates and some volatility around RevPAR growth change your approach to buyback as you look to the next year, or is it steady as you go?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Steady as she goes. Just remember one thing and that is that you got to take into consideration asset recycling. And as you know this year, we've had over $600 million of assets recycled. And you can net that against the purchase of the Sheraton Grand Phoenix, but there is call it a net roughly $400 million that we would \u2013 going into the year for 2019 we would not put in any forecast for the numbers. But otherwise I would definitely say steady-as-she-goes. We talked on our last call about how in our conversations with the rating agencies as we looked at the combined business models both as we've moved away from owning the timeshare business as well as with the combination with Starwood that we've got a stronger more sustainable, more cash-rich operating model and with the discussions with the rating agencies talked about broadening our leverage target range.","So instead of 3 to 3.25, it's now 3 to 3.5. So I would expect from that standpoint relative to maybe a year ago that we may dance a little bit higher within that range. But it will all still be comfortably in the range that we discussed. And again with the same sort of process that it is before, which is to first make sure that we invest in the growth of our business and do that with great value-added projects, but then with the remainder, return it to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Patrick.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Are you seeing any changes to Chinese demand? And also your Chinese \u2013 your pipeline in China from trade wars?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Not yet is the answer. Obviously, it's a question we have been talking about and watching carefully with our Asia team over the last number of months. Obviously the GDP numbers that China have posted \u2013 has posted are modestly lower than what we saw in prior quarters. And you would expect all other things being equal to see that have some impact on hotel demand. But the numbers for Q3 were really very strong in China. Obviously we had some impact from the hurricane that really bore down on Hong Kong most centrally. But what we're seeing is a good steady performance both in terms of intake on new deals on the development pipeline, openings as well as performance of existing hotels. We'll obviously watch this into next year. And we talked about mid-single-digit RevPAR expectations for next year. I don't \u2013 we don't want to get too granular yet because the budgets haven't been done. But I think our expectation is one point or so lower maybe in RevPAR, a point, 1.5 points lower than we're likely to experience in 2018. But still in absolute terms, good year-over-year growth and stronger optimism in China.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks for taking the question. Maybe a follow-up to one of Anthony's questions earlier.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. I guess what would be the run rate free cash flow generation this year excluding some of the one-time puts and takes? And are there any kind of other one-time items to think about for next year that may dictate how much free cash flow you will generate relative to EBITDA?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, with the one I mentioned before Stephen is kind of the most obvious one, which is the asset recycling less \u2013 less what we did on the Phoenix Sheraton. And I think that's really the main one. The one \u2013 the other one that we just continue to keep in mind is that as you know we have committed to spend some of the Avendra dollars that we had in a gain on sale, which we've taken the benefit out from our cash position. And obviously, as we look forward we would continue to expect to invest some of that in our hotel system. I think, we gave guidance this year that expected something like maybe $100 million of Avendra investing this year which is essentially a use of cash within the cash flow.","And I would expect something somewhat similar to that in that ballpark next year. But otherwise, cash taxes, I would expect that this year we had a meaningfully higher cash tax bill because of the Avendra gain, which so the cash was received at the end of 2017 and we had higher cash uses for that, because of that and that will obviously be done in 2019, so you will not have that carry forward in 2019. And again, a decent run rate to use for taxes apart from any other oddballs will be the roughly 22% that we've talked about before. We are in the process of doing our budget. So from a standpoint of investment spending we don't have a range yet for you, but obviously when we get to the beginning of the year we will.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color. And then, I guess, one unrelated follow-up. You mentioned I think in the remarks a decline in OTA bookings and the strength of direct bookings in North America, but I believe you mentioned that overall you were still flat. Can you just elaborate on what you're seeing in the international markets that may make the effectiveness of some of your direct booking efforts more or less effective?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, it's a big world out there obviously and the OTAs from an American lens we think really of Expedia and booking, you look around the world and you see additional OTAs that have sometimes business models that are quite similar to those two and sometimes they're different, but our regional focus and regional strength which is different. And I don't know that I've got any deep insights on your question. There are parts of the world which are more leisure dependent. That's just where OTAs are probably the strongest for obvious reasons.","And so look at a market like Thailand for example or Indonesia with Bali. These are markets in which OTAs, whether they be Asian-based or global OTAs are going to tend to deliver business which is more incremental because it is more leisure than elsewhere. I think to some extent there's probably also a difference in the familiarity of our brand names and distribution.","Obviously, we've been in the hotel business in the United States the longest with the deepest distribution with really high penetration of our loyalty programs. All of those give us tools to use here in terms of yielding away from these platforms \u2013 expensive platforms on high occupancy with midweek nights which are probably a bit more powerful than they would be in the rest of the world where our presence has been relatively shorter, and our market share is probably a little bit lower. Those will be the things that come to mind, but I don't think they're dramatically different from place-to-place.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Best of luck in the yearend.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Arne, just following up on the OTA comment from just a moment ago. I think in the prepared remarks you also called out that on the distribution cost front you were \u2013 you saw maybe some changes in mix that could have actually impacted RevPAR growth. Could you elaborate on those comments a little bit? I think you said a few tenths on RevPAR. Was that for the quarter for the year? And just maybe \u2013 again maybe elaborate a little bit on what exactly the initiative is and what may be having that impact?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, we called out two initiatives in the prepared remarks. One is our commission reduction for group intermediaries, which is essentially a United States issue. And the second was our use of a new revenue management platform that really allows us to factor in cost of business as we're making decisions about what business to take.","And that piece has really caused us to meaningfully reduce the mid-week contribution that we're taking from OTAs because we are using our revenue management system basically to say, we can fill our hotel with business which is less expensive to us.","And it is in the latter context that we said, yeah, it could be a couple of tenths may be of RevPAR impact from yielding that business. We think even though we might be giving up a little bit in the top line, we're if anything growing the bottom line because we are replacing some of the business we would have taken with lower-cost business.","And, obviously, if you do that enough, you can afford to give up certainly a modest amount of net business that might have come to us if we hadn't used that revenue management tool. And so that's maybe a couple of tenths in the quarter is what we meant to communicate. I'm not sure if we were clear in the timeframe in that paragraph of the remarks.","Still clearly to us it's the right call. And again, I don't \u2013 we're not offering that as a explanation for sort of our macro numbers in the quarter. In the quarter we held our own in RevPAR index, notwithstanding the merger of these loyalty programs and the noise around it, notwithstanding what we've done with group intermediaries, notwithstanding the yielding we're doing with the OTAs. And we're actually very gratified that we continue to post good index numbers even with lots of change that we are very deliberately pursuing across the company.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for that. And then, as my follow-up, maybe just to touch on kind of unit growth side, as you look out to 2019 and beyond. This is not to take anything away from all of the initiatives that you've got and how much work everybody has done in the integration, but I'm curious in the past, you have actually done some smaller kind of tuck-in brand M&A here and there. Is that something that's still on the radar screen for you and how do you kind of think about that as you think about gross unit growth and capital allocation?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, no, we will continue to look at whatever is available in the M&A side. Obviously, it's hard to predict whether anything would happen and we do have our hands full in many respects. But we believe that as an industry, we love and we believe we're just getting started.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Arne M.

Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","One of the main motives of your acquisition of Starwood was I believe around kind of their lifestyle brands, which from a room standpoint came with I think Westin, the biggest one and then WN, some smaller ones.

So do you think you have the right properties for these guests, particularly your platinum members with respect to like wellness and kind of the new lifestyle image? Thanks.","Arne M.

So I don't think we want to say it's only about lifestyle. But we do think that one of the things that motivates regular business travelers who are the folks for whom the loyalty program is most relevant is where can I go when I take my free vacation, if I've earned enough points to get a free vacation.","And they are interested in resorts. They're interested in luxury. They're interested in lifestyle. They're interested in breadth of distribution, all of those sorts of things. And by acquiring Starwood we think we meaningfully increased our attractiveness in all of those places. And so I think that reason for pursuing the deal is very much alive and is working very strong.","Lifestyle includes \u2013 it means different things to different people. You've just suggested one thing which is maybe a wellness piece of it. I actually think the Westin brand itself. I probably include Element not far behind, but those two are in our view the most meaningful broadly distributed brands that have got a lifestyle focus. And so I think in fact we are quite strong in that space. But I think there are other aspects of lifestyle too which have to do with maybe you'd look at W and say the \u2013 what the liveliness of bar and club and restaurant scene is something that is very strong in that brand and I think is still very attractive to many lifestyle travelers.","So while I think the portfolio is great, I think we believe we're in many respects leading in the lifestyle and luxury and resort space and believe it's one of the strengths of our loyalty program. We're certainly not satisfied and will continue to seek more distribution in those spaces.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then unrelated, I don't think there were many companies that announced retirement savings match plans like you guys did at the beginning of the year. And I'm wondering if you're seeing, I guess, lower attrition because of the program, anything that could be quantified going forward in terms of either fewer training fees or better Net Promoter Scores. I know it's early, but just anything that you're seeing as a result of that initiative?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I love you asking that question. Thank you for that. We do a couple of things. One regularly, I mean, every year we are surveying our associates around the world to try and understand how they feel about their work and our associate satisfaction is at an all-time high, up from last year. We're asking a lot of our people because there's a lot of extra work to pull these two companies together. But I think our people around the world are very motivated to be part of the team. I think they're proud to be working for Marriott. I think they feel good about their careers and that comes through in that survey loud and clear.","The second thing we look at and it gets more focused on the supplemental $1,000 401(k) match that we did in the United States is we look at participation among our associates in our retirement plans and that number is about 80% of all eligible associates which is an extraordinarily high number. And tells you that they \u2013 there's always been good participation. It has gone up. I think it's gone up in substantial part, because of what we did with the supplemental 401(k) match. And so, notwithstanding the strike noise we've got in a few markets, we think actually the overwhelming bit of data that we've got about our relationship with our people around the world is very encouraging.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Bellisario with Baird.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Just one more on the merger integration front. Want to focus, not on the consumer side, but more kind of what are you hearing and seeing from the corporate accounts and then the group travel planners, with respect to their views of the merger? Maybe any concerns they're having about it? And how that may be impacting their booking decisions?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, it's a big community out there and so it's hardly monolithic in its voice. But we have regular dialogue with our big corporate customers as it relates to both group and their transient travelers. We have regular sessions with group planners. Sometimes those are folks in intermediary platforms and often those are folks internally at corporate or association customers.","I think overwhelmingly their response has been, not just positive, but enthusiastically positive. They appreciate the breadth of choice. They appreciate the execution that we're bringing to the portfolio of both group boxes of which we are far and away the biggest in the industry. And I think we're hearing from our association and corporate group customers that they love the breadth of choice that we offer within our portfolio.","And similarly, I think, we hear from the business transient traveler that they like very much the breadth of choice that we're offering. And so when we see our share of the total travel book of some of our biggest corporate clients, we see that share generally growing and the relationship's generally very robust.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen & Company.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks a lot. So you mentioned you're seeing \u2013 just a question on loyalty. You mentioned you're seeing an uptick on direct online booking since the unification. Can you give us any sense of where you are on direct online as a percentage of total post-unification? How you see that trending over the next year? Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. We will continue to see direct digital grow in the next year for certain. I should be careful about saying the words for certain ever. But we have a number of things happening that include a continued organic shift towards all things digital. And so, that's a tailwind which should continue to help us. I think our direct digital \u2013 don't hold me to the precise number, but is nearing 30% of our total business which is coming in through our direct digital channels, which is good healthy year-over-year growth.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And just a follow-up on that and to follow-up on your previous comments on OTAs in the mix. Can you talk about how you see OTAs trending in the fourth quarter, given it's a more transient-heavy quarter? And any update you can give us on your new contract negotiations at the large U.S. OTA? Thanks a lot.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. I can't give you any particular insight into the fourth quarter. I \u2013 maybe you should know that, but you've stumped me on this. And we'll have to wait and see how the fourth quarter comes in. Maybe you can work on Laura Paugh and she could see whether she has any of this later. We are in negotiations with Expedia. Our contract with Expedia expires I think November 18. Other than to say those two things, there's nothing we can report.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much Arne.","Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.","Your comment on the overall share of OTAs, I think generally you've seen that their share of overall room nights on the OTAs has gone up about 1% a year over the last several years. And I think the interesting comment that Arne talked about is that in Q3 that share remained flat year-over-year worldwide. So obviously, the work that we're doing in revenue management, we're hopeful that this is helping to encourage all the work we're doing on loyalty, et cetera is encouraging our consumers to book direct.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hey. I had a big picture question on North America. It seems like 2% has kind of been the number for a few years now and your best guess, the midpoint of next year's range is also 2%. So just curious, there's been narratives of acceleration and deceleration along the way. What do you think you've actually seen in terms of the core trend in the last few years?","And then, what would it take to get to the upper end of your 1% to 3% North America next year? What are the pieces that would have to fall in place to actually see domestic accelerate?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I mean it's a good question. That's why we continue to use this phrase steady-as-she-goes. When you look at all of 2017 and now we've got three quarters of the books \u2013 three quarters of 2018 in the books and one quarter which we've talked about in terms of guidance, there's been pretty little variation over those eight quarters.","I think to be fair, if we look at each of those quarters and adjust out holidays and hurricane comps and all those sorts of things, we were in the high 1s, 1.6%, 1.7%, 1.8% in the first three quarters of last year. I think we crested over 2% in the fourth quarter of last year and the first couple of quarters of this year. And it looks like implicit now in a true apples-to-apples comparison, it's probably just a hair under 2% in Q3 and what's implicit in Q4.","And so over eight quarters maybe you see the variation of three-tenths or four-tenths, but really that's not very much over an eight-quarter period of time. And you're right, our 2019 sort of view at the moment is kind of more of the same, a midpoint number that feels pretty much like what we've seen over the last eight quarters. What will get it better, I mean, obviously, the better GDP does, the better we will be. That is still the right single correlating measure to look at.","I also think we'll see a little bit less supply growth next year. That could be helpful. We could see even within the supply growth some shifting in what markets it shows up in. I suspect we'll see supply growth weaken a bit more in New York than we do in some other markets. And so that could be helpful for New York numbers and maybe to some extent New York is an important market for the industry and for Marriott, so that could be a little bit helpful.","I think when we look at the Marriott story as opposed to the industry story, we are really optimistic about the single loyalty program and the way that that can drive us. And the sort of fully stabilized one company that we'll be managing as we get into 2019. So those things should be helpful to us as well.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","The only comment I'll add is that, as you look at GDP forecast out there, generally for 2019 versus 2018, they are slightly down. So we're not assuming in these numbers a meaningful acceleration in the U.S. economy, which may or may not be true.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then one other thing, in years past sometimes you've commented on the quarterly cadence growth and I know that I think the Easter shift turns out to be favorable for the first quarter of next year. But maybe just helping investors with the trend line going into the next year domestically, 4Q, you're thinking approximately 1%. Is it just as simple as the hurricane compares get a little bit easier going into next year and that helps get you towards the midpoint of that range? Or how should we think about kind of the...","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, we should be \u2013 it's a good question. We should be careful about saying too much by quarter next year given we haven't done the budget. I did mention that, and part is because of the Easter comparison. But Q1 looks like a good quarter and I think you've got \u2013 we'll have less impact from the hurricane comparable although there'll be some because I think the first quarter of 2018 in Houston, for example, was still quite strong because of relief work and that sort of thing. But group business looks good. The calendar looks good, so I think Q3 should be probably better than average for the quarters next year. But again let's wait until we get the detailed work done before we talk too much about individual quarters for next year.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your final question is coming from Bill Crow of Raymond James.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey good morning. Thanks for staying late, I appreciate it. Arne my first question is on Sheraton. Other than selling assets trying to drive quality through consistency, anything you can point to that shows success and kind of reviving the brand that Starwood spent more than a decade trying to get going?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, we're about fair share. The brand is about fair share for the first time in memory as far as I know. We've moved it a few full points since the deal was done. Guest satisfaction figures have moved globally we think by about three points, maybe three to four points. And that is as far as guest data is concerned a massive shift to positive. We're not done with that. We think there's still upside associated with it.","I think when we look around the world and see developer partner interest in the brand, we see that strengthening. And we know that we can look at the renovation commitments and schedules for the portfolio as a whole, but particularly on the weaker hotels which we've talked about a bit in the past. And we feel we're making really good progress.","I think the last point I'd raise which is a little harder to prove because it's a little bit more about tenor of the conversation, but I mentioned during our prepared remarks we had our U.S. full-service owners together last week here in Washington for our Annual MINA Meeting. And we feel really good alignment with them about where we're taking the Sheraton brand. So all of those things \u2013 this is a multiyear progress challenge to be sure. And we're a long way from being completed, but I think we are proving that we're making steady progress.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful. The follow-up and unrelated is on the special corporate negotiated rates, I think you said you were up low single-digits. I don't know if you could put a finer point on that, but I'm sure every year you get pushbacks from the companies you're dealing with. Is the pushback this year any different than it has been in past years? And is special corporate negotiated rates as important as it used to be given that a lot of the economic growth has come from smaller companies?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yes, I think that's a good reminder actually. Laura might be able to tell us or Leeny maybe you know. I think special corporate is more important in the U.S. than any other market, any other big market. There may be some cities in various parts of the world where special corporate is important. And I believe the total special corporate as a percentage of our total business in the U.S. is only about 12% or 13%, something like that. What have we got here Laura?","Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.","Here's North America.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","16% in full-service and closer to 20% in limited-service. And so it's relevant, but it's not massive. I think it gets the attention it does because it's negotiated. So it gives us a little bit more predictability on pricing than other transient business that's coming in. I think when you look at the way we've approached this, Starwood was higher with special corporate kind of as a percentage of total business than Marriott was. And that was because they had more special corporate accounts. They went to smaller companies. We've reduced actually compared to what Starwood had some of those special corporate accounts. We'd obviously just as soon have as much of the business traveling public show up and pay in effect rack rate or a non-discounted rate as possible. And so we're not necessarily always looking to expand the special corporate book. Having said that, we've got great corporate customers who expect to have special arrangements and for the right customer we're certainly doing that.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","All right.

My name is Bridget, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Marriott International First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And now, I would like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Arne Sorenson. Mr. Sorenson, you may begin your conference.","Arne M. Sorenson","Thanks, Bridget. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Carl Berquist, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, May 2, 2013, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","Our financial results in the first quarter were terrific. Transient business was very strong, particularly nonqualified or retail-rated business, as we eliminated discounts, pushed business into higher-rated categories and raised rates. Leisure business during weekends and spring break was robust, especially at our Florida and Caribbean resorts and luxury ski getaways. We saw 2007-level occupancies at most of our brands.","For our company-operated Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand, transient REVPAR increased 8% with strong demand in Miami, Houston and San Francisco. In contrast, Marriott group revenue in the first quarter was significantly impacted by the shift in the Easter holiday. First quarter group REVPAR was up only 1%, but including the month of April, year-to-date group REVPAR is expected to increase roughly 6%.","While transient business was strong, government business declined in the quarter. Systemwide across North America, we estimate shrinking government business, both transient and group, reduced our first quarter REVPAR growth by 60 to 70 basis points. Last year, government-related business made up about 5% of room nights across our North American system.","In light of the fact that a quarter ago we highlighted the potential negative impact of the sequester on our business in 2013, let me take a few minutes to address a few government issues. First, the 60- to 70-basis-point impact to our Q1 REVPAR from declining government business is likely to be more than just the impact of the sequester itself. Government has been under pressure to cut spending for some time, and this impact reflects the total impact of decline in government group and transient volumes from last year. We expect continuing negative impact to our REVPAR throughout 2013. While the world seems to have moved on from the sequester, we continue to believe that better results will flow to our economy if a thoughtful bipartisan budget deal can be crafted to replace the blunt instrument of the sequester.","Second, we've been pleased to see the momentum building for immigration reform in the administration and on the Hill. The time is right. In terms of fairness and economic impact, the benefits of immigration reform are obvious.","Third, we were pleased to see this morning the President's nomination of Penny Pritzker as Commerce Secretary and Michael Froman as U.S. Trade Rep. These are important government positions and deserve to be occupied by talented, energetic leaders like these nominees. We want to especially congratulate Penny Pritzker. We know she knows the lodging industry. We think both these nominees are good candidates, and we urge quick confirmation by the Senate. Remember, travel is trade.","Now let's get back to our results in the first quarter. For company-operated Marriott Hotels, association group business was very strong in the quarter. Typically booked years in advance, first quarter association group attendance exceeded our expectations, and association bookings for 2014 and beyond were very strong.","Long-term corporate demand was also healthy. Corporate group bookings made in the first quarter for full year 2014 were up 22%. In fact, in the last 12 months, our 2014 revenue booking pace increased from minus 4% to plus 5% in part due to strong corporate and association demand.","To be sure, while long-term demand is very robust, we are seeing less short-term corporate group business in our hotels. Why? We believe today's \"In the year, for the year\" corporate customers are feeling a bit uncertain and cautious likely due to government austerity, higher taxes on the consumer and stubbornly high unemployment. We are watching this trend carefully but also note that we've seen few corporate cancellations, little attrition, and our funnel of new but unsigned group bookings remains healthy. And as I said, long-term corporate bookings are strong. For all group customers, booking pace for the remainder of 2013 for the Marriott brand, as an example, is up 4%.","Outside North America, systemwide comparable REVPAR rose 4% on a constant currency basis. REVPAR growth in the Middle East was double digits. The UAE was a bright spot, attracting cold weather-weary Europeans in the first quarter. REVPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America increased over 7%, led by Mexico, which was up nearly 16%. Our resorts in Puerto Rico, Aruba and the Cayman Islands, REVPAR also saw double-digit growth.","In Asia, constant dollar systemwide REVPAR increased 3% with very strong REVPAR growth in Thailand and in Indonesia, weak economic conditions in Europe, slightly reduced systemwide constant dollar REVPAR in the region, while REVPAR in the U.K. declined about 5%, reflecting weak demand and tough comparisons to last year's run-up to the Olympics. Comparisons will get easier in the U.K. when we get to the fourth quarter.","Around the world, our Ritz-Carlton hotels had an outstanding quarter. North American REVPAR increased 9%, and outside North America, constant dollar REVPAR was up 11% as strong luxury demand hit limited luxury supply. A favorable mix of transient room nights as well as price increases continue to move room rates higher.","Our development pipeline of Ritz-Carlton hotels stands at 31 hotels today, implying more than a 35% growth over today's worldwide Ritz-Carlton system. And virtually all of our Ritz-Carlton pipeline is outside the United States.","We've made significant progress on the integration of the Gaylord brand. As of the end of the first quarter, the brand had conditioned to -- transitioned to our rewards program, adopted our property management and revenue management systems and joined our global sales organization. The improvements in operating efficiency remain a work in progress, but we see considerable opportunity to leverage Marriott's scale. We are still rolling out the Marriott procurement program, as an example.","Turning to development. Lending is gradually loosening for new limited-service hotel development in the United States but only for worthy projects. At the same time, hotel supply growth in the North America and Europe remains very low. At quarter end, our worldwide hotel development pipeline hit a new record, more than 135,000 rooms with more than 62,000 rooms under construction.","Measured by number of hotels, we are clearly taking share. Based on STR hotel pipeline data, our new hotels under development, as a percentage of our current hotel portfolio, shows faster growth in each of the United States, Asia and the Middle East regions that are significant public competitors. And our development pipelines in CALA, Latin America and Europe are highly competitive.","I just got back from the grand opening of the new Marriott in Whitefield, a suburb of Bangalore, India. From meeting the associates there, I know the Marriott culture is alive and well even 9,000 miles from our headquarters. Today, we have 18 hotels in India representing 5 brands, with more than 45 hotels in our development pipeline.","India is a microcosm of what we are doing in markets around the world, combining strong global brands with local sensibility. As we enter emerging markets, we typically establish a beachhead with luxury and upper-upscale hotels. But to achieve scale and long-term growth, a strong market presence with a broad brand portfolio is crucial. We are introducing Fairfield in India, Fairfield in Brazil, Courtyard in Mexico, Courtyard in China and the MOXY brand in Europe to achieve that scale with designs that reflect our high global standards while appealing to local guests. 30 years ago, we demonstrated the power of customer segmentation in the hotel industry when we introduced Courtyard. Segmentation was phenomenally successful in the U.S., and we are confident that approach will be even more successful around the world. We have strong, differentiated brands and tremendous economies of scale. But success is never final. We want to be more consumer driven, closer to the customer around the world, more attuned to the next-generation traveler and much faster to market.","In recent years, we announced new lobby designs, restaurant concepts, group meeting offerings and even new brands. In fact, later this year, you'll hear us talk more about the coming changes in the Marriott brand. You'll also hear us talk more about brand introductions in new countries. So stay tuned.","We believe the investment case for Marriott is clear. Expanding our share of rooms in an environment of modest supply growth, increasing global travel and high occupancy rates all imply a long period of strong room rate increases, margin expansion and fee growth, particularly incentive fee growth. Our business model should allow for investors to reap that growing profitability with high returns on investment.","To further discuss the first quarter numbers and to update our outlook, here's Carl.","Carl T. Berquist","Thanks, Arne. As I'm sure you're all aware, this is our first quarter under our new fiscal calendar. Thank you for your patience as we make this important transition. And special thanks to the many finance associates here at Marriott that continue to make this transition from a 13-period year to a calendar year so successful. They are doing a fantastic job.","Well, for the first quarter 2013, diluted earnings per share totaled $0.43, ahead of our guidance of $0.37 to $0.42. We beat the midpoint of our first quarter EPS guidance by about $0.03. Roughly $0.02 came from better-than-expected fees, particularly incentive fees in North American full-service hotels. $0.02 came from better-than-expected branding fees and termination fees, $0.01 from better-than-expected taxes, and these were offset by $0.02 in higher G&A. Our guidance beat was not related to the change in the fiscal calendar.","Total fee revenue reached $370 million, including incentive fees of $66 million. We estimate roughly $6 million of the incentive fee improvement in the quarter was associated with our longer first quarter.","Incentive fees exceeded our expectations largely due to strong performance among our full-service hotels in the U.S., particularly in New York and Florida. Worldwide, 1\/3 of managed hotels paid incentive fees in the quarter compared to 29% in the year ago quarter. In North America alone, approximately 1\/3 of the full-service managed hotels paid incentive fees compared to 1\/4 in the prior year.","House profit margins at company-operated hotels in North America increased 170 basis points. These margins are not adjusted for the shifting fiscal calendar, so they're not comparable to our calendar quarter REVPAR stat. But we were pleased with the performance. In fact, we expect roughly 150 basis points of margin improvement for the full year.","Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $36 million in the quarter. We estimate the longer fiscal quarter had minimal impact here. Branding fees from our credit card and residential real estate sales totaled $25 million in the quarter compared to $16 million in the prior year.","Leased hotel results were down slightly, reflecting softer results in London and the costs associated with a lease termination. Compared to our expectations, we outperformed in part due to $3 million of termination fees and some timing.","General and administrative expenses totaled $180 million in the first quarter compared to $147 million in the prior year. We estimate approximately $15 million of the year-over-year increase was associated with the longer fiscal quarter; $2 million of the increase was due to our revised estimate for compensation paid in 2013 but associated with 2012; $3 million came from unfavorable foreign exchange, including the currency devaluation in Venezuela; and about $3 million came from an increase in amortization of fee money largely due to the Gaylord transaction. Our higher overhead costs in the first quarter also reflected our organization's rapid growth outside the U.S. and spending on new hotel development.","For Marriott International, our adjusted operating profit margin, excluding the impact of reimbursed costs, increased to 38% in the first quarter from 34% in the 2012 quarter. We repurchased over 5 million shares during the quarter and over 8 million shares through the end of April.","Looking ahead, we expect second quarter REVPAR to increase 5% to 7% in North America as we benefit from a shifting Easter holiday, strong seasonal occupancy and further room rate improvement. Outside North America, we anticipate REVPAR will increase 2% to 4% and, given trends in Europe and Asia, probably at the lower end of that range. Asia Pacific REVPAR should grow at a low single-digit rate, reflecting weak trends in Seoul and Beijing. We expect flattish REVPAR growth in Europe, low single-digit REVPAR growth in CALA and high single-digit REVPAR growth in the Middle East. For you modelers, we estimate the shift in fiscal calendar will add approximately $20 million to second quarter operating income.","All in all, we expect second quarter operating income will total $275 million to $295 million, and diluted EPS will total $0.55 to $0.59. For full year 2013, we expect worldwide systemwide REVPAR to increase 4% to 7%. Fee revenue could increase 8% to 12%. We expect owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expenses, will decline 9% to 15% for full year 2013.","As we discussed last quarter, our leased hotels in Europe face a weakened economy, and our leased hotel in London also has a tough comparison to last year's Olympics. We will also be renovating 2 leased properties in 2013, which will be disruptive to the results. And we expect lower year-over-year termination and residential branding fees and higher preopening costs.","We expect our general and administrative expenses will total $675 million to $685 million in 2013. The increase from our prior full year guidance is largely due to first quarter performance.","All in all, we expect fully diluted EPS will total $1.93 to $2.08 in 2013, a 12% to 21% increase from 2012. Excluding the impact of the $25 million after-tax gain on the sale of our Courtyard joint venture in 2012, this is an 18% to 27% increase year-over-year.","Compared to our prior 2013 guidance, we picked up about $0.02 per share on better fee revenue and $0.01 from our owned, leased and other line. Higher G&A costs is -- higher G&A is offset by lower interest expense and a favorable tax rate.","Our cash flow is very strong. For full year 2013, we expect EBITDA to total roughly $1.2 billion, investment spending could total $600 million to $800 million, including about $100 million in maintenance spending. We will remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and repurchases and expect to recycle capital. In fact, we expect to return $800 million to $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends this year.","We appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] We know there is considerable sell-side coverage and even more buy-side interest in Marriott, so expect to stay as long as you want to answer your question. Bridget, we'll take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker from MLV & Co.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","I just had -- I think a lot of you -- a lot of your color up front was really helpful in terms of understanding how numbers flowed in the quarter. I had a little bit of a bigger picture question, though, I was hoping you guys might answer for me. I guess you guys have done a lot of transformation across your select-service brands, really bringing up the quality of the product. And I guess it's not just you guys, it's probably a lot of your competitors, too. I'm just wondering what you're hearing from most of your big clients in terms of the disparity in product offering between a Courtyard and, say, a traditional Marriott. Are you moving away from the traditional Marriott that's a -- group focused, under 400 rooms and trying to shift those more towards Courtyards or SpringHills or even Fairfields or even more upper end to the Autograph Collections or EDITION, et cetera? I just want to get some color in terms of how the development, particularly in the U.S., is unfolding given what seems to be a little bit of a shift in the customer base where they seem to be more open to staying at your select-service properties.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, the -- it's a good question, Ryan. The -- we've talked -- part of the problem is we've talked more about Courtyard, as an example, than we have about our full-service brands in part because particularly when you look at the managed portfolio of Courtyard, we're -- we have probably close to 300 Courtyards we manage. Average age, I would guess, is 20 years, maybe a little over 20 years. The first-generation Courtyards were built and they were nearly identical. And so we could look at those as a portfolio and roll out renovation essentially that would be nearly uniform from hotel to hotel and could be done in a programmatic basis. In fact, we had 70 Courtyards under renovation in the first quarter of '13, and we're fast approaching the -- a point where every Courtyard in the United States will have a new, refreshing business lobby. And increasingly, we're getting rooms renovations rolled off that portfolio, too. At the same time, there is a lot going on in the core Marriott brands with -- Host is our biggest owner. Host has done a really fine job in many of their Marriott hotels to make sure that they're renovated and up to snuff. But in part because the brand is made up of a less uniform group of hotels, in other words they weren't built in groups of 50 or 75 but often were built one at a time, there's less of a programmatic renovation that's under way. We are not moving away from the core Marriott brand, but I think we'll intensify some of the communications and programmatic renovation work that we anticipate over the course of the next few quarters, and we'll communicate with you more much about -- much more about that as the year goes along.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm trying to think about what the takeaway should be on your commentary on North America because your guidance actually was raised a bit at the bottom end, so a little bit more optimistic. But I guess I'm trying to square that with your comments getting -- your comments about sort of the closer-in [ph] business on the corporate side being a little bit softer. So I wonder if you could just kind of help square that.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I think thematically, the guidance we're offering now is essentially the same as the guidance we offered a quarter ago. We have brought up the lower end by 0.5 point, but I think that's mostly a function of the number we actually delivered in the first quarter. So as we look at the balance of the year, we looked at the low end of that range that we had a quarter ago, and to get to that low end would require a really kind of pitiful performance between now and the end of the year, which we just don't think is likely. Obviously, we're also hoping that, that doesn't happen. And so I wouldn't view that 0.5 point lift of the bottom end as being a sign of a meaningfully different view today than we had a quarter ago. I think we would say today, as I think we've said a quarter ago, that what we see is a steady, broad recovery in the economy and as it impacts the lodging business with demand growth and increasingly powerful shift to rate growth. And that is the strongest bit of tailwinds that we've got impacting our business. The caution is this is not a recovery which has got a sort of free-for-all robustness. I think generally, we see our corporate clients spending, not cutting back, getting back on the road but not necessarily throwing all caution to the wind and saying, we're going to do whatever we want to do and not be thoughtful about the risks, which are still apparent in the economy particularly because of high unemployment and Europe and some of those sorts of issues. So it's a steady and broad recovery, but it's got an element of caution to it. And I think on balance, that is the same view that we had a quarter ago.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And so your outlook's not really expecting anything? I mean, I assume you're expecting continued kind of softness in the short term corporate group?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, again, the biggest point here is that the recovery is steady and it is broad, and we expect that to continue to come. If you find the places where there are a bit of proof of the caution, we would say it was probably around short-term group bookings in Q1. And as we comb through our data, the bookings that were actually made in February for the near term were soft. But during the same month of February, when you look at total bookings that we made for the next 12 months and then for 2014 and the next 12 months after the next 12 months, they were actually up from the prior year. And so that tells us that we've got a recovery which continues to have strength. But again, it's not a free-for-all recovery.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins with Credit Suisse.","Joel H. Simkins - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of quick questions here. Obviously, you stepped up the leverage a little bit on the balance sheet given some of the buyback activity. Ultimately, where do you continue to feel comfortable with from a leverage perspective? And then what sort of tells you to exceed sort of the $800 million or, let's say, come to the high end of $800 million to $1 billion in capital return for 2013?","Carl T. Berquist","I think we'll continue to manage our cash flows to a 3- to 3.25-type leverage ratio that we've talked about before. We don't see a need or any reason to go beyond that or under that. That's working pretty well and given where the economy is. As far as -- so we'll stay in that same neighborhood. And that's a defined term relative to adjusted EBITDA with adjusted debt. As it relates to the $800 million to $1 billion return to shareholders, we continue to look at that. A lot of items that could occur, depending on how much we recycle in 2013, will drive if that number goes up some, as well as if opportunistic investments come up that we didn't see when we had the $600 million to $800 million that we talked about of capital investment but also have an effect on that number. But right now, as we look out for the rest of the year, the $800 million to $1 billion looks like it's still a good number.","Joel H. Simkins - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And if I may, one quick follow-up. You mentioned earlier some new brands. So I'm just curious what kind of traction you're seeing with EDITION right now. I sit across the street from one that's being constructed here in New York, so I see that going up on a daily basis. Just curious where that's tracking at this point.","Arne M. Sorenson","It's a beautiful building, isn't it?","Joel H. Simkins - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes.","Arne M. Sorenson","Thank you. Actually, the EDITION is building momentum. We will open in London, I suspect, right after Labor Day. Miami will open early next year and New York probably late next year. But beyond those 3 deals that we're doing on balance sheet, I think we've got a pipeline now of about a dozen. So the balance would be made up of third-party deals. Heavy mix in Asia, but we're seeing folks excited about the projects that we're doing and impressed by the commitment we've made at the brand, and we've got some good optimism about its future.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Nikhil Bhalla from FBR.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I had questions about just the government impact. So it seems like per -- what the government is directing all the federal agencies, they want the level of cutbacks to kind of hold until 2016 over and above, I think -- the base that they it set was 2010. I mean, how do you see that playing out over the next couple of years? Is this going to be a headwind that's going to be there for 2014 and 2015?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, Lord knows. I mean, I think the optimistic view would be that 2013 will limp through with respect to government business at about the kind of pace we're doing now. And obviously, that is clipping a bit the kind of REVPAR growth that I think would be posted otherwise. The good news, I suppose, in that is government business has already declined to a point where it's becoming less and less significant. And if they don't continue to cut from these levels, which I have been hopeful would be the case, we should see that by the time we get into 2014 and beyond. The comparisons are much easier, and there's no reason to believe the government business couldn't at least be flat, if not marginally positive. But at the same time, I think we would confess that we don't really know. We've got -- the nearest news is that maybe the debt ceiling date might be slipping into late summer or early fall. That would be about the time when budgets typically would be focused on and looked at. And we're congenitally [ph] optimistic that maybe we'll get to a point where we get something that's balanced and long term in its focus and I think optimistic that it shouldn't continue to hurt us at more than it's hurt us already.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it. And just on booking pace, it's about 4% right now for the rest of the year. I think it was more like 6% as of the last call. Looking at your 2Q guidance, it doesn't seem like you're seeing any softness on -- in 2Q. Is the concern more on the back half of the year?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, it's -- probably, Q3 is the relatively weaker time for the group business generally. You're talking about bulk of the summer being in that quarter. I think we'd be a bit more bullish about Q2 and about Q4 because of that kind of seasonality. But again, we talked about how group business was only up 1% in the first quarter. But if you include April and, as a consequence, get through that Easter comparison, it looks like about 6% for the first 4 months of the year. And all things considered, that's not bad.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just to continue that line of questioning on booking pace, I think the part I'm struggling the most is -- with is -- your booking pace for 2014, where it looks like things are pretty strong, up 5%. And I don't understand why corporate confidence would be high for 2014 but not high for 2013, which is closer. Is it because it's off of a much smaller base in 2014 that you -- that the numbers look bigger?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, it's a good question. I -- no, I don't think it's fundamentally because it's a lower base. It's a bit lower, but it's not dramatically lower. By this point for 2014, we'll probably have 40%, 45% of the group business on the books, I would think. And so we're building that book. And obviously, by the time we get to the end of the year, we should be something closer to 70%. Actually, we could be 50-ish now, maybe low 50s for the total business for '14 that's already on the books. And so I don't think it's that so much. But your -- yes, Steve, your question is a good one. Our guess is that again, we don't have corporations which are frightened about the future. We think they are growing. They're growing profits, and they're back in business in many respects. And probably, the longer-term bookings both, A, require more time to confirm the space, so there's a bigger risk if they don't book. And secondly, they're probably among the more important meetings that corporate groups hold, corporate clients hold, and the shorter-term stuff has probably got a bit more of a discretionary element to it. And so that -- in that discretionary area, the bit of caution which is still out there, the bit of uncertainty that's -- whether it's coming from Europe or high unemployment, whatever, that probably is having a bit more impact on the short term than the long term.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chris Agnew from MKM Partners.","Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Question on China. You called out, I believe, a low end of 2% to 4% growth. And given the government transition and easier comps in the second half, I guess I'm a little bit surprised. So 2-part question, if I may. First, maybe an update on your thoughts on the government transition in general. And then second, more -- and a little bit more specifically because we're hearing the government are encouraging officials to be low key and more austere. Any sense if this is temporary phenomena and more of a structural and permanent change?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. So China continues to be a favored market of ours. We think the long-term prospects for China are fabulous, and maybe an indication of that is we've got as many hotels and many hotel rooms under construction today in our development pipeline for China as we have already opened. And I think we signed 10 full-service hotels in China in the first quarter alone. And we see, particularly on these secondary cities, a clear need and a clear commitment to see that they're developed in a way that allows them to grow and be as compelling places for people to live as the Shanghais and Beijings of the world, and all that should be really helpful to us long term. I think in the short term, we've got 2 things going on. One is the transition of government and the government's focus on some continued austerity around government spending, particularly. And that is continuing and has continued now long enough after the announcement of the government transition that I think our expectations would be it'll be sticky and it'll stick around for a while. The other thing that's happening is we've got easier and easier comparisons as the year goes along. And I won't remember this exactly off the top of my head, but I think first quarter of '12, REVPAR growth in China was about 10%, 10% or 11%, something like that. And by the fourth quarter, we were in the 3% or 4% range. And it was essentially a straight line down. So the comparisons for the second quarter will still be reasonably tough. By the time we get to the fourth quarter, it will be meaningfully easier certainly than in Q1. And then, of course, you've got other little issues around the edge, little -- I shouldn't say little because that probably minimizes them more than they should be. But obviously, in January, we had lots of global press about pollution in Beijing, and Beijing was meaningfully weaker than Shanghai was. I think the pollution was a piece of that, and I think the focus of government on Beijing and its austerity was probably a piece of that. We're watching carefully to see what happens with the bird flu stories and whether that has an impact. There's thus far a few anecdotes, but we don't really think it's showing up in REVPAR numbers in a material way. But we'll watch all that. I think still long term, the story is a really exciting one for China.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Attie from Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, of the owned and leased profits of $36 million in the quarter, almost 80% of that, it seemed, was credit card, residential branding, and termination income. And I know there's a lot of variability quarter-to-quarter with some of those, but can you give us a sense for what the components of that owned and leased profit line item should be on a longer term or on an annual basis? I guess how much of it is recurring leased hotel profits and credit card fees versus more lumpy items because the quality is obviously different?","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. If you look at that line -- and I think we gave some detail in our 10-K or 10-Q. I don't have the numbers right here in front of me, but probably the credit card branding fees are pretty stable year in and year out, growing based on volume of that but not real choppy, whereas the residential branding fees, we get paid those fees on the closing of the residential, primarily The Ritz-Carlton-branded residential. So that is choppy and will -- depending on timing of when the residential closed and how many are in the pipeline, so to speak, that will continue to be choppy. I think this quarter and probably for the rest of the year, a lot of our leased hotels are located in Europe. And with Europe's current economic situation, our leased profits that are coming out of there are pretty anemic right now. And then on top of that, you have London, as I talked about, where you have very tough comps. And then on top of that, we have a couple of leased hotels, one in Europe, one in the Caribbean, that are very big hotels, but they're going to have significant renovations. So that's going to make it a little choppy as well as we go through the rest of this year.","Arne M. Sorenson","I think one thing to keep in mind on the owned-leased portfolio of hotels is the largest number of hotels there are leased hotels. And so you get -- depending on coverage of the lease payments, you can get sort of 0 net profit contribution or you can go up, obviously, meaningfully from that. So you've got...","Carl T. Berquist","Highly leveraged.","Arne M. Sorenson","You -- it's pretty highly leveraged numbers, yes.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And the $3 million termination fee, I know it's small in the context of the company, but was that a hotel that was important to the system? Or can you maybe just give us some detail on what that was?","Carl T. Berquist","Actually, it was -- there are 2 different ones in there. So it's not that big. And the bigger part of the 2 was a second payment, a continued payment we got from something that closed in a prior year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have a question on your incentive fees, which were very nice in the quarter. Not to get ahead of ourselves here, but if we look back historically -- and this is going to be a number of years back, but last time you were in kind of that kind of high 20s range and started to ramp. Within a few quarters, you ramped to 30 and then 40 and then on. I know we're in a different environment now -- and I'm talking percentages. I know we're in a totally different environment now than we were then, but can you just help us think through maybe, particularly in North America, on the incentive fee business side of things where owners are in terms of their hurdles?","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. Well, good news was that we were up on incentive fees and came from North America full-service hotels. When we look where it's at, with New York with -- resorts did extremely well. Remember in the first quarter, the resorts had 2 holidays. They had the year end as well as Easter. So we benefited from that. I think that what we're going to see is it's probably going to be choppy as we go through the year because the growth isn't as accelerated, as Arne mentioned earlier. However, we are getting a lot of the growth in REVPAR from rate, and that's helping margins at the hotel. You saw in the first quarter margin improved 170 basis points. So I don't think we're going to see the acceleration that you're referring to that we saw in the past, but I think it'll continue to grow. Keep in mind when you're looking at the percentages of hotels you still have all those select-service properties that we talked about in the past that dilute that number down a little bit.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Arne, I believe it was -- yes, it was this week. This week has been a blur. A competitor announced the cloud-based property and rate management system for its franchise-based and other independent brands and potentially larger chains. Just -- I'm sure you noticed that announcement. And given your large franchise network, I'm just wondering if this announcement interested you as a company. Is this a technology you would be interested in replicating? And how do you view this announcement competitively?","Arne M. Sorenson","You're just trying to prove how little I know about technology, Felicia, aren't you?","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, someone there must.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. We obviously have been paying attention to this flurry of earnings releases from our industry this week and haven't looked at it in detail. I'm not sure that what they're doing has any particular application in our system. We do have obviously a number of systems that support our properties, including the property management system, which we are working and are well advanced with our owners and franchisees on moving forward with the next evolution of the property management system that we have in place. And of course, we've got reservations platforms and other things, which become much more proprietary the more you get close to the actual booking of the rooms. So we'll keep our ears open, but I don't think that it's a new, relevant fact for us.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And would new franchisees to the Marriott system be allowed to have the choice to use your systems versus someone else's?","Arne M. Sorenson","In most significant -- with respect to most significant systems, the answer is no.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just maybe I'll start with a follow-up on the question on incentive fees. So Carl, could you just give us a sense of is -- like, has your outlook for that at all changed because the language, at least in the release, was a little bit more optimistic? So is that a little bit better in terms of full year than you probably had thought at the beginning of the year?","Carl T. Berquist","We're thinking -- well, I -- we're probably thinking mid-teens growth for the full year. It will be up in the U.S. We'll get more. Europe will be down a little bit, we think. So when everything all averages out, we're thinking probably mid-teens growth this year.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. It's not really dramatically different from probably where you were last quarter then, right?","Carl T. Berquist","More like fine tuning.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then the second question. Arne, in the prepared remarks, I didn't catch much on EDITION, but I know you're getting closer to opening at least one of the owned hotels. Could you talk a little bit about the opportunity to, I guess, push forward that brand and then secondarily to maybe recycle a little capital out of those hotels? And is that in the kind of the outlook for the $800 million to $1 billion of cash flow for this year?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I mentioned a few minutes ago how the nearing of opening of these 3 hotels that we're doing on balance sheet and the commitment that we've made through those 3 hotels has impacted the development pipeline. And I think there's lots of good stuff happening for EDITION globally. These 3 hotels are leading it, but there are good things that are following behind it. So all of that we're encouraged by. I think as we get closer to opening of London, we get to a place where we can start to talk more specifically about the prospects for recycling. We obviously intend to sell all 3 of these assets for internal planning purposes and even more so for external expectations. We don't think it's wise to expect that there will be recycling of that capital until after they open because before they open, you have not just the ramp risk, but you've got construction risk and other things which make a sale practically much more difficult. But the 3 that we've got are in great cities with tremendous momentum. You look at the capital, globally interested in owning fee real estate in London, and that's really comforting to us. You look at the way Miami is growing as a clear capital not only of a part of the region of the United States but really much of Latin America, and we feel great about that. And New York is, in many respects, a lot like London. It's a global safe haven for real estate, and what we've got there is an iconic building. So we feel good about the likelihood of recycling all of those but wouldn't expect -- wouldn't want you to expect that necessarily, we will be getting meaningful amounts of that capital back in, in 2013.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.","Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Thank you for the good color on group playing out over the next couple of quarters. I'm curious how you see business travel demand playing out in the next couple of months. Part of the reason I ask is I hear from my hotel contacts that while May looks decent, July looks very strong, June looks a bit softer now, and we're trying to figure out why this may be. I'm wondering if that's what you're seeing as well.","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, you\u2019re trying to read tea leaves, I think. I mean, business transient travel books days on average before it occurs. And so we've got -- of course, as compulsive as we are, we have transient and group revenue forecasts not just for every month but potentially for every week and every month. And what I look at shows June to be modestly lighter than May, but you're talking about being within essentially a point of each other, and our accuracy is much less than that when we're talking about being that far out. So I think the best news on transient is the strength that we had in the first quarter, and I think it shows that, that's a powerful indication of the breadth and strength of the economic recovery that we've talked about before.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Arne, as you speak to your customers, do you get any sense that -- a sense top line growth just generally in the country has slowed that they're wanting to just get more of their people on the road to drive their top line? Is that a catalyst behind the additional corporate demand?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think generally, the strength in transient is proof of that. In other words, our corporate customers are back on the road, and they're doing business. But I don't think -- maybe this is a little bit negative sounding. I don't think in the last quarter or 2 they have said, materially different way, okay, we want to ramp up dramatically the spending that you're doing. I think instead, they are continuing with something that they've been growing on the last few years. And at the same time, the -- well, we put comments about the short-term group bookings, I think, are the bit of a cautionary sign that they're going to be mindful about the spending. So they're not cutting, they are growing, but they're not growing with a sort of reckless abandon.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And a follow-up for Carl. Carl, after you back out the maintenance CapEx, your investment spending is estimated in the range of $500 million to $700 million. If you could give us some detail of what that entails. It always sort of falls into the same buckets. And if you could give us a sense of more precisely where is that money going.","Carl T. Berquist","Well, a chunk of it, $100 million or $200 million, about that, is going on the 3 EDITIONS that we're building. They're well on the way. It might even be higher than that this year. We spent about $85 million on investing activities during the first quarter. As I look at it, a big chunk of that was the construction costs. We're looking out and doing some loans this year. Not really identified yet, but we just see the cap stack and deals we're talking about might have some loans. And then the rest is probably -- you also have a big chunk of key money that just because of the volume of new deals that we're signing, you're getting an increase in the amount of key money commitments that we're making.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just on MOXY. I know you said you were going to outline some new brands in the months to come. But as you already talked -- or you already announced this one, can you just give us some thoughts around it? How big of a market opportunity do you see for it? And what are you going to do differently than other brands that are already in that segment of the market?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. The economy segment in Europe, we think, is 2 million rooms, about 40% of the total European lodging market. Prior to the announcement of MOXY, we did not have an entrant in that space. We announced it with, we think, one of the best partners or sets of partners we could have, both an operating partner we've done a number of deals with in the past and Inter IKEA, which is essentially the real estate arm affiliated but not directly tied to the IKEA retail business. And they come at it with incredible passion for it and, in some respects -- many respects, led us into this space. And so we come with a partner that we think has the prospect to get us not just the first 50 of these hotels but maybe a few multiples of that. And so we'll come out immediately with, I think, with good strength. There are interesting things which are happening on the margins in the economy space in Europe. But much of the economy business in Europe is made up of hotels that find a way to tell you every place you turn that you're in an economy product. In other words, they're not great experiences. And what we've got with hotel MOXY and the design that we've come up with, I think, will be very different than that. It will offer great value, but it will offer it in a way that really doesn't beat you up with a sense that you've got less. So we're really excited about it. And we're excited to be -- have an entrant in what is probably the biggest segment of the European lodging business.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joseph Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Carl, you mentioned that you'd expect within your guidance is embedded a mid-teens growth rate and incentive management fees versus last year. When you look at the North American side of things, how does that growth rate look?","Carl T. Berquist","I don't have it by continent right here in front of me, Joe, but I would say, as I mentioned earlier, we think North America will overperform as we continue to grow and REVPAR grows, especially from rate. But that will be somewhat offset by a little bit of the REVPAR slowdown in Asia as well as Europe. So I don't have the percentages in front of me, I apologize, but I would say that it all balances out to the 15. But we would expect North America to be the stronger of the continents out there.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then of the $500 million to $700 million of nonmaintenance CapEx investment spending, how much of that has been identified and committed to at this point?","Carl T. Berquist","Well, I would say most of it has at this point. It hasn't been necessarily committed, but it's been identified.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Loeb with Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Most of my questions were answered, but I want to follow up on one that Harry asked. Carl, you talked a little bit about key money and loans. Can you just talk a little more broadly about competitive trends and development financing, what you have to do to incent owners to either convert or build your brands, both in the U.S. and overseas?","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. I think as you look around the world, and we've talked about this in the past, in Asia, the Middle East, we really don't need to invest a lot of money, or periodically we will but relative to things. As you get into the U.S. and the European markets, there the competitive environment is such that we do make investments in the contracts. On any one contract, it's not a material number. But given the volume that we're doing is where you see it growing. I think in larger deals, whether it's big hotels or what have you, then we may help with the cap stack or put in a guarantee to be competitive. But in each of those cases, we look at that relative to the return to Marriott and our investment, making sure that, if it's in the case of a loan, that we can recycle it, get a good return. If it's key money, we obviously look at it relative to the contract we're getting. So a good example is the opportunistic thing we did with Gaylord. We put in what's equivalent of a couple of hundred million dollars of key money that's getting amortized. But clearly, that -- those contracts and that brand that we're getting far outweigh -- the value of those far outweigh that investment. So that's kind of the way we look at it. I don't think the trends have changed. Haven't seen a situation where we have to put more and more money in. I think it's more about what comes on to the market and then the competitive nature of it.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, it is still very much the minority deal that gets key money.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes.","Arne M. Sorenson","So the bulk of our growth in the United States in terms of number of new rooms or number of new hotels would be still the limited-service franchise brands. And by and large, those are not brands that we need to incentivize in any way. We have done some credit enhancing for senior debt for a few new-build projects. They tend to be urban, they tend to be managed.","Carl T. Berquist","Bigger.","Arne M. Sorenson","And they tend to be bigger limited-service hotels. But the bulk of those, there's no financial participation from Marriott. And in truth, there's -- we're talking about a handful of full-service hotels in the United States, not more than that. Then certainly still, I would think what, 60% or 70% or 80% of the hotels come in with no financial participation from Marriott whatsoever.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And on the change to the calendar year, I just want to say thank you. I know it was expensive and complicated and a lot of work for you guys and bumpy for all of us just in the transition period, but I think in the long run well worthwhile.","Carl T. Berquist","Much appreciated. Our finance team did a great job, and they appreciate that comment.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bob LaFleur with Cantor.","Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","A quick question on the balance sheet and a related cash flow question. Debt was up a little bit in the quarter, but I think you had a bond come due. How did you finance the higher debt levels? Was a commercial paper on the line? And then the second sort of semi-related question is could you just walk us through the rough math again and refresh our memories on how you get to the $800 million to $1 billion in available cash to send back to shareholders with the guidance you've given us for the operating numbers?","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. On the debt, we had a maturity in the first quarter, and that was paid off. We had, in effect, prefunded that. If you remember last year, late last year, we did a couple of bond offerings in 2012, one of which was really just taking advantage of low interest rates and prefunding the maturity that was in February. The debt you see on the balance sheet is primarily commercial paper. We're just using commercial paper. The rates are extremely favorable right now, and so we continue to finance the business with that commercial paper.","Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","So the credit line is still about 0 balance then?","Carl T. Berquist","Yes. Yes, you're talking about our revolver?","Robert A. LaFleur - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Yes.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, we haven't drawn on the revolver. We use that just as a backup for the commercial paper. So our revolver is $1,750,000,000. And as of right now, there's nothing outstanding on it. When you look at reconciliation, I'm going to go real high level here, but you can -- we can probably get you more after we file the Q here today. We're looking at net income in a range of $600 million to $650 million. We talked about the investment spending of $600 million to $800 million. We'll probably recycle about $100 million during the year of various things, whether they be note collections or sell some assets we have. Our depreciation runs around $150 million to $160 million. We'll generate about $100 million in cash tax savings, and then we'll get about another $100 million from working capital benefits, some changes in Marriott Rewards. And then because of the growth in EBITDA, we'll -- our borrowing capacity will go up, and that will generate anywhere from $250 million to $350 million. And then a couple of other things. We'll pay some dividends, issue some stock on the employee compensation plan. And if my math is right and you go through all those things, you'll get somewhere around $600 million to $800 million.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Arne, we all hear about supply growth at historically low levels here in the U.S., at least on a national level. But it feels like we're seeing signs of new construction or conversions to hotels in most cities. Do you think that purely urban supply growth is returning to its historical pace and it's really the, let's say, the suburban markets that are suffering in regards to new construction?","Arne M. Sorenson","Your question suggests that we're seeing higher supply growth in the cities and less in the suburbs?","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. Or just -- or have the cities maybe returned to a more normalized pace, what they're typically used to delivering?","Arne M. Sorenson","No, I don't think so. I mean, I was -- I went back and fiddled with our pipeline. You've got Smith Travel and Lodging Econometrics and a few others that look -- try and look at industry data, which we obviously take a look at, but looking at our own data as -- what we understand best. So we have 22,000 more rooms. Little -- a little bit more than that in our pipeline now than we did at the end of the first quarter of '12. And I sort of quickly was looking for what was that -- what are the major drivers of that. And basically, I get about 6 -- about 2\/3 of it is growth outside the United States. Of the growth in the United States, 80% of it is limited-service product. And that would be mostly suburban and\/or secondary\/tertiary cities, not urban core. The full-service rooms that are sort of the add, if you will, to our pipeline in the U.S. is a grand total of about 1,500 rooms, and 2\/3 of that is one urban convention center hotel. So there's essentially, other than a few of these convention center hotels, which depend on cities wanting them to happen and providing some financial support, we still see essentially 0 full-service development under way. And on the limited-service side, I think it is still very much a suburban phenomenon. I do think it's very much a low supply -- and that's our pipeline, of course. That's not openings. So that, in a sense, gives you a good picture of what we expect to open in the next 12 to 18 months, something like that.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's great color. And I guess maybe as a follow-up because you mentioned the convention center hotels. It feels like municipalities are getting a little more aggressive with incentives to create jobs and broaden their own tax base. Have you guys seen more municipalities reaching out to you guys? And now that you've had a little time with the Gaylord brand, do you think there's an opportunity to add more units around the country?","Arne M. Sorenson","Our teams are probably in discussions -- are about half a dozen maybe convention center hotels that have some level of city or regional support. I almost certainly would guess that, that is more than would have been the case in 2009 when we were in the depths of the recession but probably not quantitatively very different from a normal -- sort of normal environment. There is some regularity in cities looking to either have a convention center for the first time or more likely say, \"You know what? We've had this convention center for 15 or 20 years and we're no longer competitive. And therefore, we've got to figure out how to put us back on the rotation for the big association and group meetings.\" And so we're seeing some of that. Nashville will open its brand-new convention center here momentarily. It's a big box, beautiful building. And they will end up with a few hotels that open downtown Nashville that relate to that convention center. But that'd be one example. And again, I don't think it's materially different than what we'd see in normal economic times.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ian Rennardson with Jefferies.","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Going back to the share buyback, do you have a share price at which you would not be buying shares back or are you ambivalent to your share price in this sense?","Carl T. Berquist","Obviously, we take into consideration a lot of variables, and we do look at what we believe to be the intrinsic value of the company as we look at what we're buying and at what price we're buying. So a lot goes into that. But one of the big things is returning value to shareholders as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Arne, instead of focusing on REVPAR, let's look at expenses and looking out to 2014 where you have ObamaCare, you've got higher real estate taxes, labor costs on the rise, theoretically at least a full year of higher property taxes -- property insurance. Is that -- how big a threat as you think about that for next year? And many of those costs are borne by the owners, but that does impact your ability to get the incentive management fees. So just kind of give us your thought process. I mean, I know there's a lot of questions out there on these subjects, but what is your thought from an expense perspective next year?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I love that you asked, Bill. I mean, we delivered 160, 170 basis points in margins in the U.S. in Q1, 170. Well, one cautionary comment there, that's a hard number to translate from our prior 3 -- 3 of '13 period, first quarter in '12 to a 3 months of -- 12-month quarter in '13. But we don't think it's far off of what the state-to-state margin improvement is. And that is kudos to our operating team that are focused on essentially all elements of the P&L and making sure that we're doing as well as we can to drive through efficiencies in -- above-property and on-property expenses. When you look into 2014, certainly ObamaCare is the biggest new potential wrinkle in the cost profile. There is still a lot of work to be done before we'll have real clarity about what we think the costs are going to be. Our estimates today for the managed portfolio in the United States is about $60 million to $100 million. And that would be oh, I don't know, maybe about 0.5 point, so a 50-basis-point impact on margins. These are really rough numbers, though, Bill, so be careful about that. And obviously, these are system costs that will ultimately be borne by the hotel. We will pick up a share of that through incentive fees for the managed portfolio. We don't know what the number would be for the franchise portfolio, but in terms of number of rooms, the franchise portfolio is about the same as the managed portfolio in the United States. So that -- the numbers could be around the same order of magnitude. And we're just going to do everything we can to watch that and manage it. I suspect that it will not all hit in '14, that, one way or another, we'll see that some of this gets gradually implemented, and it'll probably more like a 2-year rolling impact than a 1-year rolling impact. And we'll have to see what happens with underlying medical cost growth during the same period of time because obviously, we have been seeing certainly above-inflation growth in medical costs for many, many years. And if you could see a few points of that curve bend, then the net impact would be less significant than that $60 million to $100 million. I'm not sure that...","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","If you've got...","Arne M. Sorenson","Oh, go ahead.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Sorry, go ahead.","Arne M. Sorenson","No, go ahead, Bill.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering, does your gut tell you that the pace of operating expense increase will accelerate in '14 so we'll have to do a little better top line growth or rely more heavily on rate growth to offset that? Is that a fair way of thinking about it?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, maybe modestly. I mean, with each passing year of the recovery, you end up with a greater risk that you're going to see some pressure on not just medical costs but on wages. And personally, I think we're more likely to see inflation go up than vice versa and that we'll have some modest impact. On the other hand, with each passing year, more of the REVPAR growth comes from rate. And obviously, REVPAR coming through rate is better for margins than REVPAR coming through occupancy. And I think it's way too early to be giving guidance for '14 and '15, but I think our expectations would be that we will, net-net, see margin growth above 100 basis points in each of those years, hopefully well above.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","One final question.","Arne M. Sorenson","Go ahead.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","One final question. How many hotels that were paying incentive management fees last year are not paying this year?","Arne M. Sorenson","You're just trying to stump us. We'll have to check on that\u2026","Laura E. Paugh","I'll -- we'll check it and I'll chat with you offline.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes. I assume it would be mostly European based, but it's just...","Arne M. Sorenson","I don't think it's probably very many.","Laura E. Paugh","I don't think there's very many.","Arne M. Sorenson","Certainly, if you focus on the U.S., I suspect it would be pretty unusual...","Laura E. Paugh","Yes, it would be an unusual situation.","Carl T. Berquist","Maybe it went into renovations or something.","Laura E. Paugh","Yes.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes.","Carl T. Berquist","It would be the odd man out.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Ian Weissman with ISI Group.","Ian C. Weissman - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","There's a lot of focus, when people talk about group business, the focus on the gateway cities, coastal cities. Just given your outsized presence in between the coasts and maybe even just secondary markets, can you talk about the trends that you're seeing and the improvement potentially in those markets relative to gateway cities?","Arne M. Sorenson","It's interesting. Well, I'll give you a couple of things. I'm not sure if it'll answer your answer your question exactly, Ian, or not. But if you look at Smith Travel for Q1, top 25 markets in the U.S. posted REVPAR growth about 3 points higher than all other markets in the United States. That's a reasonably good gap between -- and obviously, top 25 are not all coastal markets. Chicago would certainly be in there. I suspect Houston and Dallas are both in there. Denver is probably in there. But it probably -- I have to go check that list. It probably would not have included Indianapolis, as an example, or some other meaningful Midwestern cities. And so you get that gap, and you could say, well what's driving that. And I think you've got a few things. I think one is economic growth in the West -- on the West Coast is probably strongest. REVPAR for us in the West is probably -- as a region as a whole, has been very steady and strong. And so the economic growth is probably a little bit stronger. B, I suspect that those coastal markets are disproportionately dependent on transient business, not group business. And transient is stronger. I mean, you can hear our 8% transient growth in Q1 compared to about a 1% group growth in Q1. That's a pretty big gap between those 2. And at the same time, I think you look at markets like Nashville and Indianapolis, 2 that I've mentioned, those cities are doing well, and I think they're investing. Indianapolis has done a really fabulous job investing in the infrastructure downtown. They have created a great place for meetings, and I think the volume that they're getting because of that is quite strong. Nashville, the demand is good. Our team in Nashville is really excited about the future. And so I think there is every reason to believe that where the infrastructure is developed right, these cities can compete and can compete well. Does that answer your question, Ian?","Ian C. Weissman - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that [indiscernible]. Yes, it does.","Arne M. Sorenson","Okay. All right, thank you all very much. Bridget, you have anybody else in the queue? You said last question.","Operator","And there are no questions.","Arne M. Sorenson","All right. We appreciate all of your time and your interest in Marriott. I look forward to welcoming you into our hotels soon.","Carl T. Berquist","Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I will now turn the conference over to Arne Sorenson. Please go ahead.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. For those in the U.S., happy election day. We're pleased you're taking the time to listen to our earnings call, but we hope you also get to the polls today.","Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","Before we get started, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today are effective only today, November 8, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","There are several topics we want to cover today, including our third quarter financial results, third quarter business trends, fourth quarter guidance, and our early look into 2017. But first we want to talk about the Starwood acquisition and the integration.","This is the first earnings call for the new Marriott International. On September 23, we completed the most transformational transaction in the company's history. Including the pipeline, our global system encompasses nearly 1.6 million guest rooms today.","Our near term priorities are straightforward; reach out to associates to knit the company together culturally; seize, as soon as possible, top line synergies; property cost efficiencies and $250 million in G&A savings, and do all this while remaining focused on our ongoing business, providing great experiences for our guests and driving returns for our owners and franchisees.","Off to a fast start, our team did what no other large consumer company has accomplished. Within minutes after the merger closed, we linked three enormous loyalty programs, Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and Starwood Preferred Guest, further announcing that we would match member status between the programs. We immediately enabled our loyal travelers to earn points in one program and redeem in the other. In fact, over 3.3 billion points were transferred between the programs in the first month alone, while the first transfer and redemption reservation occurred just 15 minutes after we closed the transaction.","That effort did not go unnoticed by customers and commentators. Blogger Gary Leff, who writes at View from the Wing, noted to his readers that no program has ever set up a mechanism to link accounts this quickly. And my favorite quote came from a loyalty member who tweeted, don't know if I'm more excited about linking Marriott Rewards, or the fact that pumpkin spiced lattes are back.","Getting the loyalty programs right has been a big priority for us since the deal was announced. Today, we are pleased to confirm that only 16% of our combined 85 million members were members of both programs prior to the merger. This puts us in a tremendous position to capture incremental business. Immediately after closing, we also reached out to our largest B2B customers to tell them the great news and to begin cross-selling across our 30 brands.","For our group business, we've seen over 1,000 lead referrals through the end of October between the Starwood and Marriott portfolios. We are moving quickly to reduce costs, both in G&A as well as costs for our hotels. Procurement is a near term opportunity. Starwood-managed hotels will begin transitioning to Avendra, the purchasing platform used by Legacy-Marriott Hotels and many other companies in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Next year, we should see savings on OTA contracts. With its greater scale, Marriott has historically been able to obtain more attractive OTA contract terms. While savings to Starwood Hotels will vary by region, applying Marriott's contract terms should save Starwood owners OTA commissions, even assuming no change in OTA usage, with more savings expected in 2018.","We know that you are anxious to hear much more about our integration strategy and synergy opportunities. But let us ask you for your patience. The hotel business is about details. Every market is different and every property is different. We can tell you we've reviewed and assimilated a tremendous amount of information from Starwood over the last six weeks and that we remain as enthusiastic about the transaction as ever.","While the deal is very exciting, we are also focused on business fundamentals. While reported third quarter financial results included only eight days of Starwood results, today's outlook is drawn from an analysis of operating trends at both companies for all three months of the quarter. Our outlook for the fourth quarter and 2017 reflects the combined company.","Clearly, North American demand growth continues to moderate. In the third quarter, hotels with the weakest RevPAR were generally in oil and gas markets, or in gateway cities affected by continued weak international visitation, or impacted by new supply.","In the quarter, both Legacy-Marriott and Legacy-Starwood portfolios did well in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Toronto and Washington, D.C., while both portfolios saw RevPAR declines in Houston, New York, and San Francisco. On a combined basis, North America company-operated group RevPAR increased nearly 7%, benefiting from strong demand and a favorable holiday comparison. Catering revenue continues to be strong.","New group business is encouraging too. In the third quarter alone, Marriott and Starwood sales organizations booked a combined 3.6 million room nights for future periods. Measured by booked group revenue, the two companies booked 6% more business than in the prior year, with particular strength for stays in 2018 and beyond.","In contrast, corporate customers are clearly cautious. In our last earnings call, we mentioned the trend in room sales among Legacy-Marriott's largest 300 corporate customers in North America, from 4% RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2% in the first quarter to less than 1% growth in the second quarter. For this quarter, room revenue from Legacy-Marriott's top 300 customers was flat year-over-year, as higher demand from professional services, retail and healthcare firms was offset by lower demand from technology, financial, energy and manufacturing companies.","Looking ahead in North America, fourth quarter group RevPAR pace for our company-operated Marriott and Starwood full service hotels is down about 5%, reflecting tougher holiday comparisons combined with weak near-term corporate bookings. With greater availability, transient business should improve year-over-year. As a result, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR for the combined system-wide Marriott and Starwood portfolios in North America will be flat to up 1% in the fourth quarter.","Outside the U.S., third quarter performance of the Marriott and Starwood brands was very similar when adjusting for differences in geographic distribution. Across both portfolios in the Caribbean and Latin America region, RevPAR growth was very strong in Brazil and Mexico, but was constrained by Zika in the Caribbean, weak economic growth in South America, and new supply in Central America.","For the fourth quarter, we expect Zika will continue to be a problem for the combined portfolio, and without the Olympics, we expect Brazil hotels will more acutely feel the effect of their weak economy. As a result, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR for our hotels in the region will be flattish with the prior year.","In the Middle East and Africa, easy Ramadan comparisons took Marriott and Starwood RevPAR higher in the third quarter, along with greater leisure business in South Africa and strong regional demand in Cairo. At the same time, many oil markets remained weak. Without the benefit of a holiday shift, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR for our combined portfolio in the region will decline at a low single-digit rate.","In the Asia-Pacific region, Marriott and Starwood saw third quarter RevPAR improvement in India, South Korea and Shanghai, with declines in the Maldives, Macau and tertiary markets in China. In the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR for the combined portfolio should be flattish year-over-year, constrained by the cancellations that followed the death of the king in Thailand.","In Europe, Marriott and Starwood occupancy in Paris, Brussels and Istanbul was weak in the third quarter, while our UK properties welcomed a greater number of Middle East travelers in the quarter. Hotels in Poland, Russia and Spain reported strong RevPAR growth.","For the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR for the combined portfolio to be flattish year-over-year due to lingering terrorism concerns, weak group pace in London, Paris and Amsterdam, and tougher comparisons in Poland and Russia. Bottom line, we expect worldwide constant dollar system-wide RevPAR will be flat to up 1% in the fourth quarter.","Looking ahead to 2017, our North America outlook assumes a steady-as-she-goes economy and modestly higher supply growth. For the 2017 full year, North America revenue group pace for company-operated full service hotels across the Marriott and Starwood portfolios is currently up about 2%. For transient business, we expect current weak corporate demand to persist, although comparisons should get easier.","We are targeting a higher volume of special corporate rate business for the coming year and expect special corporate room rates for comparable customers to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in most markets. We are aggressively marketing to leisure guests and adding contract business at attractive rates. As a result, for 2017, we expect North America RevPAR for the combined portfolio will be flat to up 2%. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, North American fee revenue from the combined Marriott and Starwood portfolios totaled 70% of worldwide fee revenue.","Outside North America in 2017, we expect incremental constant dollar system-wide RevPAR for the combined portfolio will be flat to up 2%. RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America regions should also be flat to up 2%, reflecting good performance in Mexico and Central America. In 2015, Caribbean and Latin America pro forma fee revenue from the Marriott and Starwood portfolios totaled 4% of worldwide total fee revenue.","For the Middle East and Africa region, South Africa and Cairo should be strong, but we also see continued weak oil markets and risk of political disruption. As a result, we believe RevPAR will be flattish in the region in 2017. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Marriott and Starwood's Middle East and Africa region contributed 5% of worldwide fee revenue.","For 2017, the combined portfolio in the Asia-Pacific region should see continued strength in India and Shanghai, more than offsetting weakness in Macau and tertiary markets in China, yielding a RevPAR increase at a low to mid-single-digit rate. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Asia-Pacific region fee revenue totaled 13% of worldwide fee revenue, with about half of that coming from Greater China.","And finally, for Europe, we expect low single-digit RevPAR growth in 2017, with particular strength in Southern Europe and easier comparisons in Paris and Brussels. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Europe contributed 8% of worldwide fee revenue. On a worldwide basis, we expect 2017 RevPAR will be flat to up 2%.","Turning to development. For 2016, we expect our combined company should grow global rooms distribution by roughly 5% net of deletions. Project delays at both Marriott and Starwood have pushed a few openings to early 2017, but new deal signings remain very strong. As of quarter end, our combined pipeline totaled nearly 420,000 rooms. For 2017, rooms growth should accelerate to roughly 6% net of deletions.","In the U.S., the combined Marriott and Starwood brand portfolio represent 14% of open rooms. Again, we have an industry-leading 36% of rooms under construction in the U.S., and 23% of rooms under construction worldwide. To be sure, leverage levels on new construction loans have moderated and construction costs are also increasing. While these conditions are not likely to change supply growth in the near term, we believe they should discourage marginal new projects from moving forward. They should also enhance our share of new construction as lenders continue to favor the strongest brands.","Incidentally, our combined portfolio of hotels gained RevPAR Index globally in the third quarter and we are optimistic that we will see further gains as we realize revenue synergies. We continue to be optimistic about the Starwood acquisitions. Six weeks after closing, we've accomplished a great deal. We will continue to do the hard work necessary to be the best hospitality company for our owners, franchisees, associates, guests and for you, our investors.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny for a review of our financial results and some additional color on the fourth quarter and 2017. As I do, let me first offer my thanks to Leeny and the finance teams across Marriott and Legacy-Starwood. Closing our acquisition just eight days before the end of the quarter was not ideal. But they scrambled and they did it beautifully. Thank you all.","Leeny?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you, Arne. As you saw last evening, we reported diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.26. GAAP results were constrained by $237 million of merger-related costs, including $186 million of severance and retention costs, $24 million of transition costs, $18 million of transaction costs, and $9 million of interest expense, partially offset by the eight days of Starwood's operating results.","To provide visibility into Legacy-Marriott's performance in the quarter, we've adjusted third quarter results by backing out the eight days of Legacy-Starwood results and merger-related costs, as well as confirming the share count. As a result, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the Legacy-Marriott business totaled $0.91, a 17% increase over the prior year.","Compared to our July 27 guidance, adjusted fee revenue was $6 million below the midpoint of expectations due to more modest RevPAR growth and lower than expected application and relicensing fees. Still on an adjusted basis, our operating income of $378 million exceeded our guidance of $370 million to $375 million, as we saw good performance on our owned, leased and other net line, lower than expected depreciation and amortization expense, and better than expected G&A spending due to solid cost controls and some open positions.","Adjusted fee revenue for the Legacy-Marriott business increased 6%, with incentive fees up 13% in the third quarter. While Legacy-Marriott RevPAR and unit growth drove fees higher, fees were constrained by $9 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. Worldwide house profit margins for Legacy-Marriott increased 90 basis points for company-operated hotels, as many hotels are already focused on cost containment in a slower RevPAR growth environment.","Strong results at our owned and leased hotels reflected recently completed renovations in Tokyo and Charlotte, the addition of two new hotels in Rio de Janeiro, which benefited from the Olympics, and stronger branding fees. Adjusted G&A increased 3% year-over-year. The increase in interest income reflected a larger portfolio of loans. Marriott's third quarter adjusted EBITDA, which excludes merger-related costs, totaled $474 million, a 10% increase over the prior year.","So let's talk some more about the transaction. We've presented selected pro forma third quarter information on page A16 of the press release, assuming the Starwood acquisition and Starwood sale of its timeshare business had been completed on January 1, 2015, but using the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities as of the actual closing date of the acquisition. Incidentally, we expect to provide a more detailed pro forma income statement for historic quarters in the next couple of months after we fine-tune purchase accounting estimates. So combining Marriott's and Starwood's information, pro forma fee revenue totaled $723 million for the third quarter, an increase of 5.5% over the prior year, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth.","Owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct costs, totaled $166 million, an increase of more than 21%. As I mentioned earlier, Marriott owned and leased hotels benefited from recently completed renovations in the Olympics in the third quarter.","Results for Legacy-Starwood owned and leased hotels were also strong, particularly in Hawaii, Toronto, and Brazil. Starwood RevPAR at comparable worldwide owned and leased hotels increased more than 8% in the third quarter, with particularly strong profit flow-through.","For the fourth quarter, we expect fee revenue should total $695 million to $705 million, an increase of 1% to 2% over prior-year pro forma fees. Our fee growth reflects roughly 5% unit growth. Fees are growing slower than units due to modest RevPAR growth in North America, lower RevPAR in the Middle East, and resulting lower profit flow-through and a modest decline in incentive fees. We also expect some negative FX impact, the impact of several contract changes, and some givebacks of IMF recognized earlier in 2016.","We expect fourth quarter owned, leased and other, net of direct expenses, should total roughly $150 million to $155 million. In the year-ago quarter, pro forma owned, leased and other net included $3 million from hotels that have since been sold by Starwood and $11 million in termination fees.","While Arne outlined our RevPAR expectations for the fourth quarter and 2017, in case you have a different view, we estimate that one-point change in our RevPAR outlook across today's combined Marriott-Starwood system, assuming it was evenly distributed, would be worth about $35 million in fees and roughly $8 million for owned, leased and other net.","We expect depreciation and amortization will total $70 million to $75 million. Excluding merger-related costs, we expect G&A to total $235 million to $240 million in the fourth quarter, 16% to 18% lower than the pro forma prior year. Our anticipated fourth quarter 2016 G&A results should benefit from $8 million from a legal settlement, while the pro forma fourth quarter 2015 G&A included $5 million in Marriott merger-related costs. Fourth quarter operating income should total $530 million to $555 million, a 9% to 14% improvement over 2015 pro forma levels.","As Arne described, we're working hard to integrate the companies as quickly as possible. We expect to finalize the organization structure for most regions and departments during the fourth quarter, but some may not be complete and in place until mid-2017. During 2017, we will also have wind-down costs included in G&A, related to some duplicate systems, facilities and other areas of overlap. As a result, estimating quarter to quarter G&A in 2017 is challenging, but we expect to see significant progress toward our expected $250 million in G&A savings during the year. We expect to realize the vast majority of the savings by 2018.","For depreciation and amortization, you may recall that we estimated Marriott's standalone depreciation and amortization at roughly $130 million for 2016 during our last earnings call. In the 8-K filed on March 25, 2016, we estimated a run rate for incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction would total $209 million annually. Combined with Marriott's standalone D&A would imply a $339 million annual D&A run rate for the combined company.","Now that the transaction is closed, we've completed a preliminary allocation of our purchase price to the fair value of Starwood's assets and liabilities, which will be included in our upcoming 10-Q likely to be filed tomorrow. This current view puts incremental D&A at closer to $140 million to $150 million annually and puts total D&A for the combined company at a roughly $270 million to $280 million run rate.","Compared to our prior depreciation and amortization estimates, our current view reflects updated information, a refined analysis of the value of the acquired assets and liabilities, the impact of Starwood's successful asset sales year-to-date and the classification of several owned assets today as assets held for sale.","Purchase accounting rules provide a timeframe of up to one year from the date of acquisition to update allocations based on new information learned about the asset values as of the date of the acquisition. Therefore, in the coming year, there could be changes to these allocations and resulting catch-ups could impact our P&L on the D&A line.","We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchases. For the full year 2016, we estimate actual investment spending will total $425 million to $475 million. Included in this amount is roughly $75 million for investment spending for Legacy-Starwood brands in the fourth quarter. The Legacy-Marriott amount is about $125 million lower than last quarter's estimate, largely due to fewer development-related investments than previously expected.","When we announced the proposed acquisition of Starwood, we outlined the opportunity to sell owned hotels for $1.5 billion to $2 billion over two years. Of this amount, Starwood has already completed the sale of five hotels for $325 million.","Today, we own 15 hotels operating under the Starwood brand. In 2016, we believe these owned hotels could generate EBITDA of approximately $180 million to $190 million. Eight of the hotels are in North America, with the remainder largely located in Latin America. We believe we can monetize these hotels for north of $1.5 billion, with the North American assets likely to be sold relatively faster. We also believe there may be an opportunity to monetize some of Starwood's joint venture interests which could recycle additional capital. At this time, we aren't prepared to offer an estimate of proceeds.","Our balance sheet is in a better position than we anticipated. As you know, the transaction took over 10 months from announcement to closing. During this time, both companies accumulated cash from operations, as well as proceeds from asset sales. Additionally, in conjunction with the transaction, Starwood used excess cash to reduce debt balances by nearly $800 million. As a result, at the end of the third quarter, Marriott had $8.8 billion in total debt and $1.1 billion in cash.","As part of the acquisition, we reorganized the company's entity structure to facilitate the combined company's global operations. Given the new entity structure put in place as part of this reorganization, we expect global cash balances will continue to decline in the near term.","Our debt ratio at September 30 is better than our earlier forecast by roughly 40 basis points, driven fairly equally by improved EBITDAR, higher overall cash balances from the delay in the transaction, higher confidence in our ability to use all of Starwood's cash and then to a lesser extent, better estimates of our increased lease commitments as a result of the transaction.","We believe today that we are within the range of our targeted 3x to 3.25x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR credit standards, excluding the impact of merger-related costs and charges. As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases this quarter.","We know that you're eager for more information about the combined company. We will have much more to say about 2017 in February and when we hold our Analyst Day in March. But as you can tell, for now we feel very good about our brands, our business and our progress in integrating Starwood.","Now let's get to your questions. So that everyone gets a chance to participate, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of David Loeb with Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Wow. Thank you for taking me first. Good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","How about that. Good morning, David.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I appreciate that. There's a lot of interesting stuff to discuss in this and a lot of really good progress. But I want to focus on one particular issue, which is the ongoing book direct initiative. And I wonder if you can give us an idea about how you're viewing that relative to the owners? What impact you think that's having on RevPAR, on ADR in particular? And do you think the owners are seeing an offsetting or partially offsetting decrease in OTA commissions as a result of that initiative?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, I \u2013 it's a good question David. I wish we could be more definitive about it. I think it's still relatively early in assessing the impact of this. What we've seen so far is encouraging to us. But I think, fairly, we don't have statistics that we can use that would prove to you that we have delivered true success from this yet. But the early statistics, we see a high level of signups, I think something like 800,000 or 900,000 incremental Marriott Rewards signups since member only rates were launched. I think we are getting through the din of the marketing battles.","As we've talked about in the past, there was a perception that rates at our hotels were cheaper on channels other than our own, which has not been true for well over a decade. And we wanted to really find a way to break through that noise and make sure folks knew that they could get competitive rates by booking directly with us and going so far as to say there's a bit of a discount, actually, if you book directly with us we thought was a powerful way to get there. And so we're seeing good pick-up of that marketing message, good stickiness with the loyalty program.","Obviously, though, the discounts are available to folks who would have booked directly previously, as well as folks who might be booking directly now for the first time, and that has \u2013 continues to have a very modest impact on RevPAR. We think in Q3, probably about 30 basis points. And we'll watch it as we go forward. Obviously, this is something we talk with our owners about with some regularity, and I think generally the community to include us and our owner partners is supportive of continuing to pursue this. So it's all systems go.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And on the cancel\/re-book technology, what are your latest thoughts? I know I've asked this before, but what are your latest thoughts on how you might combat the impact of that technology going forward?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, the first thing to note is we don't see a material impact from that yet in any event. So we obviously continue to watch it. We're looking at cancellations generally, what's happening across our portfolio, and we're looking at it in individual markets. And I think stay tuned. That's something we'll continue to watch.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you all very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Smedes.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, Smedes.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. I wanted to just ask, you know, you're taking a little bit more of a conservative stance on your RevPAR outlook for 2017 versus your largest U.S. competitor. You're at 0% to 2%. And I was just kind of curious, what do you think you're seeing now that were a few weeks further on here than when they reported that maybe has kind of changed your view? Or are you just sort of just taking a more conservative outlook given what you're seeing in the economy?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","We obviously don't know exactly how they came to the, what range that they've provided when they released earnings. So it's a little difficult for us to provide a real detailed comparison. Having said that, listening to the words that they used and going through our own process, I think there's a couple of things that we would say. One is, I think we would be providing exactly the same guidance if we were simply Legacy-Marriott. So the first thing to point out is this is not a range which is driven by the recently completed merger with Starwood.","I think the second thing, and my guess is this is more or less the full explanation you'll get, is that we expect GDP to continue with the sort of anemic numbers that have been posted in 2016 as we go into 2017 and beyond. And it sounded as if one of our largest competitors was expecting a rebound of some sort in GDP. We hope they're right. Obviously, if GDP performs stronger, that will increase demand strength in our business, but we're building a model that essentially assumes we'll continue to bump along at the levels we've been at.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just sort of on that, I think on your last call you noted that group RevPAR was pacing up 7% in 2017 and you called it to 2% now. Is that pace of deceleration kind of normal as you move through towards the end of the year? Or is that a faster pace than what you would have expected?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I think it's faster than we would have expected. If you go back to the full year, I think we started \u2013 and Laura can maybe pull this out as we talk \u2013 but I think we started 2016 with group business up almost 10% for 2017 compared to where we were at the first of 2015 for 2016. And I think we cautioned folks that that was not likely to hold because as we got farther into the year, we would see that we could book less because we had less capacity. And so we expected that we would tail down towards the maybe mid to high single digits. But I think the experience in the last quarter or so going from roughly 7% to roughly 2% is worse than we anticipated.","I think there are a couple of \u2013 one positive thing that can be said next to that, when you look at bookings done in Q3 for all future periods, we were up about 8%, if memory serves. So people are still making commitments on group business and there's good growth. But when you look at the near term, when you look at group bookings in the year for the year, or you look at group bookings for the next 12 months, we see less robustness there. And to us that's a sign of some caution by corporate customers probably particularly who \u2013 in the sense that's where group business gets most like corporate transient business too. And there I think we're seeing companies be just a bit cautious and probably reflect the sort of anemic GDP growth environment that we've been all operating in.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the additional color.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. I wonder if you can give a little bit of color on, it looked like the percent of properties \u2013 I think this is just Legacy-Marriott properties -- paying incentive management fees was down year-over-year. I wonder if you could give a little bit of color around that.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Right. Overall, we've got Legacy and Marriott. Just a couple interesting facts for you is that, in general, the percentage of hotels earning incentive fee for Starwood is slightly higher than Marriott given their international exposure. For us, it's actually down year-over-year only barely, only by one percentage point difference. So it's not really anything meaningful. And really is again reflection of certain markets experience for RevPAR.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then I wonder if you can give a little more color around the cut in the CapEx budget just for the Legacy-Marriott properties since three months ago, down by about $125 million. So it's a pretty significant percent of the full year budget that changed in the last three months, if you could give a little color. Thanks.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure. As you know as we begin a year, we have a range of projects that we're looking at. Overwhelmingly, they're identified. And what happens as we move through the year, you're looking at the pace of those deals and, in general, I would say it's just that the deals continue to move forward, but they've been pushed out a little bit. So I don't think it's a reflection of deals dropping away, but more that they're taking a bit longer to put together. It ties in with what you're hearing in the lending environment that lenders are at the margin a bit more cautious. And as we're looking at, in some cases, putting in mezzanine loans, they're taking a bit longer to put the deals together. But they continue to be in our pipeline and we look forward to doing them as we move forward.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Morning, Harry.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","How are you?","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning. I'm great. Thank you very much. The owned and lease segment was particularly strong. It's been strong all year. Can you talk about the components of that? And as you look into 2017, what would you expect to remain strong and what's going to face a tough comp?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","So, hi, Harry. Thanks very much. So a couple things. I think when you look overall, let's first talk a little bit about Legacy-Marriott. Legacy-Marriott had strong owned, lease performance for its owned, leased hotels and then particularly strong performance on the branding fee side where we've had meaningful growth year-over-year compared to 2015. As you go into 2017, we're just in the process of putting our budget together now. So we wouldn't really be able to comment on anything specifically. But as you look at kind of tough comps across the board, again, we're continuing to look for our owned\/leased portfolios to do well.","And for the branding fees to continue, we've got a great pipeline of projects to continue to do well. I think the part I would point out is the owned\/leased portfolio on the Starwood side, we clearly are seeing the impact of their sold hotels. So as you look at that going forward, you would see the owned\/leased profits related to that that would kind of, on a year-over-year basis from 2017 to 2016, decline. And then you've probably got a couple one-off, like the Olympics in 2016, but again, the biggest impact, I think, will be the change in owned hotels on Starwood side.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. And just moving to the second question, I was really interested and may have missed something in \u2013 has there been a change in the way that you calculate your leverage ratio by incorporating or moving to EBITDAR? The reason I ask is that, is that part of the reason why you've achieved your target leverage ratio? And I'm guessing that the rating agencies are fine with it.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, so no change. No change in the way that we construct the ratio. As I pointed out in my comment, there were some changes relative to the calculation that we gave you a number of months ago based on better information. So whether it was the fact that you had better performance, particularly in Starwood's owned\/leased portfolio where I talked about them being able to produce $180 million to $190 million of EBITDAR in 2016, to better information on the lease adjustment, for example, that's in addition to the debt in your calculation of total adjusted debt for your leverage ratio. So it really is better information than it is a change in the actual way, the methodology that we use in the calculation. And as I talked about in my comments, it kind of falls across a number of categories, including those items, and frankly, more cash.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So all systems go with respect to share repurchase then over the next even three months?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yes.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","(40:20).","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. So not to push, because I know you've all worked very hard, but it does look like you're well on your way to achieving your synergy goals. So wondering if there's any chance on surpassing those on the cost side. And I know it's early, but can you give us any color of maybe some early wins you might be having on the revenue side?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I think the $250 million that we've talked about for G&A savings is still your -- the right target. It's certainly the target we're managing against. That is not a conservative external target which looks different from the target that we've got internally. And so, I would continue to look at that.","To state the obvious, with eight days only of Starwood in Q3, I think it's difficult for you \u2013 for us, let alone you, to conclude how much of that $250 million we've achieved so far. But we're getting underway. We're getting underway very quickly. And as you can tell from our preliminary comments, we're really trying to set up the organization as quickly as we possibly can so that the change to people is behind us and so that people can be looking forward. And so we'll move at that.","I think just to state the obvious, 2017 will be a bit messy because we'll have transaction and transition costs that will help you understand as each quarter is reported. They're a bit difficult, really, honestly, for us to predict by quarter at this point in time. But we remain optimistic by the time that we get towards sort of 12 months from closing, the lion's share of that $250 million, at least from a run-rate basis should have been achieved. We can't tell you sitting here today that we know for certain that every final dollar of that will be achieved by 12\/31\/17. I suspect there could be some areas where we're running duplicate systems or something else that creates some costs to slop into 2018, but we'll be very close. And to the extent we don't achieve the year-end, we'll, I think, get it fairly quickly in 2018.","I think in terms of synergies for the hotels, both top line and bottom line, we talked obviously about the loyalty program. I think the early response from our customers about linking those programs and matching status is very comforting and that is exactly the kind of response we want and expect. It will hopefully drive larger share of wallet for us with an even larger loyalty community. And obviously, that's what we're focused on.","And then on the cost side, we obviously talked about procurement. We talked about OTA commissions, but we're looking at essentially every relationship that the two companies have, whether they be about cost of systems that are proprietary to us, or third-party contracts. We're trying to make sure we deliver using the economies of scale that we've got and think that we can deliver top and bottom line improvements for our hotel owners in both portfolios.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then when you think about your unit growth going forward and you gave us some, or I guess maybe gave us some guidance, or one of you did, at the beginning of your prepared remarks. I'm just wondering, are you seeing an invigorated interest in the Starwood brands? And as you now market a consolidated portfolio to your owner and developer base, I'm just wondering, could there be upside to your unit growth forecast?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, the openings obviously are overwhelmingly driven by deals that we've already signed. Maybe even (44:05).","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I guess I was talking more about your pipeline.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, pipeline will be interesting. I think we are very optimistic that brands like Aloft and Element, which are very interesting from a customer perspective and I think have been something that the franchisee community particularly in the United States has looked at and been interested in. We have already seen that there is a strong appetite to grow those brands. I think Starwood saw that even before we closed the transaction with significant increase in the signings for those brands in the United States and we'll focus on those. We'll continue to make sure that we refine them without changing the kind of customer idea that they've got and we think we'll see growth of those brands accelerate quite significantly.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Helpful. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Patrick.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I'd like to dig in a little bit more into the falloff of the group pace. Specifically, falling from 7% to 2%, what was it with the composition? Was it the occupancy or the rate or perhaps both that had really tailed-off in there?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, one thing we should specify is, we're comparing apples to oranges here just a little bit. The 7% is Legacy-Marriott. The 2% is the combined company. And we probably should have helped you a little bit better with that, I suppose, in the release that we put out. I think if you look at simply Legacy-Marriott, it's more like a decline from 7% to 4%. Now that's still a decline and it's still a decline of three points. So let's not use those statistics in a way that suggests your question isn't still relevant. I think the bulk of the impact is in volume. In other words, no, it's not rate. And it's simply this relative caution about near-term commitments. And, again, it would simply be repeating what we said a few months ago, but that is really mostly a corporate story, mostly near-term caution that does not seem to be impacting the kind of commitments they make longer term.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. So Starwood came in with a sort of a weaker growth rate versus your Legacy. And I may have missed it. Did you give out statistics on 2018 for group pace at this point?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","All we said was that the bookings in Q3 for all future periods were up about 8% or 9% compared to what we booked in Q3 of 2015 for all future periods, which is positive. The 2018 numbers are up high single-digits, very high single-digits. I don't think they're quite 10%, but I think they're very close. And Laura will keep me honest here and make sure that we know which portfolio we're talking about.","Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.","Legacy-Marriott for 2018 is up about 9%.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Legacy-Marriott.","Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. That's it.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the deal close. So my first question is on the fee growth that you guys experienced and the outlook for the fourth quarter. So on a pro forma basis, I think the commentary was you're looking for 1% to 2% growth, which is probably a little lower than what we were looking for. Leeny, I know you broke out a few items that were headwinds in that number, but I was wondering could you give us a little bit more clarity or quantification on some of those and specifically the reversal on the incentive management fees?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. I think at this point, we wouldn't get into specific numbers, but I think you could see high single millions in terms of year-over-year, in terms of the delta, in terms of what kind of you're looking at across the board from the two companies having to suffer from everything from the Middle East to what was a change in FX and the impact of RevPAR going forward. So I think it's overwhelmingly incentive fees. And base and franchise are going to look a lot more normal relative to the growth in units and the growth in RevPAR. There are a few contract changes here and there that could impact the difference between franchise and managed, per se, but overall when you look at base and franchise, they're going to look very much in line with what goes on with RevPAR and unit growth. It's really incentive fees where you're going to see this combination of effects.","The other thing, again, year-over-year, when you kind of adjust and look for full year, I think that is important to look at because you've got some quarter to quarter variations that affect this that when you look at the full year 2016 to 2015 on a combined legacy basis, you'll get something that looks much more like the mid single digits which you would expect overall from the portfolio given the RevPAR and unit growth.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. And then maybe we can take that forward as we think about next year and probably again thinking about the overall, but maybe the IMF in particular. As you think about the RevPAR outlook that you provided, and I know you don't want to get into giving specific guidance this early on, but just directionally is it possible for IMFs to be positive next year in an environment where RevPAR is only growing with the outlook that you provided 0 to 2% and we're starting to see house profit margins probably peaking or starting to erode a little bit?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","So a couple of comments. First of all, clearly next year, with the kind of RevPAR that we've outlined, we would be thrilled to end up with flat margins. We have done an incredible job with margins in the RevPAR environment that we've had this year. And perhaps in some respects, you could argue that we've gotten margin that now we will be happy to keep in terms of the margin improvement. So, I think on that standpoint, I wouldn't look to see higher IMFs as a result of any margin improvement with essentially what is a pretty low RevPAR environment. Now, we would expect to have unit growth and we expect to have unit growth internationally, which is going to obviously help our IMFs given the construct of our contracts there.","Where it is tough to predict is this issue of where. For example, when you look at the Middle East this particular quarter that we're looking at, in Q4, you clearly see the dramatic impact of lower RevPAR on our IMF as we go into Q4. So I think that's where we need to get into the details on our budgeting process to look at the tradeoff between unit growth, internationally, as well as RevPAR, as well as then the performance of specific markets and what happens to their IMFs. So it's possible, but certainly too soon to tell at this point.","Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.","Shaun, you should also remember that for Marriott legacy in 2015, we earned about half of our incentive fees outside the U.S. but combined with Starwood now, we're probably at about two-thirds of our incentive fees come from outside the U.S. So we're a more international company than we were in the past.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Thank you both.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hello, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, folks. Good morning. Just, first question for Leeny. I was just trying to get my arms around the prospect of any kind of significant investment you see in technology going forward. And now that you've had some time with Starwood systems, can you talk about where you are at with just integrating all the major technology systems, reservations, accounting and what not so it's efficient for employees but also from a seamless consumer experience, whether it's mobile apps or the ability to do digital key and what not.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure. You've definitely outlined our next 18 months. We are heavily involved in every single one of the systems that you described. I think you can start at the easy place, which is thinking about the hotels, and actually the way that they operate. And we are looking at putting them all onto the same back office system that we have at the Marriott Hotels. And that's a process that we'll be getting into absolutely as soon as we can. As we look at the reservations and the loyalty platforms, clearly there is a massive amount of work to be done. And it also, we need to take into consideration our relationships with our credit card and timeshare partners, and a lot of technology work in looking at what exactly it will take.","So we can't give you a specific timeframe yet on the exact timing. But certainly moving in that direction. And as far as the fundamental systems of everything from company payroll and the way the hotels work, we are moving so that well into 2017 we will have everybody on the same system.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's useful. And maybe for Arne, there's been no shortage of ink spilled about the need for 30 plus brands. I think that question probably comes up just because of the subtlety of differences in pricing and positioning and the argument that every brand adds some degree of marginal cost. I guess in that regard, can you maybe talk about the incremental cost of operating another brand? And is it your longer-term plan maybe to provide more differentiation between brands so that (54:34) focus?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. We've said a couple of things here that are sort of obvious. I think if we had not merged with Starwood, would we be trying to build 30 brands from scratch? I think the answer is probably not. At the same time, having done this deal, the 30 brands all exist. They all have substantial capital that has been invested in them, particularly by the hotel owners who have made deliberate bets about which flag they put on their hotels. And we don't have the power to, nor the desire to, try and convince them that those bets have not been good bets.","I think the other thing that's really important to recognize here is the biggest expense from a brand perspective, in theory, is about marketing the brands. And, obviously, that's the most expensive when each brand has to be marketed on its own. And in that context, you would want as much definition as you could have between brands. And it would still be expensive to go out and market each one alone. I think in many respects that's no longer our model, if it ever was. I think the principal model today is we go to market through our loyalty platform, through our dot com site, through our app. And those things allow us to essentially market a portfolio and offer through that portfolio an incredible range of choice to our customers, which drives, actually, conversion from looking to booking that much higher and makes the economics of each brand better, not weaker. And so you put all that together, and I think that's why we conclude that we're going to keep these brands and we're going to continue to grow them. I don't really think that there are material incremental costs to having a brand given that that's the business model that we have.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","I just wanted to follow up a little bit about your outlook for 2017. You talked about corporate negotiated rates being up in the mid single digits. Can you give us any color how those conversations are progressing with some of your biggest corporate clients? Do you expect volumes to tick up? How are they thinking about things? Obviously, rate's a component. But you guys, obviously, want to try to lock in as much demand as possible as well.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, we said in the prepared remarks that we would increase, we thought, the volume of special corporate business that we brought in. And at the same time we said for like-for-like accounts we should see mid single digit growth. I can't tell you. I'm not sure we know yet what the average rate for the larger portfolio of special corporate compared to last year's special corporate volume will look like. In other words, are the new clients we're adding at the same rates? Or are they at higher rates because they're smaller? Are they in different markets? All those things will have to get worked out.","We're still a bit early. I mean, we have generally made proposals to every one of our significant special corporate customers, and often we've heard back from them, so we've got some to and fro, but by and large, those negotiations have not been completed. And we think it's based on the early data we've got that we talk about the mid-single-digit increase on like-for-like accounts.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","No. That's helpful. And then I guess \u2013 and obviously, I'm not asking you to negotiate on the phone here. I'm just curious, as you guys are reaching out to some of your corporate clients, are you at a stage with RevPAR growth kind of in this low single-digit range to be willing to sacrifice rate for some type of volume guarantee?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, let me answer it this way maybe, and which I think can give you some comfort. While RevPAR growth rates have declined a bit, obviously, the occupancies of our hotels remain very high, particularly on nights and in markets where business travel is significant. So if you look not at full week occupancy, but you look at Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights, we're running chock-a-block, and that means even in a 0% to 2% RevPAR environment, we're not without some position in discussions with our customers to make sure that we're being fairly compensated for that occupancy, which is in relatively short supply.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just kind of one last thing that's a little bit bigger picture. Anything over the past 10 months that you learned associated with the Starwood transaction that you think will help you guys going forward that you didn't know going in?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","There's \u2013 I'm sure we can put down a long, long list of things. But I \u2013 let's keep it maybe a little bit in general. And maybe we can even back up a little bit. When we were in the summertime with significant news about whether we'd get approval and how long it was taking, one of the New York tabloids ran a story suggesting that we had buyer's remorse and maybe didn't really want to close the deal. That story had zero factual support, absolutely zero factual support. We never lost any enthusiasm for completing this transaction, and now six weeks from close, seven weeks from close, I guess, this Friday, we are enthusiastic as ever.","And I think when you look at the report that we issued last night and we've been talking about this morning, what we see is a combined company with leverage levels already back to the levels that we target long-term with an enormous ability to produce cash, and we'll be back in the market with that cash buying back our stock. But we also see and we look at the third quarter EPS growth results and it's Legacy-Marriott because that's the only sort of apples-to-apples comparison we can do, but you're in a high teens percentage growth year-over-year. And we think the model's working extraordinarily well. We think the strength of the Starwood brands and the Starwood loyalty program have continued to impress us. And we should see that that development engine and the share of wallet we are enjoying from our customers should continue to expand. So we are very pumped up and eager to go.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","All right. Thanks a lot for the color, Arne.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just following up on those previous comments about buy-back, can you set some level of kind of market expectations for the level of buy-back in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure. I would \u2013 something in the couple hundred million dollars ballpark is not an unreasonable area of expectation.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Helpful. Thank you. Then just a bigger picture question. You still have \u2013 you have these Starwood assets you're looking to sell. Can you just talk about your view on the current state of the transaction market? Thanks.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure. As Arne talked about in his comments, clearly, there is some, just in general overall in the transaction market, there is some concern about the slow pace of economic growth. However, I think at the end of the day, what we see is that for brands that are very strong and in markets where there is demonstrated performance that deals can absolutely continue to be done. And so from that perspective, as I described, we've got, call it 70% of the assets in the U.S. and I would expect those to be sold relatively sooner than necessarily the ones in Latin America, and that for \u2013 in general for those hotels that they are strong assets and we're already engaged in discussions on a number of them and seen good strong interest.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Telsey Group.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, David.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Congratulations on your closing and I, as you know, I'm an avid reader of the tabloids. I did want to just follow-up on Harry's issue from earlier. As I look at what the debt balances are and I know, Leeny, you made some comments about what the debt balances were that you assumed at the closing. And then if I just, really from a high level, look at the debt balances and cash that you gave us relative to the leverage comment, I'll admit I'm finding a bit of a disconnect. How much debt did Starwood pay down, I suppose, is really the question? How much debt did you actually assume from them? And I would imagine all this will be ironed out when a Q gets filed.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Right. So you'll see the Q tomorrow and it'll be a little bit easier to take you through it in the detail. But just in broad terms, they did pay down roughly $800 million in debt prior to the transaction closing. So when you look at what we described, we've got basically the $8.8 billion of debt that we've got at the end of Q3 and we've also got $1.1 billion of cash. Okay? So kind of in and of itself you've got the scenario that we are in a better situation relative to the debt than we had expected prior.","I think the other thing I would point out is that earlier when we were looking we had less comfort about knowing the details around their cash globally. And as a result of doing the entity restructuring that I described earlier, we are comfortable that we are going be able to use all of the debt \u2013 all the cash balances that we don't need to run our business to repay debt and use for general corporate purposes over the near term. And I think that probably when you compare it to where we were a number of months ago, we were at the margin a bit more cautious about knowing the details about what we would be able to do from a cash perspective.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Right. Is there some meaningful adjustment in there for bank purposes with respect to the leverage? In other words, if Starwood has a capital lease, is that something that gets added back or deducted from your debt balance, or is there any meaningful chunk in there we should consider?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Right. There's kind of a classic calculation where you take an NPV of the lease payment. And that, again, we've got more refined information on knowing what their required lease payments are over the next number of years as compared to what we knew six months ago. And there again, I think we benefited a bit from being more conservative in our estimation about the length, the size, the nature of some of those leases where we got some benefit probably not \u2013 certainly not a whole tenth of -- 10 basis points, but certainly some benefit there.","I think the three biggest ones, as we described before, the three biggest changes to the 40 basis point improvement was as we described: just more cash overall, Being able to feel comfortable about our access to that cash; The level of EBITDAR which is refined for both their higher owned\/lease performance and frankly the combination of the two companies combined performance on the latest trailing 12 months; And then the third that you were able to look at the actual amounts of cash that you have on hand.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks for your answers. I appreciate it. Good luck.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Bill.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning. Good morning, congratulations on the transaction. Arne, with the deal done but obviously you got your hands full on the integration. But are you able to look at other industry issues like short-term cancellations and start to dedicate more resources, or is that just too risky to the new combined loyalty program?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, we talked about this just a little bit in response to one of the other questions that came in. And I don't want to go further than we're prepared to go. But I think the general point here is that the transaction was attractive to us, compelling to us, in significant part because of what we think we can do with the loyalty programs. And those loyalty programs, managed well, should allow us to drive that much more of our business directly from our most loyal members, which is the cheapest business for us to book because it comes and books to us to directly. And to \u2013 you don't do that just by being nice and good looking. You've got to do that by delivering real value to those customers because they're not going to be loyal to us unless it's in their interest to be loyal.","And so we're working through those things. They include significant work around systems and the like that we use to have our relationship with them but also, how do we continue to make sure we're delivering value to them. And so, free Wi-Fi and member rates and mobile check-in and keyless entry and points, these are already things which are really available to our loyalty members, but not to other customers. And we'll continue to make sure that we're managing that in a way that hopefully will give us good protection against whatever sort of either threatening intermediaries or newfangled ideas that come out that are seeking to upend that relationship.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. And the follow-up. Arne, as you look at your franchise applications and you kind of use all your years in the industry as a guide, where do you think \u2013 what year do you think U.S. supply growth peaks, the cycle?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Oh, it's a good question. I just haven't thought precisely about that question. Obviously, a big part of it depends on what happens to GDP growth. So if GDP bumps along at 1%-ish in the U.S. for the next year or two, I suspect we'll see more hotels open than are signed to the pipeline for the industry. Obviously, the trick here is for a company like ours to do better than the industry does and we'll continue to be focused on that. But I think the \u2013 in that kind of operating environment, we'll probably see most of the hotels that are in the pipeline in the industry open, ultimately, but the pipeline shrink in its entirety, which I would guess would mean that 2018 maybe is peak in the U.S. Obviously, if you've got a stronger GDP environment than that, more projects will be started. And at some point you'll hit a \u2013 it'll hit a place where the total pipeline sort of stays at the same kind of level or conceivably it could grow, in which case peak supply growth could be later than that.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. That's it.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Take that for what it is, which is a off-the-cuff answer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, there.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Just a quick follow up on the loyalty program question, as a lot of my questions have already been answered. Now that you've gotten some time to take a look at some of the details within Starwood's loyalty program and unpack some of the differences and how they see the world and see customer value and all those sorts of things, where \u2013 if you had to pick two or three places in that context, where do you see the most opportunity to maximize the economics of the combined program eventually?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, and I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're getting at, but one obvious place where we think we have upside in terms of share of wallet, let's use a loyal SPG member, maybe an Elite member who, far too often in the past would find themselves in markets in which Starwood had no product. Think about particularly markets in which select serve hotels are much more prominent than full-service hotels. Starwood had obviously some Four Points, a few Alofts and precious few Elements. But you compare the number of those three brands that Starwood had across the United States with what Marriott had in Courtyard and SpringHill Suites and Residence Inn and Fairfield and the like, and there are thousands more places for those customers to stay with us now broadly defined as the new Marriott.","And as a consequence, we should drive more share. And with that greater distribution, the loyalty program itself becomes more powerful. Obviously, one of the things that customers look for is what are the benefits I get in terms of suite upgrades or bonus points or access to lounges or other things. But also can I stay within that network regularly when I travel so that I can earn the kind of status and earn the number of points that I need in order to really get the free vacations or to get the other things that I want to get with those points? And so the breadth of distribution by itself is going to be hugely powerful in driving this. And then we've got to make sure that we are again continuing to deliver the right kind of value to the customers.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Right. That's very helpful. Is there anything in terms of the sort of the (1:13:49) level of generosity of the rewards in either program that you think is an opportunity or a deficiency versus prior? Anything like that?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","There are dozens of differences between the programs.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Right.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","And it'd be dangerous to focus on any one, but I'll give you one little peek under the hood. When we announced the deal in November of 2015, because Marriott was the acquirer, SPG members particularly were a bit nervous about, okay, what is Marriott going to do to the benefits that we like. And we of course tried to be reassuring in the words that we used. In a cynical era, I think people are not inclined necessarily to believe everything that's said.","And so one of the things we did is with the Marriott Reward program in second quarter, if I remember right, we started doing suite upgrades and late checkout. And that was actually a powerful communication to the SPG members that actually Marriott is paying attention to what Starwood has provided to some for some period of time, and that's a reassuring sign. But we'll look at suite upgrades and redemption rules and all these other aspects over the course of the next few years and try and do right by our customers and obviously do right by the program.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon with Macquarie.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. Just one for me just regarding the third quarter result. So on the North American limited service side of things, the performance for both Legacy-Marriott and Legacy-Starwood and actually the industry from what we've seen from STR, was a little weaker than expected, yet we continue to hear that the corporate leisure customer is strong. So could you just kind of help us flush out some of the underperformance in the quarter?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I think the \u2013 it's interesting, if you look at our schedules, you see a bit of a difference between the managed portfolio and the franchise portfolio too. But if you look at the portfolio as a whole, the full-service hotels get disproportionate benefit from group business, and group business is stronger than corporate transient, particularly today. The managed Select-Service portfolio also skews, not as much as the full service hotels, but skews a little bit more towards group than the franchised Select-Service portfolio does. And so that's helpful, too.","And I think the third thing is around geographic distribution. So when you look at Select-Service, when you look at the franchise portfolio, when you look at a lot of industry data, Select-Service hotels can skew more towards oil and gas markets. Think about markets that nobody had ever heard of before and a couple of years ago like Williston, North Dakota, and environs where you've got all this oil work that's happening out there. Select-Service hotels exploded onto the scene. There's not a single full service hotel in the whole area basically. And it's maybe a little less dramatic in markets like Houston, but you look across Texas, you look across many of these markets and you'll see that those hotels are competing in on average tougher markets, again, without the benefit of group. And that would be the bulk of the explanation.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Arne.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein Research.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks for the question. Good morning. Had a quick question about Starwood's pipeline actually. I know there's a like-for-like comparison issue here, but it does appear that the pipeline may have stalled out a bit this quarter. I was wondering if there's anything idiosyncratic at play there worth pointing out?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, no. There's really not. So a couple of comments overall. Always looking quarter to quarter can make for some interesting comparisons because a lot can go on one to the other. So, I think you will find, in general year-over-year, you'll find some really strong growth across both portfolios and perhaps in some respects a better measure of how they're doing.","At the same time, it clearly, when we look at it we are trying to make sure that we are taking into consideration exactly what is going on with either delayed deals or deals that are falling off. And so from that standpoint, we kind of trued it up. I think you'll find it's such a small difference when you look at how the two companies put their pipelines together that it's not anything particularly meaningful. We are excited about the level of interest. We've done a bunch of deals even since we've closed on the transaction and look forward to continuing to watch it grow.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's really helpful. Thanks. And just a quick follow up on net room growth expectations for next year. I know you mentioned in the past that you do expect to prune \u2013 I don't know if that's the right word \u2013 certain Sheraton properties that might have been under-performing in the past. Is that reflected within your forward room guidance? Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Our best guess is 6% net growth next year and that's net of \u2013 best information we have on deletions as well.","David James Beckel - Sanford C.

Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Can you help me think about the P&L impact that is lost from selling $1.5 billion in assets? So, I guess, this year I think you're doing around $620 million of gross income on the owned\/leased line. What does that look like after $1.5 billion in asset sales?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Are you talking on the revenue line or on the owned\/lease net line?","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","The owned\/lease net line.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Okay. At this point, we're really not in a position to get super detailed. I think the easiest way to describe it is what we talked about from a EBITDA perspective, which is the $180 million to $190 million of EBITDA associated with Starwood's owned hotels. We also did talk about the fact that our depreciation and amortization estimates associated with the purchase of Starwood have declined relative to the earlier description. And part of that, I'd say roughly half of that, was associated with moving several of those hotels into the assets held for sale category which is, again, going to impact D&A. But it's not going to impact the owned hotels net.","So specific numbers we'll be able to talk more about in February. I think for now, the EBITDA is probably the easier way to think about it. Obviously when we sell these hotels we'll end up with a great stream of management fees in managing the hotels. So it's one thing to keep in mind is that, although there is EBITDA that goes to the buyer of these assets, we're going to continue to have a great stream of earnings from them.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I'd just add \u2013 let me add one thing to this. It will vary a little bit by market around the world. Obviously, the U.S. assets are easiest to predict, but we've got some owned assets in other markets around the world. On average, though, you would expect that the sales prices we received should be at least at the EBITDA level if not higher that the company is trading at. And so the transaction should be accretive from an EBITDA perspective.","And when you look at it from an earnings perspective after depreciation associated with owned hotels, they should be significantly accretive from an earnings perspective. Now, again, that's on average. We're not saying necessarily that in a higher cap rate market where the risk profile is actually quite different that we will necessarily always get proceeds which are higher than our EBITDA multiple. But I think generally across the average we should see this is accretive to the P&L and the balance sheet of the company.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then, Arne, I just want to go back to your loyalty comments because Hyatt said last week that they've effectively converted 30,000 SPG members over to their loyalty program. And I know that's a small number in the grand scheme of things, but have you seen any tangible evidence of SPG members leaving presumably out of fear of just their points being diluted?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I don't think that's what they said. I think what they said last week was that they had offered to match Elite status to 30,000 SPG or SPG and Marriott Reward members. That doesn't mean they've converted them to be loyal to that company. Those folks are undoubtedly still members of our program and we're not giving up on them.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Arne M.

Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey Joe.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","What did we do to get you last in line?","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I don't know. I was going to ask you the same question. I could have voted four times. Just with regard to your comments on 2017 with the 6% net room growth. Given your comments about certain delays today, and I think you also mentioned it anecdotally the last quarter, is that rooms growth disproportionately weighted to the second half of the year? And then when we look at your totality of comments today and think about next year, and we look at fee growth, are we looking at fee growth that maybe the best case scenario or the most optimistic scenario is that fee growth approximates net unit growth? Or do you think we can get fee growth in excess of net rooms growth?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, okay. So I think on both those questions we should start by warning you we don't have a budget for next year. So we do have in this headquarters building someplace, I'm sure, a detailed schedule of when we think hotels are going to open. But we're not rolling that up necessarily in a way that's very digestible by quarter. Having said that, I would think to the earlier question about when supply growth will peak. I suspect we are continuing to see, on average, that we're opening more next year than this year. And we're probably opening more in 2018 than in 2017, which would suggest that there will be some back-end skewing to next year. I don't think it will be profound though.","Obviously, we've opened a lot of hotels this year. We've missed a little bit this year, and those are slipping into 2017. But they'll be in early 2017. And so, I think the year as a whole should be fairly robust in terms of its openings. But again, I'd suspect fourth quarter will have more than the first quarter did, simply because we continue to ramp.","On fee growth, obviously the two biggest inputs to the year-over-year fee growth is unit growth and RevPAR. And with 6% unit growth and 0% to 2% RevPAR growth, both can drive an increase in the top line, although it's obvious that the rooms growth will drive more top line growth than the rev growth, unless we're wildly conservative in that 0% to 2% number. The next piece of that is what happens with incentive fees. And I think there you end up in a 0% to 2% market with the real need to say, okay, what's happening in the high incentive fee markets for the company like New York, like Washington, like London and other markets around the world. And until we do the budgets, that's going to be a hard thing to give you much guidance on.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Arne M.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Marriott International First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on-mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Arne Sorenson, the CEO of Marriott International. You may begin your conference.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","First let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today May 9, 2018 and will not be updated as actual events unfold. This quarter, we have provided a set of slides to assist with today's discussion. You can find them on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor or in our 8-K filing.","In our discussion today, we will talk about results excluding merger related costs, reimbursed revenues and related expenses, a net adjustment to the tax charge related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and an adjustment to the Avendra gain. GAAP results appear on Page A-1 of the earnings release, but our remarks today will largely refer to the adjusted results that appear on the non-GAAP reconciliation pages. Of course you can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks also on our website.","So, let's get started. We were very pleased with our results in the first quarter. Worldwide, systemwide constant dollar RevPAR increased 3.6%, beating the top-end of our guidance by 60 basis points. Gross fee revenues rose 11% and adjusted earnings per share increased 40%.","Let's talk about the regions. Systemwide constant dollar RevPAR in our Asia Pacific region increased 10%, which was much stronger than the mid single-digit growth we expected. Hotels in Greater China saw an increase in RevPAR of nearly 12% due to better than expected corporate and leisure demand. Travel during the Chinese New Year exceeded our expectations and outbound demand from Greater China helped drive double-digit RevPAR growth in Thailand and Singapore. Indonesia RevPAR increased 5% as many volcano-related travel advisories were lifted.","For our comparable hotels RevPAR in India increased 6% in the first quarter on strong corporate and leisure demand. Just last month, I attended the grand opening of our 100th hotel in India, the Sheraton Grand Bengaluru Whitefield Hotel & Convention Center. The mood in India is very upbeat. The Asian Development Bank recently forecasted that in 2018, India will have the fastest growing economy in Asia, following recent financial reforms. With this rapid near-term growth and rising middle class, we are bullish about India. With over 20,000 open rooms, India is already our fourth largest market in the world, just behind the U.S., China and Canada, and has more than 11,000 rooms in our development pipeline.","In the Middle East and Africa, systemwide constant dollar RevPAR rose over 3% year-over-year compared to flat results expected for the quarter. RevPAR in Egypt rose 30% on easy comparisons, while the UAE saw greater leisure demand from China and India helped by the opening of the Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi. South Africa's RevPAR declined 2% due in part to the water crisis in Cape Town.","In Europe, strong economic growth took systemwide constant dollar RevPAR up nearly 6% in the quarter year-over-year, consistent with the mid single-digit growth assumed in our first quarter guidance. We saw mid-teens RevPAR growth in Eastern Europe on strong corporate and leisure demand, while RevPAR in Turkey and France continued to rebound. London RevPAR was flat year-over-year, reflecting weak demand from the financial services industry likely Brexit related.","In the Caribbean and Latin America region, RevPAR increased nearly 9% in the quarter, which was stronger than the mid single-digit growth included in our guidance. RevPAR at our comparable Caribbean hotels increased over 20%, benefiting from lower industry supply as many hotels remain out of the service following last year's hurricanes. Mexico RevPAR declined 5% following the steep devaluation of the peso and continued travel warnings for some markets. RevPAR in our Central and South American markets increased at a high single-digit rate on average with significant and surprising demand strength in Argentina, Brazil and Costa Rica.","Let's turn to North America. As you may recall last quarter, we were hopeful we would see a pickup in North America economic growth. Our hopes have been realized. It's time to take the numbers up a bit. Recall that in 2017, our North American RevPAR increased 2.1%. If adjusted for calendar and event anomalies such as the inauguration, shifting holidays and the 2017 hurricanes, we estimated 2017 RevPAR would have increased 1.7%. In the first quarter of 2018, North American RevPAR rose 2% at the high end of our guidance. Excluding the impact of the shifting Easter holiday, last year's presidential inauguration and the lingering impact of the hurricanes, we estimate RevPAR would have been up 2.7%, a full point higher than 2017's adjusted numbers. This acceleration is encouraging.","Transient RevPAR increased roughly 2.5% in the first quarter, helped by reduced corporate discounting in the legacy Starwood portfolio, better leisure demand, improved international arrivals, and overall strengthening corporate demand, particularly in the oil and gas industry. Special corporate room rates at Legacy-Marriott Hotels increased nearly 3% in the quarter.","Speaking of oil, we are encouraged by recent demand trends in energy markets. You may recall that it was the energy business where we first saw weaker RevPAR trends in the fourth quarter of 2015. More recently, Houston's RevPAR was significantly impacted by Hurricane Harvey in the 2017 fourth quarter and the difficult year-over-year Super Bowl comparison in the 2018 first quarter.","Yet underlying oil and gas industry demand has been improving. We looked at the RevPAR performance of our hotels in 40 energy submarkets in the U.S. in places such as Oklahoma, North Dakota and Louisiana to name a few. Excluding Houston, we note that RevPAR for our hotels in these U.S. markets rose 6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 8% in the first quarter of 2018. Canadian energy markets were even stronger.","We are also encouraged by recent group trends. We expected lower group business as we started the quarter due to the shift in the Easter holiday. Actual group RevPAR was stronger than expected, ending flat year-over-year for the first quarter. Outperformance was largely due to better than expected attendance at group meetings and stronger group business at our limited-service hotels.","Food and beverage trends are improving too. Food and beverage revenue per group room night rose nearly 6% in the quarter. RevPAR at our luxury hotels in North America increased 4.3% in the first quarter. Luxury hotels in Miami benefited from Florida and Caribbean hotels still out of service from the 2017 hurricanes, while RevPAR at our luxury hotels in Hawaii benefited from renovations and greater air lift from the U.S. Mainland and Japan.","RevPAR growth at Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis was stronger than expected. RevPAR at our North American upscale hotels increased 1% as the shifting holiday constrained group demand at large full-service hotels. We are encouraged that group revenue booking pace for our luxury and upper-upscale hotels is up more than 4% for the second quarter and up 1% to 2% for the second half of 2018 compared to prior-year periods.","RevPAR at our North American limited-service hotels increased 2.5% in the quarter compared to the year-ago quarter despite a mid single-digit percentage increase in industry room supply in this tier. Limited-service hotels saw strong demand from the oil and gas industry, continued hurricane recovery demand, and both the Super Bowl in Minneapolis and the playoffs in Philadelphia. Group revenue at our limited-service hotels rose 4%.","Our economic outlook has improved. At the same time, the labor market is tight, and wages are rising in many markets. This is pressuring hotel operating margins and lengthening new hotel construction timelines, particularly for non-prototype and urban hotels in North America and Europe. Leeny will speak in a few minutes about our terrific hotel operating margin performance in the face of these trends.","We continued to make great progress in our integration of Starwood. Thus far in 2018, we have combined financial reporting systems, integrated our North American sales organization, and recycled approximately $170 million in capital from asset sales and loan repayments. By August, we expect guests will be able to see and book all of our inventory on each of our Marriott and Starwood websites and apps, and enjoy our unified loyalty programs. New cobranded credit cards from Chase and AmEx should enrich guest loyalty even further. We look forward to rolling our hotels onto a single reservation system in stages with the first group of hotels converting in the fall of 2018.","And finally we expect owners will continue to see significant cost savings as the integration continues. But innovation is as important to us as integration. Our Moments platform continues to grow and enrich our loyalty programs. Currently, the platform includes more than 110,000 experiences in 1,000 destinations, ranging from destination tours and day trips like shark cage diving in South Africa to once in a lifetime events like sipping champagne trackside at next month's Belmont Stakes.","Last summer, we formed a new joint venture with Alibaba to improve service and sales for Chinese guests. Just last month, the JV launched our redesigned storefront on Alibaba's travel site, Fliggy. It now features our global inventory of hotels with a localized, mobile enhanced and user friendly layout. During 2018, we are rolling out Alipay, Post Post Pay, an innovative hotel payment service to a 1,000 hotels worldwide. Alipay, Post Post Pay enables qualified Fliggy users to enjoy a comprehensive wallet-free experience during their stay.","We entered into agreement to manage the first-ever Ritz-Carlton Luxury Yacht, bringing Ritz-Carlton's service and our asset-light business model to the luxury cruise business. The first Ritz-Carlton yacht with 149 luxury suites is scheduled to launch in 2020.","Last month, we announced that we are testing home sharing in London with approximately 200 Tribute Portfolio Homes. While only a test, we are integrating our home sharing offerings into our loyalty programs. Curating for design, functionality, location and safety, and providing the commitment to service and quality that is not typical in this space.","Behind the scenes, we recently launched a new customer recognition platform which will allow Marriott associates globally both on- and off-property to deliver better service. Integrated with our mobile app and chat functions, our associates will be able to access guest portfolios, preferences and history to ensure every guest anywhere in the world can receive truly personalized service. This is another use of technology to drive guest satisfaction.","House profit margins declined 10 basis points for our North American upper-upscale hotels in the first quarter in the face of modest RevPAR growth and higher operating expenses, particularly labor costs. This kind of margin pressure caused us to reduce commission rates for most group intermediaries in North America from 10% to 7% for bookings made on or after April 1 of this year.","This change will not have a material impact on Marriott International's results, but the commission change should make a meaningful difference to hotel owners, particularly those where group business is a significant share of their overall occupancy. The change in commission rates triggered a considerable number of new group bookings in the first quarter largely for meetings taking place in 2020 and beyond.","On the development front, we opened nearly 15,000 rooms worldwide in the first quarter and our pipeline at quarter end approached 465,000 rooms. We signed just under 20,000 new rooms in the quarter, 10% more than in the first quarter of 2017. According to STR, we have the largest pipeline of guest rooms under development in the world.","Let's look at a few of the details. Our development pipeline skews toward faster growing international markets. While one-third of our open rooms are in international markets, over half of the rooms in our pipeline are located outside North America, and of our international pipeline, nearly 60% of the rooms are in the Asia Pacific region. While we already have the largest luxury and upper-upscale portfolio in the world, our strong pipeline should extend that lead even further.","In fact a number of our luxury and upper-upscale pipeline rooms exceed that of our next three largest global competitors combined. Full-service hotels drive significant fees per room and enhance the value of our loyalty program, which is strengthened by the aspirational destinations it offers. Given our scale, we are excited to think about what we can accomplish once integration is complete.","Today as a much larger company, we are enhancing an already efficient cost structure and providing greater resources to drive high value demand. And even with these exciting changes, our core strategy is unchanged. We remain a manager and franchisor of the leading lodging brands in the world. We continue to work to make our brands even stronger. We embrace change perhaps now more than ever and we pride ourselves on our corporate culture, a culture of service to others. Marriott is a company with a more than 90-year history of creating value for its shareholders and we are committed to continuing to do so.","Before turning the microphone over to Leeny, let me thank Marriott's associates around the world. They are shouldering the burden of integrating Marriott and Starwood even as they deliver excellent results for our business as usual. Their work inspires me. Thanks for all you do.","Now for some more thoughts about first quarter performance and our outlook, let me turn things over to Leeny.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you, Arne. For the first quarter of 2018, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.34 compared to $0.96 in the year-ago quarter. Both first quarter 2018 and first quarter 2017 reflect the new revenue recognition accounting standard. We expect to have the remaining 2017 quarters and the 2017 full year income statement reflecting the new rules available to you later this quarter.","In the first quarter, gross fee revenues totaled $845 million, an 11% increase year-over-year largely from unit growth, RevPAR gains and higher incentives and branding fees. Credit card fees alone totaled $86 million, up 58% while other non-property fees including application and re-licensing fees, timeshare fees and residential branding fees increased 6% to $38 million. With a weaker U.S. dollar, first quarter fee revenue also benefited from a nearly $8 million favorable impact from foreign exchange net of hedges.","Worldwide house profit margins for company-operated hotels improved 70 basis points on a 4.0% increase in managed hotel RevPAR. In North America, margins declined slightly on a 1.4% increase in company-operated hotel RevPAR. Despite the modest RevPAR growth and significant wage growth, we were able to hold on to our North America house profit margins due to procurement savings, productivity improvement and the roll-out of shared services to more hotels. We estimate efficiency improvements and synergies contributed an average of 50 basis points to worldwide property level margins in 2017 and our goal is to add another 50 basis points apart from the impact of RevPAR growth on average in 2018.","Beginning in the third quarter, we expect to standardize loyalty charge-out rates by chain scale with most brands benefiting from even lower charge-out rate. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses totaled $70 million in the first quarter, a 3% decline from the prior year. The sale of four properties in 2017 and early 2018 reduced results in the quarter by $22 million year-over-year, while termination fees increased results by $21 million.","General and administrative expenses increased by $35 million in the first quarter due to the additional profit sharing match for associates for 2018. Last quarter, we announced our plan to invest roughly $140 million during 2018 in our most important asset, our people with about $70 million of the cost funded by Marriott and the remainder funded by a portion of the Avendra proceeds. We are largely doing this by increasing our retirement savings match of associate contributions by up to $1,000 for the first $200 invested by eligible associates in the U.S. We also intend to invest in other associate support programs during the year.","Of the $70 million of expected Marriott costs for this investment, $35 million was reflected in our G&A expenses in the first quarter. Given the five to one match feature for the first $200 invested, we expect the expenses associated with this plan to be frontend loaded in the first half of 2018. We estimate our second quarter G&A will include $25 million for this investment with the remaining $10 million expense to be reflected in G&A in the second half of the year. Unfavorable foreign exchange also increased G&A expense by $6 million, but was offset by synergy savings.","First quarter gains largely reflect $53 million associated with the sale of the Buenos Aires Sheraton and Park Tower properties. First quarter adjusted EBITDA rose 8% to $770 million and reflected a roughly $20 million negative impact from sold hotels.","Looking ahead, we expect worldwide constant dollar systemwide RevPAR will increase 3% to 4% in both the second quarter and the full year. In the Asia Pacific region, we expect second quarter and full year RevPAR will increase at a high single-digit rate reflecting continued strength in corporate and leisure demand. The Caribbean and Latin American region had a very strong first quarter, but RevPAR growth should slow a bit as many hurricane damaged hotels in the Caribbean reopened during the year creating tougher comparison.","In Europe, we expect RevPAR will continue to grow at a mid single-digit rate in both the second quarter and the full year 2018. For the Middle East and Africa region, the timing of Ramadan should reduce RevPAR in the second quarter with offsetting stronger results expected in the third quarter. For the full year, the region's RevPAR is likely to be flat. All-in-all, we believe our international hotels could increase RevPAR by 5% to 6% for both the second quarter and the full year.","For North America, we expect RevPAR will grow 3% to 4% in the second quarter as group business benefits from the timing of Easter. For the full year, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 3%. This outlook is more bullish than on our last call reflecting the stronger demand trends Arne discussed. We continue to expect 5.5% to 6% net worldwide rooms growth for the full year disproportionately skewed toward international markets.","Slide 11 shows our guidance for the second quarter. Given our worldwide RevPAR and unit growth assumptions, we expect gross fee revenue for the second quarter will total $935 million to $945 million, an 11% increase over the prior year. Our fee revenue estimate assumes $90 million to $95 million in credit card branding fees in the second quarter and roughly $10 million in favorable foreign exchange impact. We expect owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses will total roughly $80 million in the second quarter. In the 2017 second quarter, we earned $14 million from assets that have since been sold. Our guidance assumes no further asset sales beyond those that have been completed.","G&A should total roughly $250 million in the second quarter reflecting the roughly $25 million expense for our additional profit sharing contribution. These assumptions yield $1.34 to $1.36 diluted earnings per share for the second quarter and adjusted EBITDA of $880 million to $890 million, 7% to 9% over adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter 2017. We estimate our second quarter adjusted EBITDA reflects an $11 million negative impact from sold hotels.","For the full year 2018, we believe gross fee revenue could increase 11%. This is a meaningful increase over our last guidance reflecting stronger RevPAR and margin growth, and about $25 million of favorable foreign exchange impact. We believe incentive fees will increase at a roughly 10% rate, which is faster than we previously modeled largely due to the stronger RevPAR and margin growth in the Asia Pacific region.","We continue to expect our credit card branding fees will total $360 million to $380 million in 2018. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expense, should total roughly $300 million for the year, modestly higher than our last forecast largely due to higher termination fees in the first quarter.","G&A should total $940 million to $950 million for 2018, which includes our $70 million additional contribution to profit sharing. Our full year estimate of gains has increased $20 million to $25 million, largely reflecting transactions that are already complete including the sale in April of a JV interest that resulted in proceeds of $46 million.","Our full year outlook assumes a 2018 effective tax rate of roughly 23%. In our February earnings guidance, we assumed a 22% effective tax rate. The change is due to some discrete items and fine tuning. For 2018, we continue to expect our cash tax rate will total 36%. These assumptions yield $5.43 to $5.55 diluted earnings per share for 2018 and adjusted EBITDA of $3.445 billion to $3.5 billion, 10% to 12% over the 2017 adjusted EBITDA. Our full year adjusted EBITDA estimate reflects a roughly $45 million negative impact from sold hotels as well as the $70 million cost associated with the retirement match for our associates.","As we discussed last quarter, our 2018 guidance excludes the adjustments to the Avendra gain, merger related costs, the timing impact of reimbursed revenues and expenses, and adjustments to the tax charge. Investment spending for the year could total $600 million to $700 million, including roughly $225 million of maintenance spending. The remainder includes capital expenditures, loan advances, equity investments and contract investment. While contract investment is included in our investment spending estimate, under the new revenue standard, contract investment will be included in our cash flow statement going forward under the heading cash from operating activities rather than in the investing activities section as in the past.","We have already recycled over $1.3 billion of capital through asset sales and loan repayments to-date since the closing of the Starwood acquisition. We're on track to reach our post-acquisition $1.5 billion target by year end 2018, but our 2018 earnings and cash flow guidance assume no further asset sales.","We repurchased nearly 8 million shares from January 1 through yesterday for approximately $1.1 billion. With the benefit of higher anticipated earnings and cash flow, we now expect to return over $3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2018. Last quarter, we estimated cash return to shareholders of approximately $2.5 billion for 2018. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. As of March 31, our debt ratio was at the low end of our targeted credit standard of 3 times to 3.25 times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR. We've modeled our 2018 income statement and cash flow forecast at a 3.2 times target.","We appreciate your interest in Marriott. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask you, I guess specifically on your pipeline, it was up around 5,000 rooms sequentially. I realize it's still a big number, but it's a little lower in terms of growth than it has been. And I was just wondering if you could talk about, you mentioned the higher construction cost, if that's impacting your pipeline or if there's anything else in particular going on in the quarter. And along with that, your deletions seemed a little higher than usual as well.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, those are all perfectly fair questions. I think the best news around development pipeline we've put in the prepared remarks, which is the signing of about 10% more deals in Q1 than Q1 last year, which was gratifying to us. I mean, we have talked before about the fact that we think organic industry growth in the United States in terms of new signings probably peaked in 2015-2016 timeframe. Obviously, we've got some new brands. I would call out particularly Moxy and AC that are driving some of that signup as well as the sort of rebooting of Element and Aloft, which should give us the ability to compete better than the industry as a whole.","But there is a lot of growth that's occurred in the United States and I think as a consequence, having some increase in the number of signings was again a gratifying thing for us to see. We did, as we do every quarter, look through the entire development portfolio. We culled some deals that we were less confident would ultimately get completed, and of course, in culling those deals, we bring down a little bit offset to the signings we've signed. So, we had a little bit less growth in the total pipeline in Q1.","In terms of the deletions, each one is its own story. I think I've looked through every individual hotel that left the system in first quarter of 2018. It's never a surprise to see that many of those hotels are not contributing much in fees, in part because they are either at the end of their contract life and not necessarily competing as well or participating in markets that are under a bit more pressure or to some extent because they weren't contributing sort of their fair share, we were less interested in having them stay in the system.","And all those things sort of go into this calculation. But I think all things considered, we still saw some modest growth in the pipeline. And we're sticking tight with the 5.5% to 6% net unit growth, which again this year we'll open more rooms than we did last year. Last year, we opened more than we opened the year before. And I suspect the odds are that next year we'll open more rooms than we open in 2018.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. And then, as a follow-up, I wanted to ask you on your Tribute portfolio. You mentioned you're testing it. I guess how long would you be testing before you sort of enter in a more formal way into this business? And I mean what kind of scope do you think this could reach over few years and just to be a more meaningful piece of earnings over time?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, we're going to take this a step at a time. I think within a few months, we should be able to learn considerable lessons from what we're doing in London. And if it goes well and we're quite optimistic, it will, we'll look at extending that to other cities.","Our plan for timesharing \u2013 for home sharing, excuse me, is to learn as we go here a little bit. But we want to make sure we are delivering a high quality service experience and we want to make sure we're delivering whole homes. So that it is, if you will, the higher end of the market. It's a place where branding can make a difference. It's a place where we can deliver an experience both in terms of service and quality that we want our customers to have. And it's a place where we can feel really good about connecting it to the loyalty program.","Now, by the way, in the whole home space, it's also meaningfully different from a standard hotel room, which makes it a more comfortable place for us to add. But I think we'll watch this as we go. We'll obviously keep you posted on the way this is developing, but we're off to a great start in the first few weeks that we've been engaged with this in London. We're getting great response from our customers, and we feel good about it.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask...","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","...on two things. Good morning. First is on corporate negotiated rates. I wonder if you could talk about where you expect them to come in for the year in terms of a 1% increase. And also were a lot of those negotiations done before you saw the improvement in business travel that now you've seen in Q1. In other words, are those maybe at rates that wouldn't reflect where you'd want them to be for the year?","And then I also had a question on margins, which was just that looking at your North American margin was basically flat with 2% RevPAR growth. And I wanted to ask how sustainable that is as you talked about some of the cost saves from the combination and kind of that 50 basis points that that would add hopefully this year as well. Is that enough to keep margins flat at 2% RevPAR growth? Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Leeny will take the margin question here, but let me make a couple of comments on the special corporate rates. We had special corporate rate growth of about 3% in Q1, which all things considered is not bad. I think your second question is fair though. Obviously, we negotiate special corporate accounts typically in the fall. And to the extent that we are more optimistic about the economy collectively now than we were in the fall, we presumably could do a bit better in those negotiations if they were happening today than we did last fall. But that's hardly a stark difference.","And let's take a reminder here. I think Marriott is performing extraordinarily well. Marriott's business model is performing extraordinarily well. We feel meaningfully better about our prospects today than we did a quarter ago. But we're still talking about 2% to 3% RevPAR growth in the U.S. for full year 2018. We're not changing numbers to sort of a mid to high single-digit number which obviously is something we've seen in some prior economic environments. And of course that 2% to 3% RevPAR growth that continues to put a premium on making sure we're driving rates and now for Leeny making sure what we can on the cost side.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","So on the margin side Robin, you look at Q1 at 1.4% managed RevPAR growth. That was absolutely essentially entirely from rate which does help us to the extent of trying to hold on to as much margin as we can.","However, we have typically thought about needing about 3% RevPAR growth to hold onto margin. And from that standpoint with the synergies that we're getting from the Starwood acquisition, I think that number is probably a little bit better. But I think to assume 2% and flat margins that would be a great goal to shoot for that we obviously would try to do. But it would be right at the edge of being able to hold onto margin including the synergy benefits to be able to do that.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Dariush P. Ruch-Kamgar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning everyone. This is Dariush on for Shaun.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, how are you.","Dariush P. Ruch-Kamgar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good, thanks. How are you? So following up on Smedes' question on net unit growth, looking out to 2019, do you think net unit growth could actually reaccelerate as elevated deletions from Starwood subside? And to what extent do you see rising cost across the construction environment as an offset?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","This is the danger about speculating already in an answer to a question about maybe having more opening in 2019 than 2018. I think we will \u2013 we think that's possible because you just look at the pipeline and look at the years in which we signed the deals. We will have more hotels coming out of that development pipeline in 2019 than in 2018. So I think the gross openings globally could well be higher next year than they are this year.","In terms of deletions, it's probably too much to ask for at the moment. I'll anticipate maybe a question talking about Sheraton for a second. We are making really good progress with the Sheraton brand. We've talked to you in the past few quarters about focusing first on the lowest 25 hotels and then the lowest 50 hotels in the U.S.","If you look at the lowest 100 hotels in the U.S. which is really half of the Sheraton portfolio nearly three quarters of those are well on their way to being resolved. A handful of those leaving the system, most of them being renovated or will be renovated before long. Now, it will take a year or two to get those renovations done, but we feel really good about the way that is continuing to move. We'll have to give you as we get closer to 2019 a better sense for deletions next year. But I would think that the 1% to 1.5% deletion is the kind of number you should expect steady state not necessarily a material change from that.","And then the last thing hinted at in your question was really about construction delays. We are seeing really tight construction markets. Obviously, that is about labor, but it's also about a lot of what is going on in the construction space. You've got both in Florida and Texas significant hurricane recovery work underway. You've got some infrastructure work that is happening across the United States. And you've got a fairly robust real estate business and all of that is putting pressure on construction resources which makes construction both bit more expensive and has it take a little bit longer.","The other thing that we're seeing in our pipeline is we have \u2013 a few years ago, we would have skewed a bit more towards a prototypical suburban limited service hotel. I think today even in our limited service pipeline, we're seeing more of that be custom, more of that be urban and those projects obviously take longer to get completed than the prototypical suburban construction. The good news in all of this is the projects are moving forward. And so while they get stretched out a little bit we know they're coming and we know they'll open up into the system.","Dariush P. Ruch-Kamgar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks a lot for the color. And just as a quick follow-up probably for Leeny, looking at G&A and the expected $70 million of expense related to employee profit share matching in 2018, can G&A in 2019 actually be down in absolute dollars or does inflation put you closer to flat to up?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. So we're getting ahead of ourselves as we think about 2019. But I think a more kind of classic steady state G&A by the time we get to 2019 is fair. So if you obviously think about a number that is when you're thinking about without the $70 million, you're looking at $875 million sort of number. That then you would argue that that could potentially be lower than the printed number of the $945 million in 2018.","Dariush P. Ruch-Kamgar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel of Bernstein Research.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for the question. I just want to Arne ask you about conversations you've been having. Clearly the business environment is looking up. I'm wondering does that have more to do with actual cash in the coffers increasing because of the tax reform or more about expectations of forward economic growth improving?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I think they are related to some extent. And the answer is both. Obviously we talk to a lot of our customers who participate in the economy in every industry. And I think from the time Tax Reform Act was passed you've seen a step up in optimism. And the query we often give to our customers is, is it just optimism or are you actually seeing improved business conditions? And it's a majority that say, no, no, no we're actually seeing improved business conditions.","And we are actually making decisions which are the effect of our more bullish impact. It is not simply about attitude but it's about things that are actually happening. Now to be fair, you look at earnings growth across the industry, look at the first quarter results across the U.S. corporate sector and you see great earnings growth.","A big chunk of that is tax and people are paying less in tax and therefore their earnings are moving. But you're seeing \u2013 more often than not you're also seeing companies report revenue growth. And that's something that has been missing from the last few years of our economic recovery. So you put all those things together and it does seem like we are in again a meaningfully better place in the economy than just three or six months ago.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thanks. And as a quick follow-up just on the home sharing agreement just to follow-up on the last question, what is it that ultimately got you over the hump? I feel like you've been analyzing that opportunity for quite a while, so I'd love to know what finally got you to decide to get your feet wet.","And secondarily, it sounds like you're pretty optimistic about what you'll find. Is there any circumstance at which you decide not to move ahead with this arrangement?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, let's take the last one first. Of course until we complete this first task we're not going to make any definitive decisions. We wouldn't have made the test unless we felt like it was likely to lead to a positive outcome however. And so we are hopeful that we'll find stuff here that confirms our suspicion and we'll move forward.","We've obviously watched this space for the last number of years. We've been asked by all of you about the impact of this space and what it means. There are a couple of general comments I'd make, see many of the folks who started in this business started with a business model, which fundamentally did not comply with law in most, in many I should say, cities and states and countries. And it's one thing for a start-up to engage in a business that really does not comply with law, it's another thing altogether for a 90-year old company like Marriott to step into a business, which is fundamentally illegal. And as a consequence, one of the reasons we didn't jump into this quickly is we thought this is a business that is not made for us.","We have now figured out that we can run this business in a way that does fully comply with law. It will include payment of lodging taxes, so that it's a level playing field with the hotel business. It will very much include complying with local regulatory requirements on number of nights homes can be let in this way and make that work.","I think the other thing that we've observed is that as some of these platforms have grown into millions and millions of units, there is almost a paralyzing array of choices and the lack of branding and the lack of real attributes of quality around service and product makes this a area where we think we can bring our brands, we can bring our service and product focus, and deliver something which is simply a better product and much of what is out there. And then, of course, lastly we think there's a strong loyalty connection, which obviously can be helpful here. The home sharing business skews overwhelmingly to leisure travel, not to business travel. The loyalty space obviously, particularly around redemptions, but it could be around point earning as well, is we think an advantage we've got that should bode us well in this space.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Joe Greff of JPMorgan.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Joe?","Brandt Montour - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...hotel? Hello.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Here we go. Better start again.","Brandt Montour - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you hear me? Sorry, this is Brandt on for Joe. So I just wanted to follow up on the managed hotels margin discussion. If you take it one step further. So looking forward you have group commission rates going lower right, you're rolling out a cohesive loyalty program later on in the year and then there's other costs that are lower for your owners given scale-related synergies. So to what extent are each of these factors embedded into your IMF forecast?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","I would say generally they are. Obviously, we will always try to hope to do better. But as we also talked about, there's the reality of labor cost increases that are also a major element this year in our managed hotels, particularly in the U.S. So I would say that they are broadly included.","The one thing I'll also say that's interesting is that for this year we're actually I would expect by the time we get for the full year that two-thirds, almost two-thirds of our IMFs will be from international hotels. And there again that \u2013 particularly in Asia Pacific, it's much more driven by what's going on with RevPAR since there aren't owner priority returns there. And that will be an interesting thing to watch. And I think you saw that clearly in Q1 with the outperformance in incentive fees with the very strong outperformance in Asia Pacific. And we similarly saw the one-third, two-third split in IMFs in Q1.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","The other point to keep in mind is the group commissions reduction took effect for bookings after April 1, 2018, 90-plus percent of all group bookings for 2018 are on the books prior to that, maybe close to 95% if you think of as of April 1. So the commission reduction is not likely to have much of an impact in 2018. That will build over the years ahead as more new bookings get made.","Brandt Montour - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. That's helpful color. Thanks. And then a follow-up or a second question, which corporate customer segments are growing the fastest for you guys besides what you mentioned on the oil pads? And can you differentiate between volume and price?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, in general we're pleased with the price overall, I will say. From a rate perspective we just generally feel good. I think when you're talking about fundamental business, we continue to see the oil and gas from a percentage increased basis right at the top. But then for very steady kind of above average professional services and technology, I would put at the top of the list. We still continue to see good numbers for financial services, but not like the professional services and the technology and the oil and gas.","Brandt Montour - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Patrick?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Patrick, are you there?","Operator","Patrick, your line is open.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Now we can.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. We can.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thank you. I apologize in advance, just a little bit of a devil's advocate question here. But as we think about your financial projections going forward, it seems that with the changes in the rewards program, a little bit of devaluation of the Starwood side of things, how do we think about customer attrition from the Starwood loyalty customers in that regard going forward?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, the response we've gotten from Marriott and Starwood customers has been overwhelmingly positive. And remember what goes into this calculation for every customer is starts with the value of the program. And the value of the program really is about both points earning and where can I use those points. We have with the new credit cards a powerful supercharged approach to collecting points. We have with the points earned for hotel stays maintained if not increased the value to the customers, including the SPG customers. And as a consequence we think that the value equation looks very good.","There is a huge advantage to all of the customers in that now with one loyalty program it will be much easier to earn elite status and the breadth of choice for redemptions as well is simpler. And so think about the comparison to the airline industry, if you will. Depending on where you all live that is one of the significant factors that goes into which airline you tend to prefer, because if you're in Dallas, you're likely be an American person. If you're in Atlanta, you're likely to be Delta. If you're in Washington, you're probably more likely to be an United. We don't have that weakness in the sense that we are able to offer places to stay in 127 different countries around the world. We offer more choice than any other hotel loyalty program. And as a consequence, both on the earnings side and the redemption side, it is a pretty powerful flow.","And lastly, and I hinted at this a bit in the prepared remarks, but when you look at, okay, do I want to earn all these points, one of the answers is, what can I use them for. And when you look at our distribution in the higher end of the market, luxury, lifestyle, resort destinations, the redemption options are dramatically better than any of our competitors. I think you roll all those things together and we are very optimistic that we will increase our share of wallet, not see any decrease in share of wallet of our loyalty customers. And we'll continue to grow that customer community from the 110 million or so that we're at today to a substantially bigger number.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, thank you. That's it.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, Jared.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Jared?","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Can you hear me?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Now we can. Go ahead.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Sorry. Phone issues. So we see the cost synergies in the SG&A line, but is there a way to quantify if you've captured any revenue synergies so far? And as we think about those revenue synergies pulling up following loyalty and reservation integration, where should we see evidence of that? Is it mostly just the RevPAR line? And if so, should we expect that you'll outperform on RevPAR in the following years just from those synergies?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, the RevPAR index which we actually I think as a lodging-focused investment community probably don't talk about as much as maybe we should. RevPAR index is the single measure that cuts through geographic distribution, cuts through reliance on group business, cuts through chain scale, and allows us to say, how are you competing against the market. And one of the reasons we don't talk about it as much is because it's not published in a way that allows you to see it quickly. You see the industry prognosticators reporting RevPAR. You see the companies reporting RevPAR. And we'll often talk about index, but we may not always talk about index. And if we talk about index, you can't necessarily pierce through what it is we're saying to have your own source of data for it.","When we look at our performance from the time we closed the Starwood acquisition, so we're about 1.5 years in, we've been gratified to see that we have taken index steadily albeit modestly in those six quarters or so. And in some respects it's not surprising because we haven't yet merged those loyalty programs. And we're just completing the merging of the sales and revenue management teams. And those are the kinds of things that are most likely to drive the share of wallet. But it's been pretty positive nevertheless because you would also expect pulling two big companies like this together and two sales forces and the uncertainty that comes from that that there could be some distraction or some other things which would actually cause a dip in relative performance. And we haven't seen that. And we've seen good strength.","As we get into the merging of these loyalty programs, which really is an August and later 2018 event, we are optimistic that we will see an increase of share of wallet and that should translate into index growth. And of course, we'll be talking about index growth as those numbers get put in the books. I think the other thing we look at, of course, is the strength of the credit card programs. We know already, based on the negotiations we've done with Chase and Amex that they are as excited as we are about the power of this platform. And we see that in the terms of the deals we've negotiated with them, but we also see that in the way we talk with them about the opportunities we have together to grow this program. And obviously, we'll be talking about the contribution to the system and to us from those credit card programs in the years ahead.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","And I just want to add onto that, which is from the standpoint of the credit cards that Arne's talking about, remember that the credit card fees is just one component of the growth that we've got. We were able, through the renegotiation of this combined company credit card arrangement, to also increase the benefits to the customers as well as increased benefits to the owners and also increased benefits to the shareholders.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just as my follow up, you talked about the strength in the Asia Pacific region. Is your relationship with Alibaba translating into that performance right now? Or is the strength you're seeing mostly just other factors, be it demand or other issues? And then are you seeing more willingness from Chinese consumers to move up the chain scale? Is that helping you at all?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, the data from the Chinese traveler is uniformly positive. And remember, we've got \u2013 I think about within China first maybe, in Shanghai we must have something like 40 hotels open. Shanghai is the most international city in China. Our hotels are skewed dramatically towards the high end. And the bulk of our business in our China hotels, even in Shanghai, is Chinese. Now that's business travel as well as leisure travel, but you're seeing that the Chinese are participating in the high end of the market within China, and you're seeing the same thing in the China outbound markets. We're seeing good growth year-over-year. It is double-digit growth Chinese volume to essentially every market around the world. Not surprisingly, the biggest markets for Chinese outbound travel are going to be near to China; Macau, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand to name a few, obvious \u2013 Australia, to name a few obvious choices, but it includes growth to Europe and growth to the United States as well.","The Alibaba piece, we are certain it is contributing to us. It's hard for us to know exactly what percentage it's fueling. And that's something we will continue to watch with them as that JV platform gets more and more rolled out. We mentioned that some of these things are coming now, Alipay, but also the new storefront on Fliggy. And we did this for a reason. We think we can deliver real value to Alibaba's Chinese membership about 500 million strong, and we can drive great results for us and it should be successful for both of us. Still a little bit early, but I think it is clearly a positive.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stuart Gordon of Berenberg.","Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Yeah. Good morning. Just curious on your development pipeline and just on the chain scales. Would we be right in assuming that they're broadly similar as geographic splits or how about particularly the upper upscale and luxury? Is it askew there to any particular region?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","So let's \u2013 somebody can pull the...","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","...chart for me as we talk. But we're right now, let's talk about our regions first. Right now, our existing hotels are about two-thirds in the United States and one-third outside the United States. And the pipeline is a bit more than half, not dramatically more than half, but a bit more than half outside the United States and about half in the United States. So we are in the pipeline skewing more than our existing distribution towards international markets.","We mentioned in the prepared comments that our luxury and upper upscale share there is substantial, particularly when compared to the rest of the industry. But I think we are seeing globally the power of these Select brands. And so any market in the world, including the United States but also including Asia, we are seeing that the Courtyards and Fairfields and ACs and Moxys are becoming very attractive to our owning partners. And so I suspect that the pipeline is also skewing a bit more to Select-Service than our existing distribution in like-for-like markets. Remember though that as we're going to more international, the international markets in absolute terms are more full service in terms of the pipeline than the domestic ones. So that shift is probably not dramatic. Leeny, Laura, anything to add.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","No, correct. No.","Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up. I think in the prepared comments you mentioned that leverage is now at the lower end of your leverage range. And you've also said that you've a growing confidence in the economy. Should we be expecting that to migrate slightly up the way? Or are you more comfortable keeping it around about where it's just now through the next 12 months or so?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","We continue to be comfortable in the 3.25 times range. The reality is with our continued asset sales and the various \u2013 you can't always plan exactly when that cash is coming in. We have tended over the last four quarters to be down closer to the bottom end of the 3.0 times. And the numbers that we actually gave in our guidance today, the modeling that we've used is actually at a 3.20 times coverage. So I guess to your point, yes, I think we're comfortable as we think about managing it towards the higher part of the 3.0 times to 3.25 times, but still obviously in that range.","Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. I guess, kind of \u2013 good morning. Can you hear me?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. We can.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay, great. Yeah. So a longer-term question coming back to alternative accommodations. I think you mentioned some things changed regarding the legality as well as this kind of level playing field concept with regards to hotel tax, both of which raised your interest today versus a couple of years ago. But those changes aside, I was just curious for your perspective on where do you think consumer demand is at for alternative accommodations as well as the ability to browse for those stays, hotel and accommodation side-by-side. So I guess directly if the sharing program in London were to go well, could we at some point see hotel product and home sharing products side by side on marriott.com?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. I mean already in the London pilot essentially that is the case. If you search London, you can find a link up to Tribute Homes and be able to do both. And the notion, of course, here is driven by \u2013 it's our view. I think it's probably fairly undebatable that giving folks more choice is a positive thing. It is what has driven us to not just acquire Starwood but to try and compete with 30 different brands and have the kind of choice within the hotel space. And here we can offer a bit more choice, but again, choice that has the kind of quality we want to have connected to our system. And we think by having that loyalty program and that breadth of choice, we drive strength of all elements within that portfolio and think we can do more of that in the years ahead.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great, thanks. And then a second question on the fee guide. Impressive going to, I think it's 11% or 12-ish, up about 300 bps, 400 bps from the prior. I was curious you mentioned RevPAR might be part of that move higher, units is relatively unchanged as is the credit card. Is it 1 point or 2 tailwind from FX? And then what type of headwind is there from non-hotel fees that you're kind of overcoming because when you add up the credit card, the FX, the RevPAR, and units, it almost seems to point to something in the teens.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. So let's kind of run through those. First of all you're right. FX is \u2013 we're kind of go back to the broad view of 1 point of RevPAR typically for us in the broadest sense is typically about $35 million. So if you say, okay, we got about 1.5 point increase that takes you up to over $50 million increase in fees. Then we've talked about an additional $25 million from FX.","So roughly these are always hard because it depends on what happens with which currency. But just most broadly one percentage point change in the value of the dollar assuming it happens evenly gets you to about $11 million. And we've told you that our fee guidance has gone up $25 million relative to where we were before. So you've got the RevPAR, you've got the FX component.","And then when you look at the non credit card related fees, the delta that we've talked about really overwhelmingly reflects the increase in the credit card fees. So if you remember now app fees and timeshare fees are largely fixed. Application relicensing fees now have to be amortized over time, so they don't jump up and down the way they used to when you were able to take them in from cash, so they're going to be pretty steady.","And then residential branding fees are really a relatively smaller component. And while they may go up or down $5 million or $10 million, it's really the credit card, the $360 million to $380 million that overwhelmingly drives the growth in that section.","And then the last point I'll make is that, when we think of our classic rule of the $35 million for 1 point of RevPAR, when you see that the outperformance in RevPAR is in Asia Pacific, that's obviously going to skew a little bit higher towards the IMF side of things given there's no owner priority. So I think that's part of what you're seeing is that we've increased our expected growth rate from IMFs fairly meaningfully as a result of the strong RevPAR performance, particularly in Asia Pacific.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, two questions. I guess the first will be a follow-up on the credit card fees. Just to be clear, I guess, did you recognize, I guess, an equal contribution in the first quarter relative to what you'd expect over the course of the year? Or should it be steady over each quarter?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","You mean from a growth perspective year-over-year?","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I guess, you can define it either as a contribution to growth or just absolute dollars?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","In absolute, what did we talk about? $87 million?","Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.","$86 million in the first quarter.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, $86 million and we've talked about $370 million for the whole year. So that would give you that it would actually, which would make sense as you would expect it would grow a bit as you continue to see new cardholders and increased spend from consumers over time. But as we talked about before, again the increase year-over-year is overwhelmingly driven by the increased terms in the agreement. But yes, you would expect it to grow during the year.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Makes sense that's helpful. And then an unrelated follow-up. We've seen some changes in kind of search results through Google and other OTAs. I'm curious, if you've seen any changes there that impacted your direct booking trends and any color you can provide on that campaign? Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","No, I think we're seeing a good stickiness with our efforts to drive direct bookings. We're seeing good growth on our digital platforms and trying to move that forward. And obviously those are the bag of features that we've talked about over the last few years, member only rates, some features that are available to loyalty members and not others.","And I think as the loyalty program gets stickier and stronger with the credit card program, we should continue to see that those customers grow and those customers are much more inclined to book directly. And that's the case almost no matter what happens with the search algorithms or approach that some of these platforms are taking. If the customers know that it is clearly in their interest to book direct, they're going to find a way to book direct.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And have you provided the percentage that's booked through your app specifically and how that's growing? Thanks.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I don't know that we have, and I'm not sure we will this morning. But it won't surprise you that digital growth and the mobile growth as well as the app growth is very robust.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Overall digital reservations are just a hair over 26% for the year 2017 anyway. Total direct would be 72% through a combination of digital and on property including group bookings done at property and through the telephone.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Felicia.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Just Leeny, on the credit card branding fees, I was just wondering is there any way to grow that? For example, is there a language in the contracts that would allow you to benefit from upside if spending is greater than expected?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Absolutely. Absolutely. But again, time will tell. We're introducing new cards. We just introduced the new Chase card. The new Amex card will come out in August. And from that perspective, we've looked forward to lots of folks signing up and using the card. But what's in this year's expectations of the $360 million to $380 million is a bit of a steady-as-she-goes cardholder usage and numbers of cardholders. And overwhelmingly the increase related to 2017 is because of the new terms. But yes, there's increased usage absolutely over time.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. But so far just the $360 million to $380 million is representing that \u2013 so there could be upside to that?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Again it all depends...","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Right.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","...on behavior of consumers. It's kind of this I would call completely normal not out of the ordinary sort of spend this year. But some normal growth because that's what we've seen over the past few years is some normal growth.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then Arne just a little bit earlier you were talking about the international part of your pipeline and how your exposure to international is better than your existing distribution. But just wondering how we should think about that going forward. Do you think you could get that percentage to something even higher like in the 60s or even higher? And then also you discussed the construction headwinds in the U.S. I'm just wondering if there's any headwinds in any of your international regions to talk about. I know we've talked about China in the past so maybe that and anything else.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I think it's a good question. I think this is a sort of a longer-term question. But I suspect over time we'll continue to see that international mix continuing to rise. It's a big world out there. Obviously, our distribution outside the U. S. is much lower in terms of percentage of the total industry than it is in the United States. And much of the rest of the world has got economic growth numbers and growth in the middle class numbers, which are more robust than the much more developed that exist in the United States.","Obviously, though at the same time we're big in the United States and we're gratified to see that we're continuing to grow in the United States. And we don't want to turn off our focus on seizing the opportunities that are available to us in this market. So you won't find us basically shutting down, if you will, our willingness to continue to grow in the United States.","In terms of construction delays and the like in other parts of the world, nothing probably as dramatic as the United States. It tends to depend on the robustness of the economy around the world and whether any of those economies have, if you will, more demand for construction materials or construction labor than they have supply. And I think generally that is much less the case in the rest of the world than it is here, certainly in terms of the material numbers.","Now there are other factors that go into development in other parts of the world, it can take a long time to get permits. There may be much less \u2013 many more permits that are required in some markets. Sometimes that development process is not very transparent and we obviously got to make sure that we and our partners are navigating that in a way which meets our standards. And so sometimes that takes longer for us than it would in the United States. But generally we're not seeing a deterioration, if you will, in the speed of the development process in the rest of the world.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great, helpful. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Speaking of development, it seems like your development partners in the United States have to be taking a haircut on expected returns given the construction cost, the labor cost increases, higher financing costs et cetera. I'm just wondering, are they coming to you for relief from a contract help with financing? What are you hearing from the folks in the U.S.?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. It's a pretty astute question, Bill. I think you're right. I think we've seen the cost of land increase. We've seen the cost of construction increase. We've seen the development period which also drives cost obviously during the development process, cost of capital particularly increase. And I suppose we're now on the front edge of seeing the cost of debt increase with interest rates starting to move up. Debt still seems to be reasonably well available certainly for experienced developers. And as a consequence I think they can find the money to pursue this.","I think at the same time there is a strong sense that even though the returns maybe have gotten a little bit less, the returns are still fairly healthy compared to returns available in other real estate classes, and maybe to some extent in other investment opportunities. And when you're looking at the Select-Service brands particularly there's less volatility in the performance of those hotels.","There's increased proof that those hotels can last and be competitive for a number of decades. You've got obviously lots of private platforms that are participating in this development process. And with the miracle of compounding, these are still pretty attractive deals. And I think as a consequence that's why we're continuing to see the development pace be as strong as it is.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. That's helpful.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","The only last factor I'd put in there Bill is while RevPAR growth at 2% or 3%, not to use our numbers in the U.S. is not as \u2013 I mean we'd love to see it be 2 or 3 times that size, but it's not that robust. But nevertheless the hotels in absolute terms are trading at really pretty good numbers. Good occupancies, good performance and with the predictability that I talked about before I think these are still investments which are attractive to folks.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","No, that's fair. My follow up Arne is whether there's any benefit to Marriott from the Marriott Vacation Club acquisition of ILG?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Generally it will simplify things and as a consequence I think we're supportive of it. We've got good relationships with MVW and ILG. Leeny and team had already completed negotiations with both of those companies so that we were free to proceed with the merger of the loyalty programs and the websites and all the rest of it. So those restrictions were behind us.","Nevertheless I think to be able to deal with one company and not have either one of them necessarily looking behind the curtains to see, always there are possibly something you've given to one that you haven't given to us, will simplify things a little bit. I don't think it'll be dramatic.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, everyone. Can we go back to the international IMFs? Can you talk about what the main drivers are that's driving that growth? Is it more rooms in the system? Is it a higher percentage of the rooms paying fees? Is it the operating profit growth? And then when you look at how much RevPAR growth you need for margin expansion?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","So you got a bunch of things there. So obviously, when you've got RevPAR for example in China that gets close to 12% you're going to get pretty spectacular margin improvement there. And with every dollar of increased profits, we get a share because in Asia Pacific there's no owner's priority. So from that perspective I would say that the biggest chunk of the growth in IMFs is coming from Asia Pacific and their very strong performance. When you look at the overall kind of percentage you are seeing that kind of year-over-year compared to a year ago the percentage of hotels earning incentive fees internationally did go up 3 percentage points, went up from 68% to 71%.","Overall for the company, actually down a little bit, because in the U.S. we had a couple of large limited service portfolios that with relatively speaking lower managed RevPAR growth they paid a lower percentage of incentive fees. But again, it was two-thirds, one-third and that is two-thirds of our IMFs coming from international, you're clearly seeing the benefit of the fact that most of those contracts do not have owner's priority. And I'd say from a unit growth perspective for ramping up hotels, you're getting a nice amount of IMFs but I would say that the RevPAR growth is the biggest driver.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then when we look at that two-thirds or just the international component of the IMF, how much is the Asia Pacific region of that bucket?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","We can get it for you. I don't have it.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.","This is Laura. Give me a call after the call and I'll get that for you.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","I will say in general that our fees overall tend to be fairly well distributed relative to the room count, but you are going to find obviously particularly this time that Asia Pacific on the IMF side is going to be higher proportionately.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Arne Sorenson for any closing comments.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","All right. Thank you all very much for your participation and your attention today. It's great as always to talk with you. Get out there and travel, we'd love to welcome you to our hotels.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"13753":["Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) Q2 2013 Earnings Call August  1, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Arne M.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Arne M. Sorenson","Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Carl Berquist, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, August 1, 2013, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","We were pleased with our results in the second quarter. North American company-operated REVPAR increased 5.3% with 4.3% higher room rates. Occupancy rates and room rates were largely at 2007 peak levels or higher. Transient business was very strong. At the comparable company-operated Marriott hotels, transient REVPAR increased over 6% in the quarter. And it remained strong throughout the quarter, rising 7% in March and April combined, 6% in May and 7% in June. Leisure business was hot. Weekend REVPAR rose nearly 8% at the Marriott brand, 9% at Courtyard and 9% at Ritz-Carlton. Overall, Ritz-Carlton's REVPAR index -- REVPAR increased over 7% in North America, as the business continued to improve their mix of luxury business, eliminating discounts and selling more rooms at high retail room rates.","Regarding group business, we remain encouraged by the favorable trends in long-term bookings, as meeting planners continue to lengthen their booking windows. But short-term group business weakened in the U.S. as the quarter progressed. For the Marriott brand, company-operated REVPAR rose 4% in the quarter, with a 5% increase in room rates. Group REVPAR rose 17% in April, as we benefited from the timing of Easter, declined 1% in May, and declined 5% in June. Our large convention hotels, as well as hotels in Washington and Boston, were particularly impacted by weaker group demand as the quarter progressed.","Where possible, hotels compensated for the group shortfalls by growing more transient business. In Downtown Washington, D.C., weak government group and government transient demand caused REVPAR at our company-operated hotels to decline 1% in the quarter, while REVPAR at suburban D.C. hotels fell 5%. In fact, excluding the greater D.C. market, our company-operated REVPAR in North America would have increased 6.5%, a full 120 basis points higher than the 5.3% reported for the quarter. In Boston, a tough year-over-year comparison and fewer citywide conventions yielded 1% REVPAR growth year-over-year.","We continue to explore the reasons for the weakness in group demand in the U.S. Several issues are probably responsible. First, we believe we are still experiencing a lingering impact from the recession, as many large groups booked only modestly in 2009 and 2010 for meetings now occurring in 2013. In addition, we've seen increases in meeting space supply in recent years in convention centers, at corporate conference centers and at a few hotels. Since 2009, as the recovery has progressed, we have filled in this recession-era group booking shortfall with shorter-term group and transient business. Fortunately, transient business continues to strengthen, but short-term group has not. Corporations are watching their bottom line and given the economic climate, are cautious about discretionary spending. Not surprisingly, austerity is even more pronounced among government meeting planners. In 2010, government group represented 5% of the Marriott brand group business. In 2013, we anticipate only 2% of our group business will come from Uncle Sam.","More encouragingly, we are turning away groups at some hotels, either because of lack of availability or because we are attracting higher-rated transient customers. Occupancy at comparable company-operated Marriott hotels in the U.S. totaled 78% on average in the second quarter. Company-operated hotels in Chicago, Houston, San Francisco and the California desert all reported double-digit REVPAR growth in the quarter, steadily increasing their mix of transient business and pushing room rates higher.","We don't believe the group dynamic is a systemic issue. With strong transient demand and very low supply growth in the U.S., we expect occupancy rates will also remain strong and pricing will improve steadily. At the same time, we are also adding resources to our sales organization, focused on especially large meetings at all our largest hotels. Competitively, we are in good shape as our group REVPAR index for the Marriott brand rose 5 full percentage points in the last 2 years and nearly 2 points in the last 12 months alone.","Turning to international markets. We are encouraged by signs of improvement in Europe. Including all brands during the quarter, occupancy at our company-operated hotels there totaled 78%, with REVPAR up about 1% in the quarter. We saw particular strength in France and Russia. Comparisons in London, by contrast, will be difficult in the third quarter due to last year's Olympics, but we are seeing signs of modest improvement for the fourth quarter.","In the Asia Pacific region, occupancy totaled 72% and constant dollar REVPAR across all brands increased 2.5%. We saw particular REVPAR strength in Indonesia and Thailand. In Greater China, despite slower economic growth, occupancy across all brands totaled 72% in the quarter and REVPAR rose nearly 1% on a constant dollar basis, or nearly 3% using actual currencies. In 2012, outbound travel from China to our hotels in the Asia Pacific region increased 18%, and outbound China travelers to our worldwide hotels increased 21%. In the second quarter alone, outbound travel from China to our hotels in the Asia Pacific region increased another 30% year-over-year, while outbound travel from China to our worldwide hotels increased 16%. We remain excited about the long-term business opportunity in China. Our development booking pace in China has accelerated and our REVPAR index in the second quarter rose a whopping 6 percentage points.","In the Middle East and Africa, across all brands, constant dollar REVPAR increased 11%, a result that is likely to reverse in the second half of the year, given the recent events in Egypt. Long term, the region offers terrific opportunities, and our pipeline today includes nearly 45 hotels.","In summary, our REVPAR outlook for 2013 assumes a steady-as-she-goes view of North American and European demand and a more conservative view of demand trends in Asia and the Middle East. While we have tightened the range of our outlook for worldwide REVPAR growth, we remain very bullish about our long-term prospects.","Turning to development. We recently enhanced staffing and responsibilities in our international regions. This more decentralized structure is allowing us to more effectively tailor products to local sensibilities and to develop new hotels faster. The rollout of new products such as Fairfield in India and Brazil, Courtyard in Mexico and MOXY in Europe would not have occurred as quickly if key decision-making was limited only to Bethesda, Maryland. We've had great success tailoring our U.S. brands for guests in regions around the world. This year, we're also taking our 75-hotel-strong AC Hotel brand that originated in Spain and importing it to the United States. Since our announcement of this just 2 months ago, we already have more than 2 dozen new AC Hotel projects in the United States under discussion.","Our new EDITION hotel in London is on track to open later this year, to be followed by the South Beach EDITION and the new Clock Tower EDITION. Our model hasn't changed. We look to sell these assets subject to long-term agreements when the timing is right.","We opened the new JW Marriott Essex House just 10 months ago, introducing the JW Marriott luxury brand to the important New York market. The conversion has been very successful. This quarter, occupancy at the Essex House reached 85%, with a more than $450 room rate, a double-digit increase year-over-year. Our flagship brand, Marriott Hotels, is also on the move. This year, the Marriott brand team rolled out Red Coat Direct, which enables a meeting planner to manage meetings with the touch of a tablet real-time. We also introduced exciting new meetings space designs to increase the effectiveness of group meetings, and introduced a new marketing campaign called Travel Brilliantly, targeting the brand to the lifestyle of the next-generation traveler. Since 2007, our already high REVPAR index for the Marriott Hotel brand has improved by roughly 250 basis points. We hope you stay with us soon to experience the contemporary approach and energy in that brand.","Our development organization is firing on all cylinders. Our hotel system size has grown by 12% since 2009, with another 22% growth embedded in our current development pipeline. All this in a very low U.S. supply growth environment. In the second quarter alone, we signed 16,000 new rooms, double the amount signed in the second quarter a year ago. In the last 24 months, our worldwide development pipeline has increased 40%, from 100,000 rooms to more than 140,000 rooms. In 2013, we expect to open approximately 30,000 rooms and sign more than 50,000 new rooms worldwide. Development in China, India and Thailand is accelerating and global room openings in 2014 should increase from 2013 levels. By the way, 1\/4 of our worldwide room additions in the second quarter were conversions from other brands.","To be sure, today's development environment for full-service hotels in North America remains challenging, but we see some loosening of credit for limited-service development, albeit with significant owner equity required. Given the strength in franchisee demand for our brands, beginning in June 2014, we expect to increase our royalties in the U.S. for new and relicensed Fairfields from 4.5% to 5% of room revenue and for new and relicensed Residence Inns from 5.5% to 6% of room revenue.","Not surprisingly, we are taking share as measured by number of rooms. In fact, based on STR industry pipeline data, once again this quarter, 1 in 4 hotels under construction in the United States will fly one of our flags. And worldwide, 1 in 8 hotels under construction will be flagged with the Marriott brand. Our congratulations to the hotel development team for an excellent job.","Now, to talk more about our performance in the second quarter, as well as our outlook, here's Carl.","Carl T. Berquist","Thanks, Arne. For the second quarter 2013, diluted earnings per share totaled $0.57, within our guidance of $0.55 to $0.59. We were at the midpoint of the guidance we provided in May, with several unforecasted items which largely offset each other. On the positive side, our owned and leased hotel line benefited by about $0.02 of higher-than-expected termination fees. On the gain line, we earned $0.02 per share from the sale of securities. On the other hand, total fees were about $0.01 shy of the midpoint of guidance, given the REVPAR performance. G&A was about $0.02 more than anticipated due to higher-than-expected workout costs and key money impairments. On the joint venture line, our impairment of a joint venture investment cost us about $0.01.","Total fee revenue reached $407 million, compared to $342 million in the year-ago quarter. We estimate roughly $25 million of the year-over-year fee revenue improvement in the quarter was associated with the change in our fiscal calendar. With strong performance among many of our domestic full-service hotels, U.S. incentive fees increased more than 35% in the quarter. In North America, nearly 1\/3 of the full-service managed hotels paid incentive fees, compared to 1\/4 in the prior year. Worldwide, over 1\/3 of managed hotels paid incentive fees in the quarter, compared to 30% in the second quarter of 2012.","Worldwide house profit margins in company-operated hotels increased 130 basis points. These margins are not adjusted for the shifting fiscal calendar, so they are comparable to our calendar quarter REVPAR stats. But we were pleased with the performance. In fact, we expect roughly 100 to 150 basis points of margin improvement for the full year. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $51 million in the quarter. We estimate the longer fiscal quarter increased results by approximately $6 million. These results reflected lower profits at our leased hotel in London, higher costs associated with lease terminations in Germany and tough comparisons to last year's $2 million business interruption payment in Tokyo. Incidentally, termination fees in the second quarter totaled $13 million, compared to $14 million in the prior year. They aren't meaningful to the quarter's year-over-year comparison, but you should keep it in mind when modeling next year.","General and administrative expenses totaled $179 million in the second quarter, compared to $160 million in the prior year. The longer fiscal quarter added an estimated $11 million of higher costs compared to the prior year. We also booked a $5 million performance cure payment in the quarter. Compared to our expectations, G&A was a higher than our forecast, due to the $5 million performance cure payment and $5 million of key money impairment associated with terminated contracts.","Operating income totaled $279 million in the second quarter. And our adjusted operating profit margin, excluding the impact of reimbursed costs, increased to 43%.","Looking ahead, we expect third quarter REVPAR to increase 4% to 6% in North America. This assumes continued strong transient business and weak group, as Arne said. International REVPAR growth should be weaker, given the trends in Asia and the Middle East and the tough comparison in Europe. For you modelers, we estimate the shift in fiscal calendar will add approximately $26 million to third quarter operating income and reduce operating income in the fourth quarter by about $64 million.","We expect third quarter G&A to total $165 million to $175 million. We estimate roughly $12 million of the increase in G&A will be due to the longer calendar. The remainder of the year-over-year increase is largely related to the cost of our new brand and service initiative and routine increases in compensation and other costs.","You may recall that in last year's third quarter, we reported a $5 million net favorable litigation settlement. We also booked a $41 million pretax gain in the third quarter of 2012. All in all, we expect third quarter operating income will total $215 million to $235 million, and diluted EPS will total $0.42 to $0.46.","For full year 2013, we expect worldwide system-wide REVPAR to increase 4% to 6%. Fee revenue could increase 7% to 10%. We remain cautious about demand trends in Asia and the Middle East, and short-term group trends in North America, but we are encouraged by a 6% group revenue booking pace in the U.S. for the fourth quarter. We have already booked nearly 95% of our expected U.S. group business for 2013.","We expect owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses will decline year-over-year for full year 2013. Our leased hotel in London faces a weak economy and a tough comparison to last year's Olympics, particularly in the third quarter. We are also renovating a few leased properties in 2013, which we expect to be disruptive to results for the rest of this year.","Preopening costs for our EDITION hotel are expected to total $5 million for the year, of which we've already booked about $2 million in the first half. We've also booked the cost to terminate 3 hotel leases totaling $4 million in the second quarter.","We expect our general and administrative expenses will total $690 million to $700 million in 2013. While our G&A growth appears high in our third quarter outlook, much of the increase is timing related. We believe G&A in the fourth quarter will decline significantly as the calendar impact becomes very favorable, and we have easier comps to last year's litigation expense.","We expect 2013 operating income to total $975 million to $1.025 billion, including about a $5 million benefit from the 4 extra days in fiscal 2013, 4% to 9% over 2012 levels.","All in all, we expect fully diluted EPS will total $1.92 to $2.03 in 2013, a 12% to 18% increase from 2012. Excluding the impact of the $25 million after-tax gain on the sale of our Courtyard joint venture in 2012, this is a 17% to 24% increase year-over-year.","Our cash flow is very strong. We continue to expect investment spending could total $600 million to $800 million, including about $100 million in maintenance spending. We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and repurchases and expect to recycle capital. We repurchased 7 million shares during the second quarter and over 88 million shares over the past 3 years. In fact, over that time, our weighted average diluted share count has declined by over 15%. In 2013, we expect to return $800 million to $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.","We appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] We are not limited to 1 hour today and expect to stay until all your questions are answered. Maria, we'll take the questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker of MLV & Co.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","I think -- I appreciate the color on groups that you started with, Arne, but I was hoping you might be able to give us a little bit more detail in terms of what's going on there. Can -- if I missed it, I apologize, but can you give us how group is pacing in the back half of the year and then into 2014 and 2015? You talked about larger groups coming in stronger, longer-term groups, coming in stronger. Right now, are you seeing that on the association front or is that purely corporate? Any color there will be helpful.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. Thanks, Ryan. It's a perfectly appropriate first question, I would think. The -- and you could tell from the prepared comments that there is, we think, a number of different reasons that are impacting group business. We'd love to be able to provide you with a little bit more clarity and tell you that we've got a really concrete sense of exactly what's going on, but we're watching the same sort of data that you are. I think on the negative side, you look at what happened in the Q2 in the quarter for the quarter bookings, you look at group revenue paid and stayed, and you see a declining trend, from positive 17 in April, albeit benefited by Easter timing, to negative 5 in June. And you see our full year numbers, we look at Q4 being actually fairly strong, with group revenue on the books up about 6% from the same time last year, from last year's fourth quarter, but Q3 essentially being flattish. And that, too, basically says, \"All right, what's going on in the short term?\" I'll give you a little bit more data before bringing this around to some conclusions. When we look at bookings in Q2 of 2013 for all future periods, group business only, and this is for the Marriott brand, Q2 bookings were up 12.9%. It's a huge number. Now for the rest of '13, compared to last year's Q2 for the rest of '12, they were up only 0.6%. So you see that stark difference between bookings for the balance of 2013 compared to bookings for 2014 and all future years, which were up above 18% in the quarter. Those are -- that's the kind of data that we're looking at that tells us that it is not systemic, it's not long term. It is a short-term dynamic, we think. That short-term dynamic, we think, is partly impacted by the bookings that were done less robustly a few years ago when the economic conditions were weaker. We think it's probably partly driven by the high occupancy and the strength in transient that's available. And therefore, we've probably got a little less aggression going after some group business and to some extent, some unavailability. And I suspect it's also driven to some extent by some tentativeness among group customers. And that probably is a little more on the association side than the corporate side, but we don't see a dramatic difference between the 2. All in all, I think what we can say with the most confidence is we think it is short term, and we do not think it is systemic. But we'll continue to watch it and report to you as we go along.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Thanks, Arne, that's a good color. And then, I guess, just as a quick follow-up on that. Given the challenges with short-term bookings, are you hoping to enter 2014 with more group on the books than you historically would have been looking for, as your -- with uncertainties surrounding short-term filling in the gaps in '14?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I mean, if the question is are we trying to book group up '14 compared to what we would have done in 2013? I think the answer is probably not. We're still a little early to be talking about '14. But I think transient demand is a very powerful bright spot. If we get towards the end of the fall and when we're doing our planning and continue to see transient perk along at that kind of pace, I think we will be captured by the strength of that business and would not look to group up in a way that would push some of that business away. Having said that, obviously, the group houses, particularly, the big group houses, are aggressively going after bookings. And I think today, for 2014, our revenue on the books is up only about 2% from where it would have been for '13 a year ago. So that's not great, and we'll keep pushing that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Arne, I'm curious, do think we've seen the worst of the pullback from, of the government in terms of room demand? Or do you think there's going to be more to come?","Arne M. Sorenson","That's a good question. I -- hopefully, we've seen the worst. At the same time, I don't think any of us should think it's going to get much better any time soon. We talked about, on the group side, government going from 5% of our group business in the Marriott brand to about 2% now. But I suppose, in theory, it could go to 0, but it shouldn't. I mean, there's some level of government business that even the most extreme voice against government spending should be careful about cutting, and it's really necessary for that organization to function as well as it can. So there's probably some downside risk. But maybe the only good news about how weak it is, is it's not. There's not much left to give up.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And I guess as a follow-up, let me just switch gears. Can you talk about the process of bringing AC Hotels and maybe the MOXY brands to the U.S. and how you're thinking about positioning those versus your existing brands and competitors from, I guess, price or customer profile? And maybe where you think your unit potential ultimately is?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, the -- we have made no decision by the way, to bring MOXY to the United States. At least not yet. We have -- we're off to a great start in Europe with MOXY. We announced it at the lodging conference in Berlin in March and with partnership that we've got with the Inter IKEA real estate folks, we are well underway. And I think I've got a dozen or so specific MOXYs that either have already been approved or are pending committee approval. And I think we'll open our first, roughly the end of the first quarter of 2014. So we feel really good about that. But we want to make sure we get that brand launched well before we start to broaden its geographic footprint. And I don't think we'll think aggressively about moving MOXY into other markets around the world until we get underway in Europe. AC has been interesting. AC, we bought into Antonio Catalan's company about 2.5 years ago, obviously, a big focus in Spain, secondary focus in Italy. Our timing in Spain in retrospect wasn't spectacular, given that Spain has continued to get worse and worse. On the other hand, we've been really pleased with the quality of the hotels and the way the brand fits in, and have probably opened another half dozen or so ACs outside of Spain and Italy, France being the most prominent market in Europe. And I think as our U.S. franchisees, who obviously have a long-term relationship with us, look at what we are doing with the AC brand. They started pushing us, maybe 1 year ago or so, to think about bringing AC to the United States. Sometimes that comment was specifically directed at AC. And sometimes it was a more generic comment, which was, \"Marriott, we would really like for you to have another brand to play in the upscale tier that probably has more of a lifestyle flavor to it.\" And those sets of comments caused us to start to think seriously about AC and talking to our folks about, our partners here whether or not they were really interested in that. And upon doing the work that we needed to do, we saw a great appetite. And so that's why we've got 2 dozen of these hotels, very specific hotels, that are either approved or under negotiation. And we feel really good about the way that brand is likely to grow in the United States.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Loeb of Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'd like to dive a little further into the government issue and the D.C. performance. Do you think this is entirely sequester-related, or are there other factors at play? And is it mostly transient in the outskirts of D.C., or is it government group as well?","Arne M. Sorenson","So, it's certainly -- it's group and transient. Is it entirely sequester-related? I don't know. I think the government has been in decline for the last 2 to 3 years. Sequester is obviously the most recent word we use to describe that decline and is a kind of specific cause in 2013. Having said that, you've got a military that's probably pulling back from a couple of wars. And you saw the Defense Secretary out yesterday talking about shrinking the size of military forces. Now, it's not necessarily soldiers and sailors that are the primary occupants for group business or transient business from the government. But I think that's a piece of a government that is declining. And so I would think, whether it's a sequester-related or not, that the government weakness is the overwhelming cause for weakness in the greater D.C. market. You see a little bit of a difference between urban D.C. and suburban D.C., because I think when you get to urban D.C., more of that business is independent from the government. So it would be your prototypical lawyers and lobbyists and tourists coming to see D.C. and folks doing business with D.C. companies, of which there are a number. But aspects of D.C., which are less reliant on government, which is why there's relatively more strength there than there would be in the suburbs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Arne, maybe to move over to the SG&A line, that budget came in a little bit higher for the year now than I think we were expecting previously. And you mentioned a couple things in your prepared remarks about, I think, first of all, maybe some investments in the meeting, kind of in the meeting or the sales force side, and then separately, some things you're doing on the international side. Could you just give us some buckets of where some of that extra expense might be going?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I mean, as Carl's comments pointed out to, the biggest reason for the increase in our guidance for full year G&A is some of the noise that came through in the second quarter. So we had an investment management contract we had to write off as we lost a hotel. We had a workout of an existing contract, which we kept in the system, but because of the way the accounting rules, our investment in that contract had to be expensed in one fell swoop. And while not in the G&A line, we had a technology joint venture which we wrote off -- wrote down to 0 in the quarter. But those first 2 things are really about $10 million of a -- I think we increased our full year guidance by $10 million to $15 million, if I remember right.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, the rest was just fine-tuning, really. Besides those 2 items, the rest was really just fine-tuning.","Arne M. Sorenson","So I wouldn't view the increase in guidance for G&A as being anything related to sort of steady-state G&A spending. We think that when you get through the transitory stuff, we're probably looking at about a 5% steady-state increase in G&A, '13 versus '12. That is higher than we'd like it to be. I think in normal years, the drivers for that really would be around a lot of the global growth stuff that we've got going on. So we bragged in our prepared remarks about signing 16,000 new rooms in the second quarter alone and feel really good about that. But that is driven by investing in efforts to get growth platforms and growth resources spread around the world, things like the launching of the MOXY brand, the work that we're doing to essentially relaunch EDITION this year with the opening of London and then the other hotels right behind it. And then back to the U.S., there's costs associated with launching the AC brand in the United States. Those would be the kinds of costs that are more likely to drive G&A than anything else.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. And then, I guess, my follow-up would be, you also mentioned some increases in the royalty rates for a couple of your brands. And at least in the last 4 or 5 years, that's probably the first time I've heard anything like that. So can you elaborate just a little bit on that, and either why is now the strategic timing? Is there an opportunity to do that at any of the other brands in the future?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, our -- if you look across our brands, and our franchise circular is probably the best place for you to get it if you're a glutton for this stuff. But most of our brands are at the top end in terms of the franchise fee rates that are charged in the industry. Fairfield, Residence Inn, which we've talked about this morning, were about 0.5 point shy of the leader in their segments. And so, we are pleased with the progress that those brands have made. Fairfield has, as an example, culled a lot of the older product. The growth appetite from our partners is as strong as it's ever been for Fairfield. And so we've decided to move that franchise fee up to the same level that Fairfield's principal competitors are already charging. And again, as we said, this will apply really to new hotels and relicensings of old hotels, meaning, when those old hotels trade, but will not apply to the existing owners.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just following up on the expense questions, has anything changed with your thoughts around the Affordable Care Act now with the employer mandate delay? I think you had guided to about $60 million to $100 million of incremental expenses next year. Do you still expect to incur some cost?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, the $60 million to $100 million number came from a speech I gave in Atlanta in April, maybe April or May, I don't remember precisely. And to be clear, that was a system-wide expense in the United States. Obviously, fairly broad range. But certainly was driven by the expectation that the corporate mandate would be taking effect in the first of '14. It looks now like that is being delayed by a year. And so as we sit here today, I think our best guess -- and this, again, is a system-wide expense, this is, by and large, not our P&L, although it has an impact on our P&L, both as it impacts incentive fees and the few owned or leased hotels we have. But I think we would guess that right now, we're looking at high single-digit percentage increases in health care costs for the system for '14 versus '13 and something like double that in '15. But it is really hazardous to talk about '15 numbers at this point. And really, there's enough fluidity in what's happening with ObamaCare that I think we all ought to be careful about being too precise for '15.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just as my follow-up, can you just talk a little bit more about trends you're seeing in Asia Pacific and specifically in China? Sounds like China's been running around 3% for the past few quarters. You talked, I think, last quarter about getting an easier comp in the second half of the year. So just kind of how are you thinking about growth there?","Arne M. Sorenson","Okay, so China is -- we still think that we will have easier comps as the year progresses. And I won't remember these exactly right, but if recollection serves, I think first quarter of '12 in China, we had REVPAR of something like plus-12%. And then we moved down from that high-single digits, mid-single digits and by the fourth quarter of '12, low-single digits. Actually, Laura and Betsy are hinting to me that it was maybe even higher than 12% in the first quarter of last year, but -- so we started the year with a really tough comparison. And of course, with a couple of factors, probably 3 factors that impact demand in China. One is government austerity, which you're heard about from us and from many other participants in the industry. Second is some softening of the Chinese economy and growth rates that have come down by 1 point or 1.5 points. And the third would be some inter-regional tension, usually about who claims some of these uninhabited islands or various bodies of water between Korea and Japan and China. I think all of those factors remain in place. I think the government austerity has probably lasted a bit longer and been something that this new government is more committed to than we might have anticipated a year ago. And I think our expectation now would be that it would stay sort of as a steady-state basis. The Chinese economy looks to us to be performing. Maybe it's growing a little bit weaker than it did a year or 2 ago, but still broadly recovering, with really powerful trends in domestic travel, particularly in China. And so we see, even within this quarter, we saw Shanghai for example, I think up about 6% in REVPAR.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes.","Arne M. Sorenson","5%, excuse me.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes.","Arne M. Sorenson","While Beijing, by comparison, which is more dependent on government and had a little bit of that pollution hangover, was down something like 5%.","Carl T. Berquist","6%.","Arne M. Sorenson","Folks have asked about supply growth in China, and clearly there has been some supply growth. It varies a little bit market by market. I suspect we'll continue to see supply growth be fairly high. But we expect we'll continue to see the Chinese economy produce more and more domestic travel -- travelers as well as global inbound travel growth, and still think it's an extremely exciting market to bet on long term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Your release talks about 30,000 rooms to enter service now. And I guess previously, it was 30,000 to 35,000 rooms. Just the number of rooms leaving the system is unchanged. I guess is there anything slowing down in terms of pipeline? Is that Asia in particular or is it another region?","Carl T. Berquist","No, there's nothing unusual other than the difficulty in estimating construction patterns and construction timing, especially outside the U.S., particularly in Asia. It's not that these hotels or this pipeline has been canceled, evidenced by the fact that our pipeline continues to grow with new signings. It's really all about trying to estimate the timing of the openings. And also, our openings are back loaded, as you can see it, for the second half of the year. So we didn't see any cancellations of deals that caused us to say 30,000. It's more of just timing. And we would expect those to move into '14, probably in the first half. As far as the number of hotels that have left the system, that's not unusual. Most of those were contracts expiring or in some cases, there were some foreclosures. And most of them were select-service hotels.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then for my follow-up question, just your comment about group business. You mentioned one of the factors was that some nights booked were booked back in 2009 and 2010, at kind of less-robust rates. Is there a rough percentage of your 2013 group room nights that were booked in 2009 and 2010 that you have? And then I'm wondering what that dropped to in 2014.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, it's a good question, Robin. I think roughly 1\/3 -- and varies obviously dramatically by size of hotels. So the biggest shops where this trend would have been most significant are going to have the earliest bookings. That's where the 1,000-night-plus association and other massive groups might be booking. And they could easily be booking 3, 4, 5 years out. When you look at the brand as a whole, you get about 30%, which is in the year, for the year. So '13 group business booked in '13. You get about 1\/3 of the business, which is done the year before. And then you get the balance, which would be 35% or so, 35% to 40%, which would have been booked in all prior years. So for '13, that would have included bookings in '11, '10, '09, '08, et cetera. Those numbers, and we, I don't think we have them in the room now this morning, but if you'd looked at those numbers for the hotels that are 1,200 rooms and bigger, the big group boxes, they would be even more skewed towards earlier bookings. And I think that's where we're seeing some of the hangover from the recession. But again, that's just one of the factors that we're calling out.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess then, how to think about your comments that -- and if I think, you gave a lot of different data points on group. But I think one of your comments was that group on the books for '14 versus the same time for '13 last year, revenues were up about 2%. And I would think just having the 2009 and 2010 bookings, to whatever degree they were, sort of fall off as you go into '14, that, that -- that there would be a bigger increase, all else being equal, with new bookings just having that sort of recession bookings drop off.","Arne M. Sorenson","I think that's a fair point. And I think what we're seeing, a quarter ago, we saw '13 bookings up 4% compared to '12 bookings at the end of the first quarter, if I remember the data right. And so what we've seen is, we've lost a couple of points in the last quarter, which is again, kind of a near-term impact. That's an impact probably in the first couple of quarters of '14 compared to what we saw on the books at the end of the first quarter of this year. But interestingly, that stat lives side by side with this really significant increase in group business put on the books in the second quarter for all future periods, up plus-18%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joshua Attie of Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The REVPAR guidance seems to imply some acceleration in the fourth quarter, particularly to hit the high end. And it sounds like you'll benefit from kind of a combination of the easier comparisons in the U.K. and China, and also better group bookings. So 2 questions. First, can you remind us what the net impact of Hurricane Sandy was on the portfolio last year? And second, how much visibility do you have on the fourth quarter group bookings, and sort of how much stock should we put into that better bookings number? And I don't mean that as a knock on your guidance, and I know there are no guarantees. It's more just, you mentioned that June group bookings were down 5%. And that sounds like it was a lot worse than what you thought it would be when you guided in early May. And so it would just be helpful, I think, to understand how much business is really locked in at this point, and what the sources of volatility could be.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, all fair questions. June, by the way, the June stayed and paid was down 5% group business, not the bookings down 5%. And again, the stayed and paid in June would be the cumulative impact of all prior group booking activity, including very current and stuff that was booked a long time ago. When you look at our REVPAR guidance for the year, and you can look either at the global number or the domestic number, we have obviously brought down the top end. As we did the math, we thought having put 2 quarters in the books now at a little over 5% in the United States, to get to 7% would have required a pretty spectacular fourth quarter, particularly given the guidance that we've now offered for the third quarter. So what we see is a sort of expectation of REVPAR growth in the plus 5-ish.","Carl T. Berquist","Steady as she goes.","Arne M. Sorenson","A little over 5%, hopefully, like we've done the last couple of quarters, for the next couple of quarters. We know that we've got better group bookings on the books for the fourth quarter than the third. So there's maybe a little bit more upside in the fourth quarter. But again, it's all relative. So to drive the full year numbers to something in the 6% to 7% range to us seemed very difficult. Group business, I think, on the books now for fourth quarter is plus-6%.","Carl T. Berquist","Plus-6%.","Arne M. Sorenson","And that's got to be 80% to 90% of all group business for the fourth quarter for the typical Marriott Hotel, is already on the books. So we have...","Carl T. Berquist","95% is on the books.","Arne M. Sorenson","95%, as Carl says.","Carl T. Berquist","95% of our group is on the books.","Arne M. Sorenson","So we have reasonably good insight into that. Obviously, a lot will depend on whether transient continues to poke along well. And I think to be fair, second quarter group came in a little bit weaker than we anticipated when we guided for the quarter, or certainly weaker than we hoped. And that makes us a little bit cautious about being certain that we know that group stayed and paid at the end of the fourth quarter will be up to 6% that it is showing right now. I think when you look globally at some trends, you've got some things which are positive and some which are negative. Europe, the U.K. particularly, where we are -- we have substantial distribution, we've got 20, 20-ish hotels in the city of London alone. The third quarter will be tough because of the Olympics. The fourth quarter comparisons will be much easier. And we would expect, as a consequence, Europe hopefully will strengthen as we go through the balance of the year. On the negative side, we've got Egypt, which is falling apart. And I probably shouldn't say it that way, but from a hotel perspective, it's not looking very good, why don't I say that. And our hotels are running at much lower occupancies today than they were even in the second quarter. And I think those comparisons will be tough because of that market -- and then of course, we've talked about the easing in comparisons in China as we go along. Net-net, we would say that obviously, the guidance we're providing today is the best indication of where we think we'll end up when the dust settles at the end of the year.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And can you remind us, was Hurricane Sandy a net positive or negative impact? I know there were probably some markets where you were up and some markets where you were down.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I think on balance, it was about even. It was positive in New York and New Jersey and negative in Washington. I think we had some...","Carl T. Berquist","Philadelphia.","Arne M. Sorenson","We had some -- and in Philadelphia, we had some group cancellations. But I think when you look at the numbers for the country as a whole, I don't think it's going to be a terribly big factor. We'll double check with our data, and we can confirm that for you later.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Greff of JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Arne, you mentioned that the London EDITION is going to open up later this year. And this asset and some of the others that are planning to open over the next couple of years, you'll sell it [ph] for management contracts when the timing is right. For the London asset specifically, when do you start to market that asset for sale?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, we're going to open in the first half of September. We're really excited about that opening. And we don't have anything to announce now, but I think we're getting to a -- let me just say a fair period of time to ask that question. So we always model that we won't sell it until the hotel is up and stabilized. I think our track record is that, we are often able to sell it within the year after it opens.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And you may have said this, and I may have missed this. When you look at the second half fee guidance, Carl, was there any impact from adverse currency in there?","Carl T. Berquist","No, I think in the quarter, we had about $1 million, $1.5 million negative currency. I think as the year goes along, we're expecting it to be a little more onerous in the fourth quarter, several million dollars. I don't have that number exact, Joe. But if I remember, it was about $4 million or $5 million of negative currency in the fourth quarter. Yes, about $4.5 million in the fourth quarter. So for the full year, currency is going to be a headwind of about $6 million in our forecast.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smedes Rose of Evercore.","Smedes Rose - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I can attest to the corporate caution out there. It's a cold world, but I'm glad to be back. I wanted to just -- maybe ask for a reminder on the breakdown on your fees between what's international and what's domestically generated? And then within the international, kind of what -- how much is the Middle East and then how much is Egypt of the Middle East, just to kind of get a sense of that?","Arne M. Sorenson","We're about 75-25 right now. The -- you guys will pull the precise numbers out. I think the Middle East and Africa in aggregate was about 3%.","Carl T. Berquist","2% to 3%.","Arne M. Sorenson","And obviously, that includes unique [ph] markets like Egypt, but markets like Dubai is a -- I think our biggest market now in the Middle East and is a very robust and strong market today. So well, I think there's some risk in the Middle East and Africa numbers, I don't think it is anything like a risk of the full 3% to 4%.","Laura E. Paugh","For total fees, we were 79% domestic, 21% international. For incentive fees, we were 48% domestic, 52% international.","Arne M. Sorenson","Is that a '12 number or is that a quarter number?","Laura E. Paugh","That's a quarter number.","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, sounds right to me.","Laura E. Paugh","For 2012, domestic is -- in total fees, domestic is 76%, international 24%. Incentive fees in total for 2012, domestic is 35%, international 65%.","Carl T. Berquist","And owned leased -- and owned leased weights it towards Europe.","Laura E. Paugh","We had a lot of strength in incentive fees domestically in the quarter. And then for fees in the Middle East for the quarter, we're about $10 million. And Asia Pacific was in the $30 million to $35 million range.","Smedes Rose - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, what was the share count at the end of the quarter?","Carl T. Berquist","It was 302 million. I think we got that exact number.","Laura E. Paugh","Betsy's got it.","Arne M. Sorenson","And none of you has asked yet, but I'll go ahead and answer it in the hopes that maybe I'll take care of one in the questions in the queue, but we mentioned the 35% incentive management fee growth in Q2 for domestic incentive fees, which is a really, I think, positive sign. When you look at international incentive fee performance in Q2, it was actually flat to last year. And that's really purely a function of the dramatically lower REVPAR at plus 2.8%. And to some extent, the mix of hotels that are producing incentive fees.","Laura E. Paugh","So for the share count, the common shares outstanding at quarter end were 303 million, and the dilution was about 7 million shares, 7 million shares. So add in the dilution would take you up to around 310 million.","Carl T. Berquist","In a weighted average.","Laura E. Paugh","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harry Curtis of Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on one of the charges in the quarter, the cures. You've got 3 -- close to 300 -- 300,000 managed hotels. And it's not often that we see these cures pop up. I've seen them pop up a couple of times. But can you talk about your sense of how many realistically are at risk?","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. Well, I think we got about 3,800 hotels in the system. And so with that many properties around the world, you'll always have a half dozen or so that are in various stages of, I'd call it, negotiations with the owner, either because of financial pressures the owner's under or the franchisee's under or a contract is not performing the way they want. So it's always going on. I think when they get to be a material number, when we resolve those, and they end up with a charge to the P&L, we call them out, such as we did in this particular case. A lot of these get resolved and the amounts involved are insignificant, and we don't talk about it. So we typically don't talk about it, but you're always going to have a half dozen or so that we're working with.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Yes. I'm sorry, I meant to say hotels rather than -- I should have said hotel rooms.","Carl T. Berquist","Sure, sure.","Arne M. Sorenson","We hope to have 300,000 managed hotels one day, Harry.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Well, that was my next question. How long is it going to take to get you up there?","Carl T. Berquist","I guess the other thing I'd point out, Harry, is that some of these were hangovers from the weak economy that had just taken a couple of years to work through.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, we can be a little bit more specific on a couple of these. We did -- one of the charges in the quarter was a joint venture, a technology joint venture. It's really the only one I know of that we have. So it's a -- it's one of a kind. Or maybe there's one other?","Carl T. Berquist","No, that was it.","Arne M. Sorenson","That's a investment that we've had for a decade or so, and the company basically is -- does not look like it's going to survive. And that was a $4 million-ish charge, if I remember, right?","Carl T. Berquist","Right.","Arne M. Sorenson","And then we had a $5 million charge on a hotel which is in litigation. The owner kicked us out of the hotel. We had an investment and management contract, and we wrote it off in the quarter. The litigation is continuing. We are absolutely convinced that they did not have a right under the management contract to kick us out. In fact, the hotel was performing very well, and there was no termination clause in the contract. And we hope one day we'll be able to report about a substantially higher recovery for the value of the management contract that has been lost in connection with that. That is not, we think, a common occurrence and something that you need to worry about popping up every quarter.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Excellent. And then my next question goes back to your comments about adding salespeople to your larger hotels. You did this -- you began -- or you had to go back and do this as a function of Sales Force One. And that's been in place for a little while. So can you give us some sense of what impact adding salespeople back to some of your hotels has had on your bookings and cash flow? And what you're trying to accomplish with this next round?","Arne M. Sorenson","The -- so sales transformation or previously called Sales Force One, has been something we started rolling out maybe 3 or 4 years ago and was probably completed about 2 years ago. And it continues to be something we talk with our new owners about, to make sure that they understand how it's working. And obviously, we're all keenly interested in its performance. We talked about our group index in the prepared remarks. And our group index has been fabulously strong, with an increase of about 5 points, which is massive in the last couple of years. And all that is, is a measurement of our group revenue compared to the group revenue performance of each of the competing hotels in every one of our Marriott Hotel market. So it's real granular data, and we think highly reliable. And that's a sign that, at least for the core Marriott Hotels, which are most dependent on the sales offices that were set up with sales transformation, it's working well. Interestingly, when we talk about adding a couple of salespeople to these big group hotels, those hotels were less impacted by the sales transformation than the core hotels, because the sales offices have really dealt with group business, which is 300 nights peak or lower. Anything that's been above 300 nights peak or higher has been -- has stayed on the big hotel team all the time. And so there, the World Centers of the world and the Marquis of the world, they have retained their own sales force on property. Albeit, they've also gotten support from the sales office with the smaller meetings throughout this whole process. And when we talk about adding a few folks in these big hotels, that's just a way of saying we got to make sure we've got sufficient resources on the hotel where they have always been located, to go after the biggest groups that are out there, the 1,000-rooms-plus peak night.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Arne, can we just talk about -- you've introduced some -- you have several new brands over the recent past. And I was just wondering if you see that continuing? Or are you at the point where you want to concentrate on building critical mass for these new brands? In other words, is there a white space that you currently don't operate in that's attractive to you? And I'm also curious for the AC expansion in the U.S., will you be putting any sliver equity into that?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, good question. The -- I think this question, 5 years ago, we answered by saying, we think our brand lineup is pretty complete and wouldn't forecast that we add any brands. And notwithstanding that, we've added 5-or-so brands since that period time. Each one has got its own story. Obviously, Gaylord is one of those. That was an acquisition. And we are still very, very pleased with that acquisition, and very optimistic about how it will perform and how those hotels will perform. MOXY is a space we hadn't been in before. And that's an economy segment, we're really not in the economy segment anyplace in the world until we launched MOXY. And I think we got into MOXY, in some respects like the AC Hotels U.S. story that I told before, by having our good partners in Europe approach us repeatedly over the course of an 18- to 24-month period and say, \"Marriott, we'd really like you to be in this space.\" And when they brought to us -- the IKEA folks who were looking at doing 50 to 150 MOXYs all by themselves. We thought, \"Okay, this is a good launch.\" And we saw a segment in Europe that had 2 million existing rooms it, and we didn't have a single entry in it, and it seemed like a good place for us to go. I think when you look at the years ahead, we would still say, as we said 5 years ago, that our brand lineup is quite complete. In fact, we think it is the completest brand lineup in the industry, with powerful performers the top end, like Ritz-Carlton just won the J.D. Power customer survey award again in the luxury space. But of course, with Marriott and Renaissance and Courtyard and the other brands that we have. But I'd still predict that as the next years come by, we'll see that there are opportunities to add some brands in markets outside the United States. And particularly, when you're in the upscale or mid-scale space, that those brands heavily serve domestic travelers wherever in the world they're open. And we may find through the acquisition pipeline or through startup brand strategy that it makes sense to have some brands that are unique to some parts of the world. And so as a consequence, I suspect we'll never be totally complete. But we are still -- we still feel like we've got a very complete brand lineup today.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And for the AC expansion in the U.S., are you going to be putting any sliver equity into that?","Arne M. Sorenson","Not material, I wouldn't think. It will be like our other see-first brands, mostly a franchise operation. And our investments in franchise contracts in the U.S. are extremely small.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then can you say something about the context? You said the bookings made in the second quarter for 2014 and beyond were up 18%. That's a nice number. If you can just put into context maybe how booked you are now for '14? And I know '15 is early, but maybe you could give us that number, too.","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, again, it's going to vary a lot by hotel. But I would think for the Marriott Hotels & Resort brand in the United States, we're in the 50% to 60% range.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, 50%.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","For '14?","Arne M. Sorenson","For '14, yes.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So that's an improvement since last quarter?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, and we should be something like 65% to 70% by year end.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Hightower of ISI Group.","Richard A. Hightower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","To shift gears to your resort properties. I think you said on the last conference call that your brands in Florida and the Caribbean are seeing prior peak occupancies. Just wondering, a, is that still consistent? And then b, what are you seeing on the rate side of that equation? And then any commentary on next year's booking activity at this point?","Arne M. Sorenson","No commentary on next year's booking activity other than the group statistics we've already hung out there. I think if you look at Ritz-Carlton and its performance for the quarter, domestic Ritz-Carlton up about 7%.","Carl T. Berquist","7.4%.","Arne M. Sorenson","7.4%. And know that Ritz-Carlton has got a dozen resort assets within that portfolio, Florida and Caribbean, but I think there are 8 or 9 in Florida alone. The numbers for the quarter were great. I mean, you've got to factor in the Easter dynamics. So in 2012, Easter was in April, which is -- Easter is a very strong time for Ritz-Carlton resorts, not surprisingly because of high-end leisure travel. But for them to post those sorts of national numbers, 7.4% in the quarter, heavily driven by the resorts, and the resorts have been very strong performers throughout that period of time. A little harder to segregate the Marriott data. But when you look at our flash numbers, I don't know if you've got Florida segregated, I don't think we have it sitting here. But the resorts have been strong performers, and that's driven by leisure and transient business. So I think generally we see greater strength in leisure and in transient in the higher end, than we do in group and in suburban and in the middle market.","Carl T. Berquist","So with California...","Richard A. Hightower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Any specifics on the occupancy and rate side there? The [indiscernible] improvement?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think I can't tell you for certain. I suspect that occupancies are back at peak levels and REVPAR is probably about at peak levels as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Crow of Raymond James & Associates.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Arne, as a follow-up to a prior question. The increased staffing of sales at the hotel level, is that really focused on Gaylord-branded properties? And maybe what percentage of new hires or sales addition went to that brand?","Arne M. Sorenson","No, I think this is a focus on all big hotels. Gaylord, obviously, has 4 of them and -- but we've got a couple of dozen that we describe internally as our...","Carl T. Berquist","Big box.","Arne M. Sorenson","Invention network and I think all of them are focused on it. But we're probably -- by having 2 or 3 questions on this, we're probably making a bigger point than it is. And I think we're talking about a person or maybe 2 person at these hotels. It's not a significant shift in the approach.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. As you look to '14 and you look at D.C., which is an important market for you and a lot of others, and you've got the new supply coming online. We've got the government continues to be weak. And as you look at the conference and meetings scheduled for next year, is that a market that you anticipate will underperform again next year?","Arne M. Sorenson","I can't answer that yet, Bill. I apologize for that. Obviously, the government demand trends we've talked about generically, and I wouldn't expect an overnight change in dynamic of government demand broadly. And I don't have, top of mind, the citywide schedule for D.C. So we'll have to look at that as we get into the budget process at the end of the year.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then if I could ask one quick follow-up. You said you gained 6 points of market share in China, which is terrific. Any sense for where that's coming from? Is that a local brand losing share to the Marriott? Is that Marriott taking brand from other global brands?","Arne M. Sorenson","I don't know that I have a -- it's harder for us to know exactly where it's coming from. And remember how these REVPAR index numbers come together. So for each hotel globally, we will have a competitive set, which typically would be 4 or 5 other hotels. And that hotel would then ask, usually it's Smith Travel, but there are sometimes other agencies that are reporting on this stuff. \"How did my hotel perform compared to the average of that competitive set, both in rate and in occupancy? And what's my rank in that competitive set?\" Smith Travel does not come back and tell us how each one of the other 4 or 5 hotels performed, or isolate it so that we can look necessarily through to see how every hotel is pricing or doing anything else with occupancy. So it's a comparison to an average. We know that we have -- and many of you have seen this, I know you have Bill. We have really great locations and great product in most of these markets in China. And I think location and product quality, when you add good service to it, is a very strong reason to drive market share. And so whether that 6-point index growth in the second quarter was that quarter alone, but when you look at the last year or 2 or 3, we see similar powerful moves in our REVPAR index across China.","Operator","Our next question comes from Whitney Stevenson of JMP Securities.","Whitney Stevenson - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little more about some of the group dynamics you're seeing, specifically with respect to the size of groups that are reserving? And maybe a little color on outside the room spend?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, the -- I mean, I think the group caution is still a bit more about the bigger groups than it is the smaller groups. But the short-term dynamic is probably the single best way to describe where we see the relative weakness. So we have talked about lots of factors in this. And I hesitate to go through it all again, simply because I'll bore you all to tears. But I think we see that short term is the weakest because group is relatively softer than transient. We are seeing that flow through on F&B, food and beverage revenue growth for the hotels as a whole at lower rate than average REVPAR.","Operator","Our final question comes from Chris Jones of Telsey.","Christopher E. Jones - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Just a quick follow-up on the brand question. Can you talk a little bit about what you think the opportunity is for the AC brand in North America? And if you think there is a potential that you'll see some conversion, whether it be from other brands or even within your own house brands? And then also as you are getting ready to open up the EDITION in London, maybe some longer-term views on where you think that's going to go as well?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, you bet. I think the opportunity for AC Hotels in the U.S. is substantial. Certainly, some number of hundreds of hotels over the course of the next decade or so. And I think it will play in, from a pricing perspective, in firmly in upscale in all likelihood. I think it will skew more urban than, for example, our Courtyard brand is, which is urban and suburban. I think AC Hotels is likely to have more product convert from other brands or other real estate uses than Courtyard would be. Because I think, again, it's probably that urban feel. I think of the first 20 or so that are under negotiation now, 1\/3 to 1\/2 are conversions of existing hotels. Sometimes, that's more than simply a rooms redo, but a little bit more of a whole property reconstruction, I suppose. But clearly, renovations or conversions of existing real estate will be a part of that AC piece. When you go to EDITION, we are really excited to get London open this fall. We are hoping that we can get both Miami and New York open later in '14. It's possible New York will shift into early '15. We'll see how that construction process goes. And we think the 3 of them will represent the brand extremely well. We have another 4 or 5, or 6 or 7 maybe, that are under signed contract and under construction in various parts of the world. I don't think that any of those are slated to open in '14, but I think we'll start to see some of those open in '15. And we're really optimistic about the momentum that we think these openings will bring to the brand. And I think that we'll see signing pace increase now as we go forward over the course of the next 12 to 18 months.","Christopher E. Jones - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Just a follow-up on the EDITIONs, the new ones you're alluding to, are they management contracts, franchise?","Arne M. Sorenson","They're all management contracts. You bet. Okay. Any other questions in the queue?","Operator","And there are no further questions, sir.","Arne M. Sorenson","All right. We thank you all very much for your interest in Marriott, and I look forward to welcoming you in our hotels at the next possible opportunity. Bye.","Carl T. Berquist","Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"13931":["Marriott International, Inc.

At this time, all participants have been placed in the listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Arne Sorenson","Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","First let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued earlier today, along with our comments are effective only today May 10, 2019, and will not be updated as actual events unfold.","In our discussion today, we will talk about results excluding merger-related costs and reimbursement revenues and related expenses. GAAP results appear on Page A1 of the earnings release, but our remarks today will largely refer to the adjusted results that appear on the non-GAAP reconciliation pages. Of course, you can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks also on our Web site.","Before proceeding to talk about our results, let me take a minute to talk about the announcement we made last week about my cancer diagnosis. As we mentioned, I have Stage 2 pancreatic cancer. Thankfully, the medical team at Johns Hopkins has seen this many times before. They believe we have caught it early, that it is operable, and that the course of treatment is proven. I'm grateful for all the messages of support from the investment community as well as from Marriott's community of associates and business partners around the world. With the support of an extraordinary strong team of Marriott executives, we are going to soldier on.","Now, last month, we opened our 7000 property, the 27 storey St. Regis Hong Kong. After opening this landmark hotel, our development pipeline at quarter-end totaled roughly 475,000 rooms compared to 463,000 rooms at the end of the first quarter 2018. Gross room openings totaled nearly 19,000 rooms in the first quarter compared to 15,000 rooms in the year-ago quarter. Net room openings were almost double from the number from the prior year. Almost 216,000 rooms in our pipeline or 45% are already under construction, the largest number of under construction rooms in our industry.","At our current pace of openings, our under construction pipeline represents the equivalent of 2.5 years of embedded gross rooms growth. The remainder of our pipeline represents another 2.5 years of growth. Our legacy Starwood brands account for roughly 30% of our development pipeline. Among our 17 luxury and upper upscale brands, the rooms pipeline for the Sheraton brand is second only in size to the Marriott brand. In the first quarter of 2019, we opened four new Sheraton Hotels and signed three new Sheraton deals, including the new built 250-room Sheraton Hotel in Bradenton, Florida. More than a quarter of Sheraton's existing portfolio is under or has committed to renovation.","Our limited service brands are growing rapidly. Globally, our limited service pipeline, largely upscale brands, includes more than 285,000 rooms, nearly 2.5 times the number of pipeline rooms in those brands five years ago. Outside North America, our limited-service pipeline is now nearly 3.5 times its size in 2014. We are growing these brands in markets around the world with a variety of approaches from modular construction to urban high rises to multi-brand hotel complexes. We are developing new prototype designs for Fairfield Inn and TownePlace suites to better suit smaller markets, and we continue to add development talent to make these deals happen, because the growth opportunity is meaningful.","We see evidence that owners and franchisees prefer our brands. According to STR, more than one in three rooms that are under construction in the U.S. today will fly one of our flags. And while our existing distribution globally is more modest, still one in five hotels under construction globally will be flagged with the Marriott Brand. We continue to expect to see net rooms growth total approximately 5.5% in 2019 with rooms deletions of about 1% to 1.5%. We deleted 3000 rooms in the first quarter of 2019.","I visited several markets in China in late March. The big news there is Marriott Bonvoy and Alibaba. Less than two years ago, we formed a new joint venture with Alibaba to improve service and sales for Chinese guests. In the first quarter of 2019, property revenue from our newly designed Alibaba channel more than tripled year-over-year, while the level of new Marriott Bonvoy enrollments in China doubled over the prior year quarter. We are excited to welcome these new members to our hotels around the world. Marriott Bonvoy offers guests the largest and most compelling collection of hotels and experiences. At the end of the first quarter, membership in Marriott Bonvoy reached nearly 130 million worldwide, up roughly 5 million from year-end 2018. Approximately 40% of the new sign-ups came from China. Worldwide, loyalty redemption revenue at our hotels rose at a double-digit rate in the first quarter.","We recently announced our home rental initiative. In a survey we conducted in 2018, we found that over one quarter of our loyalty program members who responded had used home rentals in the prior 12 months. During our home rental pilot in 2018, which was available in a few European cities, nearly 90% of our guests were Marriott Bonvoy members, and over 80% were traveling for leisure. The average length of stay in our pilot was more than triple that for the typical hotel guest. With a successful European pilot, we decided to launch homes and villas by Marriott International, offering guests access to a growing number of premium and luxury homes and villas in over 100 destinations across the U.S., Europe, the Caribbean, and Latin America.","Our commitment to providing travelers with full residencies, including kitchens and other amenities guided our selection of homes. Our desire to complement our core hotel offerings similarly influenced our selection of markets. We will work with select property management companies who are already managing these homes, and estimate roughly 40% of these markets we are launching in are new to Marriott. We believe our highly curated home rental product fully integrated into our loyalty program for earning and redeeming points will enhance Marriott Bonvoy member travel experiences and increase the value of our loyalty program. Home rental should enable our loyalty members to stay with Marriott throughout any travel experience, allow us to leverage our strong brands and expertise in an evolving competitive landscape, and ultimately drive a greater share of wallet for our portfolio.","In April, we signed a new multi-year agreement with Expedia, which should enhance our leisure packaging platform Vacations by Marriott, and leverage Expedia's technology for a new business opportunity to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2019. With the changes in the agreement, we expect our owners and franchisees will see improved overall economics from the relationship. In the first quarter, worldwide house profit for comparable company-operated hotels increased an impressive 1.6%. While the integration is largely complete, our hotels continue to benefit from synergies associated with the Starwood merger.","On the revenue side, we reduced discounting at Legacy Starwood Hotels in the first quarter and across our system increased the proportion of bookings coming from our digital channels. Direct digital revenue bookings at our hotels globally increased over 20% in the quarter, and now represent over 30% of room nights. Revenues booked on our mobile app increased more than 70% year-over-year. While our revenues booked on OTS worldwide declined 4% yielding OTA business helped hotel profitability, even as it likely depressed our first quarter by RevPAR growth by a few tenths of a percentage points. Our global RevPAR index rose 100 basis points in the quarter.","Let's talk briefly about the region's, systemwide constant dollar RevPAR in our Asia Pacific region increased 3% in the quarter. RevPAR growth was strong in India, Japan, Indonesia, and in the major markets in Greater China, but was somewhat offset by weaker results in South Korea, Thailand, and the Hainan Island market in China.","In the second quarter, we expect mid-single digit RevPAR growth in the region with fewer headwinds from South Korea and Hainan Island. Future RevPAR performance will depend somewhat on the economic impact of ongoing U.S., China trade negotiations, particularly in markets that rely on manufacturing. While we await the outcome of those negotiations, our forecast assumes Asia Pacific RevPAR will increase at a mid-single digit rate for the full-year 2019.","In the Middle Eastern Africa, systemwide constant dollar RevPAR declined 4% year-over-year. RevPAR growth in the UAE declined 8% on flat demand and supply growth in Dubai increased by 11%. At the same time, RevPAR in Cairo and the Red Sea resorts rose sharply on strong Eastern European demand.","For the second quarter, we expect EMEA RevPAR will again decline albeit less significantly than in the first quarter. Significant supply growth in Dubai is likely to persist, but we should see stronger demand in the holy cities in Saudi Arabia. Ramadan started May 6th, 10 days earlier than last year, which should push some business travel in the region from second quarter to later in the year.","For the full-year, we expect RevPAR will decline at a low single digit rate in the EMEA region. In Europe systemwide constant dollar RevPAR rose 2% in the first quarter, U.S. traveled to many markets in Europe with strong with considerable numbers of loyalty redemptions, RevPAR in London increased by 4% year-over-year. At the same time, Brexit uncertainty kept many U.K. travelers at home constraining growth in many warm weather European destinations. Travelers avoided Central City Paris, due to the continued yellow vest demonstrations with a Ben Ali in Venice beginning this month and strong U.S. demand expected to continue in most markets. We believe RevPAR in Europe will increase at a mid-single digit rate in the second quarter, and for the full-year.","In the Caribbean and Latin America region, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR increased nearly 4% in the quarter. In the Caribbean RevPAR rose 8% on strong demand, as several U.S. Airlines increased lift the islands. RevPAR growth in Brazil was very strong on record demand during Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. While continued travel warnings took RevPAR and Mexico down 3%.","Looking ahead, we expect RevPAR growth and Kayla will moderate a bit increasing at a low single digit rate in the second quarter and full-year as competitor hotels reopen in the Caribbean. System-wide RevPAR in North America rose nearly 1% in the first quarter. RevPAR was constrained by the partial federal government shutdown in January. Tough comparisons to hurricane recovery in Florida and Houston and the lingering impact from the fourth quarter labor strike NOI. Excluding these factors, we estimate our system-wide RevPAR growth would have been roughly 70 basis points better than the reported number, our RevPAR index in the U.S. increased nearly a 100 basis points in the first quarter.","Group RevPAR across North America increased 3% on strong city-wide demand in Atlanta and San Francisco and the favorable impact of the timing of Easter. While Easter timing will present a headwind for group business in the second quarter, the negative hurricane and government shutdown impact should be behind us. Our group revenue booking pays for the full-year 2019 is flat. New bookings for 2019 increased in the first quarter and surged in April. So we expect Group RevPAR will be higher for the year.","First Quarter Transient RevPAR from our largest 300 corporate accounts in North America, Rose 3% but overall transit RevPAR was flattish in the first quarter, largely due to weak demand in March. Given as we expect North American RevPAR will increase by 1% to 2% in the second quarter and 1% to 3% for the full-year.","Marriott is a dynamic company. We created a powerful lodging portfolio, managing and franchising across the highest value tiers. With the Starwood acquisition, we recognized that we are in a unique position truly sophisticated frequent travelers with an unparalleled loyalty program and a wide range of travel experiences. The more our guests are engaged in our loyalty program, the more profitable business opportunities we can pursue even outside the traditional lodging space such as credit card and residential branding. This year we expect to earn $440 million to $450 million in credit card and residential branding fees. Incidentally credit card sign ups rose 20% in the first quarter year-over-year. In addition, unit additions and RevPAR growth such opportunities should drive higher returns to our shareholders, even as we retain our asset light approach to business.","Before turning the call over to Leeny Oberg, let me take a moment to recognize our extraordinary Investor Relations leader, Laura Paugh. We announced this morning that Laura will retire from Marriott at year-end. Laura Paugh in nearly 40 years at Marriott have literally included our entire history of modern day Investor Relations. When she began Marriott like many other companies did not even do quarterly earnings calls, such as this one. She has not only built this discipline for us, she has been recognized by you as one of the best investor relations professionals in the entire public company universe. Not just the hospitality space. She has been a partner, a mentor, and a friend to me for over 20 years of involvement in Investor Relations. All of us are grateful for her service and expertise. Thank you, Laura.","Now, for some more thoughts about first quarter performance and our outlook, let me turn things over to Leeny.","Kathleen Oberg","Thank you, Arne. I too would like to express my deep appreciation for Laura's countless contributions and dedication to our Company. Her strategic insights and determination to get the right answers have no doubt contributed meaningfully to our shareholder value over the years. Well, I will personally miss her a great deal. I know you will all join me in wishing her very happy retirement and celebrating her accomplishments during the rest of this year.","Now, onto the results, for the first quarter of 2019, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled a $1.41 compared to $1.34 in the year ago quarter. This was $0.08 over the midpoint of our guidance of $1.30 to $1.35 largely due to better than expected windfall tax benefits and other favorable discrete items on the tax line. Recall that in the prior year quarter adjusted EPS included $0.11 from gains on hotel sales. Gross fee revenues totaled $895 million or 6% increase year-over-year, largely due to unit growth and higher incentive fees and credit card branding fees. Incentive fees increased 5% with good margin performance and strength at our Florida and California resorts during their strong season. Credit card fees alone totaled $93 million, up 8% while other non-property fees totaled $39 million.","With the stronger US dollar, first quarter fee revenue reflected nearly $7 million of year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange net of hedges. Owned leased and other revenue, net of expenses totaled $15 million in the first quarter, a $20 million decline from the prior year due to $21 million of lower termination fees.","General and administrative expenses totaled $222 million compared to $247 million in the prior year quarter. G&A in the first quarter of 2018 included a $35 million expense for supplementary retirement savings plan contribution. First quarter adjusted EBITDA rose 7% year-over-year to $821 million, consistent with our 6% to 10% growth guidance, while not included in adjusted EBITDA, expenses associated with last year's data security incident totaled $44 million in the first quarter netted against $46 million of insurance recoveries.","We expect gross fee revenue for the second quarter will total $990 million to $1.01 billion, a 4% to 6% increase over the prior year. Our second quarter fee revenue estimate assumes higher credit card branding fees but modestly lower incentive fees due to property renovations and unfavorable foreign exchange. We expect owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses will total roughly $80 million in the second quarter while G&A should be $225 million to $230 million. Our guidance assumes no further asset sales in 2019 beyond those that have already been completed. These assumptions yield a $1.50 to $1.58 diluted earnings per share for the second quarter. Recall that the second quarter last year included $0.26 in gains from the sale of hotels.","Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter should total $940 million to $965 million flat to up 3% over the prior year. For the full-year 2019, we believe gross fee revenue could increase 6% to 8% over the prior year with about $15 million over our last guidance due to stronger expected incentive fees. We believe incentive fees will increase at a mid-single digit rate for the year and continue to expect our credit card and residential branding fees will total $440 million to 450 million in 2019.","Last year our gross fees were constrained by strikes in several markets in the fourth quarter. Owned leased and other revenue, net of direct expense, should total roughly $285 million to $295 million for the year, roughly $40 million decline year-over-year. Termination fees totaled $69 million in 2018 and we expect such fees will $25 million to $30 million in 2019 a bit improved from our prior forecast for this year.","Results from our Marriott homes and villas business will be included in the owned leased and other line, and are expected to be immaterial. G&A should total $920 million to $930 million for 2019, about $10 million higher than our last estimate due to higher bad debt expense in admin spending. These assumptions yield $5.97 to $6.19 diluted earnings per share for 2019. Recall that the prior year included $0.65 in gains from the sale of owned and joint venture assets. Adjusted EBITDA should totaled $3.615 billion to $3.715 billion 47% over 2018, adjusted EBITDA and estimate that is unchanged from last quarter. As we discussed last quarter, our 2019 guidance does not include merger related costs and the timing impact of reimbursed revenues and expenses.","Investment spending for the year could total $600 million to $800 million including roughly $225 million of maintenance spending. The remainder includes capital expenditures, loan advances, equity investments and contract investments. Roughly a quarter of our total investment spending relates to systems initiatives that should be reimbursed over time. We repurchased nearly 8 million shares from January 1 through May 8 for nearly $1.2 billion and continue to expect to return at least $3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2019. This assumes no further asset sales during the year.","Our balance sheet remains in great shape. At March 31, our debt ratio was within our targeted credit standard of 3 to 3.5 times adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR. We have modeled our 2019 income statement and cash flow forecast at a 3.3 times target.","Now, Laura, would like to add a few remarks.","Laura Paugh","Thanks, Leeny, and thanks for all the kind things both you and Arne have said. I have to say that the best part of my job at Investor Relations at Marriott is working with some very talented colleagues. IR is a team effort not only including the gifted [indiscernible] but many, many people throughout the organization, including the broad senior management team. When we talk about the collaborative nature of Marriott culture it is not a story. We have a very good time in IR. As I think you can tell we laugh a lot. We love working with Arne and Leeny they are just the smart forthcoming and engaged as they seen.","The other best part of my job in IR is working with all of you. I'm always happiest when the phone rings and you want to talk about Marriott, our competitors the OTAs the economy or your summer vacations and many years I've done IR. I've seen the market move from unreasonable exuberance to irrational despair and back, I know you face meaningful pressure to deliver result, and I hope I have helped as you have evaluated the company. I will be here through the end of the year and look forward to seeing many of you in person at conferences and meetings in the next few months. So let's answer your questions. So we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one followup if that's possible. We will take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Katz of Jefferies.","David Katz","Hi, afternoon, everyone.","Arne Sorenson","Hey, David.","Kathleen Oberg","Good afternoon.","David Katz","I have to admit I had probably four or five questions in my head, and I am struggling to remember any of them. I just wanted to wish all of you the best, but what I did want to talk about is we have started get into a range where just industry wide some of the metrics have started to be a bit choppy. And yet, the cash generation remains powerfully strong. If we were to paint a scenario, and I don't think you got quite this draconian at your analyst meeting, but if we were just start to talk about RevPAR that was down, call it 2% to 5%, have you sort of penciled out what the cash would like, and how your decision process would be altered under those kinds of circumstances? And I am again not calling or wishing for it, just thinking out loud.","Arne Sorenson","Yes, I think \u2013 Lenny can jump in here. I think the best place for you to refer in terms of the financial model is to what we shared with you at the investor relations meeting, and you can do some of your own calibration of that and make some assumptions and probably be fairly close. We don't have a model other than that one that we shared with you then. And I guess I would just say thematically that while March was a disappointing month in many respects, it is to us not a harbinger of a predictably different environment than the one that we have been going through the last few quarters. So, thematically today, I think we would say it's steady as she goes for the next few quarters. We continue to see that when adjust for hurricanes and strikes and holidays and the like that we are poking along broadly between -- broadly around 1.5% sort of RevPAR growth. We might have been a tenth or two shy of that in first quarter 2019. But there is some good news too. We talked about good April bookings for example in group, a very strong performance for us for the month. And so, while you should do whatever modeling you think is appropriate and make whatever forecast you think is appropriate, I think our caution to all of us would be let's just expect for now that we are going to keep going at sort of the pace we have been going over the last few quarters.","Kathleen Oberg","The only thing I'll add David is -- and we did do a model that actually did assume a 5% decline in RevPAR as part of what we talked about at the security analyst meeting. And I'll point out a couple of things, one, we are obviously far less dependent on your classic North American incentive fees when you look at both our growth internationally as well as the credit card fees. And then second of all, I\u2019ll talk that even in the great recession, we ended up with the lowest year being 3% growth in net rooms. And so, when you continue to see that sturdy strong rooms growth and a clearly less volatile franchise and management fee stream, I think it bodes well for really strong cash generation if we were looking at a recession.","David Katz","Great. And my one follow-up literally is you made reference to bad debt expense, which I just looking back quickly I am not sure that we have seen that in some of the prior quarters. What's in there?","Kathleen Oberg","For sure. That's part of G&A, and that's obviously when you end up with let's say a terminated hotel that is part of what happens. You end up not getting all of your reimbursed costs back. It is in the G&A line. It can be a little bit lumpy. It's a really small number. But then obviously as we have said this year for our G&A as part of the increase in the overall G&A that we forecast for the company, about $5 million of that is from bad debt. That's related to a few international hotel situations in Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. That's I think is the easiest way to describe is one-off situations. But as you might imagine, the bad debt number for the company overall is way immaterial.","David Katz","Understood. Thank you, and again, all the best.","Arne Sorenson","Thank you.","Kathleen Oberg","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun Kelley","Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I would like to yes, say my best wishes to you Arne on a speedy recovery, and congratulations to Laura on what's been an incredible career. So my question will be just going over to the RevPAR performance that you saw on the quarter, I think as we look through the metrics that you provide, the numbers that standout to us were -- we look through the legacy Starwood brands. I think most of those at least on the full-service side seem to under-perform some of the chain scale averages and some of the performances that we saw in the Marriott legacy brands. I know these numbers bounce around, and we always want to pick at little patterns. But, could you just elaborate a little bit on that? And I think, Arne, in your prepared remarks you may have mentioned something about a reduction of discounting, so did that drive some of that RevPAR performance, or what should we expect going forward as you continue your integration path?","Arne Sorenson","Yes. I think there are a few different factors that are going into this. But it\u2019s a perfectly fair question. And one of the things, I think, we start with here is geographic distribution. So if you look at Smith Travel industry wide numbers for Q1, you see a 4 point difference in RevPAR performance between the top 25 markets and all others. Top 25 markets in the U.S. according to Smith Travel were down roughly 1% -- one full percent in RevPAR. The other markets were up 3%. So you've got a 4 point difference in RevPAR performance between those markets. Obviously, that's industry as a whole. That's not Marriott's portfolio uniquely. And I think when you look at Marriott in its entirety compared to some others in the industry or when you look at some of the Starwood brands compared to some of the Marriott brands, I think you will find that we are much more concentrated in the top 25 markets, and that is inevitably part of this. When we look at Marriott brand's legacy versus Starwood brand's legacy, we can see a couple of other things that are happening. One is the strike carryover in Hawaii, particularly where our bookings are a little bit longer window. First quarter was continued -- they had some strike impact even though strikes were done that is disproportionately impacting the Starwood Hotels. I think the second would be around OTAs, and we called out in the prepared remarks that OTA business is down 4% for the combined portfolio in Q1.","Interestingly, the Starwood Hotels were about 10 points more reliant on OTA's list than the Marriott Hotels were. And as we have gone to one reservation system and once our unified revenue management strategy, the shift if you will from reliance on those third party OTA is to international digital channels probably cost a little bit. We thought it's maybe few tens of a point for the portfolio as a whole. The impacts are is probably a bit more disproportionate on the Starwood Hotels. And there are some changes on other discounting. Starwood had some deeper discount packaging that Marriott did not have. That's probably had an impact in it. But you roll all those things together, those are probably the principle drivers of the difference in the averages beneath of course the portfolio as a whole you will individual stories with individual assets.","Shaun Kelley","And I guess my quick follow-up would then be just any changes you guys think about the broader integration process? And I know when the deal was originally contemplated I think there was some down the road revenue synergy opportunities that you were probably envisioning just to kind of how you think about those in the context of what you are actually able to deliver right now?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, I think the time is ripe for that. I mean we have got the combined loyalty program launched. It is in market and being marketed. We have got strong credit card sign ups. We have got strong share wallet growth. I think there is a lot we can look at now to be optimistic about the future. And I think it's time to deliver the revenue upside.","Shaun Kelley","Thank you very much.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my question.","Arne Sorenson","Hey, Jared.","Jared Shojaian","Just to stick with the same line questioning here. I mean called out RevPAR index being up a 100 basis points. And, we saw pretty sizeable increases from your peers as well. So I guess it's the conclusion that the independence are just meaningfully losing RevPAR share right now. And then on that idea, how do you think about the value proposition of branding today versus in the past? Because presumably, there's more value for owners today than there's really ever been? And does that give you the ability to push royalty rates a little bit harder?","Arne Sorenson","Wouldn't that be nice? You obviously won't hear us be unbiased about the value of branding, we think we deliver extraordinary value to our owner and franchisee partners by plugging them into a system with a loyalty program and a very efficient reservation system that delivers substantial business to them at meaningfully, less cost, then would be the case otherwise, but I don't think you need to take our word for it, if you look at what's happening with the development pipeline. And we've talked about some of those statistics, but we're about 7% of the global industry today with, something like 20% of the hotels under construction heading towards our brand. So you can see investors, owners of real-estate, moving with their feet, because I think they see the strength of them. I think the other thing to remind everybody, and we don't want to get defensive sounding and we don't want to get too technical on RevPAR index. Our RevPAR index is a really important tool, particularly when you're looking at an individual hotel and how it's performing in its competitive set, but it is not the only measure that is out there to assess how portfolios are performing.","In the wake of acquiring Starwood, we have found that many of our competitive sets include many of our own hotels, because there will be concentration, particularly in some of these urban markets, where we've got a significant number of full-service hotels. And so, we're measuring our performance against our own hotels, not exclusively, because we've got to have some others that are in there. And similarly, we are seeing to some extent, others who are competing in markets that we don't exist in. And so, if you think about the secondary, or some of the tertiary markets, our brands are not broadly distributed in those markets. And as a consequence, we don't have the impact maybe of newly ramping hotels in those markets, or of competition, maybe against some of the relatively weaker brands. All things put together, we are actually gratified in the midst of a massive integration, that in the midst of all of that, we still managed to take about 100 basis points index growth, both in the United States and globally in the first quarter of '19.","Jared Shojaian","Great, thank you. And just on the pipeline, it was down quarter-over-quarter for the first time in several years. I know we shouldn't read too much into one quarter it's worth the pipeline data but I think the pipeline last year, and so far, this year is growing quite a slower than your 7% gross unit growth. So can you talk about that? And maybe what you're hearing from developers right now?","Arne Sorenson","I don't think the very modest. I think we calculated 0.8% decline in the pipeline from quarter and Q4 is a trend. We opened well in the first quarter. Always at the end of the year, we probably have a little bit more coming on the pipeline than we do it other times and typically Q1 will be the slowest signings quarter part of that is because you've got to go through a reauthorization of the franchise circulars in most states, all those things combined, led to that modest negative in Q1. And we don't think we're necessarily see that in the quarters ahead, but having said that, we've said now for least a couple of years that sort of steady state or organic growth, particularly in the United States, United States is flattish. We are I think continuing to take share, maybe even building a little bit momentum of momentum, but in the 9th or 10th year of recovery with cost increases in construction and labor and length of the construction cycle. Even though financing is high and the absolute returns are quite good. I don't expect we'll see a meaningful ramp up for example, in development in the U.S., I think instead will be sort of poking along at flat levels, substantial bit flat levels, and growth quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year is going to depend a lot more on what happens in the rest of the world.","Jared Shojaian","All right, thank you, and Laura, congratulations to you, well deserved, and Arne, my best wishes to you for a quick recovery.","Arne Sorenson","Thank you.","Laura Paugh","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Greff of JP Morgan.","Joe Greff","I was going to say good morning, but those are old conference calls. Good afternoon.","Kathleen Oberg","Thank you\u2026","Joe Greff","I guess 1 PM is better than 4.30 PM on a Friday. More seriously, Arne we wish you the best heartfelt, and Laura congratulations, we will definitely miss you.","Laura Paugh","Thank you.","Joe Greff","My question, most of my questions have been answered, but one question I have is regarding the development pipeline, what percentage of the pipeline is North America or U.S. top 25 markets, full service? And what percentage of that would be financed or under construction?","Arne Sorenson","We will have to go back to you on this. I think about 40% of the global pipeline is luxury enough [technical difficulty] so it's a pretty healthy mix, which is in the higher segment. I am certain that the percentage in the U.S. only, which is luxury and upper upscale is meaningfully lower than that, and that U.S. lean towards for us upscale principally not upper mid scale, we don't really have upper mid scale space. Am I close?","Laura Paugh","In the pipeline when we're looking [technical difficulty] it's about 10% of overall 475,000 - global pipeline of the North America pipeline, it's about 20%.","Joe Greff","Thank you so much.","Arne Sorenson","And I don't think we can give you the top 25 versus other markets, but with the information we've got here.","Laura Paugh","Obviously, full service\u2026","Joe Greff","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Beckel of Bernstein.","David Beckel","Thanks a lot for the question. I'd also like to echo the sentiments or well-wishes Arne and congrats Laura on a tremendous career. My question, my first question has to do with RevPAR cadence given Q1 results Q2 guidance. Of course there's some timing issues, but back half implies, sort of a pretty healthy acceleration, particularly in the U.S., you talked a little bit about group strength giving you some confidence that will materialize, but there -- are there any other one-time items to be aware of there with respect to the calendar. And more generally, what gives you the confidence that demand and RevPAR will sort of seemingly reaccelerate through the back half of the year?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, there is, I mean I think is one thing we can be probably annually blamed for, I suppose. And that is we often keep our range of full two points. And so obviously we started the year one to three. We're still at one to 3 after the first quarter. And if we were actually comparably precise in each quarter as the year went along, we would narrow that range more and more, because the more quarters put in the book, the less likely, it is that you're either going to hit the bottom or the top end of that. And I think that could be said here too, but maybe they get to the opposite fundamental point, our internal, I guess, if you were to take it sort of single point RevPAR forecast is essentially right in the middle of that range. ","And so, that tells you that basically when we're looking at trends in bookings and group bookings and year-over-year comparability issues. The most obvious in the fourth quarter, of course being the strikes, which we've had to struggle through in the fourth quarter 2018, but hopefully will not be in the fourth quarter of 2019. All of those things get us to a place where we think it is sort of the midpoint of that one to three years about the best prediction that we can make. It does suggest that in part, because of comparability issues and because of bookings maybe were a bit better in the second, in last two quarters than in the first two quarters, but not a dramatically different scenario. And it's not are sitting here saying we're going to have a different kind of economic environment and we have to today.","David Beckel","Great. Thanks for the color there. And just a quick follow-up, I know it's a CapEx increased by about $100 million. Can you give a little color as to why the increase?","Kathleen Oberg","Sure. Basically, we're up in the midpoint, about $100 million and it is a combination of little bit higher systems initiatives tool, which will actually be reimbursed over time from our owners, as well as, a loan for a particularly valuable management agreement. That's going to result in a meaningful property improvement program that will bring a hotel up to really fantastic brand standard for that brand.","David Beckel","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi.","Smedes Rose","Thanks. Arne, Glad to hear that here in good hands and Laura is not going to be the same without - we look forward to catching up offline with you. I wanted to ask -- just you mentioned your opening remarks and new design for TownePlace and Fairfield ends. I think targeted at smaller markets. I'm just wondering is that answering some sort of unfilled demand that your developers are asking you to do. Are you trying to be more competitive with products that are already targeting the smaller markets or kind of maybe what's what does it mean for those that I guess for the pipeline for those two products.","Arne Sorenson","I think it's actually both. But there, and I sense there the same issue, we have heard from a number of our franchisees that they want to expand in secondary into some even tertiary markets where a Fairfield or a place at either 90 rooms instead of at 125, 130 rooms is the better positioning for those markets and while we've had, we've had the ability of course to shrink the number of rooms in the hotel. If you're not shrinking the public space in a way that's commensurate with that you're probably putting a product that's a little bit over built in that market. And so we want to do something with those partners who want to grow in those markets to make sure that we've got something, which is true to the brand, but cost effective for them and competitive with competing product that might be there, and obviously you can see we've got a lot of different companies that participate in the select service space, particularly. And if you look at the tertiary markets, you'll see that we are probably less distributed there than many other companies in the United States.","Smedes Rose","Okay, thanks. And then just listening to all the hotels -- Expedia the new Expedia contractors come up some. It sounds like more than just, it's a little more nuance than just sort of lowering the commissions and it's more about more control over, maybe the way the rooms are put into the OTA systems, can you just provide maybe some just broad strokes that maybe just kind of the changes in the contract. How is\u2026","Arne Sorenson","I mean that's, that obviously we are now, I don't even know what round of new contract is with Expedia, but we've been renegotiated contracts for nearly 20 years I suppose I that and there is a similarity to some extent with each of them, but I think on some level we continue to look for cost effectiveness. We look for data transfer ability, the ability to understand who the customer is and have the systems understand the customer is. We look at inventory control, which is can we yield our inventory, can we make sure we're pricing our inventory on our own platform in a way that doesn't necessarily have to be offered up in every other platform. And those things were on the table here too and of course you would expect Expedia or another OTA to one-off in the opposite of what we want certainly, as it relates to the level of the commission. That's probably the clearest to see, but I think we are grateful for where we got with Expedia, we do think it will deliver economic benefits to our owners.","We also think we are we don't have much to say about this today. You'll have to stay tuned, but we do have an idea with them with Expedia, that we think is attractive to both of us maybe a incremental place for them to make some economics in our space, but also space in which they can actually deliver more cost effective solution to us than some of the solutions that are available to us today. And so we're pleased with the outcome that we've got and look forward to seeing what we can accomplish with it.","Smedes Rose","Okay, thank you.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell of Barclays.","Anthony Powell","Hi happy Friday, everyone and Anthony well-wishes, well-wishes to you Laura thanks for your help and openness over the years. So that the house profit margin increase in North America on pretty modest RevPAR was positive in the quarter. I think you've targeted 50 basis points of hotel level margin growth from the merger are you believe that currently do you think that could lead to upside to your incentive fee growth projection of 6% to 10% over the next few years.","Kathleen Oberg","So, couple of things, we basically have achieved in every year since we've acquired Starwood, 50 basis points of at least 50 basis points of margin improvement of apart from RevPAR and '17, '18. And it's our goal to do that again in '19 and quite frankly, Anthony, if our goal to do it again in '20. So I think whether it is from purchasing or from what we've seen in the loyalty program to productivity synergies to above property synergies through the PSF we've been thrilled with what we've been able to do and quite frankly with the hard work that the properties have put in to making that a reality. So we do continue to see the benefit. And I think you're seeing that come forth the incentive fees and in the process of the hotel.","Anthony Powell","Got it. So I think in your, in the Investor Day, you said 6% to 10% of growth over the next few years. Is that still the target or there may be upside to that.","Kathleen Oberg","Yeah, I think for now using what you've got in the Security Analyst Meeting is just right.","Anthony Powell","Got it. Okay, just one more.","Kathleen Oberg","We, one more certainly hope to beat it.","Anthony Powell","Got it. And just on the home rental business, this is more of an offering or amenity for core customer or do you think, this really scale to something that's meaningful in terms for over the next few years.","Arne Sorenson","Well times going to tell. I mean I, we're taking a different strategy obviously then number have , we are not, we want to, we know that what we offer in this space. Our brand must stand behind that nobody is going to excuse us from a bad experience a home and villa rental kind of experience. You're not going to blame the host, they're going to say Marriott you put me in a product that was not cleaner or something else, happened in that space. And so that's one thing that we'll make we'll have an impact on the size of business long term.","The second thing we're doing is we're really looking at the whole home market, we're not looking at a studio apartment we're not looking at extra bedrooms, we're looking at something which is meaningfully different from a traditional hotel room for obvious reasons. We think it makes them more complementary to the hotel space that we're in, we also think yet it helps skill on a gap if you will.","One of the gaps that arguably we've had is that win larger families whether that's a single nuclear family or an extended family are traveling together hotels are not necessarily always the easiest place to because there may not be places for them together. Outside of the public spaces of the hotel and the more we can do something that solves both of those, the better off. We think we are I think though even define that way. It is a big market and a market that we can grow in; we obviously don't expect that there will be a material financial impact in 2019. We wouldn't tell you to build anything in this model till we get smarter about it in the years ahead. But we're really excited about it and we are really eager to learn what we can learn in this space.","Anthony Powell","Great, thank you.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James.","Bill Crow","Good afternoon folks. And obviously share the sentiment that's already been said, or a 20 years of trying to me better I appreciate your efforts. I'm not sure they work, but I appreciate them - Arne, my question is really on the select service limited service space whether you think the consumer today is more discerning and what they're looking for and whether that's put older properties at a significant disadvantage to newly opened properties.","Arne Sorenson","It's a good question. Good question, for lots of reasons, I mean I think the full service hotels have got it they very meaningful advantage. They've got function space they've got presence that a typical select service hotel can offer often food and beverage range that select service hotel can offer, and they can continue to be I think quite competitive, particularly in the right kinds of markets. I think at the same time you see select brands and we've got a number of these I think about Moxy and AC and Aloft and Element just to name a few. That come right to mind that are interesting, they can be lively they can be with energized by bar space or lobby space or maybe even flex Food & Beverage space and if they're in urban locations they give a better alternative I think in some respects, then the relatively lower rated hotels that might have been in the same market in a past generation. If they existed there in the first place. And so, we'll watch this altogether obviously one reason these brands are growing so well as I think our franchise partners see them and say, this is a pretty, pretty interesting new mouse trap and we want to be part of experimenting to see how this works. I think ultimately all these hotels can be successful and if they're positioned right and if there truly their brands.","I think some of the newer select brands have the ability to punch above their weight in terms of rate per square footage, which I think will make them stronger over time. And ultimately where the growth settles is going to depend a little bit on that return and that return is both about current cash return for development costs, but it's also about capital preservation and what assets are going to hold their value the longest and that's still often going to be urban main and main kinds of locations that may deliver a little less percentage cash flow return but are going to hold their value extraordinarily well.","Bill Crow","Okay, I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes of SunTrust.","Patrick Scholes","Good afternoon. Let me just also reiterate Arne for a quick recovery and Laura, congratulations. Well deserved.","Laura Paugh","Thank you.","Patrick Scholes","A question, you had talked about occupancy taking a bit of a hit in the quarter. I guess, less use of third-party OTAS. Is this something that we would expect to continue throughout the year and then is it also fair to think that's on the flip side, it certainly benefits owned hotels including yours, as well as IMS?","Arne Sorenson","I mean I think we have seen, probably some of this the last few quarters. We certainly in the Marriott -- Legacy Marriott portfolio even before the integration of the reservations platforms, we have started to do some yielding of our inventory off of third-party sites when we predicted we didn't need that business. And so I suspect as we get further into the year, we will see some lapping of what we did in the past. I think what is accelerated, probably a bit is with going to one reservations platform is we brought the Starwood Hotels in sort of one fell swoop onto a little bit more aggressive approach that way and so we think we'll probably see some impact of that, we're going to watch this. I mean obviously we don't want to turn away business, if it's incremental to us. What we want to do, though, is make sure we're set up to maximize profitability of hotels and long-term and well you we've talked about this before.","Well, RevPAR is the single measure, which is most available in the industry. It is not the measure, which is the most important, which is what kind of profits are you driving from the performance -- hotel as you compete for owner Capital. And as we've said before, we're quite compared to sacrifice a few tenths on the top line if it makes sense to drive enhanced profitability on the bottom line.","Kathleen Oberg","The only additional add to that is that I would not expect it to the second part of your question, I would not expect to materially impact only profit.","Patrick Scholes","Thank you for the clear definition.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin Farley","Great, thank you. I want to add my best wishes for Arne and Laura quite obviously I'm -- that Laura leaving the as many years of I've been doing this. I always learn something when I talk to Laura. So I think for all of us are understanding of the industries can be diminished by her going, but so let that stop you well deserved. So my question is incentive management fees. I wonder if you could give us sometimes you give color on kind of what percent was hotels are paying versus the previous kind of in North America, and then -- just with the guidance for management -- incentive metrics declines in Q2, you mentioned that's renovations, it seems like something that I'll the renovation disruption might be more than one quarter phenomenon, but your full-year guidance is still for that up mid single-digit for the incentive management fee. So I wonder if you could just talk to us about how, like, what's the sort of specific to Q2, but not necessarily an issue in later quarters about that. So, thank you.","Kathleen Oberg","Sure, absolutely. So let's first talk about percentage ownership on incentive fees. And in Q1, in '19, versus '18, it was up 300 basis points. So, 56% versus 53% a year ago, first quarter, so fits nicely with the discussion that we've been having, relative to margins, and also International Hotel growth. Relative to the full-year, last year '18 was up about a point over '17. It's too soon for us to kind of get into percentages for all of '19 but I think clearly the trend is moving in the right direction. So a couple things I mentioned on incentive fees in Q2, one of the things that's going on in Q2 and incentive fees is FX, we have expected that FX, albeit it's a little bit less bad than we expected a quarter ago, a quarter ago we said 15 to 20. Now we've got closer to 10. We do expect that FX impact negative FX impact, which clearly hits incentive fees to be largely in the first-half. So we are expecting a chunk of that to be in Q2. And then, you add on to that the reality that in Q1 we had a bunch of resorts that were getting this extra strong incentive fees, and then layer on top of it the renovations and Easter and that's where you get this overall change in the direction of the incentive fees in Q2.","Robin Farley","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Hey, good afternoon and best wishes on a speedy recovery, Arne and Laura good luck in your retirement.","Laura Paugh","Thanks.","Arne Sorenson","Thank you.","Thomas Allen","So at the beginning in your prepared remarks, you talked about two and a half years of embedded growth, just in the hotels in construction, and then another two and a half years in the pipeline. Is that saying for that for the current 5.5% to 6% growth, you're guiding it? Is that what you're implying?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, I guess so. Yes, I don't know that we exactly. went back and tested the net unit growth number. And obviously, the 5.5% is net of deletions. We're not updating the deletions forecasts, but really simply looking at -- you look at the volume of rooms in that pipeline, and it looks about five years' worth of growth.","Thomas Allen","And just assuming, just a steady pace of opening, so, it -- just the today's pace, you got a lot of stuff in the pipeline.","Kathleen Oberg","It's consistent with what we talked about in the security analyst meeting, which obviously you'd expect higher room openings in 21 than you would expect in '19, but it is all consistent with this pipeline be it 478 or 475.","Thomas Allen","Okay, perfect. And then just since you announced homes and villas, what have you heard from owners?","Arne Sorenson","They're curious, of course, they're deeply interested in where we're going with this, obviously 2000 homes and villas is a substantial increase from what we were doing last year. But it is not a significant number by itself when you compare it to the either the size of the hotel system we have today, or even the number of hotels we open every week. And so, it's less a question really about what are we doing today, than what might we be doing in the future? And I think as we go forward, we're going to make sure we're communicating with them and taking on board their interest, I think our owners are not monolithic. So it would be wrong to say that every one of them has exactly the same point of view.","I do think there are many of them that acknowledge that this is a rational step for us to take. And if they were in our shoes, they'd be doing exactly the same thing. I think broadly, they appreciate the value of the loyalty program and know that this can enhance the loyalty program, which is to benefit not just of the homes and villas of business, but it's also to the benefit of the hotel business. And I think owners generally have a point of view, which is they'd like to grow with us, but maybe have nobody else grow with us, so that they can make sure that they capture as much of our customer base as they possibly can. I think they understand philosophically that that's not a world that they can necessarily have. But you put all that through the grinder and I think we've got a, very constructive set of conversations with our owners and I'm sure we'll be able to navigate this too with them well.","Thomas Allen","Helpful, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from one of Michael Bellisario of Baird.","Michael Bellisario","Good afternoon.","Arne Sorenson","Hi, there.","Michael Bellisario","All the best to both of you, Arne, and Laura.","Laura Paugh","Thank you.","Michael Bellisario","You gave us a 3% number. I think it's on the transient side for your largest accounts. I mean, did you see any different trend with some of your smaller accounts and any difference is between kind of larger and smaller customers in terms of the booking behavior that you saw?","Kathleen Oberg","Yes, I wouldn't say anything. Kind of notable, happily, some of our biggest customers like the professional services, areas, things like that. They were good. They were up meaningfully. So, some of the areas that you would expect, so I don't think there any particular trends of the larger versus the smaller, but certainly, professional services and example was up very strong.","Michael Bellisario","And then you mentioned, I think you called it a surgeon group bookings in April, what was kind of the profile of that customer that was being more aggressive with their forward-looking bookings?","Kathleen Oberg","Well, they're actually that was group that we were talking about. That was group bookings, which obviously can cover a range everything from associations to government to corporations. And it was quite strong in the corporates. What I think one of the things that we were very pleased to see is that it was the surge was both in the year for the year as well as for all future periods, which was always very encouraging.","Michael Bellisario","That's helpful. Thank you.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from on this Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company.","Kevin Kopelman","Hi, thanks a lot. And first of all, best wishes to you, Arne, and congrats to Laura.","Arne Sorenson","Thanks Kevin.","Laura Paugh","Thanks, Kevin.","Kevin Kopelman","I just had a quick one. Can you talk about free cash flow trends that you're seeing and that kind of one-time payment that you had in the first quarter and how you're expecting free cash flow trend for the year? Thanks.","Kathleen Oberg","The one-time payment, you're referencing.","Laura Paugh","You just talk about insurance costs related to profit sharing last year?","Kathleen Oberg","Yes, profit. That was profit sharing within a year ago, first quarter. So in that respect, we were talking about kind of year-over-year trend in G&A because obviously last year was weighted down by the $35 million. You could be talking about the profit sharing from our working capital changes.","Kevin Kopelman","Sorry, I'm talking about the outflow for accrued payroll and benefits.","Kathleen Oberg","Yes, yes.","Kevin Kopelman","You're aware. Yes.","Kathleen Oberg","Yes. And that is just a function of the fact that as you remember, we accrued for this supplemental benefit last year, but we actually paid it out in first quarter into our associate's accounts. And then second of all, we also moved up our profit-sharing timing from Q3 to Q1. So when you look at the working capital, use of cash in Q1 relative to normal, it looks particularly heavy, and that's because of about $200 million worth of timing differences in the cash flow.","Kevin Kopelman","Got it? And then just a follow-up on typically, your loyalty program has been a source of cash and you talked about how it might be different this year and you did have strong I think, redemptions in the first quarter. So any change to the outlook there for this year?","Kathleen Oberg","Yes, so good question. And again, to your kind of to finish off the rest of your earlier question, otherwise, in terms of the overall flow of cash, it's really the same as we expressed in the first quarter, so no fundamental change, we obviously haven't assumed any asset sales. So it's pretty similar. Yes, I would say loyalty might be between $50 million and $100 million, negative use of cash this year as compared to more neutral where we were a quarter ago. But that's also offset by a little bit higher net income. So you put that all together with maybe ever so slightly higher debt borrowings, and we end up in exactly the same place. And all of those I would say are in the $60 million to $75 million, so really kind of fine-tuning more than being any fundamental change.","Kevin Kopelman","Okay, got it. Thanks so much.","Kathleen Oberg","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from one of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Hello, everyone. I just got a quick question on conversions. Now that bond boy has been launched. The programs have been integrating. Are you seeing an increase in interest promoters to convert to Marriott brands?","Arne Sorenson","I think it's certainly at least steady, if not up a bit. Yes, I think the demand both for new build and for conversions is comparable. I think the feedback we're getting from our owners is very positive. I think they're have been questions already, obviously, about margin, which we've talked about, I think there is not maybe not unanimous but broad recognition that we're delivering the incremental margin performance because of what we've built here. And I think there's broad understanding that the revenue lift should come behind it. And not only an absolute revenue lift, but a mix of revenue sources, which is more cost effective. And so, the level of conversations we're having with our current and prospective partners are very robust.","Kathleen Oberg","And in certain markets that are more RevPAR challenge, like Middle East for sample, we're very encouraged with some of the conversion activity we see going on there where the benefits of the strong revenue pipeline of our brands is viewed as very attractive, as well as the margin.","Wes Golladay","Hey, can I get one more question? I want to -- looking at the limited service, the underperformance this quarter is a little bit more pronounced. And I assume some of that was related to their -- the relief efforts last year. Is that true? And how do you expect the gap between full service to trend throughout the year?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, it's a good question. The -- I think the limited services, partly geographic distribution, maybe a little bit for us, partly age of product, I suppose maybe for courtyard, which we're working on, but I don't see a dramatic difference in performance between the segments as the year goes on.","Wes Golladay","Thank you very much, and best wishes and thanks for everything.","Arne Sorenson","Thank you.","Kathleen Oberg","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from line of Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research.","Vince Ciepiel","Great. Thanks. And best wishes to both Arne and Laura. I had two questions. And they're both related to share of wallet, one pretending to start with Marriott deal and the second on home sharing. So first on Starwood, Marriott, obviously had this base of legacy Marriott loyalty members, Starwood loyalty members, and I'm curious kind of what inning you think we're in of increasing share of wallet within those bases of legacy members? What type of overlap you're seeing of the legacy Marriott staying now at Starwood properties, and vice versa? I guess maybe a simple way of capturing it is, I think you've noted loyalty is 50% of the business now. How high do you think that could get?","Arne Sorenson","Well, I'm not sure we actually know the answer. The second one, a couple of comments on absolute penetration of loyalty, and then maybe finish with what anywhere in. It was interesting to us that when we acquired Starwood and looked at the way the calculation was done for loyalty contribution of hotels, Starwood was seven or eight points higher than Marriott was, principally because the calculation was done differently. And we have synthesized those calculations now, so that they're the same. And actually, the loyalty contribution to the Starwood Hotels looks a whole lot more like what it does for the Marriott Hotels. And there's some arcane things in there about whether you count for example, a point in the eligible room that came in through an OTA channel but has a loyalty number attached to it, where maybe they can earn points from food and beverage, or you don't, and we don't so there are a bunch of things that go into their calculation.","As we said, we're at about 50% of all of our rooms are coming from our loyalty programs. We think that number will grow. We are -- I think, in a very early inning, well, our customers were both Starwood and Marriott customers, I think we're pleased when we allowed linkage of the loyalty programs on the day of close to now have one single program means they don't have to go to two separate sites, if you will, to see what the options are in the other legacy portfolio. And that means the customers are just in the last few months now for the first time going on and looking at whatever destination they may be going to end seen a meaningfully broader selection to choose from than they did before. And it means that we are seeing folks who might have driven farther for that SPG hotel or driven farther for that Marriott Rewards hotel before now having options that are a little bit closer to them. And there'll be some in there'll be some trading sort of back and forth and in both directions, which I think net should drive share of wallet and maybe not disproportionately impact either one. We did put in our prepared remarks that redemption volume has gone up significantly. I think that is a powerful sign that people are seeing that the value of the choices that are available. And so, I tried to put an ending on it, but I would say it's very early in the game in terms of the revenue lift and the lift available from the bandwidth program.","Okay, I guess the operator told us you were last. Thank you very much for being so patient with us. We obviously try and do these things in the morning for obvious reasons. We had our board meeting and shareholders meeting this morning and we're trying to fit an awful lot in the same day. And so, thanks for waiting until Friday afternoon. For us, we appreciate your interest in us. Congratulations, Laura. Once again, we'll have you for another few quarters here but\u2026","Laura Paugh","Thank you, happy Mother's Day to everybody.","Arne Sorenson","Happy Mother's Day, everybody, make sure you take your mothers or your spouses or whoever is mother-like to you to one of our hotels and celebrate. Have a good weekend.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect."],"13848":["Marriott International, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to hand today's program over to Mr. Arne Sorenson, President and CEO of Marriott International. Please go ahead.","Arne M. Sorenson","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Carl Berquist, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","For those of you who joined our call early, we hope you enjoyed the music, courtesy of our new global marketing partnership with Universal Music Group. UMG is the world's leader in music with a portfolio of top labels including Capitol Music Group, Def Jam Recordings and Island Records among others. This partnership will enable us to better engage next generation experience seekers with Marriott Rewards member-only access to UMG events and concerts. British singer and songwriter, Ellie Goulding, helped launch this partnership last month with a live performance at the St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel. Stay tuned for more exciting events coming up around the world.","Speaking of entertainment, as of the second quarter, we were the first hotel company to offer Netflix programming in our guest rooms. Our collaboration with Netflix reflects changing consumer preferences in how guests want to access and watch content while they travel. We expect to offer Netflix in more than 100 properties by the end of 2015.","Our Moxy brand is hitting the road and will be showcasing its model guestroom around the country. Built for transport in a shipping container, the Moxy guestroom mark-up made its debut at Alice in LA earlier this year. Now not only will it be on display but it will also be the setting for a new YouTube eight-part series. Created by Marriott's content studio, the series will be hosted by comedian, Taryn Southern, creator and star of Taryn TV. She'll interview and gossip with guest celebrities revealing their travel habits and quirky experiences on the road. So watch for this coming up on YouTube.","Before going further, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.

You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our Web-site at www.marriott.com\/investor.","Before we get into our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about two industry questions. First, there's been a lot of discussion about the strength of demand and the pace of RevPAR growth. Undoubtedly a slower pace of RevPAR growth is likely to occur at some point in North America as economic growth matures. Trees don't grow to the sky. In fact, you may recall, at our Analyst Meeting last year that we started our four year RevPAR growth rate scenarios with a 4% handle.","While this slower pace is likely at some point, we think it is premature to call it today. Based on our data, we believe North American industry RevPAR growth will be solid for the foreseeable future, impacted quarter to quarter by calendar shifts and unusual events. Our RevPAR results support this view. Our system-wide North American RevPAR rose 5.1% in April, 4.7% in May and 6.4% in June. Early in the quarter, our results were constrained by civil unrest in Baltimore and flooding in Texas.","Recent group bookings are very strong. North American Full-Service Group business booked in the second quarter for all future periods rose over 8% year-over-year. In fact, meeting planners are worried about securing availability more than negotiating hard on rate.","You've heard a lot about the tough third quarter comparisons. Last year, our third quarter North American Full-Service Group RevPAR was very strong benefiting from the favorable holiday pattern. As we started 2015, our group pace for this year's third quarter was down 2% reflecting those tough comparisons. Since then with strong short-term bookings, our third quarter pace has improved to plus 3%. Given this improving group business and our continued strong transient demand, we expect North America system-wide RevPAR will increase 4% to 6% for the third quarter.","Our fourth quarter should be even better. Group revenue pace for our full-service hotels for the fourth quarter is up 9% today. Given the tight supply of meeting space at many hotels, we would expect fewer last-minute group bookings and therefore we expect our actual group revenue growth rate will be closer to 7% when the quarter is over. With this strength, we are expecting fourth quarter North American system-wide RevPAR to increase 5% to 7%, probably biased a bit to the upper end of the range. Net-net, our RevPAR expectations for 2015 are fundamentally unchanged from a quarter ago.","We expect 2016 will be solid as well. Already roughly 55% of our expected group business is on the books and group revenue pace is up about 7% having improved 3 percentage points in the last 12 months. It's a bit early for us to outline our RevPAR expectations for 2016 but STR is forecasting U.S. industry RevPAR to increase roughly 6%.","Supply is another common question about our industry. In the U.S., the modest pace of economic growth combined with lender caution has constrained lodging supply growth for the past five years. While construction starts are picking up, STR doesn't expect U.S. supply will reach even the historical average growth rate until 2017. But there is more to the story. Today new supply is largely in the limited service category and focused in secondary and tertiary markets. In fact, in STR's under-construction, final planning or planning U.S. pipeline in the U.S. over 55% of the new rooms are outside the top 25 markets, and many of these markets haven't seen significant supply growth in a very long time.","Development and ownership of new hotels is very diverse. Lodging Econometrics reports that over 900 unique owners are building hotels in the USA today, with merely 85% of them controlling just a single project. Financing is easier and averaging 70% to 75% loan-to-value, yet developers remain very selective about the rooms they choose. Lodging Econometrics also reports that Marriott International brands account for a quarter of the U.S. under-construction pipeline, well ahead of our 11% existing room share.","This preference for strong brands is also revealed in recent conversion activity. While we typically expect to see a greater number of conversions in an economic downturn, high levels of U.S. conversions have persisted even as the economy recovered. Marriott has benefited from this flight to quality. The successful launch of the Autograph brand followed more recently by industry copycat brands reflects this reality. By the way, at quarter end we had 86 Autographs open worldwide with another 42 projects in our development pipeline, making it one of the fastest hotel brand launches ever.","Looking ahead we believe conversions to our system are likely to step up as our new Delta brand will focus on the conversion market. In just two months we have already received inquiries regarding the possible conversion of more than 50 hotels in the U.S. and Canada. Including Delta, we expect to open roughly 55,000 rooms in 2015, reflecting roughly 8% gross room additions.","We believe our growing share of hotels is largely due to our strong brands and revenue platforms. In fact, guests booked roughly $12 billion of gross room reservations on Marriott.com globally in the last 12 months, with roughly $2 billion on Marriott Mobile alone. With nearly 52 million members, Marriott Rewards puts us closer to our guests, rewards their loyalty and allows us to better understand their needs.","We are pleased with our record 250,000 room pipeline but it's not just room volume that sets us apart from the competition. With our strong RevPAR index, concentration in higher room rate markets and brands as well as profitable and consistent long-term contracts, our rooms generate better terms and greater value than implied by the room numbers alone.","Our effective royalty rate for our North American franchised hotels in the second quarter was 5.4% of gross room sales. While royalty rate increases only apply to new signings, relicenses or renewals if we apply our current published stabilized royalty rates to the same top line, our effective franchise royalty rate would total 5.8%. Even our newest brands are delivering attractive royalty rates. At contract stabilization, our more than 60 AC and Moxy hotels in the domestic pipeline should yield franchise royalties at 5.5% of room revenue.","On a year-to-date basis, we've signed roughly 40,000 managed and franchised rooms worldwide, including the acquisition of nearly 10,000 Delta rooms. With strong long-term contracts, we expect these new managed and franchised rooms worldwide will deliver over $85 million of annual stabilized fee revenue.","There are many ways to grow hotel business. In the absence of a strong brand, one could drive rooms growth with significant capital contributions or fee concessions to owners. One could also employ short-term agreements, offer easy termination provisions and accept poor quality conversion candidates. These approaches drive unit growth but not much value. Unfortunately, anecdotally we are hearing that competitors most under pressure to drive unit growth are offering such deal concessions. We don't intend to take that path.","With our strong brands and a meaningful pipeline, over the next few years we expect an increasing pace of unit openings at attractive economics. Solid RevPAR growth and increasing unit growth should continue to fuel improving returns on invested capital, growing cash flow and steady and significant returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. From 2012 to 2014, we returned over $4 billion to shareholders. We now expect to return over $2 billion to shareholders in repurchases and dividends in 2015 alone. We are bullish about our future.","Now I'd like to turn things over to Carl to talk more about our outstanding second quarter results. Carl?","Carl T. Berquist","Thanks Arne. Our second quarter was strong. Lodging demand remained solid and constant dollar worldwide system-wide RevPAR increased 5.3%. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.87, roughly $0.07 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance of $0.78 to $0.83. $0.03 of our outperformance came from better than expected general and administrative expenses, including $0.01 each for lower legal expenses, lower net development expenses and good overall cost control.","In addition, we picked up about $0.01 from favorable G&A timing, offset by about $0.01 of transaction and transition cost for the Delta acquisition which was not in our second quarter guidance. We booked a $0.09 gain on the redemption of our preferred equity stake in the Grande Lakes and Desert Ridge Resorts, offset by an unfavorable $0.04 per share associated with an anticipated loss on the sale of a hotel and undeveloped land.","System-wide RevPAR in North America rose 5.4% and occupancy reached 78%. Group RevPAR rose roughly 6% with room rates up about 5%. For transient business, we continued to reduce the volume of special corporate business in favor of a greater volume of higher-rated retail business.","Looking across the markets, we saw very strong system-wide RevPAR growth in the quarter at our hotels in Washington DC, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver and San Francisco. In contrast, San Antonio RevPAR declined in the second quarter due to flooding and Baltimore experienced group and leisure cancellations.","In New York, our system-wide RevPAR increased 1% in the second quarter and New York's group pace for the third quarter improved. While room rates at full-service hotels in New York are compressed by limited-service additions, our system-wide occupancy in the city reached 90% in the second quarter. DC had a great quarter with strong group business. Just 15 months after opening, the Washington Marriott Marquis is performing well with nearly 80% occupancy in the quarter. As predicted, Marquis is helping to drive convention business to the city.","Outside North America, second quarter system-wide comparable RevPAR rose nearly 5% on a constant dollar basis. On an actual dollar basis, international RevPAR declined 5% year-over-year. In the Caribbean and Latin America region, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR increased 5% with strong performance in Mexico and at resorts and leisure destinations in the Caribbean. For the full year, we expect RevPAR will increase at a mid-single-digit rate with a tough third quarter comparison to last year's World Cup in Brazil.","In the Asia-Pacific region, second quarter constant dollar system-wide RevPAR rose nearly 6% with particular strength in Japan and India and easy comps in Thailand. System-wide RevPAR in Mainland China increased more than 7% reflecting strong results in Shanghai. RevPAR in Hong Kong declined due to lower inbound China travel while in South Korea RevPAR declined due to the MERS outbreak. For the full year, we believe our Asia-Pacific RevPAR will increase at a mid-single-digit rate.","In Europe, constant dollar RevPAR rose 4%. RevPAR increased due to high attendance at group events in Germany, strong demand in the U.K. provinces and strong leisure demand in Spain. France remained weak even with the low euro as leisure travelers selected more reasonably priced venues. Room rates from U.S. travel to our European hotels increased 7% in the quarter with particular strength in Germany, Austria and Great Britain. We expect our Europe RevPAR to increase at a mid-single-digit growth rate for the full year.","In the Middle East and Africa, constant dollar RevPAR increased nearly 1%, constrained by the earlier start of Ramadan. We expect to see much stronger results in the third quarter as an offset. For the full year, we expect a mid-single-digit constant dollar RevPAR growth for this region as well.","Turning to margins, house profit margins at Company-operated hotels in North America increased 80 basis points reflecting stronger pricing and lower utility costs. Worldwide house profit margins also increased 70 basis points. Our house profit margins reflect the new accounting guidelines for the lodging industry which require that service charges be included in property revenue. Excluding the impact of this accounting change, we estimate our North America house profit margins would have improved 110 basis points in the second quarter.","Base fees rose 9% in the quarter reflecting higher managed hotel RevPAR, higher food and beverage sales and unit growth. In addition, limited-service portfolios recognized $5 million of deferred base fees in the quarter. As expected, incentive fees were flat in the quarter reflecting roughly $5 million of lower incentive fees from a few full-service hotels under renovation, a $2 million lower fee due to a shift in timing of fee recognition at one resort, and a $4 million negative impact from foreign exchange. Incentive fees were also constrained by weak results in South Korea and Hong Kong.","In contrast, incentive fees for North America Limited-Service hotels doubled in the quarter with particular strength in the Courtyard brand. With the completion of a public space and rooms renovation program over the past five years, pruning a poorly positioned property and strong demand, over 60% of domestic managed Courtyard hotels paid incentive fees in the second quarter compared to 35% in the year ago quarter. Worldwide, 59% of our managed hotels paid incentive fees in the quarter compared to 45% in the year ago quarter. In North America alone, 55% of managed hotels paid incentive fees compared to 32% in the year ago period.","Franchise fees increased 14% in the quarter. Most of the improvement was due to unit growth, RevPAR improvement and ramping royalty rates. We also saw higher royalty fees and relicensing fees associated with hotel transactions and contract renewals. With a robust hotel resale market in North America, we relicensed over 75 U.S. franchised hotels during the quarter. In most cases the new agreements reflect higher stabilized royalty rates and regularly include a commitment to make property improvements. In the last 12 months, we estimate owners of North America franchised hotels have committed to nearly $1 billion in property improvement program.","Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $60 million in the quarter compared to $70 million in the prior year. Results reflected the renovation of the Charlotte City Center Marriott, preopening costs for the New York EDITION and lower residential branding fees.","Depreciation and amortization totaled $32 million in the quarter compared to $47 million in the prior year. You may recall that we booked a $15 million impairment in the prior year. General and administrative expenses declined from the prior year largely due to easy comparison to last year's $7 million revaluation of our Venezuela Bolivar exposure.","Our preferred equity stake in our Grande Lakes and Desert Ridge hotels was redeemed in the second quarter yielding proceeds of roughly $120 million and a gain of $41 million. We also recorded a loss of $22 million on the pending disposition of a hotel and the sale of some land that will be developed as a hotel project. We expect roughly $100 million in proceeds from these two transactions sometime in the next 12 months.","Foreign exchange reduced our pre-tax income in the second quarter by roughly $9 million, largely in fee revenue. For the full year, we expect FX will reduce our pre-tax income by roughly $30 million. These amounts do not reflect the impact of exchange rates on travel trends.","For Marriott International, our adjusted operating income margin in the second quarter increased from 47% to 50%. We repurchased over 9 million shares during the quarter for nearly $715 million. Our fully diluted weighted average share count in the quarter was 7% lower than in the prior year and over 25% lower than five years ago.","As Arne mentioned, for the third quarter we expect worldwide constant dollar RevPAR will increase 4% to 6%. We expect total fees will increase roughly 5% to 7% with incentive fees likely to increase at a low teens rate in the seasonally slow third quarter. You may recall that last year's third quarter included $15 million of recognized deferred base fees and $9 million of franchise relicensing fees.","We expect our owned, leased and other results in the third quarter will total $50 million to $55 million. Our renovation of the Charlotte City Center Marriott and lower termination fees year-over-year should constrain growth in the quarter. G&A expenses in the third quarter should decline modestly year-over-year with lower legal cost and an easy comparison for foreign exchange. Last year's third quarter reflected $4 million of unfavorable FX due primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar.","Turning to the full year, compared to our prior guidance, we've tightened the range of RevPAR growth as we are already halfway through the year. With 5.5% to 6.5% constant dollar RevPAR growth, we expect our fee revenue will increase 10% to 11%. We've tweaked our full year fee revenue estimate a bit from our prior guidance due to the tightened RevPAR range, unfavorable foreign exchange and more modest incentive fee growth in Hong Kong and South Korea.","We've improved our estimate for depreciation and amortization from our prior guidance by about $10 million due to a refinement of our Protea and Delta purchase price allocation estimates and lower depreciation from assets held for sale. We expect our full year general and administrative expenses will total $630 million to $640 million, a roughly 3% to 4% decline year-over-year. Compared to our prior full year guidance, our lower estimate for G&A reflects lower legal and net development expenses and better overall cost control.","Partially offsetting these savings is roughly $10 million of transaction and transition cost for the Delta acquisition which was not previously in our guidance. All in all, we expect fully diluted EPS will total $3.10 to $3.18 in 2015. Compared to our prior guidance, we have included the $0.05 of net gains booked in the second quarter offset by the $0.02 of Delta transaction and transition cost for the full year.","We expect adjusted EBITDA will increase 13% to 15% for 2015. Investment spending could total $600 million to $800 million including about a $140 million in maintenance spending and $135 million for the Delta acquisition. We will remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchases. We've already recycled more than $750 million from asset sales and loan repayments to date in 2015, including the redemption of our preferred equity stake in Grande Lakes and Desert Ridge and the sale of the Miami Beach EDITION, the New York EDITION and a Courtyard in Paris.","Included in these year-to-date proceeds is roughly $40 million from the redemption of a preferred equity stake in another hotel that we received just this week. We expect to return at least $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends this year.","We appreciate your interest in Marriott. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, we'll take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley","You talked about cash return to shareholders of $2 billion, which is up by about $250 million from last quarter, but your EBITDA guidance is actually down a little bit. So I am wondering where the sort of incremental $250 plus million, was that maybe an acquisition you had looked at doing that you're not doing now and so that cash ends up going to shareholders or kind of what's the delta there?","Carl T. Berquist","I think part of it is, Robin, they are redemption of some of these preferred stakes that we have in hotels that are occurring this year as well as the $100 million that we have on the market right now for the land and the hotel that we're doing. And we think our stock is a 'buy' right now, so we want to get out there and buy it.","Robin Farley","Okay, great, that's helpful. And then just for my follow-up, just to clarify, you have EBITDA lower at both ends, RevPAR is being raised at the bottom and lowered at the top but EBITDA is lower at both ends, is that mostly the Hong Kong and South Korea fee revenue that makes the EBITDA not as favorable as the RevPAR changes?","Arne M. Sorenson","Absolutely, it's the international markets, it's Seoul and Hong Kong would be the two most significant. Both are big incentive fee contributing hotels for us in those markets. And then a little bit of foreign exchange impact around the world would be the two biggest things on fees. Obviously when you get to the EBITDA calculation, you've got a bunch of adjustments going in different directions including the building in for the first time of $10 million or so of Delta transaction and transition costs which are rolled into that G&A number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi.","Smedes Rose","I wanted to ask you just a little more on potential acquisition activity, I'm not talking about Starwood but more thinking about things like Delta and Protea, and Delta seems like it's really more of a conversion vehicle for you and Protea was more about establishing a footprint in an area where you were underrepresented, and as you look forward, do you think you need more conversion brands potentially in the limited-service or midscale arena or are you more interested in kind of locking down your footprint maybe outside of the U.S. more aggressively?","Arne M. Sorenson","The way you framed the question, I'd probably take option B over option A but in some respects it's obviously a theoretical question. Deals become available in the market with sort of a certain definition, and as we've talked about before, I think Delta and Protea and Gaylord, AC, I think all of them have some similarities in that we found them to be pretty compelling financial propositions with acquisition prices sort of in 8 to 10 times fee range, something like that, within a short period after closing and accretive to us therefore from a value perspective.","I think when we looked at Protea, we were expanding into a part of Africa where we really didn't have presence and we found not just a portfolio of great hotels but we found a collection of good leaders down there who could grow our business in Sub-Saharan Africa. I think in the abstract we wouldn't have been necessarily all that eager to add another brand but would've loved to do the growth with the brands we already had, but of course it came with another brand and that brand had strength and everybody is going to keep it.","When you look at Delta, it was really sort of a [indiscernible]. I think the way we underwrited that deal was as a way of getting an existing portfolio of hotels, getting a greater strength in Canada which is obviously both a strong market in its own right and a great contributing market to travel to the United States, back and forth, and the deal sort of stood on its own from that perspective. I think in the months since we've closed now, just three months, we've been pleased \u2013 we're hopeful for this but we've been pleased to see that there's a strong appetite from our partners including in the United States to explore growing the Delta brand with us here. And so we think it will add a sort of extra piece of value to us as we go forward.","I don't think that we are particularly looking for additional conversion brands, whether that be in the upscale space or other segments of the marketplace, and I think in some respects we would continue to say that our brand lineup is reasonably complete. We think we've got most of sets of both lifestyle and traditional brands in the industry and they are all performing quite well with good momentum, but we'll continue to kick all the tires that drive by.","Smedes Rose","Okay. Can I just ask you, what was the share count at the end of the quarter?","Carl T. Berquist","Common shares outstanding was 267.3 million shares, and then you have about 4.9 million of dilution, so diluted shares was 272.2 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven Kent","So a couple of questions. Can you first talk about your full-service RevPAR growth? It seems to be underperforming your select service RevPAR growth. Just some thoughts whether that's some part of the cycle or whether that's something to do with the brand? And then the second question is, you noted in your opening comments that RevPAR will be solid for the balance of 2015 based on some data, and I was just wondering what that data is, especially because it seems like the last-minute travelers is really the one who's seen the street pushing the rates pretty recently.","Arne M. Sorenson","So let's take those in order. I think on the full-service RevPAR question, I would not take either of your suggested answer. I don't think it has much to do with our brands and I don't think it really has much to do with the cycle. I think you look at full-service hotels and you've got two things that are going on. I think the most significant is renovations. We had a number of quite substantial full-service hotels, big hotels that were under renovation in the quarter, probably had 0.5 point to 1 point of RevPAR impact, maybe something like that from those hotels alone, and we think those renovation comparisons will now get meaningfully easier in Q3 and by and large disappear as a headwind in Q4.","And I think the second thing is, obviously New York is something we're all watching. It is the weakest big market in New York. I think it does tend to contribute a bit more to the full-service numbers than others. And so we see full-service performance. Yes, you're right, it's lower in the quarter than the limited-service hotels but we think it's going to come back as we get through the renovations piece and go through to get to the other demand points, which is a good way of transitioning to your second question.","The data points that we would point you to are the ones that were in the prepared script primarily, and that is, group bookings for Q3, group bookings for Q4, group bookings for 2016 and when you look at also the strength of transient demand which has been steady throughout and of course transient bookings, you can't see much when you go past 30 to 60 days particularly with business travel because it's relatively short-term booking. The near-term stuff looks quite good and we'd expect transient pace to continue pretty well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","Arne, you've been bullish for some time now looking back even at points when [indiscernible]. So now, as you look \u2013 and your comments at the beginning of your prepared remarks were crystal clear, as you look towards the rest of the year and into next year, what has changed since what you saw what happened early in the year in 2015, if you could just talk about that for a moment?","Arne M. Sorenson","I said our perspective really has not changed fundamentally since a quarter ago or even two quarters ago. I think we've got some apprehension as a marketplace, in part maybe driven by the fact that we're in the sixth year of a strong lodging recovery. I think all of us kind of wonder how long can it last and we're constantly looking for clues that maybe we're reaching a point where we can somehow say that we're transitioning to a different phase, and I understand that.","In many respects we look at the same questions and we ask the same questions here. We don't see evidence that would suggest that we're entering a different phase of the cycle. We see supply growth continuing to be low. We see demand growth continuing to be high. When you look at group business, when you look at pricing power, all of those things look good.","And to be fair, I am not necessarily sitting here saying that RevPAR numbers that the industry reported last year or that Marriott reported in 2014 are the numbers that we'll get in 2015 or that we'll get in 2016, but I think we will see a solid mid to high mid single-digit RevPAR growth for comp store sales in the United States extending for some period of time, and when you think about the way that works in our model with good solid unit growth because of the strength of our brands, we will continue to produce an extraordinary amount of cash which can be invested back into our business or can be returned back to the shareholders, and I think that will continue to drive great cash flow growth, I think it will drive great growth in returns, I think it will drive a great growth in earnings per share, and that's what causes us to say we remain pretty bullish about what's to come.","Felicia Hendrix","Thank you for that. And for my follow-up, just probably changing gears for a moment, in June you announced the partnership with TripAdvisor. I was just wondering if you could talk about the thought process that brought you to signing that deal and are there other opportunities in the OTA space or the non-traditional lodging space or non-traditional booking space that you see.","Arne M. Sorenson","We've got a lot of respect for TripAdvisor. They have built a platform for customer reviews that has tremendous strength and obviously a broad application for hotels around the world. And we have been in a bit of a mating dance with them for some period of time, sort of feeling each other out and trying to figure out how the partnership would work between us, and what we found and ultimately caused us to do the deal with them was a partnership that was meaningfully more constructive for us than some of the other relationships that we have out there in terms of ability to control our inventory, in terms of customer data, in terms of ability to continue to offer specials or advantages within our tent of Rewards customers, and the cost of the reservations. So all of those things let us to conclude that TripAdvisor would be a great partner and we were really excited to get that deal done and to launch it and look forward to the way that it proceeds.","Felicia Hendrix","And then just as far as anything else you could do in that space?","Arne M. Sorenson","Nothing else that we would talk about at the moment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry Curtis","A couple of follow-ups. At quarter end, am I correct in calculating that the net debt ratio was around 2x and where would you expect it to be by year-end?","Carl T. Berquist","When you calculate that, Harry, you need to throw in the leases and some other things as far as the rating agencies are. So we kind of look at an adjusted debt to an adjusted EBITDA and that when you throw in the leases, guarantees, some other things there, we're getting closer to 3x and we try to manage right around that 3x. Obviously it's not exact, so sometimes we're a little under that, sometimes we're a little over that, but we kind of target that. That keeps us in a solid investment grade rating. And so we'll manage that debt capacity relative to about 3x, but that 3x is adjusted for leases and guarantees.","Harry Curtis","Okay. Then in a somewhat related question, you've given guidance for total investment spend of $600 million to $800 million. Backing out maintenance and the acquisition, that leaves about $425 million in additional investment spend. Where do you think you're going to be based on the pace that you are at now by the end of 2015?","Carl T. Berquist","I think we'll be in that range. I think that range is still good range. I can't fine-tune it anymore than that right now. It's still \u2013 we're only in the midyear right now, but as we look out at our capital commitments over the next six months as well as we continue to grow our pipeline, I think that's still a good number to hold to, that $600 million to $800 million.","Arne M. Sorenson","Harry, I don't have the precise numbers in front of me, but I would guess that of that $600 million to $800 million, 75% to 80%, maybe even higher, is identified. So if you're getting at what's the likelihood that we're going to come in a few hundred million dollars less than that range, I wouldn't put much likelihood on that.","Harry Curtis","Okay, that's exactly where I was going. And just the last part of that is, what are the biggest chunks of that additional investment spend?","Arne M. Sorenson","Carl has maybe got a list here but we are renovating top to bottom our Marriott hotel in Charlotte, we've just completed renovating top to bottom our Renaissance Hotel in the Dominican Republic, we have of course completed the construction of the EDITION hotels which is already done but was included in our first couple of quarters, we've got some technology projects which are in there and obviously technology spending is not what we think of first but we're probably doing $100 million plus of that in the year.","Carl T. Berquist","Building couple of hotels down in Brazil.","Arne M. Sorenson","We're building a couple of hotels down in Brazil, we'll open a Courtyard Residence Inn in time for the Olympics next year, so that money is going out.","Laura E. Paugh","And then we've got some key money and some loan\u2026","Carl T. Berquist","So we have a few loan commitments that will probably fund later in the year.","Arne M. Sorenson","Those sorts of things.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James.","Bill Crow","Arne, there was a report out by a large corporate travel and expense management company looking at the sharing economy, I think everybody has probably asked the Airbnb question in a variety of ways, but the study indicated that corporate or business related travel bookings on Airbnb increased like 143% from one quarter to the next this year, and my question is not just how much are we losing share because it gets very small at this point, but as you talk to your corporate customers, can you tell us anything about the adoption of hotel alternatives at the corporate level which I think that's what we're all trying to gauge? My follow-up to that would be that on a call last week, one of the REITs suggested that the brands are willing to renegotiate some of the occupancy thresholds for reimbursement of Rewards points in stays, and is it possible that that would have a incrementally positive impact on larger markets next year or whenever that happens?","Arne M. Sorenson","I'm not sure if I totally understand what the second point was. Obviously let me talk about that first and I'll get to Airbnb and the sharing economy. When you look at redemption rate, so that is Marriott Rewards or our competitor's equivalent members ultimately cashing in their points for free stays at hotels, there are a number of complexities in the way those redemption rates work. They vary a little bit I think from company to company but there are some trends which are important obviously in a rising rate market which we've had the last five or six years. I think many platforms have seen that the amount of points that are needed to redeem in a like for like hotel probably need to go up a little bit because the rates have gone up and therefore the cash that needs to be distributed from the program to the hotel owner where the redemption occurred needs to be a bit higher.","The other thing is, you've got different levels of redemption depending on the occupancy at a hotel. So the theory has been, if that redemption is displacing likely rack rate guest that would be available from the open market to pay for that room, the hotel owner ought to get a bit more than if the hotel was relatively empty and had rooms that were going to go down dark over the course of the night.","We have changed some of those formulas in part because we saw that there was a little bit too much sort of internal gaming in the system and we wanted to make sure that we were benefiting our customers as well as giving fair compensation to our hotel owners. And so there is some conversation around the fine points of that.","I don't expect changes that will be implemented further will likely be material in responding to something like the sharing economy. Obviously we are totally committed to making the Rewards program continue to be the strongest and most preferred loyalty program in the industry and that is about delivering value to our customers which we're going to continue to do but we want to make sure we do that in the way that our hotel owning partners understand to get the benefit of that.","When you get to the sharing economy, I think you look at the increase quarter over quarter or year-over-year in business travel. To some extent that is still the law of small numbers. Overwhelmingly in this space you're talking about leisure travel, overwhelmingly you're talking about travel which is at relatively lower rates than would be available in a traditional hotel. And so while there are some business travelers, probably particularly younger business travelers who use these kinds of platforms for their business travel, they are still the exception rather than the rule.","There's a lot we don't know for certainty and we'll watch, see the way this develops. Airbnb obviously gets a lot of attention for a reason. They've grown quite quickly and I think in many respects they are sort of a captivating idea. On the positive side we think it's quite good that Airbnb seems to be drawing travelers into the traveling marketplace sooner than they might otherwise be doing based on cost and that's partly a generational thing, that's partly a wealth demographic thing, but we are seeing more and more travelers hit the road both in the United States and around the world and that's a good thing and we think ultimately they are likely in some meaningful percentages to stay not just at Airbnb facilities but to stay in traditional hotels and we'll obviously compete to get as many of those as we can.","When we listen to our special corporate and significant corporate customers, I think usually what we hear is that they would like to make sure that their people when they're traveling are taken care of and that the risk profile is acceptable to them, and there are attractive features of hotels when it comes to those kinds of considerations, whether that be life safety issues, whether that be security issues, whether that's simply the ability to find their people.","I think there are some though where folks say, okay, actually if we can save money on this and if our people want it, maybe we'll do some event and so that's why you start to see some of his year-over-year growth. And again, we'll watch it, we don't think it's a significant factor in terms of impacting our business today and are optimistic that it won't become one but we'll have to watch it and see.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Greff with J. P. Morgan.","Joseph Greff","I have two questions. You mentioned your 2016 EBITDA guidance came down primarily because of the Seoul and the Hong Kong hotels as well as an incremental adverse FX, so does that imply in the second half that your U.S. fees or U.S. related EBITDA relative to three months ago is actually flat to up?","Arne M. Sorenson","It would be flattish, it might be down a tad, but not in terms of different expectations. Obviously we came in today with RevPAR numbers which are what right about at the bottom quarter of the guidance we gave you a quarter ago for Q2. So we said 5% to 7% and we ended up at 5.4% or 5.3% depending on which measure you're looking at. So that has some impact on the numbers but it's really not significant. That's why we say the expectations are essentially the same.","Carl T. Berquist","And you know when you look at the percentage of the total EBITDA, it was more fine-tuning for those kind of things than anything else, Joe.","Joseph Greff","Okay. And then on the capital return front, you obviously bought back more stock in the quarter than in recent quarters and you obviously upped your at least capital return target to $2 billion plus, for you to mimic second half capital return equal to the first half, what would have to go right, would that just be a lot more asset recycling and things of that nature or how do you view potential for that in general?","Carl T. Berquist","I think the one thing you kind of look at in the first half, we recycled about $750 million worth of assets in the first half and we don't have that program for the second half. Our wagon is starting to go a little [indiscernible] on assets to sell and to recycle. So I think it would be difficult to have that same level during the second half relative to what we did in the first half.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Shaun Kelley","Arne, we've heard some of the bigger owners in this space to start to talk a little bit I think more aggressively about transitioning some of their hotels from managed to franchise and I'm just curious sitting there as the manager or the brand manager of a number of these types of hotels, not to get into any one specific, but does this have a big impact to Marriott in as much that you guys kind of worry about as you kind of see those transitionings occurring in your portfolio or are you pretty agnostic to those types of changes?","Arne M. Sorenson","Both, I mean I think we are hopefully a great manager and also a great franchisor, and so we want to make sure we're growing in both sides of this business and we want to make sure that we're doing the right thing with our partners, both owners of managed hotels and owners of franchised hotels. It's an interesting dynamic and you hear lots of explanations for what's going on here.","I actually think when you do the hard work and look at the performance of an individual hotel, really because our operating team in the United States has done a fabulous job in both driving top line performance and getting better and better in terms of delivering that performance to the bottom-line, I don't think usually this is about a short-term effort to drive better cash flow at the hotel, the conversion from managed to franchised. I think it is overwhelmingly about the recognition that there are more buyers of hotels that have flexibility to choose an operator than there are for hotels that are subject to long-term management contracts.","Why? Because there are great franchise operators in this business, the best of whom are our partners, who really are looking only at buying hotels that they can operate themselves and those folks become potential buyers of hotels if they have the flexibility to manage them themselves and if that flexibility doesn't exist they won't be interested in looking at it. And so opening up that pool of buyers I think is the biggest reason that most of these changes have happened.","We still get good fees. In fact, if we're not in incentive fees on a managed hotel, our fees tend to go up if they convert to franchised as opposed to managed. That can be a positive. The other thing that can be a positive is often with a change of ownership in a hotel, renovation will be accelerated, and so that's likely to bring hotel to brand standard faster than maybe the normal renovation cycle would be.","So those are a lot of factors that go into this. It is not cataclysmic to us either way but we do want to make sure that we are as good a manager as we possibly can be, and attractive to the folks who are interested in looking for a third party manager of their hotels.","Shaun Kelley","Great, thanks for the color. And my follow-up is just to kind of hit on the capital return theme which has been discussed, but I guess to ask it more directly, I guess first to Carl, do you think you pulled forward kind of any of the repurchases for your pattern throughout the year in terms of this year? And then I guess bigger picture, is there room next year to kind of duplicate a number that's around this size when you think about what you're going to have in terms of cash flow?","Carl T. Berquist","We're not prepared yet to talk about 2016 and capital returns, but I think there are a couple of things to look out. One is, as we talked earlier about our leverage ratio of 3x debt-to-EBITDA or adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA, we can go up a little bit, down a little bit, and that gives you a little flexibility in the model to buy back more stock so to speak and get more aggressive now. As of the end of the second quarter, we actually came in a little under the 3x. So you could say we had a little capacity at the end of the second quarter on that.","I think that the other item is just how much we can recycle when it comes to what assets are up for sale, and like I said, we've had a good recycling here in the first half of the year and in fact all of 2015 will be a healthy period of asset recycling. I guess what I would say is, kind of take a look at our Investor Conference where we looked out and said, what will we be returning over the next three or four years and how that's tracking relative to where we are with RevPAR and the asset and what we've done. I think it was $6 billion to $8 billion over that time period, over four year period, $6 billion to $8 billion, so pretty healthy shareholder return.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Loeb with Baird.","David Loeb","You've covered a lot of the really important topics but I want to drill down into another one, Arne, if you don't mind. With Moxy, I assume Moxy is going to be month a new build brand. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape in the development area for the low rent, cal it up or midscale, and below brand? Hilton has announced that they're going to have a new brand. And it seems like development results from other franchise oriented companies have been fairly poor. Can you just talk about how you see the competitive landscape and how you see the return profile for developers, like what will the cost per room be and how will they generate returns relative to building a Courtyard or Residence or Fairfield?","Arne M. Sorenson","Moxy is interesting. Obviously we started it in Europe with our partners at Inter IKEA who with one of our European franchisees worked on us for a period of time and basically convinced us and made us disciples really of this notion that the economy segment in Europe ought to be reinvented. You look across that landscape in Europe, there were 2 million rooms in that segment and if you experienced any of those rooms it seemed like the product was trying to tell you, you didn't pay a lot for your room so don't expect much. And we thought with Moxy we could do something which was deliver considerable value to the customers, used great technology to cost-effectively build this product and therefore drive great return for our owners.","It was something which was fun and people would talk about. Now we've got only one open so far in Europe at Malpensa in Milan. It's doing great, customer response has been fabulous, and we've got a pipeline in Europe of nearing 50 I think, maybe 40 to 50 Moxy hotels.","We then had our franchisees in the United States looking at this, sort of understanding what it was and with them decided to launch it here earlier this year. We've now got 40 in our \u2013 excuse me, we've got about 15 signed but we've got a number of a few dozen behind them that we're talking to our partners about in the North American market.","And what we're seeing is that there really is nothing like this brand in the U.S. It is lifestyle, it is economy, it will be mostly new build, it will be mostly urban, this is intended to be a lifestyle product, it is not intended to be simply another economy brand that we would roll across in tertiary markets across the United States. And I think that makes it quite different from anything that exists out there. Obviously we can't speak about what our competitors are talking about maybe doing in the future because we haven't seen really any definition around them.","David Loeb","Do you think there's room to reinvent economy in the U.S.?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think Moxy in a sense will do that, although again it would be more of an urban application. I think \u2013 I don't know, David, that's not really fundamentally what we're trying to do with Moxy. I think the Moxy experience we have in mind will depend a bit on an urban community and environment that can enliven that product, and when you get to a sort of tertiary market, that's a harder trick to pull off or maybe almost impossible in some respects.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","You started off your prepared remarks just talking about kind of the supply environment and lodging industry and you said that STR doesn't expect supply to kind of come close to long-term average growth until 2017. We have good visibility into 2015 and 2016, I mean there are a number of forecasts, but do you guys have a sense of what supply growth will be in 2017ko based off of your data and your analysis of the industry?","Arne M. Sorenson","Let us start by confessing that Smith Travel and Lodging Econometrics data is better than ours. We do our best obviously to track our pipeline. We don't have people out there looking at who's pulling building permits from our competitors and trying to assess what's happening in that space. So our efforts rely to a meaningful extent on those folks who are trying to do that work both Lodging Econometrics and STR, and then in some to some extent extrapolating some judgment about what we're seeing through our system, but we do not have a secret crystal ball that we're prohibiting you from looking into.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity.","Ryan Meliker","Most of my questions have been answered but I just wanted to ask real quickly with regards to Airbnb because that continues to be a recurring topic in conversations with investors. Obviously business travel is a big component of your business. Airbnb is now trying to get into that space and grow it. As you talk to your corporate travel managers, where do they put the priority on security, is that like number one cost of entry or is that something that they just kind of take for granted or don't even think about, that would be helpful?","Arne M. Sorenson","Corporate customers are I suppose in many respects as different from any other kind of customers and so you hear different priorities from different places. We have big and really important corporate customers for whom security for their people is the primary feature. We have some for whom the primary feature is cost. I would think, sort of guessing, we haven't done, at least not that I'm aware of, a survey of every corporate client. It might be something that would be worth doing, but I would think that security and productivity concerns, predictability concerns would all rank quite high for the typical corporate customer of size.","Ryan Meliker","Okay, that's really helpful. And have you had conversations with your corporate customers with regards to Airbnb and is that a topic that continues to come up?","Arne M. Sorenson","Of course and my answers have been influenced by those conversations.","Ryan Meliker","Wonderful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Rennardson with Jefferies.","Ian Rennardson","Coming back to the supply situation, if I look at the STR data, I'm slightly confused about what you were saying earlier, Arne, about the geographic dispersion of that supply growth because the latest text from STR to me looks like that 15 of the top 25 markets are looking at supply over 3% of rooms under construction and 21 of the top 25 have got over 2% of existing supply under-construction. So I'd just like you to square the circle for me please.","Arne M. Sorenson","The data we have is probably not inconsistent with that. About 55% of the rooms were in the secondary and tertiary markets or outside the top 25 is probably the best phrase to use. That means that 45% of the rooms obviously are in those top 25 markets. When we look at our top 25 fee producing markets in the United States, there are less than a handful where we see supply growth that looks like it's in excess of numbers that we should be concerned about. It won't surprise you that New York is on the top of that list.","Operator","Our next question is from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Within Delta, it looks like you guys are off to a pretty strong start with that brand. You mentioned 50 potential conversions. Are any of these Marriott hotels and are you targeting specific competitor brands?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think of the 50, I can't tell you for a certainty that there are zero Marriott hotels, but I think the answer tends towards zero. I think these are requests that have come in from our partners with conversion candidates from other brands. We're not sort of specifically sitting here and saying we're going to identify competitor's brand and go after that one, but I suspect as we see what ultimately happens here, we will be able to reach some conclusions about which brands are the best times for us to be efficient in and we'll communicate that with you when it becomes more of a reality.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then you mentioned some of the competition was increasing their I guess competition for trying to get unit growth. Are you more concerned about the economic terms of new deals or just the non-economic terms?","Arne M. Sorenson","We're concerned about both but very much to include the economic terms. Again, this is anecdotal. We have no ability to get insight into what our competitors are ultimately negotiating other than what our partners tell us they may be hearing and it won't surprise you that if what our partners tell us comes up in the context of a negotiation there is always some bias to exaggerate the great terms that might be offered by somebody else.","But having said that, anecdotally we see that some of the terms that have been put out there are deals that cannot create value in any traditional sense when you look at the cost capital or you look at the cost associated with adding a hotel to a system, and seem to be driven by a desire simply to add rooms.","Operator","Our final question comes from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research.","Vince Ciepiel","Just one here on group, could you add some additional color there, sounds like you guys have done a good job improving 3Q from down 2 to up 3 and 4Q kind of has seen a little bit of a contrary move but it sounds like it's due to last-minute bookings kind of being reduced, so what's going on with the booking curve in group and how do you see that kind of 7% figure for 2016 evolving over the next maybe 6 to 12 months?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think the group data is without exception encouraging. I think those numbers that you ticked through, they each have a little bit of a story obviously to \u2013 in the abstract it doesn't sound like plus 3 in group booking for Q3 is something to write home about, but given the way the holidays work in the quarter, given that it's a seasonally weak corporate group quarter except for the month of September, and given where we came from, we think it's come along well and we're pleased with the way it's moved.","The fourth quarter numbers I wouldn't view as being concerning in any respect. The prepared remarks were really only meant to communicate that the 9% growth we've got on the books at the end of the second quarter for Q4, our guess is will not hold only because occupancies are high and therefore we won't have the space to take as much short-term bookings as we took last year.","And I suspect as we get into 2016, we'll see some of the same dynamics. I suspect we'll start 2016 with relatively more of the full year group business on the books at the 1st of the year than we started 2015 for, and what that suggests \u2013 I wish I had data for you, I don't at our fingertips, I don't know Laura or Carl whether you do, but undoubtedly we're seeing the booking window lengthen for group business, and we'll make sure a quarter from now we get some specific data out there to help you people understand how that window is lengthening.","That's one reason I think you look at this statistic of bookings in a quarter for all future periods. That's a way of thinking about \u2013 it's sort of neutral in a sense to the length of the booking window, and that was that 8% figure for Q2 of 2015.","Vince Ciepiel","Great. And just following up on that, you mentioned 55% booked. Is that similar to where you were last year, and then maybe that 7% figure, how much is kind of rate versus rooms?","Arne M. Sorenson","I don't know off the top of my head about 55's comparison to last year but I would almost guarantee you it's higher now than a year ago. In other words, that our booking window is lengthening, so we've got a bit more business on the books today for 2016 than we did a year ago for 2015. When you look at the 7% plus revenue, I think we're about 50-50 room nights and rate contribution for 2016.","Vince Ciepiel","Great. Thanks very much.","Arne M. Sorenson","Okay, any other questions?","Operator","No, sir, there are no further questions.","Arne M. Sorenson","Alright, we've exhausted you all. Thank you for your time this morning and for your interest in Marriott. Get on the road and come stay with us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining the Marriott International 2015 Second Quarter Earnings Call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions].","Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Arne Sorenson, President and CEO of Marriott International.","Arne Sorenson","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President Investor Relations and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director Investor Relations.","Before we get started, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today July 28, 2016 and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","The big news this year for Marriott is the Starwood Acquisition. As you know we have received all of the necessary regulatory clearances throughout the world with the exception of China. We are in the second phase of China review and we have been working cooperatively with the regulatory authorities. Phase 2 review ends on August 9. We remain optimistic that we will receive clearance from China and will complete the transaction in the coming weeks.","Before we move to specifics, let me make three observations about our results in the quarter. First, you will not be surprised that U.S. economic growth has been slower than we anticipated when the year began. In fact over the last three quarters, room sales of our nearly 300 largest corporate customers have gradually weakened from 4% growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter to 2% in the first quarter and less than 1% in the second quarter.","Fortunately group business remains strong and discounted leisure business has picked up the slack. With half of the year complete our second half North America REVPAR guidance assumes economic growth remains on the same slow pace that we have seen year-to-date.","Second, with the stronger dollar we are seeing fewer international guests coming to our U.S. hotels. With the impact most pronounced in a few key gateway markets. We estimate the number of room nights occupied by international guests at comparable hotels in New York and Miami declined by 10% to 15% in the second quarter.","For the U.S. as a whole, t he number of room nights from international guests in our hotels declined by roughly 3%. Third, specific regional issues have had a meaningful impact on REVPAR growth. Terrorism in Brussels, Paris and Istanbul, Zika in the Caribbean and Latin America, oil prices in Houston and oil prices and unrest in the Middle East to name a few.","Combining the headwinds from the economy foreign exchange and regional issues Marriott's worldwide; systemwide comparable hotel REVPAR increased 2.9% in the second quarter just below our guidance. We were pleased with this performance because despite the environment REVPAR index data shows that we are taking share. Our already high system wide worldwide REVPAR index increased 90 basis points year-to-date as we extended our lead over our competitive set.","We are also increasing our share of new development. Driven by the strength of our brands we are already the largest hotel company in the world. Our global system totaled nearly 780,000 rooms at the end of the second quarter and our worldwide pipeline increased to more than 285,000 rooms, nearly 15% higher than the year ago quarter.","In 2016 we expect our worldwide distribution not including Starwood will increase by roughly 7.5% gross or 6.5% net. According to SER [ph] well Marriott has 11% of open rooms in the U.S. today. We have been selected to manage or franchise 30% of the rooms currently under construction, more than any other hotel brand company.","Our large pipeline is particularly impressive given today\u2019s financing environment. New rules requiring banks to carry higher capital reserves have constrained lending, causing lender to be more selective on both refinancing and new hotel construction. This selectivity includes more conservative loan to value ratios, a bias towards smaller transactions and caution about concentrated exposures in individual markets. To our benefit, lenders continue to favor the strongest brand.","While our business is cyclical our cash flow is less sensitive than you might think. We estimate that one point of REVPAR worldwide over a full year moves our fee revenue by only about 1% or $25 million, and one point of REVPAR moves the net results of our owned and leased hotels by about $3 million.","Meaningful unit growth and low risk fee revenue yields terrific operating leverage. Our performance this quarter highlights the fact. Second quarter comparable worldwide actual dollar REVPAR increased 2.3%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% and adjusted EPS grew 18%.","Our business throws off outstanding cash flow. We may make investments from time to time for particularly attractive management or franchise agreements on high value of hotels, we also buy and build great brands and businesses, we\u2019ve added five brands in as many years and the pending Starwood transaction will add another 11 brands. But if we can\u2019t find an attractive investment we return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Over the past five years we have returned nearly $7.5 billion to shareholders, repurchasing nearly 130 million shares at an average price of $49 per share. We remain committed to minimizing owned assets and maximizing returns to shareholders. Our pre tax return on invested capital was 50% in the second quarter.","Before I turn things over to Leeny, I\u2019d like to say I am incredibly impressed with the people at Starwood. Despite the disruption and uncertainty they have experienced over the last 15 months, the Starwood team has done a great job, acceralating their development pipeline, spinning off Vistana, launching new marketing initiatives and opening nearly 125 hotels all the while also taking care of the guests and managing the everyday business. Thank you. I\u2019d also like to say that I have never been more proud of Marriott associates; this team has done a lot of transactions over the last five years. From the spin-off at Marriott vacations worldwide in 2011 to the more recent acquisitions of AC hotels, Gaylord, Protea and Delta.","With each of these transactions Marriott associates worked hard to first execute the transaction and then capture the strategic value of the deal, all while growing and managing our existing business. The Starwood transaction should be completed in the coming weeks bringing these terrific teams together. Both the Marriott and Starwood teams have done exhaustive planning to get ready and we are excited by our prospects. While we will see a lot of progress in the near term we expect that full integration will be a two year project.","We are bullish about the power of the combined company. Starwood is known for its very strong brands, marketing knowhow and outstanding frequent traveler program. Marriott has a proven track record in creating and growing leading brands, improving underperforming brands and expanding distribution. The combination of Marriott and Starwood should bring even more including cost savings in G&A and hotel operations and revenue opportunities. We expect to accelerate the growth of Starwood\u2019s great brands and the ultimate combination of our rewards programs and Starwood preferred guests will create the most compelling frequent traveler program in the industry by far.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn things over to Leeny to talk more about our second quarter results. Leeny?","Leeny Oberg","Thanks Arne. In the second quarter we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.96, a 10% increase from the prior year. Adjusted for the Starwood transaction expenses, diluted earnings per share totaled $1.03 an 18% increase from the prior year. Adjusted EPS was about $0.04 to $0.05 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance, fees were about $0.02 to $0.03 below those expectations due to weaker than expected REVPAR and lower than expected franchise re-licensing fees.","Our owned, leased and other lines was about $0.01 shy of our expectations due to slightly lower than expected branding fees. G&A came in about $0.01 favorable to expectations. The joint venture line was $0.01 to $0.02 better than expected largely due to strong hotel performance.","Finally, our tax rate generated $0.05 to $0.06 of better than expected EPS due to some favorable discreet tax items. Worldwide constant dollar system wide REVPAR rose roughly 3%. For our company managed hotels, worldwide house [ph] profit margins increased 60 basis points.","In North America, company managed REVPAR rose 3.6% and house profit margins rose 100 basis points. House profit margins benefitted from productivity gains and lower energy costs. On a system wide basis, North America\u2019s system wide REVPAR rose 3.2% in the quarter with particular strength in Los Angeles, New Orleans and Atlanta.","Transient REVPAR rose 2% in the quarter as we maintained our occupancy by opening discount channel. Group REVPAR rose 7% and catering sales increased more than 5% in the quarter. Overall group cancellation rates remained normal and attendance at group meetings met our expectations. Group business continues to look solid for the second half of 2016 with system wide North America group revenue paced [ph] up 5% although the timing of holidays will influence quarterly comparison.","Third quarter system wide group revenue pace in North America is up 9% while fourth quarter pace is flat year-over-year. Encouragingly, 2017 group pace is up 7%. Outside North America, second quarter system wide comparable REVPAR rose 2% on a constant dollar basis or declined 1% using local currency. In Europe, constant dollar system wide REVPAR increased 3%. Germany\u2019s REVPAR rose 9% with strong group business REVPAR in Spain rose at double digit rate benefitting from a stronger economy and large number of guests that would have visited hotels in the Middle East in the past.","REVPAR in France, Belgium and Turkey remained very weak. System wide REVPAR in the Asia-Pacific region increased nearly 6%, South-Korea\u2019s REVPAR increased dramatically on easy comparison to last year\u2019s MERS outbreak. REVPAR in Greater China rose 3% with very strong results in Shanghai and Beijing and modest growth in Hong Kong. Economic growth increased REVPAR in India by 10% in the quarter.","We saw occupancy declines in the Caribbean and Latin America largely due to weak economic conditions and the impact of the Zika virus. Occupancy rates were also lower in the Middle East and Africa region due to the earlier start of Ramadan, oversupply in Dubai, ongoing political unrest in many countries and the lower price of oil.","Total fee revenue in the second quarter increased 4% with incentive fees up 16%. Base fees declined 3% due to a tough comparison to deferred fees recognized in the year ago quarter and unfavorable FX rate.","Franchise fees increased 6% despite 3 million less in lower like in -- in relicensing fees reflecting pure asset sales among our franchise communities.","Total incentive fees increased 16% with North America hotel incentive fees up 22%. Worldwide 64% of our managed hotels paid incentive fees in the quarter compared to 59% in the year ago quarter. In North America alone, 62% of managed hotels paid incentive fees compared to 55% in the year ago quarter.","Owned leased and other revenues net of direct expenses increased 20% in the quarter reflecting renovations at the Tokyo, Ritz-Carlton and the Renaissance Jaragua, somewhat offset by the sale of our St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton last year.","In addition, results reflect an easy comparison to last year\u2019s pre-opening cost for the New York addition hotel. Branding fees increased 14% with higher card holder sales from our co-branded credit card and higher sales of Ritz-Carlton residences.","Reported general and administrative costs increased 11% or 1% when adjusted for the $14 million of Starwood related transition and transaction cost in the second quarter. Reported operating margins totaled 10% for both the 2016 and 2015 quarters. Adjusting for cost reimbursement and Starwood transition and transaction costs, operating margins reached 53% in 2016 compared to 50% in the prior year in the second quarter.","Interest expense increased to $57 million in the second quarter, excluding the $11 million cost of a bridge facility commitment, adjusted interest expense totaled $46 million. In preparation for the upcoming transaction we raised $1.5 billion in senior unsecured debt during the second quarter. The 5.5 year and 10 year notes were priced at the lowest interest cost for comparable maturities in the company\u2019s history. These offerings increased our long term debt to $4.1 billion paid off our standing commercial paper balances and increased our cash and cash equivalent to nearly $700 million.","Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8% over the prior year and adjusted EBITDA margins totaled 65%. Making an EPS projection for 2016 is difficult. To assist the modelers, however we provided some P&L guidance for Marriott\u2019s legacy business for the next two quarters.","For the third quarter we expect worldwide system wide constant dollar REVPAR will increase 3% to 4% benefitting from the favorable holiday pattern and strong group bookings including the Olympics in Brazil.","Total fee revenue for the Marriott standalone business totaled $495 million to $500 million, 6% to 8% growth over the 2015 third quarter and adjusted EBITDA as expected to total $476 million to $481 million a 10% to 12% growth over the prior year.","For the fourth quarter, we expect worldwide system wide constant dollar REVPAR will moderate to a 2% to 3% increase reflecting tougher holiday comparisons in North America.","Total fee revenue for the Marriott standalone business could total $485 million to $490 million, a 7% to 8% growth over the 2015 fourth quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter is expected to total $461 million to $471 million, a 15% to 17% increase over the prior year. We expect worldwide system wide REVPAR will increase roughly 3% for the full year of 2016. Given our expected 6.5% worldwide net unit growth and modest increases in G&A we anticipate that our legacy business will generate roughly $1.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the full year, 10% more than in 2015. We expect incentive fees to grow at a mid-teen\u2019s rate.","Compared to our full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA forecast from last quarter, our current adjusted EBITDA outlook is $36 million lower at the midpoint with more modest REVPAR growth, some construction delays pushing hotel openings into early 2017 and fewer asset sales among our franchise community we\u2019ve reduced our fee outlook by $40 million including $10 million in lower franchise re-licensing fees.","Elsewhere on the P&L, we\u2019ve reduced our owned leased and other net forecast a bit due to some fine tuning of our branding fee estimate while our new forecast for G&A is about $10 million better than our prior forecast.","For the Marriott legacy business 2016 investments spending could total $450 million to $550 million including about $100 million in maintenance spending. Excluding Starwood, we anticipate recycling $200 million to $250 million through asset sales and loan repayments during 2016.","Given that transition and transaction costs are uncertain at this point, we are including these costs in our 2016 guidance but expect to break out such expenses as actual results are reported as we did this quarter.","Like you, we rely on Starwood\u2019s publicly disclosed forecast of their REVPAR growth, unit growth and adjusted EBITDA for their business. When the transaction closes, we expect to assume Starwood\u2019s outstanding debt issue roughly 136 million Marriott shares and increased net debt by roughly $3.5 billion for the cash component of the deal.","Given we and Starwood are still two separate companies, we can\u2019t comment on the pace of Starwood\u2019s asset sales in 2016. But with the completion of the transaction you can be sure we will focus very quickly on getting back to our targeted leverage level as quickly as possible.","With regard to future G&A spending, we expect to have our new organization largely in place by year end 2016, although some transition costs will carry over into 2017 and even a bit into 2018 as we integrate our systems and technology platforms.","We continue to believe we will achieve $250 million in steady state annual G&A savings. Once the transaction is complete, we will work to prepare 2015 and 2016 pro forma adjusted quarterly income statements to reflect the combination. These statements should be ready sometime this fall.","We believe the transaction will close in the coming weeks and now one more housekeeping matter for you. A typical schedule for declaring the third quarter dividend is immediately following our August board meeting scheduled this year for next week August 4. While we plan to pay a dividend in the third quarter, the announcement of the third quarter record and payment date made be delayed a bit until there is greater clarity around the actual transaction closing day.","We appreciate your patience as we work through these issues and particularly appreciate your interest in Marriott so that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Crystal will take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry Curtis","Hi, good morning, everyone. Arne your comments about the sequential trend in the economy were reasonably downbeat yet your level of confidence seems to be pretty strong relative to the second half and your forward bookings in group for next year are fairly decent. What gives you the confidence that it actually won't get worse from here because history does tell us that it has got a reasonable shot at getting worse?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, well good morning Harry. Obviously the strength of the economy is the biggest question I think in terms of forecasting how we are likely to perform in the coming quarters. And to some extent is the place maybe you can see this up a little bit over the second quarter. I think as we guided a quarter ago we have an overly rosy view about the strength of GDP in the United States particularly and as a consequence we continue to stick with our 3% to 5% REVPAR for the full year that we have provided at the beginning of the year.","I think today we have obviously experienced actual second quarter number which came in essentially right at the low end of our guidance in the United States and a little bit below the end globally when you factor in some of what\u2019s happening around the world. And that I think is fundamentally a reflection of lower GDP growth in the United States that wont\u2019 be anticipated.","But it is still positive GDP growth, I think to some extent the question you and we could ask of ourselves is we what more solid, more confident in the kind of guidance we are giving today than what we gave a quarter ago. And I think the best answer to that is that we now are making forecast based on essentially the current face of GDP growth in the United States which is weak not on a more rosy scenario.","Is it possible the U.S. economy performs worse than that, of course it is. But when you look at the range of economic data that comes out including recent employment reports and consumer confidence reports and corporate profits and some of those sorts of things, it looks to us like it\u2019s a reasonable good bet that the economy will continue to grow, albeit grow maybe somewhat anemically. And there does not appear to be data out there which would suggest that it is getting meaningfully weaker from a GDP perspective. But that is the question that continues to keep your eye on.","Harry Curtis","Thank you. And my follow-up question is how quickly do you think you can get to your target leverage ratio? And the reason I ask that is at that point you'll be generating some substantial free cash flow and if you could give us your thoughts on possibly taking the dividend up which investors seem to be paying more or attaching more value through these days?","Leeny Oberg","Thanks, Harry. As we said \u2013 as I said in my comments we'll obviously as soon as we get going with this transaction and close we'll be working on driving that leverage ratio down to our targeted levels of 3 to 3.25 as quickly as possible. I think as well and I think I would fully expect that we would be engaging in share repurchase and enjoying the flexibility that provides as we kind of move forward.","We always will continue to look at dividend, but for the moment we are comfortable with our 30%, roughly 30% payout ratio and would expect that once we get the target leverage ratios down to the levels that we'd like that we would begin being back in the market for share repurchase.","Harry Curtis","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley","Great. Thanks. I'm curious about the decline in the gross room additions for 2016. I guess, it was down about 50 basis, but I guess just given that we're halfway through year it seems like a lot of those projects would have been just sort of months from opening. So I'm just wondering how that supply could come down so close to when those additions were expected to hit?","Arne Sorenson","Yes. I think it\u2019s good question Robin, and good morning. As we put out in the press release and the prepared remarks we have seen really some construction pace expand. And I would think about Europe and North America has been primarily examples of that. And that is about construction workers and supply and to some extent maybe a little bit about how essential it is to get open instantly.","And I think in some respects that in a somewhat weaker market, somewhat more anxious market that allowing the construction to take a little longer is a rational thing that some of our partners are doing. And as a consequence we see that the construction pace has expanding just a little bit. We are not seeing cancellations of projects however and I think generally what we're talking about is projects that formally we would have expected to open probably in the fourth quarter of the year opening some time in 2017.","We've looked really hard at the incoming deals in our development pipeline, and I think we've been pleasantly surprised to see that new signings in most regions of the world are comparable if not up a little bit compared to gangbuster year we had in 2015, including new deal signed in North America. And so we feel that actually it shows continued strong interest in growing with our brands and is not really a fundamental change, but is a bit of fine tuning on whether we open before or after New Year's Eve.","Robin Farley","Okay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up. I'm just curious that your guidance for the full year being now at kind of a single point at that plus 3%, typically you give a range maybe early in the year is that sort of 200 basis points spread that, but even closing in on the year maybe 100 basis points spread. I guess just given the increase kind of uncertainty and visibility, I'm just curious why go with a more narrow range when maybe your visibility would theoretically be a little bit worst?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, it\u2019s a good question. We of course talked about that. And often we start the year with the two point range and I think fairly if you look back over the number of years we've been doing this, we probably keep a two point range longer than we should as the year progresses. We talk about two point range here that's the fact of the matter is to have a two point range at this stage of the year implies on the low end a much, much worst potential performance than we think is even potential.","And on the high end in many respects requires us to envision a performance that is more optimistic than we think is really probable. And so, as we went through this and you can see obviously we give out four [ph] point range in our guidance for Q3 and then again for Q4. To some extend you can do the math and see how that impact, in the sense you could say that our roughly three is kind of like a 2.5 to 3.5 which would be the more normal range to look at. But we think we should be fairly close to three as the year comes in based on group and our present expectations about GDP growth.","Robin Farley","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Joseph Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff","Good morning, guys.","Arne Sorenson","Hi, Joe.","Leeny Oberg","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Greff","Just a question on the timing or how you're thinking about the timing of accelerating your capital return, I think a quarter ago you mentioned that maybe share buyback can resume at some point in the fourth quarter. Are you still thinking along the same lines? And then just in terms of the capital return and accelerating that how contingent is that on Starwood owned hotel asset dispositions?","Leeny Oberg","Great. Thanks Joe. So, obviously we would have loved to have been closed by now in terms of having this call. And as you move through the year, the later and later the close you get the harder it is to know exactly where we will be three months from now or four months from now given we haven't closed yet. We \u2013 I'm not going to pertain to know all the details about exactly where every transaction is on the asset sales side with Starwood and so we will need to get in there as soon as the assets \u2013 as soon as the deal closes and evaluate exactly where it is.","I think we do continue to feel very comfortable that as quickly as we can we will be back in the market and whether that frankly happens to be towards the end of the Q4, the beginning of Q1 does depend to some extend on exactly which deals close in the fourth quarter and first quarter. But I think give or take a few months I think we see it exactly the same place we did before. It just again, we don't have specific visibility on exact timing of the closing of asset sales.","And to get from where as we said before we would expect to be somewhere in the ballpark of 3.6 [ph] and then want to get down to 3 to 3.25 and if we don't close until sometime in August to get there by the end of Q4 definitely depends on the some asset sales. So, we'll be updating you as quickly as we can.","Joseph Greff","Great. Thank you. And just a follow-up on the question regarding some of the delays in these project openings, Arne, would you characterize those delays has been driven more by economic uncertainty or do you talk workers and things like that, can you sort of help understand or amplify that please?","Arne Sorenson","Yes. And remember this is the collective of decisions that are being made by our partners in many respects not by us. But I would say that it is probably in the U.S. more about construction pace and the level of construction that's going on around the country. I think in somewhere like the Middle East and Africa it's probably a little bit more about the sense that the market essentially that you don't need to rush to get it done. But they continue to move forward with it. I really don't think it is a significant or cataclysmic change.","Joseph Greff","Good enough. Thank you.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Thanks. I'll start with a bit of a housekeeping question, just you had mentioned that you're expecting the Phase 2 of the review in China to be complete by August. Is that it or is there another phase?","Arne Sorenson","Well, the Chinese government does have the ability to take deals into a Phase 3, and obviously we can't speak for the Chinese government and have no regard for the fact that they've got to run their process in a way that meets with their needs. Having said that, we obviously are in communication with the staff over there, we've provided very, very significant amounts of information over the course for the last six or eight months something like that. And believe that the information that they need they have in hand and based on what we hear we are optimistic again that we should be done in the next few weeks.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Getting to larger picture questions, I was just wondering, Arne, you talked about and you clarified in some earlier comments about how you revised your view \u2013 how you're using GDP to generate your guidance going forward and that was helpful. So kind of in light of that as you look towards the second half of the year and given what is going on in business transient demand and in just in the corporate world. I was just wondering what level of business transient demand you're factoring into the guidance for the second half?","Arne Sorenson","Yes. I'm not sure if I'm going to answer that, off top of my head. I think that the kind of pace we saw in the second quarter is more or less what we'd expect to take place over the balance of the year with one significant clarification. And that is in part because of calendar timing and in part simply because of the rhythms of group business, group is meaningful stronger in Q3 than in Q4. Plus 10-ish in Q3 and a flattish in Q4, obviously that puts us around plus five for the second half for the year as a whole.","And so, I would expect that we will see a group B when you combined those two quarters a more powerful driver of RevPAR growth than a transient business, transient of course includes both corporate travel mostly during the week and leisure travel mostly during the week-end. We would continue to expect that leisure travel is going to be stronger than business travel. And that business travel will be kind of flattish maybe up a point \u2013 point or two depending on the way things go.","I think if you wanted to be optimistic you might say that we're bearing some of the consequences of the incredibly pessimistic mood that corporate had as 2016 begin, think about our perspectives in the first quarter. And that's maybe a little bit of a lingering impact and if there is because of the economic data that's coming out or corporate profits or other things, a little bit less anxiety going forward, maybe we could see that improve a little bit. But again we're essentially forecasting that kind of steady state, weak corporate transient demand, not falling off a cliff in any respect but just sort of continuing to bump along.","Felicia Hendrix","And then just to kind of understand on the leisure side, what we're looking at for the second half, I was just wondering how leisure transient grew in the first half and also how that compared to last year?","Arne Sorenson","Leisure transient, so let's see here, we've got a whole bunch of quarters in front for us, I mean, just make sure we're getting this right. We're probably leisure transient year to-date in the four-ish range something like 4% growth year-over-year. When you look at \u2013 so I guess that gives you a comparison to last year as well.","Felicia Hendrix","What about for all of that, like for all of last year, how does that? How did that grow?","Arne Sorenson","You mean last year compared to 2014?","Felicia Hendrix","No. I just mean how that leisure transient grew -- yes, how that leisure \u2013 what was the leisure transient growth last year?","Arne Sorenson","We should make sure we get that for you accurately.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay.","Leeny Oberg","Give me a call back and we'll see if we can pull back together.","Arne Sorenson","I think 4% is the number you can be fairly clear about now. Year to-date, first half of the year about 4% leisure growth.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. That's helpful. And just one last quickie. Some of the companies that have reported so far as has said that they are looking or they're seeing weaker short-term group bookings, I mean, you gave us a lot of data on your group business and the pace and stuff and that's helpful. Just wondering if you've seen any difference between kind of small group versus large groups, or you're seeing any kind of difference in demand?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, we do. Interestingly from months to months sometimes by size that the data moves around, so we've seen bigger groups probably strongest but it does vary a little bit month to month. I think there is a piece of as though which is about availability. We've got really quite please to see occupancy continue to grow in Q2 delivering roughly half of our RevPAR growth. Our hotels are quite busy and we have clearly seen the booking window expand which is certainly one of the factors that would be impacting in the year for the year group bookings.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Thank you. Very helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Sean Kelly with Bank of America.","Sean Kelly","Hi, good morning. Arne, just looking back through the very opening comments you talked about some of the commentary and the trends from some of your largest corporate customers. I was curious as you see that trend unfolding is there any \u2013 are there any greenshoots that you guys are getting maybe anecdotally for many of those conversations as we start to lap some of things that oil and gas and some of the other things that maybe bringing down the broader corporate sector. I mean, anything people are talking about that probably isn't factoring in the GDP yet but that give you signs of encouragement?","Arne Sorenson","No. I mean, I think the \u2013 still I think you look at the economic data, corporate profits and GDP growth will be the best indication to Europe where we think where that should go. Greenshoots, I don't know, I guess I sort of hesitate to use that phrase anywhere, but not surprisingly though when you look underneath averages you'll see relatively greater strength in the tech world than you will see to pick the other extreme in the oil patch.","And Houston I think was down 10% if I remember right RevPAR in Q2, which is 10% of the oil patch in the United States obviously. And I think that's driven by bad aspect of our economy. The comparisons will get easier for oil certainly as the year ago along. I'm not sure that that means any of them will view business has been robust though in a way that causes them to get back to the level of activity that they might have had two years ago something like that.","It does maybe mean that it shouldn't continue. It shouldn't decline from here I suppose that might be an optimistic way of thinking about it. But again, I think looking at corporate profits and GDP growth those are going to be the best things that drive the averages as a whole.","Sean Kelly","That's helpful. And then, this one maybe a little bit specific, but just thinking about the sequential pattern as things unfold with all the shifts in the third quarter, could you give us a directional sense of due you expect RevPAR to improve as we move throughout the third quarter or the opposite, just sort of what you're kind of anticipation of how 3Q shapes up on monthly perspective?","Arne Sorenson","I think we believe August and September will be stronger than July.","Sean Kelly","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity.","Ryan Meliker","Hey. Just I was hoping you guys could give us a little color on how things are progressing with your member pricing initiative. I know it wasn't in your prepared remarks but are you gaining any traction in terms of stealing customers away from the OTAs, growing your loyalty program platform? And then also any impact in the short term that's having on your RevPAR growth outlook over the back half of the year by offering the discounts?","Arne Sorenson","All good questions. Thank you. We are \u2013 I know one of our principal competitors talk about this yesterday in their call. They were a couple of months, maybe three months ahead of us particularly in the marketing of their programs, but their data is got a few months head start for us. But I think what we're seeing in our Marriott Rewards Member only rate is very encouraging.","We continue to see a strong year-over-year growth in Marriott Rewards Signups. We see that occupancy contribution from the rewards program is in the high 50% of contribution to the hotels. We see strong growth in apps download and Marriott.com business and mobile bookings and all those things. So, we're encouraged by that. It has had a modest impact, we think on RevPAR in Q2 probably in the 30 to 40 basis point range on reported RevPAR, which in a sense you could look at and say that is a negative impact of it. But this is a long term question for us.","And really what we want to make sure we're doing is communicating clearly to Marriott Rewards Members that will have value because we know them and because they have loyalty to us and make it clear crystal clear, sometime contrary to the advertising or perception that's out there in the market, but make it crystal clear that the rates through our channels are at least just good if not better than the rates that available anywhere else.","And obviously if that drives a meaningful share shift towards our channels that's a good thing and that's the bet we're making and we think it\u2019s good bet. ","Ryan Meliker","Thank you. That is helpful. I understand the long-term benefits of this and I would never question that. I'm just trying to understand kind of what is built into your guidance. You mentioned 30 to 40 bps of RevPAR headwind in the second quarter. Are you building that type of RevPAR headwind into the back half of the year as well as this program continues to ramp? Maybe a little bit more as the program continues to ramp? How are you thinking about that?","Arne Sorenson","I wouldn't think it\u2019s going to get any worst, but it is reflected in our guidance.","Ryan Meliker","All right, that's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Hey good morning. So you cut your G&A guidance for the year just I mean you have been very good in the past about streamlining cost I guess two questions one would be at what point or what level of REVPAR do you think you would need to make more drastic cuts and then two, how much kind of dry powder how much do you think you can cut there. Thanks.","Leeny Oberg","Well, so let's take both of those. So first of all just in general you are seeing good solid cost controls. You are watching the company do what it should do in a modest growth environment which is being very careful to look with adding positions and the reality is as we prepare for Starwood, I think we definitely have been keeping a very close eye knowing that we are going to be able to have great efficiencies by joining up with Starwood and so really not just kind of adding necessarily before the merger where we have an opportunity to do it afterwards and do it in combination with the reorganization of how we want to run the company on a combined basis.","So I think overall these are good solid the $10 million that you have seen is the what I would call a permanent sort of solid reduction in G&A relative to cost controls and I don't think we are imagining that there is with the current standalone Marriott business that we would be imagining that we are looking at an environment of needing to do a wholesale reorganization. We do continue to think that they are fantastic synergies related to the combination which as you\u2019ve heard, we are still confident that the 250 million of steady state savings in the combined company is achievable.","Thomas Allen","Helpful. Thank you and then just as my follow-up you mentioned earlier that you hadn't seen any pick up in cancellations rates on the group business. I am wondering if what you are seeing on the trends inside what level of cancellations rates do you typically see and how is that been trending? Thank you.","Arne Sorenson","I am not sure I can answer the first part of that question. But the second part it's there about the same. We did make a change a year and half ago on our cancellations window so typical business would be until roughly the first of 15 or I can double check the calendar on this whether I am remembering it right but I think roughly the first of 2015 we began to require cancellations 24 hours before stay in other words the day before the check-in date. Prior to that time you could cancel up to 6 PM on the day of the stay. And that has obviously reduced cancellations in the last 24 hour period. But when you look after that time and look at cancellations day before 2-3 days before we are not really seeing the material change from what we have experienced previously.","Leeny Oberg","That occurred in February 2015.","Arne Sorenson","February 2015.","Thomas Allen","Helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey Donnelly","Good morning guys. Actually on the topic Arne, you experienced with those trends that you see positive or negative in group cancellations attrition in the year pace or can I hear on the coal mine that have called accurately for shadows future trends or do you find it's something unreliable indicator given your experience?","Arne Sorenson","It's a good question. There is certainly in the group space if you have got a shrinkage that is recurring sort of real time so that groups are showing up with meaningfully lower number than what they anticipated before that could be a warning that group participants or the companies sponsoring groups are less bullish about things than they were when the reservation group booking was first made.","But again, we haven't really seen movement in that. So there is not data there that would tell us be where because of that in fact you can tell from our comments about group, group is one of those things that we look at that give us some solidity in our point of view about the future and the group attendance has been good and food and beverage spending has been good and so we that's sort of reassuring. It's a good question around transient cancellations again I don't think we have seen the shift there but I don't I can't tell you whether in prior cycles that would be a canary in the coal mine my guess is it's not very much because corporate transient business is booked so short before the stay that actually it doesn't show up so much in cancellations but probably just shows up in the booking itself.","Jeffrey Donnelly","Okay and maybe the follow-up in the perhaps this is for Leeny around the integration I recognize you probably got plan for all aspects of the Marriott integration but where in your mind do you think you are going to say some of the highest hurdles in the integration. Is it technology, is it branding and marketing, is it guest loyalty and maybe it's follow-up just so we can have our expectations that one to two years from now should we expect this will leave you guys to sort of a new state of the art technology system or you sort of more focused on just patching existing systems together?","Leeny Oberg","Very good question. So couple of things, I would say we are still in the lands where we don't have kind of open sesame into all the information. So full knowledge about exactly how we are thinking about some of these technological platforms and merging them and what we will choose and exactly how we will do it remains to be seen. I think we continue to believe this is a two year process.","But this integration of these two companies when you think about it kind of what we guided to get in there look at it and then figure out from the transition standpoint that it is a two year integration. It's definitely something that you should expect. In terms of loyalty, we have got a host of issues in addition to both the logical issues around platforms and reservation etcetera. We have also got some other things like credit cards and time share businesses where we need to work with our partners to get where we all want to go in terms of the relationship with the customer and that one is a little bit harder to pick exactly a time I think we have said before that we are hopeful by 2018 to emerge the loyalty program so I think the two year sort of estimate is for right now it's good as we can give you.","Jeffrey Donnelly","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Telsey Group.","David Katz","Hi, good morning all.","Arne Sorenson","Hi David.","David Katz","Hi, so I wanted to just ask about the post closure asset sales program plan. How should we be, I assume that you have specific set of strategies around getting that done and as I listen to you talk about it in many respect it seems as though it is a forgoing conclusion that they will be sold and we do have a stated set of net proceeds coming out of that. Is there any color that you can give us around your assurances that it's going to happen the way you have mapped it out and some of the sort of issues in getting that done?","Leeny Oberg","Great. So, you are right we have talked about in general what we expect to do in terms of $1.5 billion to $2 billion of asset sales over the next couple of years. Once when we do this deal so first of all you can tell what Starwood has done so far this year they have done a great job of moving through their assets sale program and getting some nice deals done. We like you basically take our cue from them in terms of hearing how they are doing on that front and from that perspective we know that they are talking to a number of parties out there about some very good sized transactions and we look forward to as soon as the deal is closed to getting much more involved in understanding exactly where things are with the negotiations and the terms of the deals and the pace of those discussions.","So I wouldn't really be able to hazard where we are in Q3, Q4, Q1 of 2017 except to know that I am sure you have seen Marriott track record. And that is that we don't want to be a real estate owner and we will be moving as quickly as practicable to recycle that capital but frankly I would expect that you will hear more from us at the end of Q3 when we have closed and we have got a better handle on where things are.","David Katz","So it sounds like there is a series of processes that they have begun.","Leeny Oberg","Yes.","David Katz","That you will be taking the reins on that are at some wide range of sages?","Leeny Oberg","That's you hit the nail on the head. That's exactly right. ","David Katz","Understood, okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Rich Hightower","Hey good morning everyone. ","Arne Sorenson","Good morning. ","Rich Hightower","So I want to go back to an item in the prepared comments about the strategy in the second quarter of increasing occupancy via various different channels as a way to generate REVPAR. So it's sort of reminiscing of the heads and bed strategy that was employed much earlier in the cycle here and so my question is how much more occupancy or how much more REVPAR can you drive this way given that we are basically at or near a structural peak in occupancy and then going forward where will REVPAR come from if that avenue is eventually more or less closed off?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, there is lots of business out there that we don't have in our hotels by definition obviously. We think we got about 11% of the rooms in the United States on a smaller share in the rest of the world usually dramatically smaller than that 11%. We tend to run meaningfully higher rates than the market as a whole. And we obviously do that with the purpose that's partly because of the way our hotels are squeaked in terms of their level of luxury and level of services that's partly about simply our approach to pricing.","So there is lots of business out there that is more rates sensitive and can be persuade by us if we think it is in our interest to pursue it. Obviously we are also adding new units around the world. And whether that's 6.5% or 7% it is meaningful growth into our system and so we are with those new hotels making sure we can also grab new customers in order to fill them and do what we need to do and performance there has been great and so I think there is plenty of business for us to continue to go and grab. I think that business cannot always be grabbed at exactly the rates that the highest rate of business we have in the hotels but we do our best through revenue management and mix management and the like to drive optimal performance and I think we have done well with that.","Obviously that's top line focus sort of number I would, let me stress something on the bottom line too and maybe brag about it a little bit. But I think the 100 basis point improvement in margins in the managed portfolio in the United States, 3% REVPAR growth environment is extraordinarily impressive and that is a bit about good management at the top line but it's also great management of cost elements of those hotels and both of those things I think tell you that we have got tools that we can use even in this sort of a anemic GDP growth environment that we are experiencing today that can cause us to deliver yes maybe it's lowish single digit REVPAR growth but when you put unit growth and cost management and capital return shareholders into the equation you end up with this high teens or maybe even better EPS growth. 18% EPS growth in Q2 and that's with $20 million less in gains on assets sales because we had that in Q2 of 2015.","Rich Hightower","Okay that is of Arne, and maybe as a follow-up to that also related to prior comment you did mention that Marriott brands are continuing to take share from other than in the industry, but we are hearing a very similar story from some of the other big brands and so can you sort of describe the landscape of hotels of operators or branded, non-branded whatever where that share is coming from at this stage?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, I mean I think there are two big American lodging companies that are these brands are in first demand and of course we believe our brands are in first demand and we have got that to support that but I think there is a significant shift towards quality, I think that shift in many respects accelerates when there is more anxiety in the market and whether that anxiety is manifested by the way the equity investor approaches it or by the approach that the lender takes we obviously talking about that little bit in the prepared comments. Lenders are more cautious today and that caution is also going to force them to put their borrowers in the position where they are going with the strongest brands that pose the least risk in weaker environment and that's very much sure benefit. ","Rich Hightower","Right and let me clarify that I did mean REVPAR index rather than development?","Arne Sorenson","REVPAR index. Who are we taking it from well remember the way REVPAR index is done. It's not Marriott against company B, but it is how does the Marriott Marquee in Time Square in New York compared to the four hotels or five hotels or six hotels that they have in that hotels competitive set. And as a consequence in some markets it's going to be for the Marriott Marquee I don't know on the top of my head what competitive set is but I suspect that it's a number of the big branded hotels within about a mile with that hotel. In other markets we may have Marriott that is competing against a limited service hotel because that's the other \u2013 only other hotel in the market or some other products like that or some independent hotels and all of these get rolled up and when we talk about 90 basis points of index growth that is a collection of taking from lots of different kind of competitors.","Rich Hightower","All right, that's helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon with Macquarie Research Equities.","Chad Beynon","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to shift gears to Asia-Pac since you are one of the largest now in post deal close, I believe you will be the largest player in the market and you talked about some pretty positive things going on, on a forward looking basis and in the quarter. I am wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more where you are seeing the strength where the occupancy is coming from and then are we starting to see an improvement in the F&B and banquets side as we saw several years ago? Thank.","Arne Sorenson","Yes, Asia is really a bright spot. You can look at it for total REVPAR numbers that we reported in the quarter we obviously call that a number of the individual markets but you look across the region and see more often than not good strong performance. Sometimes in markets like South Korea that is aided by an extraordinarily easy comparison because of the crisis last year but you look at India with its 10% REVPAR growth that is driven by core economic growth in the country China we talked about with Mainland China REVPAR of about 3% in Q2 and if anything that understates China's performance we did have a shift in the way we report REVPAR year-over-year which is something to do with service fees and service charges and some of the fine tuning of that which has about 2 point impact on reported REVPAR in China in the quarter. And so if anything China is doing even better than the numbers that we reported.","We have been pleased with China on the development side year-to-date we obviously read the same newspaper that you do and there is some anxiety there as there is in many other markets around the world but it seems that people are continuing to move forward with projects that have strength. And then, on the negative side Hong Kong has been sort of tougher market mostly because Chinese visitation has, Mainland Chinese visitation has declined. Some of that is currency driven given that Hong Kong's dollar is essentially pegged to the US dollar and so as a consequence has become more expensive as the US dollar has continued to appreciate around the world. We wouldn't expect that Hong Kong is going to change for the better anytime real soon. But it's time, but I think across the region generally we are pretty bullish about Asia-Pacific.","Chad Beynon","Okay. Thanks. My follow-up, asked in the quarter in the half year from a percentage basis and from a year-over-year basis very impressive for you and really particularly against your peers, particularly given the declining demands in the industries, so I am just trying to figure out if we do see REVPAR decelerate as you have guided. Are there many IMF players that are at risk of falling away or are those portfolios or operators that are just barely paying IMF so small in the grand scheme of your total fees from that segment? Thanks.","Arne Sorenson","Maybe Leeny will do that but before Leeny jumps in on this let me mention Australia given that you are with Macquarie, so I apologize for not having done that but Australia is a bright spot in Asia-Pacific.","Chad Beynon","Appreciate that. Thank you. ","Leeny Oberg","So, on incentive fees you see that what we have got for the first half of the year and the back half of the year is fairly similar growth rate. Now we are looking so far this year where whatever 64% earning incentive fees and by the end of the year that will probably climb up a few percentage points. We have got a great breadth and depth now with greater international exposure across our portfolio where it's not quite the same in terms of the fall off. I think as long as we are staying in the kind of ballparks that we have talked about for REVPAR without a meaningful change I think we are in the right spot you have got the right kind of numbers. We aren't seeing that we automatically would have to kind of imagine that all of the sudden you are going to go back and reverse the one that you have.","We have got a large portfolio limited service hotels that added nicely to incentive fees in Q2 and their performance looks to continue to be strong. So it's IMF performance was really nice and broad both North America as well internationally obviously impacted buyers from tough international markets but overall kind of strong growth overall.","The other thing I would say on our IMF is that as you think about where we are from a margin perspective this performance is really top notch in terms of the kinds of IMF growth that we are having relative to the rep par growth it's really great performance and we feel great about the rest of the year in that regard. ","Arne Sorenson","Just one other comment on that. If you look at our reported numbers and pay attention to the managed page as well as the system wide page obviously managed hotels deliver the IMF. Managed hotels have a higher group mix than the system as a whole. We only really end up talking about REVPAR. We often don't talk about food and beverage and other contribution that comes from group but that does very much drive profitability of the managed hotels and with the relatively stronger group there is, I think all the things that Leeny said are that much even clear because that performance in those hotels should continue to be a bit better than those that are more reliant on transient and less on food and beverage.","Chad Beynon","Okay. Helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research.","Vince Ciepiel","Hi, I just have one more on group, trying to better understand the booking curve there on the prior call you noted group pacing up 7% for the second quarter. It sounds like group REVPAR did finish up at that 7% level now you are noting that group paces up 5% for the second half and based on what you are seeing with in the quarter for the quarter group bookings would you expect group REVPAR to materialize close to that 5% for the second half?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, I mean, I think, its good question. I think our number for Q4 has gotten a bit better over the last quarter. I think we were obviously we are talking about three quarters a quarter ago left in the year not two and so we didn't give it to you for each quarter but I think we did say that Q3 was relatively stronger than Q4. I think Q4 numbers look a little better today than they did a quarter ago. My guess is that often the way this works is if Q3 for example were plus 10 or plus 9 point something in group business we are more likely to end up with group number which is a bit lower than that when the dust settles because there is not likely to be availability to take as much in the quarter for the quarter group business as we probably took last year. The opposite maybe the case for the fourth quarter though. So the fourth quarter hopefully will end up with actual group REVPAR numbers which are better than zero. How those two things balance out for the second half in the aggregate I couldn't tell you but it shouldn't be dramatically different than the kind of 5% number that we are talking about today for second half.","Vince Ciepiel","Okay great. And then as a follow-up on that I think heading into this year group was pacing up seven and based on those comments it sounds like it will materialize close to five for the full year 2016. I think you are noting the 2017 is pacing up seven is it possible to think that 2017 could finish it close to 5% for group holding everything constant?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, you are going \u2013 you are taking us well into next year and I think that's possible. I think that \u2013 the good news here though is the 7% booking is a really year-over-year comparison. So that is a data point that is compared to the same data point at the same time last year for 2016 and that is a real increase of 7% in group revenue.","Vince Ciepiel","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Crow with Raymond James.","William Crow","Good morning. Arne, I wanted to focus in on the Chinese approval real quick. It feels like its delay in the transaction by weeks or maybe months is this a straight yes or no vote by them? Is there a negotiation or demand for any changes as you operate in that market? And if we went into a phase three how long do you think that could take?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, I don't think there is much more we can say than what we have already said. I will give a little bit more color. I don't obviously we have got folks in China that are helping us navigate through this and through them and through our teams we have been in touch with the Chinese authorities who are doing this process. I don't think it's political. I don't think it is extraordinary. I think it is the wheels of government working and as you can tell from our comments we expect we at least hope that we will be done here real shortly and be able to close the transaction. And close it on the terms that we have explained all of you. ","William Crow","Okay, I will leave it there, thank you.","Arne Sorenson","Okay.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of [Indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on your guidance so obviously sounds like you are assuming safe stage GDP environment but how is industry supply factored into the guidance as well and is it possible that from the accelerating supply that we are seeing including some of the short term rental capacity is driving some of the softness that you are seeing right now on the corporate side?","Arne Sorenson","Obviously REVPAR is a function of both supply and demand. Supply growing now at I don't know 1.5%, 1.6% something like that which is an historic terms is not particularly alarming maybe a little bit more than we have had last year or year before that but not a frightening sort of figure. It is very much factored into the guidance that we are providing both our supply growth and industry supply growth and we are trying to make a real world set of assumptions about the way we think our business will perform. Supply growth could be a little higher next year, but I wouldn't think it's going to be dramatically different than what we are seeing this year and that will continue to have an impact into performance.","Generally an incremental point of GDP growth is about 2 points of demand growth for the industry and as consequence we could see occupancy for comp hotels continue to grow even in this kind of supply growth environment but it does depend on GDP growth and the more GDP lose of the more occupancy is likely to move.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay that's helpful. Thank you. And then, you are obviously making some traction here with the direct bookings away from BOTAs but what sort of progress is being made with just the timing of when customers pay so I am specifically wondering about the percentage of reservations that are paid in advance versus on arrival. How is that trending and what can you do here to drive just more upfront payments? ","Arne Sorenson","We have in some markets of the world push advance pay, market it a little bit more aggressively. I know the European team has driven a significant increase in advance pay reservations. I can't tell you off the top of my head what the percentage of transient business is, that is advance pay in but I know it's growing. I suspect it's growing modestly for the company but not dramatically. And but that is one of the tools obviously that can be used as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead sir.","Arne Sorenson","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","I should note that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today November 5, 2019 and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks at www.marriott.com\/investor.","So let's get started. We were pleased with our results in the third quarter. Our global system-wide RevPAR rose 1.5% consistent with our guidance. Our global RevPAR index increased 210 basis points in the quarter with strength in the U.S., Asia Pacific and the Caribbean and Latin America.","In the U.S. alone RevPAR index increased nearly 200 basis points in the quarter with U.S. transient index up 250 basis points. Marriott Bonvoy is on a roll. Global room revenue for Marriott Bonvoy members is up 12% year-to-date over the last nine months members contributed 52% of system-wide room nights, a 320 basis point increase year-over-year. In the U.S. alone members represented 58% of booked room nights in the nine months.","Year-to-date loyalty point redemptions are up over 20%, driving better results at resorts and leisure destinations around the world. Social media feedback about the program has become decidedly favorable.","In a recent survey of Bonvoy members by an eight to one margin. Respondent said, they preferred the new Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program over either Marriott Rewards or SPG.","Over the last nine months, Marriott Bonvoy membership increased by 12 million members to reach 137 million members with nearly 40% of that increase coming from China including the meaningful contribution from our Alibaba joint venture.","Earlier this year, we launched Homes and Villas by Marriott International, our home rental business with a growing number of premium homes and villas. Today we offer 5,000 homes in 190 markets across the U.S., Europe and the Caribbean and Latin America. In the third quarter over 95% of our home rentals were booked by Marriott Bonvoy members and nearly 30% of the home rentals were paid for with point redemptions.","In another move popular with Bonvoy members, we recently announced our entry into the all-inclusive hotel business. After signing new management agreements for five new build, all-inclusive resorts located in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Last month we announced our offer to acquire Elegant Hotels, which owns and operates seven hotels in Barbados, which would jump-start our all-inclusive offering.","We expect this acquisition will be completed by year-end 2019, subject to approval by Elegant's shareholders and satisfaction of other conditions. Our guests are increasingly booking online. Our direct digital channels leveraged the popularity of Marriott Bonvoy and offered the lowest cost per reservation. Those channels marriott.com and Marriott Mobile accounted for 32% of our room nights booked in the third quarter over 400 basis points higher year-over-year.","Also in the quarter, the percentage of room nights booked through OTAs declined nearly 100 basis points. Incidentally earlier this year, we signed new agreements with Booking.com and Expedia, which we expect will result in better economics for our owners and give us enhanced control over how our products are presented by third-party sites.","Our sales organization had a great quarter. For North America, new group business booked in the quarter for comparable hotels in all future periods increased 6% year-over-year.","New revenue bookings made in the third quarter for 2020 increased 6% and new revenue bookings for 2021 rose 10%. We have opened many of our group sales offices during evenings and weekends to serve our customers at their convenience and to take advantage of the strong demand for our products.","While our booking pace is down modestly for the fourth quarter 2019 due to the timing of holidays, booking pace for comparable hotels for 2020 is up at a mid-single-digit rate year-over-year. About two-thirds of the group business expected for the year is already booked.","In the third quarter, we opened nearly 18,000 rooms more than any competitor worldwide. Our development pipeline increased to a record 495,000 rooms, 5% higher than the year-ago quarter, including 214,000 rooms under construction. Nearly 40% of the rooms in our pipeline are high value upper upscale and luxury rooms in high RevPAR markets.","In 2019, we expect our room count will increase 5% to 5.25% net, reflecting increasing construction delays, offset by lower-than-expected room deletions. For 2020, we expect similar net rooms' growth. We continue to experience construction delays in North America, particularly in the top 25 markets as well as in the Middle East and Europe. Permitting issues are also contributing to groundbreaking delays, which impact openings for 2020, but signings are strong. In fact, 2019 room signings are approaching record 2018 levels. The vast majority of 2020 openings are already under construction.","So, let's talk about 2020 RevPAR growth. Estimates for U.S. GDP growth point to a slower pace of economic growth in 2020 with lodging supply growth continuing at about 2%. This implies continuing, moderating RevPAR growth for the U.S. industry. At the same time, as I mentioned, our group revenue on the books in North America is quite strong, with booking pace up at a mid-single-digit rate. We are negotiating 2020 special corporate rates right now. And while only a few negotiations are complete, we expect 2020 special corporate rates will rise at a low single-digit rate.","Recently announced U.S. government per diems, weighted by our market distribution are set to rise 1.4% for the government's upcoming fiscal year. Today, we are seeing good demand from both business and leisure transient customers, reflecting preference for our brands and our loyalty program. But given the meaningful unknowns in the economy, we are estimating North America RevPAR growth in 2020 will increase around the midpoint of our 0% to 2% global RevPAR guide.","For our Asia Pacific region, we are modeling 2020 RevPAR growth at a low single-digit rate, reflecting strong growth in Beijing, South China Markets, India and Japan. Double-digit growth in room supply in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Maldives may constrain RevPAR growth in those countries next year. Recent events in Hong Kong make that market quite difficult to forecast. Our Hong Kong RevPAR declined 27% in the third quarter, albeit with a meaningful improvement in RevPAR Index as we outperformed the industry. We expect RevPAR at our Hong Kong hotels will decline roughly 40% in the fourth quarter.","For the full year 2020, we are assuming a mid-single-digit RevPAR decline in the city. Obviously, any estimate for Hong Kong RevPAR performance is somewhat speculative. So, while we hope comparisons will ease in the second half of 2020, we are only making a modeling assumption.","For next year, we expect Europe RevPAR will grow at a low single-digit rate, constrained by new supply in Germany and the U.K. RevPAR in the Middle East and Africa should be flat to up slightly in 2020 with continued supply growth in the Middle East and improving demand in Africa. In the Caribbean and Latin America region, RevPAR should increase at a low single-digit rate next year, reflecting more modest economic growth and political uncertainty in some markets. At the same time, the region will benefit from newly comp luxury hotels in Panama and Costa Rica.","As you know, our business model is focused on managing and franchising the finest lodging brands. Our past results have demonstrated how this allowed us to perform well throughout economic cycles. Investors favor our business model because of this stability, but we are much more than this. We have the deepest hotel brand offering and broadest property distribution in the world, which contributes to our most valuable loyalty program.","Worldwide loyalty penetration has been increasing all year and we believe there is further upside. Owners benefit from our strong RevPAR premiums and great economies of scale, particularly since our acquisition of Starwood. In North America, we have faced slowing industry RevPAR growth and rising wages for some time. Yet savings from our greater scale and implementation of best practices since 2016 have contributed 220 basis points of house profit margin lift at our managed hotels in North America. Today, the house profit margins for the Marriott Hotels brand in North America, for example is 150 basis points higher than at the last cyclical peak in 2007.","Strong economic results for owners contribute to owner preference for our brands, increasing market share and our growing pipeline. While we have a 7% share of worldwide open rooms, we have a nearly 20% share of worldwide rooms under construction. We look for investment opportunities to leverage our distribution and our loyalty program, enhance our brands and drive shareholder value. We've announced two such opportunities just recently.","Our acquisition of Elegant Hotels once complete will firmly establish our all-inclusive presence; and our purchase and reinvention of the W Hotel Union Square should enhance the value of the W Hotel brand. Our successful sale of the St. Regis New York and the 10 other hotels we have sold over the past three years demonstrates strong owner demand for our brands and our commitment to our management and franchise strategy. In total, we've monetized over 2.2 billion of assets since the acquisition of Starwood.","To be sure roughly 7% of our total fees are incentive fees from North American hotels. These incentive fees are subject to an owner priority return and admittedly vary more that with RevPAR than basin franchise fees, but the downside is limited. ","Further the long-term value to shareholders from these properties is meaningful as these are among our most prized and valuable hotels to our guests. As you can tell, I'm feeling very good about Marriott's prospects today and appreciate the company's compelling value.","On a more personal note, I'm also appreciative for your many kind words of support. I've completed chemo, radiation and immunotherapy over the last six months. Next step is surgery. I've been working throughout and I'm still getting in my morning runs. I'm sorry, I'll have to miss our upcoming holiday party in New York, but expect to be with you on the next earnings call in February and look forward to seeing many of you in person in 2020.","Before handling this over to Leeny, let me pause a moment to recognize Laura Paugh. Sadly this is her last quarterly earnings call. Laura was by my side for my first quarterly earnings call in October of 1998. She was already a veteran IR professional then and she has only gotten better and better in the 21 years, we have sat next to each other for these calls. Laura, thank you.","If I may be so bold thank you from all of us at Marriott and from all of us in the industry. If we analyze our stock and the other securities in the hospitality interest \u2013 industry, you're simply the best.","For more about the third quarter and our outlook here's Leeny.","Leeny Oberg","Thank you, Arne. Our third quarter financial performance was solid. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.47. While RevPAR growth and individual P&L line items were quite close to guidance, we were about $0.02 shy of the midpoint. Roughly $0.01 came from slightly higher-than-expected tax rate and a bit over $0.01 came from weaker-than-expected hotel performance in Hong Kong.","Global system-wide constant dollar RevPAR rose 1.5% in the third quarter year-over-year. For North America alone RevPAR increased 1.3%. RevPAR growth exceeded our expectations in D.C., Houston and Hawaii on strong citywide and transient demand.","On the other hand, New York City RevPAR continues to cope with both higher hotel supply and lower demand. RevPAR growth in Orlando and South Florida was constrained by death concern about Hurricane Dorian. RevPAR for our comparable hotels in the largest 25 markets increased 0.9% in the quarter.","For group business in North America comparable hotel RevPAR rose 2%. Group cancellations remained modest and attendance at group meetings were strong. Transient RevPAR was up slightly year-over-year reflecting steady corporate demand and stronger demand from leisure travelers.","In the Asia Pacific region system-wide constant dollar RevPAR increased nearly 2% in the third quarter constrained by events in Hong Kong and trade war impact on tertiary markets in China. Excluding Hong Kong, RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region increased nearly 3%. Larger markets in China were strong particularly Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.","Leisure demand for our hotels in China is growing and outbound room nights sold to mainland Chinese travelers in the region increased by 9% in the quarter with large numbers traveling to Japan, Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia.","In Europe system-wide constant dollar RevPAR rose 2% in the third quarter compared to the prior year, 4% excluding the impact of the World Cup in Russia last year. Europe continues to benefit from the strong dollar. Room nights sold to U.S. travelers increased 13% in the quarter with particularly strong loyalty redemption demand in Italy, Greece and Spain.","London posted another strong quarter with RevPAR up 6% on strong U.S. and Middle Eastern, demand. In the Middle East and Africa region system-wide constant dollar RevPAR rose 2% in the third quarter with strong results in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt offset by weak performance in Dubai.","In our Caribbean and Latin America region RevPAR rose 3% in the quarter with strong performance in Brazil. Our hotels in the Caribbean benefited from strong leisure demand and Mexico showed better result than in recent quarters. Gross fee revenues totaled $955 million in the third quarter consistent with our guidance and increased 2% over the prior year, reflecting unit growth and higher RevPAR.","Residential branding fees declined $15 million, reflecting the uneven timing of residential projects from year-to-year. We continue to have a deep pipeline of residential projects under development. While total fees met our expectations in the quarter, incentive fees declined a bit more than we expected largely due to RevPAR and margin weakness in the Asia Pacific region.","Arne discussed third quarter RevPAR performance for the Hong Kong market. Total fees from our Hong Kong hotels declined $3 million during the third quarter compared to the prior year and we estimate such fees could decline by $5 million in the fourth quarter.","Currently for the full year 2019, we expect our dozen hotels in Hong Kong will contribute roughly $30 million in total fees. Owned leased and other revenue net of expenses totaled $67 million in the third quarter, a $15 million decline from the prior year largely due to lower termination fees.","Results also reflected lower results in New York City and the impact of renovation at the Sheraton Grand Phoenix. Termination fees totaled $11 million in the quarter compared to $23 million in the prior year. Our adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was flat year-over-year reflecting $15 million lower residential branding fees, $12 million lower termination fees and $17 million lower incentive fees offset by rooms and RevPAR growth.","Our third quarter adjusted tax rate was a bit higher-than-expected due to a slightly different geographic mix of business. Compared to the prior year, our 2019 third quarter adjusted tax provision was higher, mainly due to prior year tax benefits from dispositions.","Let's talk about the fourth quarter. For North America, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR will increase by 0% to 1% year-over-year. Shifting holidays and other calendar anomalies should constrain RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter, but we should also benefit from favorable comparisons to last year's strikes. For the Asia Pacific region, many economists expect China's economy will continue to weaken in the fourth quarter, which could further pressure RevPAR in China's secondary markets.","With ongoing weakness in Hong Kong overall Asia Pacific RevPAR in the fourth quarter could be flat to down modestly. Excluding Hong Kong, we expect RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region will increase at a low single-digit growth rate. We expect fourth quarter RevPAR in Europe will continue to grow at a low to mid single-digit rate with strong results in Venice, London and Moscow.","Middle East and Africa RevPAR should decline at a low single-digit rate in the fourth quarter reflecting continued supply pressure in the UAE, while RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America should increase at a low single-digit rate benefiting from strong citywide events in Santiago in Rio de Janeiro and a strong holiday season in Aruba and Grand Cayman.","For the fourth quarter 2019, we believe gross fee revenue will total $960 million to $970 million, up 5% to 7% over the prior year's quarter due to RevPAR and unit growth. This is at least roughly $20 million lower than our last guidance at the midpoint, largely due to more modest RevPAR growth, the fee impact of events in Hong Kong and unfavorable foreign exchange.","We expect total incentive fees will be flattish in the fourth quarter. While incentive fees will be constrained by the RevPAR environment, fourth quarter IMF will also be helped by comparisons to last year's strikes and international unit growth. We continue to believe credit card fees could total $400 million to $410 million for the full year 2019.","Owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses could total $85 million in the fourth quarter compared to $88 million in the prior year's fourth quarter reflecting $5 million to $10 million lower termination fees. Fourth quarter 2019 owned leased results also reflect the sale of the St. Regis New York and the purchase of the W Union Square.","G&A should total $250 million to $255 million in the fourth quarter 3% to 5% over the prior year and consistent with our prior fourth quarter guidance. With these expectations, adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter should total $898 million to $913 million, a 4% to 6% increase over the prior year's quarter. We expect our adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter will be 25%, an increase over the prior year due to higher favorable discrete items in the prior year.","Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter is also a bit higher than our last guidance. These assumptions yield $1.44 to $1.47 diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter flat to up modestly from the year-ago quarter. For the full year 2019, we expect adjusted EBITDA will total $3.572 billion to $3.587 billion, a 3% increase over the prior year. And diluted earnings per share will total $5.87 to $5.90.","Our full year diluted earnings per share guidance includes the impact of gains on sales of assets totaling $0.02 per share in 2019 compared to $0.65 per share in 2018. Our 2019 earnings guidance does not reflect a gain on the sale of the St. Regis New York, which we expect will be significant. As always, our 2019 guidance does not include merger-related costs or reimbursed revenues and expenses or additional asset sales.","Total investment spending for 2019 could total $1 billion to $1.1 billion including roughly $225 million of maintenance spending an estimated $199 million for Elegant Hotels' equity and debt and the purchase of the W New York - Union Square for $206 million. We expect $550 million to $600 million of this total investment spending should be reimbursed for recycle over time.","We sold the St. Regis New York last week for $310 million subject to a long-term management agreement. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 14.2 million shares for $1.83 billion. And we expect cash return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends will approach $3 billion in 2019. This assumes no asset sales in 2019 beyond those already completed.","Our balance sheet remains in great shape. At September 30, our debt ratio was within our targeted credit standard of 3.0 to 3.5 times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR.","So before we take your questions, I want to also thank Laura for her innumerable contributions to Marriott. Personally, I want to thank her for her incredible mentorship to me over the years. It's hard for all of us to imagine life at Marriott without her guidance, her steady pen and her wit, but we'll try hard to make her proud.","So that we can take -- speak with you as many as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Instinet. Harry, your line is open.","Laura Paugh","You're open, Harry.","Harry Curtis","Can you hear me? How is that?","Arne Sorenson","Now we got you.","Laura Paugh","Hey, Harry.","Harry Curtis","All right. All right. Technology problem here. Yes. Laura, you've been a great resource and partner over the years. Thank you very much.","Laura Paugh","Thank you, Harry. Great working in with you.","Harry Curtis","I appreciate that. So just a couple of quick questions. First, Arne, you were talking about corporate negotiated rates and in that process, are you guys getting any sense of the -- if whether or not the political environment is holding back travel budgets or investment by your customers? And what would it take to improve that sentiment?","Arne Sorenson","Yes. I don't -- there is a little bit more apprehension, I suppose, and that we pick up. I'm not certain so much in the special rate negotiations directly as it is in just the conversations we're having with senior members of the American business community.","I think that apprehension is a little bit about politics, but the way you framed it, maybe makes it almost sound a little bit too general. I think it is more focused on the trade dynamic probably than politics generally. And, of course, we've got every day news about whether or not we're nearing a trade deal. I think, if we get to a trade deal, obviously, that will be meaningful even if it's a relatively small deal.","But having said that, while apprehension is a bit higher, I think, absolute performance of the U.S. economy is still quite robust. It may not be reflecting the kind of growth we'd like to see on a year-over-year basis. But whether you're looking at our industry or the economy more broadly, I think you see obviously low unemployment in our industry, you see high occupancy, you see absolute performance that is fairly meaningful.","And so I think we would characterize this and you can sort of sense it in what we said to expect in terms of year-over-year increases in revenue coming from those special corporate accounts. But it feels like a cautious but steady move into 2020 from 2019, expecting a bit more of the same as opposed to something declining.","Harry Curtis","Very good. And my second question, shifting gears, relates to the connection, if there is any, between the growth in Bonvoy members and correlation to credit card fees, growth in credit card fees. And as we -- you've shown a terrific increase in the number of your members. Is there -- or would you expect there to be some correlation to growth in credit card fees to a similar degree in 2020 and beyond.","Arne Sorenson","Well, obviously, we had a gonzo year in 2018, when you looked at the way the credit card made contributions to us compared to before. And, of course, that was because we had renegotiated deals with both of our credit card partners. And we're in market with new limited time offers and other things that we're moving that quite robustly.","Growth rates in 2019, by comparison, have been maybe a tad better than growth in total lodging fees, but not dramatically different. We have, of course, have got internal discussions underway where we're looking at what we might budget for 2020.","It's a little too early to talk about that in any sort of particular ranges, but we think there is more opportunity for these credit cards as the program gets that much more powerful. Our penetration of total Bonvoy members is very light. Our penetration of the heavy travelers is obviously more significant. But I think we'll look for opportunities to grow that contribution in 2020 and probably in a number of years beyond that.","Harry Curtis","Very good. Thanks very much, everyone.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Katz of Jefferies.","David Katz","Hi. Good morning everyone.","Arne Sorenson","Good morning.","David Katz","Laura I just want to thank you for being patient in explaining to me synfuel, timeshare and any other detail. And for being the best caller-backer of all time.","Laura Paugh","Thank you, Dave.","David Katz","All the best. I wanted to just go back Arne to a comment you made in your opening remarks about margins being up 150 basis points versus 2007. Obviously, we're comparing a different business today, but I have sort of gone back and looked at what the incentive fees were and trying to compare that on a -- some kind of a per room basis. I got about halfway through that analysis and it became my turn. Help me sort of compare what the incentive fee generation is today and how we would put that in context for where you think we are in the cycle versus that 2007. I just found that comment interesting and would love to elaborate on it a little bit more.","Arne Sorenson","Yes. So a couple of things. I'll repeat a couple of things I said in the prepared remarks. So we have calculated -- obviously we're talking here about hotel-level margin performance which is really about managed hotels and principally until a comment coming up is about North America. And two things. One is we've tried to calculate what margin performance is driven by RevPAR and then what margin performance is driven by implement assets we've been able to implement because of the Starwood transaction.","And that difference is about 220 basis points in North America. So, we think about 220 basis points or two full points of GOP margin has been delivered because of that. In part because, of that we end up with nominal GOP gross operating profit at the hotel level up 150 basis points from the peak in 2007. Now that's an average number. It covers a lot of variables across different markets in the United States. We know that New York for example with both substantial cost growth which has experienced in the last decade not just in wages and benefits but also in property taxes and compounded with some supply growth. We have seen more pressure there on house profit margins compared to peak than we have in some other markets.","Now when it, gets to incentive fees this becomes a global story of course. And what we've seen is a continued meaningful shift from U.S. derived fees to international derived fees. And while it would be an oversimplification to say that all international IMF is less risky than domestic IMF certainly on average terms it is significantly more stable through the cycles than the American IMFs are. Why? Because typically in the United States you would have an owner's priority. And until you fill that owner's priority bucket we get nothing, where in much of the rest of the world, the incentive management fee formula gives us a share of profits from the first get-go.","Leeny Oberg","So just a couple of more things to add to that David that you may find helpful which is the switch from kind of what used to be two-thirds North America total incentive fees to now one-third which will -- absolutely we expect to be the case in 2019 that only one-third of the incentive fees are coming from North America. One of the interesting things when you look at Q3 is that actually the percentage of international hotels earning incentive fees increased from 73% to 75%, while not surprisingly in the U.S. they declined from 52% to 41%. So all of this again points to Arne's theme about the predominance of owner's priorities in our North America managed hotels while outside the U.S. it's much more that on dollar one of profits we earn an incentive fee albeit a lower percentage of overall profit.","David Katz","Super helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin Farley","Great. Two questions or one question one follow-up. First is just looking at removals in the system this quarter it looks like the lowest rate in a couple of years. And just wondering if that was just a timing issue or if there's sort of a change in either properties in the system that are willing to make reinvestments? Or are you more lenient with not forcing some removals. So I just wanted to get some color there. And then I do have a follow-up as well. Thanks.","Leeny Oberg","Okay. Great. Thanks Robin. No, you hit the nail on the head in terms of that we are expecting a lower rate of deletion from the system this year certainly than last year which approached 2% and was disproportionately related to the legacy Starwood Hotel portfolio. And this year we are looking at that being much closer to 1%. We've been giving guidance for the year of 1% to 1.5%, but as we've moved through the year and continue to have conversations with owners, we're continuing to see that many of these hotels are staying in our system. It is not a function of u0s being more lenient relative to the kind of investment required for these hotels as we've talked to you there's been tremendous investment for example in the Sheridan portfolio as many of those hotels are either undergoing renovation or we've got agreements for them to undergo renovation. I think we are thinking this early in the budget process as we look at 2020 and it's really too early to say anything more than a fairly stable historic rate that would be 1% to 1.5%. Obviously, of course, it will be great if it turns out lower, but we do think for this year it is going to end up towards that lower range.","Robin Farley","Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up you talked a little bit already about incentive management fees. Just thinking about 2020 next year and you've only given the RevPAR guidance. Is it \u2013 should we be thinking about maybe fee growth not being at the same level as this year's 5% just given that if expenses continue to go up in North America just the issues that you highlighted in this quarter with incentive management fee Hong Kong where it sounds like RevPAR really expected to decline next year? And then expenses in North America we saw the pressure on North American property margins this year house margins this year. Does it seem like the expectation for fee growth next year would be lower than this year's growth rate?","Arne Sorenson","I think it'd be too early to conclude that. I mean, let's be mindful of the fact we are heavily into the budget process right now, but we're not completed yet. And of course we've got a sense, which we've shared with you this morning of a RevPAR range which we think is germane to the way we think about 2020. But the teams around the world are working to sort of run that through each of their businesses and individual hotels for that matter just to where it pulls together and settles. But I would think that lodging fee growth there's every reason to believe it will be positive and should be broadly comparable to what we experienced in 2019.","Leeny Oberg","As you know, we had a couple of oddball items like FX and changes in termination fees and shifts in residential branding fees that impacted. And all of those things will need to be taken into consideration as we look at next year. But the fundamental model of RevPAR and unit growth would get you certainly to something that looks quite similar to this year on that part alone.","Robin Farley","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi.","Smedes Rose","Hi. Thank you.","Arne Sorenson","Good morning.","Smedes Rose","I wanted to just ask a little bit about just the Sheraton and the Westin brands if you look at the year-to-date performance at least measured by RevPAR I mean, they're struggling versus what you've seen at the Marriott brand specifically. And is there anything that you would expect to be doing differently or something that's underway maybe that will help kind of close the performance gap in terms of percentage changes as you move forward? Or any thoughts since you acquired these brands?","Arne Sorenson","Yeah. It's a good question and it does \u2013 it's a logical question given the RevPAR numbers by brand that we share in the press release. I think one of the things that we were most gratified by in Q3 we obviously talked about [Audio Gap]. But we saw index growth in both legacy Starwood and legacy-Marriott portfolios. And that is a pretty powerful sign that we think this experiment is working well. And it's going to work well we think for both portfolios if you look at it that way. I think what Sheraton and Westin are probably quite different in this regard. Westin is impacted by the law of small numbers to some extent more than Sheraton is. So the smaller the portfolio the more you've got some variability based on geography alone that can often have an impact to the reported RevPAR numbers.","Sheraton obviously is a bigger brand. You still have some geographic differences there that are relevant. I think the other thing we've got is we've got a good amount of renovation activity underway in the Sheraton brand which does have an impact on the margins on the way RevPAR is posted in any given quarter. That might be short-term pain, but clearly it is long term very much to our advantage. But again, I think the \u2013 if you put a point out and said, well, how does Sheraton repositioning going in? We're really actually quite encouraged. The \u2013 a piece of that is implied by Leeny's comments about relatively lower deletions from the system. I think what we're seeing from our ownership community generally is a positive support for where we're taking the brand and an acknowledgment that that means capital needs to be brought in and those brands \u2013 those hotels need to be brought up to the kind of standards we're setting for the brand going forward.","Smedes Rose","Okay. Thanks. And then can I just follow up quickly? You're continuing to expand your all-inclusive presence. From a valuation perspective it looks, I mean, that was just pretty \u2013 clearly pretty compelling and I'd imagine there's a lot of synergies there. But I wanted to ask it's a big sort of concentration in Barbados. Not as big as \u2013 it's not the biggest destination for U.S. tourists as it is for European. And I mean, I guess kind of what is your goal here? Is this just sort of set up a platform for other folks to come to you now and sort of say, we want to be a part of this? Or kind of what's the endgame ultimately?","Arne Sorenson","Yeah. I mean, the \u2013 obviously, all-inclusive has grown very steadily over the course of the last couple of decades I suppose and we've watched it develop. It is almost by definition a purely leisure brand. I mean, there are certainly some hotels that are getting some group business that is not leisure but it is heavily a leisure play. We are really encouraged by the Bonvoy strength which we've talked about this morning, which really in some respects is about recognizing business travelers by giving them the kind of experiences they want, when they're taking their leisure trips. And with lifestyle and luxury and resort portfolio that we've got in our hotel portfolio, we've already got tremendous things to offer there. But we can see that in the all-inclusive space there's another thing that we would like to be able to offer which is a connection with the loyalty program for an all-inclusive stay which many, many travelers like to have.","I think the bet we're making with Elegant is not as concentrated as it might seem. Well it's a handful of hotels in that market. It's only about 700 rooms total. So we're not in any way concerned about our ability to continue both to market that in the UK, which has been the strongest source market for those hotels, but increasingly open that market up to American travelers who will find the paradise of Barbados I think as attractive as many of the other markets in the region.","And then I think we'll continue to move. I think the theory has been well-recognized for a number of years and that is -- isn't it obvious that hotel loyalty programs should be able to deliver good cost-effective volumes all-inclusive hotels. And I don't know that anybody has really proven that yet. Obviously some of our hotel competitors are already in with a handful of all-inclusive hotels, but I think it's still early for all of us. And we want to make sure that we get in there that we use our management team to both learn the differences in this business, but to also be able to make sure we can deliver our customer to these kinds of hotels. And I think we'll be able to do that.","Smedes Rose","All right. Thanks. And Laura best of luck on your next adventure.","Laura Paugh","Thanks, Smedes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Greff of JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff","Good morning, everybody and Laura, I just want to add you will be missed. So thank you for all your help over the years.","Laura Paugh","Thanks, Joe.","Joseph Greff","Arne, you talked about construction delays earlier in the call. Can you talk about how much of it is related to operating expenses or construction costs and finding labor versus owners just maybe cooling things a little bit in light of macro uncertainty? And then how much confidence do you have in terms of that there's a plateau in the delay of some of these new openings as you look out to 2020?","Arne Sorenson","So in fairness a good question, Joe. The -- obviously we're disappointed by this too and a quarter ago and probably two quarters ago too. We were asked about net unit growth in 2020 or in the years ahead compared to 2019. And based on the multiyear planning that we've done much of which we've shared with you when we do analyst meeting and also just based on the obvious which is that the pipeline in aggregate size is very big and we've been signing high-quality deals every year.","And while every year is not a record we have been in many respects surprised to the upside about how the new projects are coming into the pipeline. And that continues well into 2019 even with the sort of apprehension in the market. So all of those things caused us to be not just hopeful, but to have some factual underpinning thinking that we were going to see unit growth step up in 2020 and years beyond from the levels we're today.","And obviously, we've given you our first look at 2020 this morning or in our release last night. And I have said we now expect it to be roughly comparable negative growth rates next year as this year, which I know is disappointing to folks. We're still early in the process so we should mention that. We don't -- we've not finalized our budget plan.","I think that as we've said in the past and every quarter we go through the entire portfolio pipeline. And we add new units based on signings that have been done we subtract units when they open and we subtract a few that are killed every quarter. The number that we've canceled this last category is really not moving. So we're not seeing the worst news driving this which is that deals are being abandoned.","Instead, what we're seeing is sort of all of the above for delays. And by that I mean, you've got a piece of it which is about the greater upper-upscale and luxury mix that is in our pipeline; greater urban mix which is in our pipeline where permitting and construction often takes longer. You've got continued high construction costs in many markets around the world which our owners are trying to make sure that they manage well offset a little bit by continued high availability of debt financing at pretty attractive terms.","And then lastly I think you do have some apprehension about the economy generally. And so I think there are some owners it varies a little bit by market-to-market, but some owners who will look and say, I do intend to do this project. I'm going to move forward with it. But I'm going to do it maybe with a bit more deliberate speed than I would have if I was really 100% convinced that I needed to cap it -- capture this thing right away.","It is an American phenomenon, but it is also increasingly a global phenomenon. Because I think we are seeing the same dynamic play out probably in the Middle East and Europe next to the United States, but we're seeing these trends sort of take place around the world.","Joseph Greff","Excellent. Great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, it looks like based on your disclosures in the press release that the buyback activity moderated somewhat meaningfully quarter to-date. And I know the capital return commentary is left intact. If you could just help us understand; one, am I interpreting that correctly? And two maybe what drove this sort of slowdown in 4Q-to-date buyback activity.","Leeny Oberg","Sure Joe, happy to. As you can imagine kind of in between every month we're constantly assessing the cash that we need for investment, the timing of that investment, as well as the timing of asset dispositions and just the general flow of cash from operations.","And the reality is, we got bit a bit by the timing of both our commitment on Elegant and on Union Square and not really wanting to count on cash in the door until it actually showed up. So there isn't really any message at all relative to the timing of quarter to-date.","And if you look at our first three quarters they are actually quite even except for Q1, where we were a bit more accelerated in Q1, because as you remember we started off the year with a leverage ratio that was really down towards the lower end of our 3.0 to 3.5.","So as we talked about, it's the same expectation for overall level of capital return to shareholders as it was last time. And generally, the new CapEx that we've talked about is offset by the disposition that we had last week.","Joseph Greff","Great. Thank you. ","Leeny Oberg","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell of Barclays.","Anthony Powell","Hi, good morning guys. The acceleration of the RevPAR index gain was pretty meaningful in the quarter. Was that driven more by the sales momentum you talked about or by better customer engagement with Bonvoy?","Arne Sorenson","It was driven by both, but I think the Bonvoy piece is probably the broadest in its extent. That is very much a global phenomenon where penetration from the loyalty program went up meaningfully in essentially every market around the world. Our group sales at the same time which is a function of the sales force obviously is stronger than the transient categories of business, but by a point or so not dramatically and certainly not capable of explaining all of that index growth, if you will for the quarter.","Anthony Powell","Got it. And you mentioned that the loyalty redemptions were up 20% in the quarter. Was some of that growth due to the fact that customers may be pulling forward some bookings ahead of changes like peak and off-peak redemptions and penetrate upper comps in the future?","Arne Sorenson","Yes. The redemptions have been high this year. I think a big chunk of it is simply the stability of the program now and the ability of customers from legacy SPG and legacy Marriott rewards to experiment with a broader portfolio. And that's been very interesting to see and there's some obvious examples. Starwood for example had the Great Chica Collection in Italy principally.","But Southern Europe glorious hotels and suddenly that's opened up to a huge number of legacy Marriott Rewards members. And they say, these are places that we want to try and experiment with. I think there is probably some on-sale aspect also that moved that.","I think some of the bookings that could have been made through the first part of 2019 probably not into the middle of 2019 allowed some of the highest category hotels to be -- and this is not about peak\/off-peak pricing, but it's about the former highest category hotels. They were on sale a little bit based on the way the minutia of those formula work.","And I think you have some extraordinarily sophisticated folks who watch these loyalty programs and thought this is a good time to reserve some of those redemption stays for that kind of hotel. But I suspect, we will see pretty robust redemption activity as a steady state aspect of a loyalty program going forward.","Anthony Powell","Got it. Did the mix of redemptions in the system increased significantly this year? Or was it kind of similar to prior years in terms of overall?","Arne Sorenson","Well all redemptions are up, but they're up not just in luxury and upper upscale, but they're also up in the select service space.","Leeny Oberg","And there's meaningful crossover which is great to see. So you've got former Marriott Rewards members going to legacy Starwood hotels and vice versa in meaningful nights.","Anthony Powell","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Hey good morning. You were very active on the transaction front so just a couple of questions on that. Do you expect to do any more single-asset transaction in the near term? And then when you think bigger picture are you returning to your historical practice of doing a larger bolt-on transaction or small to medium-sized bolt-on transaction every year? And then, how are you thinking about larger-scale M&A like Starwood? Thank you.","Arne Sorenson","I mean I'm going to say something general, and then Leeny will jump in here, and give you something that's more precise. But, we have, obviously, the capacity given our size to make some modest investments in positioning the company for accelerated growth going forward. And so, the deals we've announced, for example, in the last four to six weeks really proved that out.","They are about positioning us well for the all-inclusive space, which we've talked about already this morning and making sure what we do what we want to do for the W brand, particularly in North America where we want to make sure that we invest in the strength of that brand, which has been a juggernaut for Starwood for many years; but do that in a market like New York where it is really important that we have a flagship that we feel great about.","And so, both of those opportunities stepped up. We, of course, looked at them in the context of how does that individual deal value for us long-term. What's the strategy for it? But more than that we look at it in the context of are we strengthening the platform for us to grow in the future. Leeny, I don't know what should add to that.","Leeny Oberg","Yeah. No, the only thing is to your basic question, the answer is no. We're not changing the business model, whatsoever, relative to the asset-light business model. We actually own 14 hotels today, which is the same that we owned a quarter ago as we bought one and resold one. And as Arne said, it's seven hotels on for Elegant, but they total only a small number of rooms.","So, it continues to be the same which is that we are opportunistic whether it\u2019d be bolt-on or whether it\u2019d be single-asset purchases. They're very much done from a strategic lens, but also with a view that we are not moving at all from our asset-light model.","Thomas Allen","Helpful, thanks for the color. And then, just a quick one. You highlighted in the prepared remarks that in 2019 you expect to earn $30 million from fees from Hong Kong. What was that in 2018? And do you have guarantees on those hotels? And so, just help us think about like the potential volatility in that number would be great. Thank you.","Leeny Oberg","So, as we talked about, first of all, the break is that it's $30 million, which is kind of probably 65-35 between base fees -- base in franchise fees versus incentive fees. What we talked about is them being down $3 million in Q3 and $5 million in Q4. My guess is they were expected to be up a little bit this year. So, that's going to say on a net basis that they're probably down, I don't know, $5-ish million for the year this year.","And then, obviously as we go forward, we'll have to see what next year brings. We don't have any meaningful sort of guarantees that would remotely be something that would kind of give you pause. We do have a JV, the Sheraton Hong Kong JV, which was impacted in Q3, and we'll be -- expect impacts into Q4 from those JV earnings. But again, these are all relatively small amounts when you're looking at only 12 hotels overall.","Thomas Allen","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amanda Graham of Goldman Sachs.","Steven Grambling","This is Steven Grambling, so maybe that's me. Thanks for getting me in. Thank you, Laura for all of your insight and humor. Maybe that was one last thing to mess with me.","Arne Sorenson","I promise. She didn\u2019t. But I promise you she didn\u2019t do that.","Steven Grambling","First on David's first question on house margins, how much of the improvement has been driven solely by RevPAR in the economic expansion versus benefits to owners through increased sale credit card negotiations OTA renegotiations, et cetera?","Arne Sorenson","Well, so the 220 basis points is all the latter, okay? That's an effort to calculate the margin, cumulative margin impact since we closed the Starwood deal, excluding the impact from RevPAR. And if you take that number and the 150 basis points, the absolute improvement in margins versus 2007, it would suggest that 100% of it -- a bit more than 100% of that difference is driven by the deal that we've done and the steps we've been able to take since then. Does that answer your question, Steve.","Steven Grambling","Yeah, that does. That's perfect. And then second on Thomas' question about capital intensity. Is there a rule of thumb to think about for the combined CapEx software investment contract acquisition costs? As we move forward, given the increase over the past two years, seems like we should be moving to a more normalized level?","Arne Sorenson","That's a good question. I mean I think the capital spending we do -- we've talked quite a bit this morning about some of the unusual deals. So, let's ignore it first, because that's been talked about.","Leeny Oberg","Yes. The normal $650 million to $750 million that we've talked about on an annual basis and that we talked about at the security analyst meeting is still the appropriate number for what we think for ongoing organic growth of our business of which roughly, call it, $225 million is normal maintenance CapEx for our corporate systems as well as for our owned leased hotels.","So, the rest is as you know there's a good chunk of key money and then bps that are either for equity investing as well as for loans and guarantees. And again as we talked about today for example in this year if you're talking about roughly $1 billion to $1.1 billion, we would expect as much as $600 million of that could be should be recycled over time.","Stephen Grambling","Helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes of SunTrust.","Patrick Scholes","Hi, good morning.","Arne Sorenson","Good morning.","Patrick Scholes","Laura, thank you again. Certainly thank you for taking and promptly answering my many obscure questions over these years.","Laura Paugh","It's been fun Patrick.","Patrick Scholes","Thank you. Arne a question for you on that strong group pace for next year. How much of that strength do you see is driven by political conventions and the like?","Arne Sorenson","I don't think much. I'm not sure I actually know for a certainty. But certainly over time a presidential election year is not a great year for Washington D.C., for example, all other things being equal because by and large the politicians are out on the hustings as opposed to hanging out in Washington. And so we obviously have a substantial presence including group hotels in Washington.","I don't know what their bookings are for next year, but I would guess that it is sort of less than average. And I think when you look at the rest of the country, of course, you'll have two conventions in two individual cities which will be good for that. But I think overwhelmingly what we're talking about is corporate and association business. It's not about the political environment.","Patrick Scholes","Okay. Thank you for your color on that.","Arne Sorenson","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun Kelley","Hi, good morning everybody and Laura I wanted to pass along my congratulations as well. And I'm sure I think 11 years ago we were talking about incentive management fees. So, I feel like it's an appropriate time to ask about incentive management fees. So, I just wanted to kind of dig in a little bit. Arne, I think you gave some color earlier in the Q&A about just sort of the breakdown in mix between domestic today versus where it was previously in international.","As we look at what was kind of provided at the Securities Analyst Day though and we think about like the environment that we're in it does feel like we're sort of running below the level of targets where we thought maybe a 1% RevPAR environment we might be able to get to let's call it mid-single-digit type IMF growth and it feels harder and harder to kind of hit that.","So, just could you break that down a little bit more? Is there a specific area that you think is kind of either trending below what you thought or missing expectation? Is it just across the board that there's a little bit more leverage in the model than you kind of thought there was? Or just kind of how you break that down for us.","Arne Sorenson","So, maybe we should decide right now that we'll invite Laura back in a decade and we can talk about incentive management fees and what would that be 2029 or something like that.","The -- and one context-setting comment before answering your question, obviously, the incentive fees are skewed towards -- by definition they are always on managed hotels not franchised hotels. And they skew towards more significant markets think of the top 25 in the United States or very well-established resort destinations. And they skew towards upper-upscale and luxury hotels all around the world. And it is those hotels which deliver disproportionately higher fees per room to us than our competitors or others in the industry will experience from the brands that they've got.","So, while there is a bit more volatility in incentive management fees for obvious reasons, they come from the bottom line not the topline. They are in every instance fees we would just as soon be earning because they are economically additive to us and because they are strategically additive to us because those hotels make an extraordinary amount of difference.","Leeny and Laura and Betsy and I were talking this morning actually I think if you go back and look at the securities analyst meeting and the 1% scenario, we're performing right in line with that at least in terms of total fees. There may be some variability in which of the three fee lines is contributing to that, but broadly we're within the range of what we've talked about.","And so there's nothing here that we're going to be able to say to you this morning that gives you tremendously more clarity than what you know to be the obvious which is that when you're in a low year-over-year RevPAR environment with expenses growing at meaningfully faster rate than RevPAR is that that's going to have an impact to Marriott and its incentive fees just the way it's going to have an impact to the owner and their contribution from that hotel.","Now, there are some things which exacerbated here a little bit one way or another. Hong Kong we've talked about at length this morning would have had a disproportionate impact in Q3 albeit modest. I suspect the impact in Q4 will be more significant than in Q3 because the performance there is going to be that much worse in Q4.","And then you go around the rest of the world and you'll see different performance in different markets. New York, we've talked about too New York will be a place where because of anemic RevPAR growth or modest declines even in RevPAR. And cost increases the incentive fee contribution from the hotels that are in incentive fees in New York will be disproportionately weaker than they would be in other markets around the world.","Leeny Oberg","The only thing I'd add to that is that when we look at 2019's expected full year fees, we actually at this point would expect that international incentive fees will go up year-over-year. They won't go up a lot but they will go up. And that represents two things. First of all the different quality of the incentive fees as we've talked about earlier much less of an owner's priority characteristic.","And number two, in general, our managed footprint is growing faster outside the U.S. than it's growing inside the U.S. So again, when you look at those security analysts' forecast or expect models that we put out earlier this year, one of the things to remember is that we are expecting unit growth outside the U.S. to be faster than inside the U.S., which again has this difference in the characteristics over the incentive fees.","Shaun Kelley","Great. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Arne it's good to hear from you. I'm glad all is trending as we've hoped so far. And Laura just echo everyone's comments. It's been fantastic. Congrats and best wishes to you.","Laura Paugh","Thanks Jared.","Jared Shojaian","In the 2020, 0% to 2% RevPAR guidance, can you parse out the impact from group business transient and leisure transient? And if I just take your group commentary, which seems really strong and your special corporate rates being up low single-digits, it would seem like leisure is not as strong. So correct me if I'm wrong on that.","Arne Sorenson","Yes. You're testing us a little bit given we have not done our budgets yet for next year. I mean I think it's -- I think you're going to infer from what we've said that group may be the strongest contributor if you will to that 0% to 2% range that we gave for next year.","I think it would be far too soon to suggest that that implies that leisure transient is meaningfully weaker than business transient. Obviously, we're going to see the way the year actually evolves but we're also going to see the way the completion of our budget season evolves. And again -- but behind that average of 0% to 2%, you're going to see some markets that are lower than that 0% and some markets that are higher than the 2% based upon market dynamics, which may have something to do with convention centers or group booking pace for that individual market or the strength of the sort of local drivers of those economies as opposed to some other economies. So I would -- while group I think will be among the strongest segments for us. I don't think it means that the others are necessarily going to be down.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. Thank you. And just a follow-up on that. I mean, if I look around at other travel industries, leisure travel in general I think still seems to be quite strong. You've got the theme of experiences. You've got the boomers retiring. That seems to be a little in contrast to some of the things we're seeing on the hotel side.","Do you think some of the -- I guess call it leisure softness maybe not as strong as what we're seeing with group and the like? Do you think any of that could be related to I guess home rental starting to gain a little bit of a bigger share of the hotel pie here in recent years?","Arne Sorenson","Yes. I don't -- and that's one reason I answered your first question the way I did is we don't see leisure has been weak. We see -- and again I'm probably talking a little bit about the American situation at this point but probably we can expand it to some other parts of the world as well.","I think that the -- what we see is our leisure customer is out on the road and they are staying with us and they're taking their vacations. Yes of course, some are doing home rentals when they travel as well. That is I think particularly more relevant for those that are most cost-sensitive, not for those who are most interested in a great experience if you will.","And of course that's one of the reasons we've decided to get into this space ourselves to deliver something which is more predictable as a great experience and more tied for travelers who are interested in more than just the cheapest rate that they can possibly get.","But I think leisure remains strong. We -- I met with some senior folks coming out of China not so long ago. And I think if you look at China outbound travel which is often leisure, the global numbers are still quite respectable.","Arrivals in Europe from China of course are much stronger than arrivals in the United States are from China and there are a number of reasons for that. But I would characterize really the leisure customer generally as being quite healthy.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James.","Bill Crow","Good morning. Laura, I jumped on your bandwagon but I've been on it for 20 years now and thanks for the ride. Arne, strength and wisdom to the doctors. My question -- first question really has to do with incentive management fees go back to that topic. What is the mark-to-market on an expiring management fee? In other words, those that were signed 20 years ago or 25 or 30 years ago we know the economics were really good at Marriott. But as they mature, as they expire what does that change? What's the delta?","Arne Sorenson","That's a good question Bill. I mean, I don't think that's terribly germane to what we're experiencing today, okay? So the performance in our global incentive fee line is not being driven by a mark-to-market of a significant number of managed hotels for example.","So I would suggest this question be viewed a little bit more abstractly than that. And there I think it's going to vary a little bit by part of the world. Leeny mentioned that about two-thirds of our incentive fees now are coming from outside the United States. Those contracts are -- they're not all uniform, of course, but we're signing brand new hotels coming into our system with incentive fee formulas and real contributions from them about similar to many of the hotels we signed a decade ago, which are in. And so I don't think there's a meaningful mark-to-market risk there long term.","I think if you look in the United States or to some extent in Europe, there are some above market deals that we did a long time ago. Sometimes they were assets that we controlled and sold. And as those mature, I suspect that owners will try and reduce incentive fees there.","Now to be fair, owners will always try and reduce the net level of fees that they're paying, not just incentive fees but the top line fees as well. And the negotiations there really are about what, kind of, value do your brands and does your loyalty program deliver and what are they worth.","And a long-winded way of saying, of course, if some of those contracts were terminated today and start all over again, I suspect that they would start with a similar formula for incentive fees but probably with a starting point, which is lower than what they're achieving today.","Bill Crow","All right. And my follow-up quickly and if I missed it I apologize. But could you talk about capital return for 2020 given some of the other comments you made about trends being similar next year to this year? Any reason to suspect that you won't return $3 billion or so in capital?","Leeny Oberg","Yeah, I think from a model standpoint that you're right, the fundamentals in many respects when you think about EBITDA growth and the kind of RevPAR and unit growth numbers that we've talked about that makes sense.","But a couple of caveats for you Bill. First of all, we haven't gotten into the detailed planning that we're thinking about whether it's cash taxes or net working capital and the loyalty program and all that. So for the moment let's assume, we're talking kind of more of the same. And the only comment I would make is to remember that we started out this year really at the lower end of our classic 3.0 to 3.5 times leverage ratio. And we did take advantage of that in the early part of the year. So that, kind of, kick we won't have the advantage of next year. But otherwise I would say that your general thesis is correct.","Bill Crow","All right. Thank you all.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Leeny Oberg","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Hi, everyone. Just had a quick question on the new OTA agreement. You mentioned that you have better control of the inventory with third parties. How meaningful is this and will show up more in the RevPAR line item? Or will there be any cost savings associated with it?","Arne Sorenson","Yeah. The -- probably the most significant thing we've done with the OTAs themselves is something we've been doing not just in the brand-new agreements but probably started a bit over a year ago. And then as we have been more aggressive in essentially dialing back the business we'll take from OTAs when we project will be at high occupancies. We've had that right for a few years. We didn't use it as aggressively as we're using it now. And we've talked about that in some of the last number of quarterly calls. It conceivably had a modest negative impact to RevPAR growth year-over-year. But we think factoring in the lower costs associated with the business that came in when we turned those dials down to zero net-net it drove profitability for the hotels. And that will be something that we will continue to -- a tool we'll continue to use.","The other thing, which we disclosed of course is that with Expedia, we did a -- we found a place where actually our alignment with them could be much greater and that was in the wholesale space. Wholesale is another, kind of, third party if you will that is both an expensive channel and sometimes a channel, which makes pricing integrity challenged because wholesale inventory can end up out there being passed from one intermediary to another and we don't often know where it's sold.","And in talking that through with Expedia we thought well they can bring their technological prowess to bear and we can put some discipline in the wholesale market, which should make that both easier to manage from an integrity perspective. And reduce the cost of that business that comes into our system through the wholesale channel.","So, that we're excited about. Obviously, we're -- it's early days in that, but the teams of both Marriott and Expedia are working aggressively. And we think there will be some good outcomes from that.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up, and that would be obviously, conversions will accelerate in a downturn. But right now we're seeing a low RevPAR growth environment. You're also driving down the OTA commissions meaningfully lower.","And you're having more increased direct bookings. So, could we see an acceleration over the next few years, in a low-growth environment? Or would we have to still wait for the downturn for the conversions to accelerate?","Arne Sorenson","I think conversions are quite healthy, even today as we speak. And partly that is, the things that you've just mentioned. It is also about some of the soft brands that, we've used with luxury collection Autograph and Tribute all performing quite well.","We are in a position where we can go out and both offer the top and bottom-line financial benefits. But also have some flexibility on the kind of product we take, that we wouldn't necessarily be the case, if we had only the hard brands.","I think when we get to a weaker economic environment. We will see that some of the hotels that don't really have good pipes of customers, connected to them. They'll also have an incremental reason if you will, that they don't have today which should be helpful then.","Wes Golladay","Thank you.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Wes Golladay","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company.","Kevin Kopelman","Hello. Thanks a lot. And, first of all, Arne, best of luck on the upcoming procedure.","Arne Sorenson","Thank you.","Kevin Kopelman","And Laura thanks for all your help and congrats. So I just wanted to follow-up on signings really quickly. So, could you talk about what approvals and signings were in Q3?","And then, maybe clarify your comment about approaching record signings this year. Are you almost there already in early November? Or is that expected closer to year-end?","And how would you kind of generally characterize the outlook for new signings, going forward, as it stands today?","Arne Sorenson","Yeah. A couple of preliminary comments, developer our developers are the best in the industry by far. But they are a special breed. And they love to do things at -- in the fourth quarter of the year. And so until the bell is rung at the end of the year, you never really know where you're going to end up.","We are -- if you look at, signings through Q3, we're marginally ahead of last year. And again, I think you could say, in the context of a -- that's global comment. But in the context of the uncertainties that are out there about the economy, or about geopolitics, or about other things that's a pretty stunning level of success.","We can't say at this point where we're going to end up the year. But there's a lot that the team is working on. And they'll scramble to work it through. One funny thing, the select service team in the United States as they get into December, they've got this big bell that sits on the table. And they ring the bell every time they sign a contract.","And that bell is ringing all the time in the last couple of weeks of the year. They delivered one of those big bells into my office last December just, to sort of let me share in the fun if you will. But we'll keep working through the end of the year. And obviously, we'll report when we get into January about, where the dust settled on signings, generally all good news.","Kevin Kopelman","Excellent, thanks, Arne.","Arne Sorenson","You bet.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Ari Klein of BMO Capital Markets.","Ari Klein","Hi. Thank you. Maybe just following up on the conversion side of things, can you just talk about in some of the markets that have been a little bit tougher for you? Have you seen conversions increase in those markets?","Arne Sorenson","You're talking about markets in which RevPAR has been softer?","Ari Klein","Yeah, yeah.","Arne Sorenson","Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't -- I'm not sure I can do that justice off the cuff. I do think if you look at one of the highest supply growth environments in the world is the UAE to include Dubai.","And if you look back a couple of years, I would guess that, in Dubai we had done essentially zero conversions. And in the last year or so, we've done a handful of conversions.","And I think in a sense that may prove a little bit of this theory that we were talking about before, which is where businesses under the most pressure in that instance, it's mostly about supply growth not about demand weakening.","But RevPAR has been negative for the industry in Dubai. Not for us necessarily in every quarter, but has been negative for the last -- much in the last couple of years I suppose in Dubai.","And as a consequence, we're seeing a bit better conversion activity there than has ever been the case in the past. That would be an example. I can't give you stats for sort of a group of markets like that if you will.","Ari Klein","Okay, great, yeah thanks for the color. I appreciate it.","Arne Sorenson","Yeah. All right, Laura, will you bring us home?","Laura Paugh","So my last comment there's no better job in the world in investor relations. And no better company in the world than Marriott to do it in. The corporate culture here isn't just about taking care of the customer. It's also about taking care of all of you.","There's a real commitment here to get it right for all of you, with straightforward accurate and fulsome disclosures and candid assessments of business trends. Fortunately it takes a team of people to make that happen and they are terrific.","You've met some of them that have joined me on road shows and conferences over the years. And many of them are listening to this call. So my message to all of my colleagues is thank you for making us look smart for so long. And keep up the good work.","For the investors and sell-side analysts on the call, I am going to miss you. And I've really enjoyed working with you. I hope all of you come to the holiday party on December 5. We're going to have a terrific time.","Arne Sorenson","Thank you, Laura.","Laura Paugh","All right.","Leeny Oberg","Thank you, Laura.","Arne Sorenson","Thank you everybody.","Operator","Thank you for participating in Marriott International's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Marriott International. Sir, you may begin.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","First let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today, May 9, 2017, and will not be updated as actual events unfold.","In our discussion today we'll talk about results excluding merger-related costs, and we'll compare 2017 results to prior-year combined results, which assume Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business was completed on January 1, 2015. Of course, comparisons to our prior year reported results are in last night's press release, which you can find along with the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","So let's get started. Over the past few weeks we held hotel General Manager conferences around the world from Toronto to Mexico City, New Orleans to Dubai, and London to Macau. At those meetings we discussed the tremendous potential of the new Marriott International, whether it was capturing economies of scale from our substantially broader distribution, capitalizing on opportunities for revenue and cost synergies, or building on the excitement about our loyalty programs. The enthusiasm and energy of the General Managers was simply terrific. We are successfully melding two talented organizations and it's exciting to see everyone working together. At every stop, there was tremendous optimism about our future.","I expect our strong results in the first quarter will increase that optimism, given the extensive integration work that is underway, I'm proud of our Hotel teams around the world for their focus on running the business, taking care of guests and driving results. Across our company worldwide systemwide RevPAR increased 3.1% in the first quarter with a nearly 2 percentage point improvement in occupancy. Worldwide RevPAR index rose for both legacy Marriott and legacy Starwood portfolios, increasing nearly one full point on a combined basis. Our operating teams kept their eye on the ball translating RevPAR growth into 100 basis points of higher house profit margin. We added more than 17,000 rooms in the quarter and increased the development pipeline by nearly 10,000 rooms.","With the improvement in RevPAR and margins and continued growth in distribution, our first quarter combined fee revenue grew 6%, adjusted EBITDA increased 10%, and adjusted diluted EPS rose 38% over the prior year combined results. In North America, systemwide RevPAR rose 3.1% in the quarter. Our hotels in the greater Washington D.C. area benefited from January's inauguration and Women's March. Systemwide RevPAR in D.C. increased 15% in the quarter compared to the prior year and well ahead of our expectations.","Performance in Hawaii also exceeded expectations. Strong transient demand came from both mainland and international guests, pushing systemwide RevPAR up 7%. The rough weather on the U.S. West Coast likely encouraged some last-minute bookings to the islands.","Demand in Canada was particularly strong with comparable constant dollar RevPAR rising 10% in the quarter. This year is Canada's 150th anniversary and Montreal's 375th. With favorable exchange rates our hotels in Canada are hosting more international guests ready to celebrate. Laura is already packing her bags for the summer.","While these markets were particularly strong, RevPAR also exceeded expectations in many other North American markets. Across the North American region, group RevPAR rose 7.7% year-over-year, benefiting from the events in Washington and the shift in the Easter holiday to the second quarter. Group RevPAR modestly exceeded our expectations due to strong attendance at group meetings while meeting planners continued to add last minute food, beverage and ancillary spending.","Full year 2017 group revenue booking pace for all our North American full service hotels is up 1.6% over a strong 2016 group year. We've seen some weakness in new bookings from small groups in recent months, but with very strong occupancy rates at many hotels and 86% of our anticipated 2017 group business already on the books, space constraints have also made adding new groups more challenging.","Meeting planners recognizing that meeting space is filling continue to book earlier in some cases for multiple years, a practice we have encouraged. By the way with nearly 4,500 hotels in North America we have a great selection for meeting planners whether they are booking a large meeting for multiple years or a small meeting for next week. In fact in the first quarter, group RevPAR at our limited service hotels increased 10%, and booking pace for our legacy Marriott limited service hotels for the full year is up over 5%.","Transient RevPAR in North America was up nearly 2% year-over-year in the quarter constrained by the timing of Easter and high occupancy rates. At the same time, transient demand exceeded our expectations, and we improved the mix of transient revenue drawing more high-rated retail and corporate customers and reducing discounts. In the second quarter, we expect lower group business year-over-year due to the timing of Easter. As a result we expect North American systemwide RevPAR will be flat to up 2% in the second quarter, and will increase 1% to 3% for the full year. On a preliminary basis, April year-to-date RevPAR systemwide for North America is up roughly 2%.","Our North America 2017 RevPAR guidance is 100 basis points ahead of the guidance we issued in February. To be sure, transient demand was better than expected in the first quarter and our outlook for full year transient business has improved a bit. But even in February, when we last issued guidance, we were expecting our first quarter RevPAR growth would be somewhat over the midpoint of our 0% to 2% RevPAR forecast. So moving our North America RevPAR guidance to 1% to 3% isn't quite as large a shift as it may first appear.","In the Asia-Pacific region we're encouraged by recent economic growth. First quarter systemwide RevPAR increased 5% with strength in retail and corporate business. RevPAR in India and Indonesia increased at double-digit rates, while in Greater China systemwide RevPAR rose 5% with strength in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. Hotels in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau outperformed our expectations in the quarter. Given these trends we expect our second quarter and full year RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region will increase at a mid single digit rate. This is higher than our prior guidance due to strengthening transient demand.","RevPAR also exceeded expectations in Europe, increasing 7% year-over-year on solid transient and group demand, and strong international arrivals. European room nights sold to U.S. travelers alone increased at a mid-teens rate in the first quarter. Greater group business in the UK and Germany allowed us to improve the mix of transient business in those markets, and RevPAR growth at our Paris hotels was ahead of expectations. We expect our hotels in Europe will continue to show strength through 2017, and we expect our second quarter and full-year RevPAR will increase at a mid single digit rate, a bit higher than our last guidance.","In the Middle East RevPAR growth in the first quarter was flat, consistent with our expectations. Geopolitical unrest, low oil prices, and lower government spending continued to depress hotel results. The good news was in Africa where RevPAR increased more than 18% with strength in Egypt. RevPAR in South Africa alone increased 9%, as the weak Rand continued to attract tourism to this great destination.","Middle East RevPAR continues to be a challenge to forecast. While we aren't modeling a meaningful change in oil prices or government spending, comparisons should get easier in most markets as the year progresses. As a result we expect Middle East Africa RevPAR will be modestly lower in the second quarter, but improve in the second half, resulting in flattish performance for the full year 2017.","In the Caribbean and Latin America systemwide RevPAR in the first quarter declined 2% year-over-year. RevPAR in Mexico increased at a high teens rate, while RevPAR declined in the Caribbean, largely due to lower leisure demand with the shift in the Easter holiday. Lower RevPAR in South America reflected a weak economy and oversupply in Brazil. You may recall that the Zika virus began to impact our business in February of 2016. We expect easier comparisons in the region late in the year, and stronger performance in the Caribbean in the second quarter, due to the shifting Easter holiday. This should yield a low single digit increase in RevPAR in both the second quarter and full-year 2017.","With this solid improvement in international RevPAR, we expect second quarter and full-year worldwide 2017 RevPAR will increase 1% to 3%. Our full-year worldwide RevPAR growth outlook is about 50 basis points higher than our prior guidance, largely due to better than expected results in the first quarter, and improving demand in Asia and Europe.","In the first quarter, margins at company operated hotels improved 100 basis points due to stronger RevPAR growth, better productivity, lower food costs and improved billing processes. Productivity was helped by ongoing service innovations such as Your Choice, our program that allows loyalty members the option to choose between daily housekeeping or bonus loyalty points.","In the first quarter, our development pipeline increased to over 430,000 rooms, including 166,000 rooms already under construction. Today according to Smith Travel Research, one hotel in three hotels under construction in the U.S. and one hotel in four hotels under construction worldwide is associated with one of our brands.","Our development success is impressive given the development climate in North America. While lending has eased for open hotels, financing for new hotel construction is challenging, with growing equity requirements. Construction costs have moved higher and we've seen some project delays in North America due to shortages of skilled subcontractors. Hotel development is picking up in Asia, even as new construction moderates in China and India. We are seeing an uptick in conversions in those countries and greater construction elsewhere in the Pacific Rim. We continue to see considerable limited service development interest in Europe overall with growing interest in Western Europe. Limited service hotels are also growing in popularity with Middle East developers, particularly in tertiary markets.","Demand for our brands remains high and we are on track to deliver 6% net unit growth in 2017. Throughout the company our teams are making tremendous progress on the Starwood integration. We've already transitioned HR systems for Starwood Hotels in the U.S. and expect other continents will follow later in 2017. In March we added 36,000 associates to the Marriott payroll system. For our guests all our hotels worldwide are now on an integrated system for guest event and social media feedback. This summer we expect to publish harmonized global brand standards, which, along with regular audits, is an essential step in establishing property accountability and maintaining guest satisfaction.","We've converted Starwood owned and managed hotels in North America to our procurement system. Elsewhere in the world we are reviewing and renegotiating vendor contracts to leverage our purchasing power. We are also using our purchasing platforms to track actual hotel spend to ensure the hotels realize the savings. We have already migrated all U.S. Starwood Hotels to Marriott's OTA contracts, Hotels in other continents will follow soon. This should reduce the cost of OTA bookings, as well as improve inventory control. We are rolling out Marriott's guest room entertainment platform to Starwood properties. This will lay the foundation for an enhanced television experience including On Demand streaming content and services. We are also enhancing the SPG app to enable guests at most hotels to take advantage of mobile check-in and checkout.","In April we transitioned over 100 company operated Starwood Hotels in the U.S. to our above property shared service model for finance and accounting. We are on track to unify our financial reporting infrastructure in early 2018, and to realize a common technology platform for reservations and loyalty programs in late 2018. Drawing from both legacy Marriott and legacy Starwood staff, cross functional teams are coordinating meaningful change in virtually every aspect of our company's operation. This effort is enormous and we are seeing meaningful results today, and even more just over the horizon. I'm incredibly proud of the many people working on this integration, and they have my sincere thanks. As you can tell, we are excited about our business, and encouraged by recent trends.","Now to explain how RevPAR and unit growth translates to EPS growth, let me turn things over to Leeny. Leeny?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you, Arne. For the first quarter of 2017, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.01, $0.12 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance, $0.87 to $0.91. Fee revenue contributed $0.06 of the outperformance due to better than expected RevPAR growth, branding fees and incentive fees. Results on our owned, leased and other line outperformed by three pennies largely due to better than expected property results.","Adjusted general and administrative costs were better than expected by about $0.03 mainly due to open positions and timing. Worldwide base fees increased $7 million or 3% over prior-year combined amounts, reflecting unit growth and RevPAR improvement offset somewhat by terminations, hotels that converted from management to franchise agreements, and foreign exchange.","With higher RevPAR and growing distribution, franchise fees increased 10% in the quarter. Also, included in franchise fees are application fees, relicensing fees and fees from our timeshare, credit card and residential businesses. Together, these fees totaled nearly $100 million in the quarter, 14% higher than combined results in the prior year. Branding fees were particularly strong.","Incentive fees increased 2% year-over-year in the first quarter constrained by deferred fees recognized in 2016, and unfavorable foreign exchange. At the same time, incentive fees were about $17 million better than expected, with $10 million of the outperformance coming from a significant number of North American full-service hotels and $7 million from hotels in the Asia-Pacific region.","We expect roughly $5 million of our North America incentive fees outperformance at seasonal hotels will be reversed later in the year. Since hotels in the Asia-Pacific region typically don't have owner priorities reversals there are not likely. For the second quarter, we expect worldwide incentive fees will likely be flattish due to the timing of Easter. For the full year, with stronger RevPAR guidance and strong margins, we believe total incentive fees could increase at a mid single digit rate.","Owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses totaled $81 million in the first quarter, a 6% decline from the prior year. Improved performance was more than offset by lower termination fees, which declined $7 million, and the impact of asset sales in the past 12 months, which reduced year-over-year results by $4 million. Owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses was $16 million better than we expected in the first quarter, largely due to forecast beats at hotels in Atlanta, Barcelona, London, Toronto, and Tokyo, as well as about $6 million in higher than expected termination fees.","In the second quarter, we expect owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses will total roughly $90 million, compared to $115 million in the prior year. We estimate the negative impact of asset sales will be about $15 million in the second quarter, and we also expect lower results in Rio de Janeiro and New York. Our guidance for owned and leased hotels assumes no further asset sales this year.","For the full year, we expect owned leased results will total $340 million to $350 million, compared to $426 million in 2016. The full-year comparison to last year's combined results includes a $40 million negative impact from asset sales, including the Westin Maui, $25 million to $30 million in lower hotel results, again largely in Rio and New York, and $15 million in lower termination fees.","While asset sales reduced owned leased results they also increased management fees and free up capital for reinvestment in our business or return to shareholders. Adjusted general and administrative expenses declined by $36 million in the first quarter and beat our expectations by $17 million, largely reflecting cost reductions, open positions, and timing as the integration continues. We expect G&A will total $220 million to $225 million in the second quarter, and $880 million to $890 million for the full year. Compared to our prior guidance, the improvement in our full year outlook for G&A largely reflects the better than expected results achieved in the first quarter. We continue to expect to achieve our annualized $250 million in cost synergies by 2018, including over $200 million in annualized savings in 2017.","In the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 10%. Adjusted EPS in 2017 should total $3.92 to $4.09. An increase of 19% to 24% over prior-year combined results. For the full year, we expect 2017 adjusted EBITDA will total $3.1 billion to $3.195 billion, an increase of 4% to 7%. You may recall that in our February guidance for 2017, adjusted EBITDA was 3% to 6% higher than the prior year.","We've increased our estimate of adjusted EBITDA since February to reflect higher fees, lower G&A, and stronger profitability of owned and leased hotels, somewhat offset by the sale of the Westin Maui. As you can see on page A-10 in the release, our new estimate of full year adjusted EBITDA also reflects some fine tuning of the add backs to net income, including correcting the share based compensation line by $27 million. That amount should have been excluded, as it was the merger-related portion of the share-based compensation costs.","Investment spending for the year could total $500 million to $700 million including about $175 million in maintenance spending. To-date in 2017, we have recycled roughly $320 million through asset sales and note repayments. Cash balances were high at quarter end as we received the roughly $300 million in proceeds from the sale of the Westin Maui on March 31.","We repurchased over 10 million shares through last week for approximately $925 million in 2017. We anticipate returning over $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2017. Our guidance does not include the impact of possible asset sales beyond those already completed.","We appreciate your interest in Marriott. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from David Katz with Telsey Group.","David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Morning, everyone.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, David.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Morning.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Morning. Congrats on a nice quarter.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you.","David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","I wanted to just probe a little bit more about the guidance, and I know you've given quite a bit of detail around a lot of things, but if I'm trying to balance between your perspective on the economic climate taken in total for the remainder of the year versus the execution of the integration and just the execution of the business combination, how much of your improvement today would you say you would allocate to both?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Oh, that's a good question. And I'm not sure we've necessarily broken it down that way in our internal calculations, although clearly, as we've noted, the driving \u2013 the most significant driving factors in our increase in our RevPAR guidance was the strength of the first quarter, including in North America and the rest of the world, and the momentum that's particularly occurring in Europe and Asia-Pacific.","The U.S. results, North American results, as well as the global results, obviously were stronger in the first quarter in part because we took share, so we talked about one point \u2013 nearly one point index growth in both the Marriott and Starwood portfolios. And, you know, it would be hard fairly to attribute all of that one point increase to the success of the integration, but I don't at the same time think that it's entirely unrelated to that.","And so I think, we are getting a little bit of juice that is coming from bringing these two companies together. At the same time, you know, clearly strength around the world was because of a stronger demand environment as well, so I think the economic \u2013 underlying economic situation is also contributing. I can't give you percentages for each.","David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Right.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","But both are a factor.","David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Got it and if we're looking at the \u2013 what's left of the owned portfolios of the combined company, Leeny, where are we in terms of selling things off and how we should \u2013 I heard you that you've guided as though the owned portfolio remains where it is. But what inning or what can you tell us about how much progress you've made, and what we might reasonably expect you to sell in the remainder of the year and into next year?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","I think, David, we continue to be comfortable with the commentary that we've made before about selling over $1.5 billion of real estate by the time we get to the end of 2018. I would also say that we continue to be confident that there will be further asset sales in 2017. Beyond that as I'm sure you know, predicting the exact closing and timing of specific transactions is very hard to do, but I think, we're pleased with the progress, and we're moving along.","David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. I wanted to clarify -","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Robin.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","How are you? Thanks. About group booking comments. It sounded like what you have on the books for the rest of the year, the pace is sort of like North American full-service group is up 1.6%, and I think, last quarter that you had said it was pacing up 3%, but I don't know if I'm using the same exact metric in both cases. So maybe you can \u2013 can you talk a little bit about, it sounds like then maybe it did slow in Q1. Just perspective.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, we were in the high 2%s a quarter ago, and again this is full-service in North America, so it's down about a point. And that's \u2013 you know, it's not entirely rare to see us \u2013 see those numbers moderate over the course of the year, as in the year group bookings are the only thing that obviously can \u2013 or we think, that obviously can raise those numbers.","We made a point of explaining in our prepared comments that we think we got about 86% of the group business that we anticipate for the year on the books, and obviously occupancies are running high, which means that we are seeing the booking window lengthen a bit, and we are seeing a bit more growth in limited service group business than in full-service space. At the same time, I think there is still some cautionary \u2013 what \u2013 something cautionary there about the data. It shows that we've got group customers that are a little reticent to make big commitments, but generally this is pretty healthy. And so on balance, we would say don't be alarmed by it, and we see good growth going forward.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","And just based on how much you have booked for the year, where you're pacing now that up 1.6%, is that where you think the year ends? Or it sounded like you said maybe things could moderate during the year. So just want \u2013 is that \u2013 does it end up being only up 1%? Or just how do you think about how...","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, that's probably the best single number we would have at the moment. The \u2013 it is kind of a funny year and I think you've heard this from some of the other players. Partly this is because of the holiday schedule and partly it's just the normal vicissitudes of group bookings. But Q1 and Q4 are the strongest quarters of the year, Q2 and Q3 will be a bit weaker and that makes it a little bit hard to forecast all of this stuff. But I would think that, you know, in the high 1s, maybe someplace in that place, would be the best single number we can give you today.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harry Curtis, Nomura.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, Harry.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Harry.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Just following up on that line of questioning, how is the group pace looking for 2018? It's still early, but \u2013 and maybe if you can comment on price, as well.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Let's see here. The \u2013 we're up in the mid single digits, between 4% and 5% for North American full-service for calendar 2018.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Okay. And then my second question, just going back to the possible asset sales, I just want to make sure that our assumptions are right. The balance of owned hotels in the Starwood portfolio, is that roughly 5,200 rooms in North America?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sounds about \u2013 in North America, I'll get you the specific numbers, but...","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Including Canada, yeah.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Including Canada, that would \u2013 sounds about right.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Okay, and is it reasonable to think that roughly 300 a key is not \u2013 is an okay ballpark to be in in terms of its market value?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I'm not going there, Harry. Each \u2013 each \u2013 that's like kind of saying that Tremont in Chicago is the same as the St. Regis in New York is the same as, you know, Toronto Sheraton. You know, they're each one- just like our children, each one is very unique.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Yeah, well, you know, you've got to throw out the pitch to get a hit. So, yeah, I'll just end it there. Thanks a lot.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks. You mentioned the Starwood companies moving over to your the Avendra platform and benefiting from lower OTA fees. And I was just wondering if you could quantify just for sort of the average hotel owner, who's moved now and is enjoying these benefits, do you have a sense of what kind of margin expansion they might be seeing just sort of on average?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, first of all, Smedes, I would say so far, very little. So far, in general, this all happened during the first quarter in both cases. So really in terms of Q1 margins, although there's some great work done in benchmarking and working on a host of things across the brand, coming from OTAs and from Avendra, next to nothing.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, well, maybe then as those things are adapted more, and they have a little more under their belt. Do you have a sense of what it could do for the typical Starwood Hotel? Or legacy Starwood Hotel?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","It's going to vary so tremendously in terms of (32:31) ...","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","... for OTAs. Because remember that in the U.S. it's going to be very different than overseas, and then again Avendra is largely a U.S.-base and there again if you're a suburban hotel that doesn't have a lot of group versus if you have a ton of group that buys lots of food and beverage, it's going to vary \u2013 it's going to really vary tremendously. But I will say, it will definitely, you know, be \u2013 it will be noticeable in terms of margins from the benefit, but I wouldn't be able to quantify an average.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And I just wanted to ask, you mentioned some hotels converting from management to franchise, and it's not \u2013 I mean, it's not sort of a thing as my kids would say, is that an issue going forward for Marriott? Are there a lot of options for people just to convert to franchise or is that just something that's sort of, well, kind of a one-off general sort of exception?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I think, it is a trend we've seen for a number of years and is likely to continue, even as we grow the managed portfolio, particularly globally and in the big-box space with new hotels. I think, in many instances, we've seen some hotels get to the point where they need substantial new capital for renovation. Often they're sold in the context of bringing that new capital in, and there is more capital eager to invest in well-branded assets, well-branded assets that have flexibility on who's running the day-to-day operations, and we have seen that it is in our interests, as well, to make those transactions happen in a way that brings the capital interests, helps to bring them up to standard.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Particularly in North America.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. And which is very much a North American phenomenon.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. It's actually Anthony Powell here for Felicia. How are you guys doing?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good, how about you?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Anthony.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Doing great. You mentioned that you're seeing better higher rated corporate transient demand. Could you single out any industries that are driving that growth or any particular markets where you're seeing the strength? And also I believe last call you mentioned that you were trying to sign up more corporate contracts. How's that going?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I think generally, we are \u2013 we feel a bit more encouraged by corporate travel this quarter than we did a quarter ago in the guidance that we provided. But let's be careful about throwing all caution to the wind here. I think you've got, in the corporate travel landscape, lots and lots of different stories. Obviously the energy patch continues to remain relatively weak. In fact I think we were more optimistic about Houston a quarter ago than we are today. We sort of felt like we had hit bottom, and today I think we're a little less confident of that.","By comparison, you look at the strength we saw in Washington, you look at the strength that we're seeing still in a number of western markets, we see companies that are reporting better corporate profits and I think as a consequence, we feel a bit better based both on the actual results in Q1, which to be sure was benefited by Easter, but also by sort of what we feel like is tenor in the marketplace. And we have moved more of our transient business, including business transient business, towards retail and to special corporate and away from discount, and so those things are driving a bit of a mix shift within the transient bucket. All good news.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it, thanks. And on your RevPAR index gain can you attribute any of that to customers allocating more of their travel spend to your system due to the merger or are you just better at selling and getting more groups into the hotels?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, I think by definition it means we're getting a bit more of their spend, since we have relatively taken share of the industry. We don't get real time data that would allow us to know exactly how to calculate that, but we are encouraged.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Great. That's it for me. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Patrick.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Patrick.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Question for you when we're thinking about your North American RevPAR guidance of 1% to 3%. I think, on a previous question you mentioned or indicated that group was sort of in the 1%-ish to 2% range. How do you think about your two other customer segments, the individual business travel and the leisure? Where would they fit in that range?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Maybe Laura or Betsy have got something precise here on that, but generally, I would think that leisure will be the strongest. You obviously have some markets which have got complexities around that answer, because of Zika or because of other trends. And obviously those comparisons will get easier as the year goes along, but generally I think we would say leisure is the strongest.","The transient, business transient, is obviously the shortest booking and therefore the area we've got the least visibility into it. But I would think that corporate transient travel would be comparable, maybe a little bit better than group. And those are all North American centric numbers too. When you look around the rest of the world obviously you see different dynamics.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Can I ask a follow-up question? In your Investor Day, you had talked about some initial steps that you were making with Sheraton identifying sort of the lower-end properties and targeting them first. Can I get a \u2013 I'd like to hear a little bit of update on what's \u2013 how that's progressing.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, we are \u2013 we're encouraged by the progress we've made so far, and as we talked about at the Analyst Day, we have \u2013 we're well underway in conversations with our Sheraton owners and franchisees to make sure that we are getting the input we need to have from them to publish good, detailed brand standards for the Sheraton brand. At the same time, we have looked at both the bottom 25 and then the next bottom 25, so the bottom 50 Sheraton Hotels, and that's by and large relying on guest survey data and what the guests tell us about the way the hotels are being received.","We are in discussions probably with 80% \u2013 80% to 85% of those owners of those 50 hotels. Nearly half of those 50, renovations are already underway. And we've got another handful or so where we've got plans that are fairly specific that are evolving. And so that gets us to close to 60% or so of those bottom 50 that we've already got good movement on. By the way, of those 60%, there will be 2 or 3 which we already think pretty clearly will leave the system, because it doesn't make sense for us to keep them and for them to get the kind of capital that would be necessary for them to meet brand standards. But all of that gives us encouragement, though this will be a multi-year effort.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning, everyone. Was wondering if you could just maybe comment a little bit more on the increase to the capital return guidance. So it looks like it moved up fairly substantially versus the last outlook provided. What was the kind of biggest driver, biggest surprise to where you \u2013 to what you'd provided kind of earlier?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","So I think the easiest way to think about it, Shaun, is that you have the Westin Maui, which at $317 million at the end of the quarter, definitely gives us more room for the rest of the year, and then you've got the reality that our EBITDA was higher than we expected, and when you think about how you can lever that and use it, it gets you very quickly to $2 billion.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then sort of the same question as it relates to the costs and the G&A that came in in the quarter, Leeny, but as we think about the $210 million and you guys clearly said a piece of this is timing and related, but kind of what pieces or what components should start to ramp as we move sequentially through the year? And is there any possibility that ends up being, still being a little bit conservative as we just think about some of the puts and takes of the integration here?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, I hope so. That's first and foremost. I hope that's conservative. So the way I would think about it is that about, call it not quite half, of the outperformance, I think, you could argue is timing-related, and really will be spent some time in Q2, Q3, or Q4. But then, also, as you think about the hiring that needs to happen in MEA and Europe from the close-down of that, that was definitely part of what ended up driving the outperformance, and all of that hiring is now ongoing, and so the rest of the quarters won't experience that same gap in openings that were held in Q1.","So to make a long story short, we do think, when you put the numbers together, that there is probably a little bit more additional savings as we go through the year, but it's also going to be matched with the timing delays that we had in the spending in Q1. So that's how we really get to taking the beat in Q1, and kind of using that for the full year.","The other thing I'll point out is that remember, if you're comparing to combined company results, that that \u2013 you have to be careful as we look at that quarter to quarter going through the year, because as we moved through 2016, you were finding that there were people leaving Starwood, so the quarter over quarter comparisons get more difficult. When you look at it the full year, as my comments said, we're comfortable that it will be at least $200 million of the $250 million achieved in 2017.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And, sorry, last one, but did you ever \u2013 had you ever given that $200 million before?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, we talked actually at our last call, we talked about thinking that we'd be roughly $185 million of this $250 million that we felt like in 2017. And frankly, now with the beat, I think we're confident that the $200 million is at least a good number for 2017.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just back to the topic of group and group pace for 2017, when you look at the components of the group pace, is there a big difference between association or large attendance group versus non-association or smaller attendance group?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Short answer is, I don't know. I would \u2013 let me just take a peek here at these notes. Looks like, in order of strength, association would be the strongest. Then corporate, and not surprisingly, you get into things like government, government would be weakest. But not a huge gap between them, between association and corporate.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then your earlier comments, in your earlier comments, Arne, you mentioned that financing for new hotel construction is challenging. Are you willing or are you getting requests to invest more in some of these new projects?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","We're not really getting requests to invest in these new projects.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","No. Not meaningfully.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","The bulk of this is about select service franchise development in North America. That is not a place where we have ever really used our balance sheet in a material way, and wouldn't anticipate that that would ever change. I do think, you're not really asking this question, but I'll go ahead and talk about it anyway. I think because of land and construction costs and financing for new builds, I think we're likely to continue to see that 2015 was the sort of peak for signings of select service growth in the United States. And 2016 was obviously strong, as well. I think, 2017 will be strong, but will not be at the same levels that we saw in 2015.","And the only way we'll see that ramp back up, I think, would be with definitive proof of a stronger GDP environment, and stronger performance environment, than is even reflected in the guidance that we're giving today.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everybody. Just wanted to talk, shift gears a little bit. Can we talk a little bit about Airbnb. I know it's a topic that hasn't come up in a few months. Seems like there's been a lot of regulation over the past few months surrounding Airbnb, whether it be in New York or San Francisco or across Europe or other cities around the world. I'm wondering if you're seeing, if that regulation is giving you confidence in your outlook, or if that regulation is actually starting to impact your numbers or whether you don't have enough visibility into that yet.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You know, it's a good question, Ryan. I think, the answer is that Airbnb and the home-sharing phenomenon has probably been less impactful to the RevPAR numbers that we've posted the last number of years than folks might first have imagined. And similarly, is probably less impactful today even with what's happening on the regulatory side in a number of cities and states.","Now, we will continue to analyze this data as much as we possibly can to understand it, but I think by and large, they are serving a mostly different customer than what we serve at Marriott. They are skewed much more towards leisure. They are skewed much more towards a value-centric customer in the bulk of their business, and if their business is under pressure because of a regulatory environment, I'm not sure necessarily that that customer immediately pops up and shows up in our hotel suites.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","That makes sense. And then I guess, you know, as you think about Airbnb and where they might be going, you know, with the regulatory environment limiting their growth, it seems like there might be an avenue for growth as they potentially enter the OTA market with the idea that they've got proprietary inventory coupled with they already have access to that leisure traveler. Has any \u2013 is that something you guys have given any thought to, particularly as you're negotiating with the OTAs in terms of trying to get better commission rates given Airbnb's commission rate is so much lower than what you guys typically pay to the Expedias and the Pricelines?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, well I'm not sure that clearly Airbnb's total rates are all that different when you look at what they charge the host and the guest, and combine those two as transactional costs in the platform, but let's stand back maybe for a minute from Airbnb specifically. Obviously, we have spent a lot of time analyzing our relationship with intermediaries. We are interested in having those relationships work for us, as well as they possibly can, and be as cost effective as they can. That is about of course negotiating our relationships with them regularly when they come up, and fundamentally it's about making sure we got a loyalty program that gives us the power to have a relationship with a huge percentage of our transient guests, particularly. And we've got, you know, continued great news on the loyalty space with not just 100 million members that we talked about at our Analyst Day, but signing up a million a month or more, and we feel really good about the way that's going.","None of our hotels as far as I know has a single room on Airbnb. They certainly should not have a room on Airbnb so we are not today looking at that company as an intermediary in a way that's anything similar to the relationships we have with other OTAs around the world.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","All right. That's it for me. Thanks there. Thanks, Arne.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Arne -","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Bill.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Given all the \u2013 all the what you've already chopped on the integration and what lies ahead, I think you talked about a couple of the things out there for next year, where does the biggest risk lie?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, so the \u2013 I think, we're off to a good start on the integration, but I think, we are by no means declaring victory today. We've got a lot of work ahead of us. I think, the team is performing extraordinarily well in getting at that work, and they're incredibly energized by what has been accomplished and what we have to accomplish, and what we think we can achieve by accomplishing it.","There are plenty of risks around. I think, if you identify one it's going to be around technology. And we are \u2013 you know, it takes longer, it costs more than any of us would like, and I don't think that's unique to Marriott or unique to the hotel business. I think, when you look across the corporate landscape, it is what we see in company after company.","And we've got to make sure that we are moving as quickly as we possibly can, because these technology platforms will really allow us to drive, particularly the kind of revenue lift that we think is available, by having one reservations platform and one loyalty platform. And of course, secondarily also allow us to deliver these technology platforms at lower costs to our owners, because we'll be supporting one and not two. And even as we pull those platforms together and do all those things, we want to make sure that we are continuing to innovate and do the kind of new things that our customers expect us to do.","So a recent example of that is our investment in PlacePass which is really an online or virtual concierge which helps our customers plan for their trips before going. It's a space that we're very excited about, but we want to make sure our technology platforms allow that to be linked to our loyalty sites and our dotcom sites so that we can drive that business even as we do that and other integration work. So long way of saying technology would be probably the thing that we are maybe most, what, frustrated by the cost, and time associated with it, maybe most fearful about it, but also most convinced that it will drive upside long-term to the performance of the portfolio.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful. And then if, as an industry leader, I was wondering if you could give us some comments on a couple of headlines that are out there. The first one is the industry's efforts to lobby Congress regarding Expedia and Priceline. The second one is kind of this airline overbooking news and whether you guys have considered whether you need to make changes to your booking patterns, or, you know, to take away the risk of walk-in guests.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, there \u2013 those are two hot topics. Thank you for that.","The \u2013 let's talk about overbooking first. We, about, oh, I don't know, a year and a half ago, two years ago, we expanded the cancellation window for our transient travelers from 6:00 p.m. the day of arrival to midnight the day before arrival, and that was a very useful tool to reduce overbooking. We do have, in a couple of markets today, a few pilots where we're looking at going to midnight of the day before, so that would be sort of like 48 hours before, and there are a number of reasons we're testing that, but I think that could be helpful on overbooking, as well.","Obviously, this is \u2013 there's nothing worse to it \u2013 for a traveler than to show up at a hotel with a confirmed reservation and not have the room there, and so we're trying very \u2013 we measure how many times we have to walk a guest. We obviously do pay for that first night if they end up someplace else, but it's still not a great experience. And so that's an area where we continue to put some effort, and obviously we'd like to be at perfection. We'd like to be full every night without a single room empty and without a single customer walked. Now, that's not necessarily something that we will ever achieve, but I think, we're making good progress on that.","I don't have much to say about industry efforts on the Hill about OTAs. I'm not sure I know exactly what the AHLA is doing there. I know there have been things over the course of the last year or two years about real transparency. I think that is not so much about what the conduct of the big OTAs has been, but it is conduct of affiliates that pop up and somehow exist under their sites or exist independently, and may not really have the inventory, and so they may be selling rooms to customers who think they've booked a room in one of our hotels or somebody else's hotel and they show up and actually there's no record of that. And that's probably the thing that we want to be most thoughtful about, because even though we have nothing to do with that booking, it reflects poorly on us, because the customer thinks they've booked a room in our hotel.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you for your time.","Arne M.

Do you plan to continue to offer similar levels of member discounts going forward, or do you expect to curtail those over time?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I think member discounts are here to stay. And the reason I say that is because we are encouraged by what we've seen. And obviously we want to make sure that through the loyalty program, we have the relationship with customers that is \u2013 that doesn't require them to sit down and do a spreadsheet calculation to figure out whether it's in their interest to be members of our loyalty program. But instead, where they know without having really to even think about it that if I concentrate my stays with Marriott, I'm going to get \u2013 I'm going to get great rooms, I'm going to get points for my stay, I'm going to get free WiFi, I'm going to get mobile services.

I've got two quick follow-ups.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Okay.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","First on the net unit growth, what's the breakdown of the pipeline between legacy Starwood and Marriott brands? And how has the pipeline and associated process evolved since the acquisition closed?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Oh, these are good quizzes here, Stephen, at the end. I think the Marriott, legacy Marriott pipeline is proportionately a bit bigger than the legacy Starwood pipeline. So if you think about Marriott and Starwood before closing, Marriott was about twice the size of Starwood, I think in total rooms, 800,000-ish rooms to 400,000-ish rooms. And I think when you look at the pipeline, we're probably, oh, you know, 65%\/35%, maybe something like that which would suggest the Marriott pipeline is a little bit bigger, which is not really that surprising. Marriott had many more brands playing in this select service place in the United States than Starwood did, and that's obviously where a number of these rooms in the pipeline from deals signed in 2015, 2016, and currently, are there.","In terms of the way the process has changed, there are \u2013 there's nothing really revolutionary. I mean I think Starwood used a similar approach to valuing deals that Marriott did. There were some modest difference in the way the incentives worked for the developers. There are \u2013 which probably intensify the focus on value as opposed to just rooms, as we go forward. I think, Marriott, too, has had a bit different approach to territorials maybe, and particularly cross-brand territorials in some deals. But I view most of those changes as fairly minor, and, you know, as a consequence we've put the team \u2013 the development team was in place globally by the end of calendar 2016. They're working extraordinarily well together, and I think things are going swimmingly.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And then one other quick clarification. I think it was on Shaun's earlier question on synergies. As you captured a bit more in the first quarter maybe than what you expected, are you finding new opportunities, or is there simply a pull forward of things you had already identified?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","I would say things that we identify, the best I can describe it, Stephen, is maybe in some respects happening a little bit sooner than we had expected.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great.

Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Jared.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Just to ask the group question a little differently. Do you have the number for total group production in the quarter for all future periods? And then have you seen any change in cancellations or attrition?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","The cancellation\/attrition story is generally quite positive. So there's less cancellation and attrition than would have been the case in prior periods. Group business, all group bookings in Q1 for all future periods was down modestly in revenue compared to the same time last year. However, last year was up massively from the same measure in 2015 and prior years. So while, obviously, we'd like to be up in every year over and over again, I don't think that the modest decline in revenue on the books in Q1 for all future periods is that concerning.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then, Arne, I think in the past, you used to provide the percentage of your North American hotels that were currently earning IMFs. Do you have that number? And where do you see the next direction for that number? Do you think it will be up or down?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","I've actually got it, Stephen (sic) [Jared] (1:02:10). And if we're looking at the percentage, in the first quarter, we're looking at 60% in the total portfolio with about 47% in North America, as compared to a year ago, very similar worldwide. It's about 61%. This is on a combined basis. So this is for both companies.","And I think in general, there's a very slight difference between a year ago and this year first quarter, and that's a result of one portfolio of limited service hotels that was barely in the money a year ago Q1 and was not in the money in Q1. Though, to be honest, we expect them to be in the money in IMF this year and 2017, so we'd expect it to kind of get back to where it was for the whole company.","The only comment I would make where we see it going is that clearly with international, with the growth in the Asia Pacific portfolio which tends not to have owners' priority, as you might imagine, that is weighing more and more into the percentage of hotels earning incentive fees. While in the U.S., when you've got a midpoint RevPAR of 2%, it's very difficult to hold onto margins or increase them very much relative to earning more incentive fees. So, overall, if we continue to see this kind of RevPAR environment, you might actually year-over-year see North America's percentage not growing, but international continuing to grow.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.

And then on the corporate side, can you give an update of your top 300 customers demand from that segment and are you seeing a difference between select service and the full service hotels?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You said top 200 customers? What did you say?","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Top 300. I believe you guys give that statistic every so often.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Top 300. Well, that's news to me. On the group, generally, yes. I mean I think we are more focused on food and beverage and ancillary spend because of the volume we've got of group business, and I think that will continue to be the case as long as group business on the books remains strong. And I think the top 300 accounts generally are in positive shape.","Now, we've got a sort of plus 4%-ish for Q1 for the top 300 accounts, but remember there we get the benefit of Easter, so March was meaningfully stronger this year than last year for business travel, because we didn't have that holiday. And I think that includes the group business as well, which is also primarily related to the calendar. But still net-net, again, it's a bit why we are encouraged on our expectations for the balance of the year.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then between the full service hotels and select service hotels, we're seeing a lot of supply on the select service but demand seems quite strong as well. So I wonder if the business traveler for select service is doing a little bit better than the full service. Can you comment on that?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I think they're both actually performing quite well. And if you look at the RevPAR numbers which we published by brand. You'll see that the full-service hotels performed extraordinarily well in Q1. I think the select service portfolio was strong, though, too. And I think that's a sign that demand generally was strong in the quarter.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks. Most of my questions were answered. But if I could, just on the incentive fee front, when you guys think about some of the changes that you've made with the Starwood portfolio, including getting them on your pre-negotiated OTA rate and improving the RevPAR index, is there an opportunity there to see any kind of meaningful push in incentive fees? And what's the timeline on when we would start to see some of those thresholds be met?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","So I would say a little too soon to talk about a real analysis of changes in exactly what may be going on with the threshold, particularly as we're really just getting going at putting synergies into place and working through all the portfolios. As you did see, our incentive fee forecast for the year, we've clearly moved up nicely relative to where we were in February. And so from that standpoint, as a result of the strong margin work that is going across in the combined portfolio, we actually had strong IMF outperformance in both Asia Pacific and in North America across the portfolios, so kind of great work across legacy portfolios. It's also worth mentioning that they have a much bigger share of incentive fees that are outside the U.S. and Asia Pacific, which obviously every dollar of RevPAR you get a certain share of that with no owner's priority.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Leeny. That's helpful. And then, if I could, if you guys \u2013 and let's just talk about the $880 million to $890 million range. If you're in that range this year, we would assume that you've kind of hit the $200 million number you referenced earlier. If we think about the incremental $50 million, do we kind of layer that in in 2018 and then assume some form of growth on the just core inflation within the SG&A line? Is that kind of how you're shaping it now for 2018?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. No, I think that's exactly right. I think we'll, obviously, be able to talk a bit more as we get further into the year about 2018. The biggest variable there is about wind-down costs, about how we work our way through making sure that, for example, we're combining the ledgers on the two companies, et cetera, and all of that we're kind of working our way through. I think as we've described it before, we've really talked about the $250 million, we would expect to really feel comfortable that it's kind of more in the latter part of 2018 that when you look at it on a quarterly run rate basis, you see it. But your general approach in terms of inflation with continued savings is right.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird.","Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Bigger picture capital allocation question for you. Stock's at 15 times EBITDA. The market clearly likes buybacks, but when do those buybacks become less attractive, especially as you think about other tuck-in acquisitions or investment opportunities within the portfolio that might have better returns?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Great question. We look at it all the time. Certainly, first and foremost, we want to be investing in our business in value accretive ways. And whether that is by a contract, by a loan, by a brand acquisition, no matter how we look at it, first and foremost, we want to grow our business. But the reality is we've got a model that generates far more than we need to invest in our business, and we continue to be, as you can tell, from our share repurchase to date, we continue to feel great about returning our shareholders in kind of the balance that we're doing across a combination of dividends and share repurchase.","Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","So as a follow-up, are you not seeing those other opportunities, or buyback still make sense at 15 times earnings?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","No, no, no, we're seeing opportunities, but as I was describing, our model, the reality, the $500 million to $700 million that we've described and the need to basically continue to grow our business that's in the model and we continue to expect to spend that. And to the extent there are other things that come along, we absolutely take a look at them.","Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. I wanted to circle back on April. I think you noted it was running up 2%. I'm curious how much of a headwind Easter was to April, and heading into the quarter...","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Vince, make sure you heard the data. Year-to-date, April was 2%.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Got it. So I was curious, how much of a headwind you thought Easter would be to April?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Easter will be a headwind to April. And we don't have final numbers yet for April.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","But for...","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","It will be a headwind for April and it will be a headwind for Q2. I would think that it's nearly 1 point positive to Q1 and nearly 1 point negative to Q2.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","That's right.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","And please take that as directional because we don't even have final April numbers yet.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Helpful, thanks. And then also just thinking about demand and specifically related to the occupancy gains, I think 1Q showed some nice growth and I'm curious within your full year budget how much you're thinking occupancy will play into it and if you think occupancy will be positive in 2017.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Globally I would think it will be positive, but I think in North America, much more likely to have RevPAR driven by rate as opposed to occupancy I think as the year goes along. Hotels are practically already quite full, and of course, it will depend a little bit quarter by quarter based on the holidays, but the contribution should be more rate-driven.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Telsey Group.","David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you for allowing me back in. I just wanted to ask...","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Are you back for more?","David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","I'm back for more, first and last. It was some psychological theory I learned a million years ago...","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","There you ago.","David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","...primacy and recency.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","There you go.","David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","But, as we go through the model and we update all of the portfolio of brands, are there any updated thoughts about the range of brands? And, quite frankly, it seems like a lot, a long laundry list of brands, and how sustainable that can be over the very long term?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","No. We are thrilled by the number of brands we have and the range of choice that we can give to our customers, as we've spent obviously time talking about this at the Analyst Conference. There's no different thinking today than we laid out then. And we can all look at our 30 brands and our 1.2 million hotel rooms and say that's a lot, but it's nothing compared to the range of choice that's offered by the third-party intermediaries. And offering more choice to our customers is a great thing. And as a consequence, you should presume that we will continue with these brands and that our effort will not be about getting to fewer brands, but instead getting to emphasize the distinctions between brands and make sure we are driving the compliance, if you will, or the consistency of product quality and service quality so that the customers are experiencing something which is consistent with what each of those brands stand for.","David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Appreciate it. Thank you for letting me back in.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our final question in queue today is a follow-up from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Arne M.

Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you hear me, guys?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Now we can. There you go.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Obviously intuitively for the third quarter in a row, merger related costs decreased on a sequential basis. How much anticipated merger-related costs do you have for the balance of this year? And would you expect that to continue to go down on a sequential basis?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","I think the best I could say, Joe, right now is that we have to look at this as we keep moving along and getting through integration. So we don't have a final number for you. I think over $100 million in 2017 is the right expectation. Obviously we've already had $51 million in Q1, so that would kind of argue that we'll continue to move through the year, but exactly where we end up, whether it's $100 million or a bit more, it's too soon to say.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And the $100 million that you're talking about would be on a pre-tax not post-tax basis?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yes. That's a pre-tax basis, right.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. That's it for me. Thanks, guys.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Okay.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only-mode and the floor will be open for your questions at the end of the call. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the conference over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer.","Arne Sorenson","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Joining e today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President Investor Relations and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director Investor Relations. ","First let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Security's Laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today April 28, 2016 and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","So let's talk about the first quarter. In North America comparable system wide REVPAR rose 2.4% in a quarter. In January North America system wide REVPAR rose 3.1% despite the severe East Coast snow storm. In February REVPAR rose 3.4%. In March REVPAR increased only 1% as group meeting planners avoided the week before and the week after Easter. All in all we estimate the shifting Easter holiday period reduced our system wide REVPAR growth by about 1% as coined for the quarter. ","A natural first question would be why with 2.4% North America system wide REVPAR growth in Q1 do we think 3% to 5% growth is still the right range for the year. So our group business on the books gives us confidence in the remainder of the year including higher transit room rates that are likely to come with stronger group compression in the second and third quarters. In fact April REVPAR through the 23rd is up 5.2%. Group booking pays for our full service hotels in North America is up 7% for the rest of the year. ","First Quarter REVPAR growth was strongest in Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco and the California Desert, while REVPAR in Chicago and Philadelphia declined due to unfavorable city wide calendars. System wide REVPAR at unlimited service hotel rose 2% in the quarter constrained by a combination of weak demand from the oil and gas industries and new upscale supply. REVPAR at Ritz-Carlton increased more than 6% as recently completed renovations pushed both occupancy and room rates higher and the early Easter increased leisure business. Particularly in Lake Tahoe and Bachelor Gulch where the snow was deep and the skiing was great. ","SER expects overall U.S. supply growth of 1.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017. Interestingly in the last six months financing for new hotel construction in the U.S. has become more conservative. We understand that leverage levels on a new construction loan has declined from 70% to 75% a year ago to 60% to 65% today. Loan pricing and recourse levels have increased. In certain markets construction costs are also higher, particularly labor. While we are not likely to see a material change in supply growth in the near term longer term we believe these conditions should discourage marginal new projects from going forward and could delay others. While new industry construction could moderate in the U.S. over time we believe our brand conversions will likely accelerate. Our autograph brand raised 100 hotels worldwide in just six years largely due to conversions. With 19 brands today and soon to be 30 brands we now have even more opportunities for meaningful unit growth through conversions.","Elsewhere in the world in the Caribbean and Latin America the good news was Mexico where REVPAR rose nearly 30% in the first quarter. This expanding economy offers great opportunities from limited service development along with very strong REVPAR growth. Our warm weather resorts benefited from the shift in Easter in the first quarter but concerns about the zika virus triggered group cancellations in some markets in the region. ","In Europe the economy grew modestly in the first quarter and system wide REVPAR rose nearly 3%. The tragic events in Paris, Brussels and Istanbul depressed occupancy rates in those markets with some spill over concern impacting REVPAR results in London as well. ","Elsewhere in the UK REVPAR remained very strong. In Spain the economy is rapidly recovering and our hotels benefited from strong demand from UK and U.S. travelers. Instability in the Middle East and North Africa further enhanced Spain's appeal as a vacation destination. Demand for our German hotels remain strong in the quarter with favorable fair business in Cologne and Berlin.","In the Middle East geopolitical unrest and low oil prices depressed oil results in much of the region while UAE occupancies remained over 80% room rates were lower with new supply on the market. For Egypt there were fewer flights to the Red Sea Resorts while in Sadia Arabia hotel demand was constrained by lower government spending. ","Looking ahead Ramadan will start in early June this year, about two weeks earlier than last year which should hurt second quarter REVPAR comparisons in the Middle East. In Africa our Protea Hotels performed very well helped by strong local business and international tourism attracted by the weak South African Rand. Protea system wide constant dollar REVPAR rose nearly 15% in the first quarter and we expect that it will increase at a high single digit rate for the full year. ","Our Asia Pacific region performed better than expected in the first quarter while economic growth in China has moderated. Consumer spending on travel remains strong. Shanghai and Beijing had very strong results in the quarter with REVPAR up in the high single digits. Nearly 60% of mainland China hotel demand comes from mainland Chinese travelers and their numbers are growing. ","In the first quarter the number of domestic Chinese travelers visiting our hotels in that market increased 7% while the number of mainland Chinese travelers visiting our hotels abroad increased 25%. Thailand and Japan were particular beneficiaries. Hong Kong continued to see weak mainland China demand due to its strong currency pegged to the U.S. dollar. In India the economy is strengthening and first quarter REVPAR was at 14%. We see significant development opportunities outside North America, particularly from limited service hotels. ","Today our international limited service development pipeline totals nearly 250 hotels with more than 47,000 rooms, a 30% increase in the last year. In Europe after adding manpower to our development effort in recent years we already have 70 limited service hotels in our development pipeline including more than 40 Moxy and AC hotels. In India \u00bd of our existing properties and 60% of our pipeline hotels are in the limited service brands. In China we recently signed a deal with eastern crown to launch Fairfield by Marriott. While none are yet in the pipeline we expect to have 140 Fairfield's signed in five years and 100 hotels opened by 2021.","In Mexico we already have 20 limited service hotels open and another 16 in the development pipeline. Finally in the Middle East our limited service hotels, Court Yard, Fairfield, Residence Inn and Protea represent 40% of our pipeline in that region. Our unit growth is strong around the world excluding Starwood we expect our worldwide room distribution to grow by 8% growth or 7% net in 2016. Based on SER industry pipeline data one in four hotels under construction in the U.S. will fly one of our flags and worldwide one in seven hotels under construction will be flagged with a Marriott brand.","We are already the biggest hotel company in the world when measured by total rooms opened. We signed over 100,000 rooms in both 2014 and 2015. Those signings give us great confidence in our openings in the years ahead. With our Starwood acquisition we will become a more global company, able to better leverage global trends and seize opportunities. Following the acquisition we estimate more than one-third of our rooms and fees will come from outside the U.S. We've talked a lot about the synergies in this transaction and the economies of scale that are inherent in this business from GNA to reservations to the frequent traveler program to the back of the house. We expect a recognized meaningful top line and bottom line improvements over time and unit growth should benefit as well. With a broader brand portfolio we will be able to offer the right brand for each asset and market. This means we can play in more sand boxes than many of our competitors winning the highest value opportunities. ","We still expect the Starwood transaction will close midyear 2016. We are awaiting regulatory approvals from the EU, China, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. In the meantime we continue to do the blocking and tackling to driver results and improve our business. In March we introduced Marriott board member rates designed to reward loyalty members who book direct. The list of member only perks continues to grow. Loyalty points, mobile check in and check out, free Wi-Fi and now lower rates. Today 65% of transit room nights comes from rewards members. This month we announce enhancement to the rewards part of Marriott rewards offering a wide array of curated special events and opportunities. In addition an initial group of elite members will be invited to participate in a new elite concierge service. By developing a relationship with a member the concierges will be able to anticipate their unique needs, ensuring the member's preferences are recognized and their desires are met before, during and after their stay. And for golden platinum elites guaranteed late checkouts should make traveling both more pleasurable and more productive. ","Marriott's competitive advantages are numerous. Strong brands, wide spread distribution, powerful sales channels, loyalty program and reservation systems, back at the house efficiencies, owner and franchisee preference and most important culture focused on our people. We also know that success is never final so we are working to be even better. Now let me turn things over to Leeny from more about the quarter. Leeny?","Leeny Oberg ","Thank you, Arne. For the first quarter of 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.87. Four cents ahead of the miss point of our guidance of $0.81 to $0.85. Fee revenue was in line with our expectations. Results on our owned, leased and other lines contributed about $0.05 without performance including $0.03 from branding fees from residential real estate and our Marriott Rewards credit card and the balance largely coming from performance of our owned and leased hotels.","Adjusted, general and administrative costs were better than expected by about a penny mainly due to open associate positions. Interest in taxes were about $0.02 unfavorable largely due to some discrete tax items in the quarter. All in all it was a solid quarter.","Total fee revenue increased 5%. As you know 2016 is a leap year. The extra day in the quarter did not impact our REVPAR statistics but we estimated added about 1% to our property level, revenue and fee growth in the quarter. Base fees rose 4% reflecting REVPAR and unit growth offset by more than $4 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. ","Incentive fees increased 13% reflecting roughly $3 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact and a $2 million favorable recognition of a differed incentive fee. Worldwide 63% of managed hotels earned an incentive fee in the quarter compared to 48% in the year ago quarter. In North America incentive fees rose 23% with incentive fees for our limited service brands up 40% alone. Franchise fees were flat year over year. Strong unit growth and REVPAR improvement were offset by $15 million of lower relicensing fees and $2 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Owns, leased and other revenue net of expenses totaled $81 million in the quarter, 29% higher than the prior year largely driven by higher branding fees associated with sales of Ritz-Carlton residences and our cobranded credit cards. ","Our leased hotels in Tokyo and Jaragua showed much better results as they came out of renovations but those results were offset by foregone owned profit from our Ritz-Carlton Saint Thomas Hotel which became a company managed property late last year. Adjusted, general and administrative expenses increased by $10 million largely reflecting routine cost increases. This quarter we benefited from $10 million lower reserves for guaranteed funding while the 2015 quarter benefitted from $12 million associated with favorable litigation resolutions.","We repurchased nearly 4 million shares during the quarter for approximately $225 million. We expect to complete the Starwood acquisition midyear and expect to resume share repurchases in late 2016 once our leverage ratios return to targeted levels.","For our second quarter our guidance assumed the Starwood transaction will close sometime after June 30. For Marriott's legacy business we expect second quarter North American system wide REVPAR will increase 3% to 5% reflecting strong group business already on the books. We expect international system wide REVPAR will increase 2% to 4% reflecting strong Asia Pacific trends offset by weak REVPAR in the Middle East. We expect Marriott's fee revenue will increase 6% to 8% in the second quarter. ","We expect our owned, leased and other results in the second quarter will increase roughly 25% with continued strong branding fees, lower preopening expenses and higher profits from our owned and leased hotels. We expect G&A will increase 2% to 5%. Adjusted net interest expense should total roughly $40 million. All in all we expect our second quarter adjusted EBITDA will total $495 million to $510 million, an increase of 8% to 12%. ","Adjusted EPF should total $0.96 to a $1.00, an increase of 10% to 15% year over year. This forecast assumes no share repurchase during the quarter and does not include Starwood transition and transaction cost. Turning to the full year we expect worldwide REVPAR for Marriott's Legacy business will increase 3% to 5% combined with 7% net rooms growth we expect our 2016 fee revenue will total roughly $2 billion consistent with our forecast in February. Owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses should total $310 million to $315 million about $10 million ahead of our February forecast largely due to stronger residential branding fees. ","We expect our full year adjusted general and administrative expenses will total $645 million to $655 million about $5 million better than our last forecast largely due to the open associate position that we mentioned about Q1. For the Marriott Legacy business 2016 investment spending could total $450 million to $550 million including about $100 million in maintenance spending. Excluding Starwood we expect to recycle roughly $200 million to $250 million through asset sales and loan repayments through 2016.","Making an EPS projection for the full year of 2016 is difficult given the uncertain timing of the Starwood transaction. To assist you modelers however for full year 2016 we expect Marriott standalone adjusted EBITDA will total $1.9 billion to $1.965 billion, about $15 million better than our February forecast. Given that 2016 transition and transaction costs are uncertain at this point we are not including these costs in our guidance but rather expect to break out such expenses as actual results are recognized as we did this quarter. When the transaction closes we estimate that we will issue roughly $136 million Marriott shares and increase total debt by roughly $3.5 billion representing an estimated $20 million in higher net interest cost per quarter. ","Incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction will depend on purchase price accounting evaluations that have not yet been completed. In a recent 8K we estimated incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction at roughly $52 million per quarter. Like you we will rely on Starwood's forecast of their REVPAR growth, unit growth, asset sale assumptions and adjusted EBITDA for their business. We eagerly await their first quarter results in 2016 outlook. ","Our results in 2016 are likely to be messy including Starwood by the end of this year we expect to be back to our targeted leverage range and have resumed share repurchases. We expect most of the corporate level, cost energy associated with the transaction to be in place by the beginning of 2017. We are committed to completing asset sales promptly. Including Starwood we could see continued strong unit growth in 2017 even with our larger size.","Also we continue to believe the transaction will be earnings per share neutral in 2017 before including the benefits of possible revenue synergy. We appreciate your interest in Marriott. So that we can speak to as many as possible we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. We will take questions now. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix. ","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning, thank you. My first question which the first question is a two-parter. So Arne I think what's on a lot of people's mind is the kind of Easter shift. So you talked about April being up 5.2%. I'm just wondering how much of that comes from Easter and then also as we know April you know Hilton said yesterday that they expect May to be weaker and then June to pick up, are you seeing the same thing?","Arne Sorenson","Well yeah those are sort of detailed questions. I'm going to also sort of give you a general answer to the question that you haven't asked but I think is the top of the mind for everybody. As we said in the prepared remarks we think the negative REVPAR impact was about 1 point in Q1 to the shift of Easter. The impact of Q2 could be about the same. Obviously the impact of one month of April would be larger and it could be nearly 2%. Important to keep in mind though that last week April still has Passover in it and so we'll look at the impact when the dust ultimately settles and give you more precise calculations but it would be something close to 2% we would think for April. When we look at our group bookings which of course are the clearest long term data that we have we see April and June relatively better than May but we see good group for Q2 as a whole we see good group for Q3 as a whole. Q4 okay but not quite as good as Q2 and Q3 and as we said in the prepared remarks we've got about 7% increase group revenue on the books for Q2 through Q4 compared to the same time last year. ","The biggest question at the moment obviously is not so much about group but is about the [ph] trends and demand. So let's maybe start with basics. The transit demand correlates most closely with GDP growth. Statistics out this morning show that U.S. Q1 GDP growth was only 0.5%. Anemic even in the context of the fairly moderate U.S. economic recovery we've been witnessing the last few years.","The question for all of us including for you is do we expect the U.S. economy to perform at higher growth rates in the quarters ahead. We do. It seems reasonably clear that sentiment was profoundly negative early in this year in that it has improved significantly since January. That plus other statistics around employment, growth and other things which suggest that the economy is poised to perform at better than that 0.5% number in Q1. Based on our information as opposed to GDP information the U.S. market seems to us to be characterized by a number of short stories if you will. Let me give you a few examples.","Houston weak because of the weakness in the oil patch. New York weak primarily because of supply growth but also maybe a bit because of the strength that the U.S. dollar and its impact on international rivals. Miami weak probably mostly because of the weakness in Brazil one of the great source markets for Miami and to some extent maybe growth in luxury supply. San Francisco very strong reflection of the strong health of the U.S. digital economy. Of course LA also quite strong. Now our biggest customers also tell us things that are quite different. Many of them tell us that their book of business is solid and reflects continued health in their business and from their purge of strength in the U.S. economy. Some wrestling with a flattish top lines seem to be turning with greater attention to managing costs including their travel budgets.","Now when we roll all of these antidotes together you will have these markets. What we see is a collection of short stories but not a common theme let alone the same author. So our view as reflected in our continued 3% to 5% REVPAR growth guidance is that we expect the U.S. economy to continue to bump along with moderate GDP growth and therefore moderate occupancy growth which when combined with ADR growth should deliver 3% to 5% REVPAR growth for the year. ","Felicia Hendrix","And Arne just quickly and then I'll go follow up on that. Previously you said that you're expected to come in at the high end of that range. Is that still a view?","Arne Sorenson","Well the 3% to 5% is still the range that we think is appropriate. This question that I just addressed is a question that we're talking about internally as well and of course we've got forecasts that get rolled up from our properties around the world. We also have maybe a slightly more conservative view here based on recent trends but generally all of those forecasts are above the midpoint of that 3% to 5% range and we would think as a consequent it's at least as likely we are at 5% as we are at 3%. This will though depend on what happens with transit demand in the quarters ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, that's all very helpful. Thank you.","Arne Sorenson","You bet. May be aware, there is an ultimate hurdle that sort of forces the timing which is at the end of two years. So basically at the end of 2017, they have to be 40% complete with their ability. So the easy math is to say that's 20% per year or 5% per quarter. I think we all know that to assume linearity it would be a little silly because these things get off to a little bit slower start, there is always more complexities in them etcetera.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Kelly.","Sean Kelly","Good morning everyone. Leeny in your remarks towards the very end where you're giving some helpful pieces of the merger I think you mentioned that corporate level synergies were expected to be in place by 2017. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that. Is the corporate level component, how much of that or I mean directionally at least is the $250 million that you guys have outlined and how much do we think is going to take more time?","Leeny Oberg","We expect and aim to put into place so that starting January 1 you would see as a run rate. You would see that for the year we would achieve those $250 million synergies. Now that's obviously going to be on an adjusted basis Sean because we will continue to have some transition costas on certain technological systems we've got to run parallel systems until we get them put together. So you know by that standpoint we would hope by the end of 2017 that we've got that largely done but I think on a good basic solid running the company run rate you should see that in place in 2017. ","Sean Kelly","That's helpful and then I guess as a follow up you know for the last quarter you have been talking and highlighting about being more on a residential branding fee side. Could you just talk a little bit more about why that comes through or is that recognized when residential units come online or is it recognized when you guys are signing contracts for stuff in the future. ","Leeny Oberg","Sure. Absolutely. You're right. It clearly not quite as predictable as all of us would like. Let me talk a little bit about the residential branding fees. As I'm sure you know these stem from projects and often they are connected to our hotels, but the stem from residential projects where our brand is a part of those projects and we earn a fee on the sale of those residences. We are not paid for those until they are not only sold but they are actually closed. So number one you've got something that opens so it's a little bit hard to predict exactly the pace of the sales and then the pace of the closings but we have a project. Waikiki is a great example of one in Hawaii that began selling late last year and it's just been selling like hotcakes and basically we expect it to sell out this year, 300 units and we had had it more spread across the year while it turns out it was largely done in Q1 because it was so popular. The good news is this is a business that has been although it is clearly cyclical related to the financing of real estate it has been growing very nicely for us particularly internationally. So when you look at this year's fees the average over the last call it five years has been about $15 million dollars a year. We do expect this year for that number to be closer to double that but when you look over the next few years Sean I think you're looking at a number of residential branding fees that probably is likely to be in the high 20s because we've got a great pipeline of projects that are moving along. ","Arne Sorenson","By the way these projects are all fee projects for us so we're not developing these like residential ourselves.","Leeny Oberg","Right. ","Arne Sorenson","So one of the issues on the predictability is we're not running either the building or the sales of this process. We've got to wait until the unit is closed before we know for certain when we recognize those fees. ","Sean Kelly","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Farley.","Robin Farley ","Great thanks. It looks like your incentive management fees of the percentage property paying incentive paying as your fees jumped up quite significantly year over year. Is that a level that you expect to see on full year basis, that kind of increase?","Leeny Oberg","Yes it is actually. It jumps up meaningfully largely because we had three managed portfolios of limited service hotels that IMS is calculated on a portfolio basis. So when they all come. You know when they hit that target they all jump in to be in an incentive fee territory so it's actually about 160 hotels that jumped in Q1 this year as compared to Q1 last year that jumps into incentive fee territory. Now I will say year over year the incentive fee last year for the full year we did end up in the 60s for IMS fee participation and we expect that to be similar this year, but in the Q1 last year in the first quarter those limited service hotels were not in incentive fee earning territory. ","Robin Farley","Okay. That's helpful. And one follow up if I could. You mentioned the cost savings to be fully in place kind of it sounded like the start of 2017 which I think is a little bit earlier or maybe you just sort of hadn't committed to a date where they would be fully in place but should we still think about; I think you had previously said the transaction was going to be neutral to earnings per share in 2017 and 2018 so that maybe it wouldn't be accretive or I don't know if that implies that it would be accretive in 2019 but does that time frame move up with the comments this morning about costings being in place?","Arne Sorenson","Let me just provide the typical warning which should be obvious. I think everybody. We haven't closed the transaction yet so there's still a lot of details that we don't know. Leeny in fact mentioned in her prepared remarks that the depreciation and amortization for example will not get finalized until the transaction closes because given the amount of stock that we're using in the deal the amount that we pay really will not be defined until actual closing because it will be derived in significant extent from our own share price. Obviously the other aspects that start with operating business that until we close we won't understand with real detail. Generally though what we think though is that 250 million dollars' worth of synergy run rate which Leeny talked about for 2017 is included in our assumptions about a roughly neutral EPS impact from the transaction. It is probably the first time we've held it out there as being 1117 as opposed to a second year I think is the way that we talked about it before. And again we've got a lot of work to do to make sure that that happens because we can't guarantee it but we think that with that we will get a relatively neutral performance on EPS. I think the upside from that accretion in other words will be driven more by revenues synergies and margin synergies at the property level and how that drives unit growth and then of course what we do with the powerful and substantial cash that's going to be generated by this confined business in either investing or returning that capital to shareholders. ","Robin Farley","And then the same thought on the accretion in 2018 versus 2019 or timing.","Paul Silverstein","Stay tuned. ","Leeny Oberg","Yeah. A little too soon. ","Robin Farley","Okay. Great. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Harry Curtis.","Harry Curtis","Good morning. So Arne you mentioned that there are elements of economic improvement that you've seen. How is that being reflected or was that reflected in the pace of your bookings in April versus the first quarter?","Arne Sorenson","Oh I actually don't have April group bookings if that's what you're talking about. I don't have April group bookings to date. I tend to get those at the end of the month, but we do have obviously the 5.2% REVPAR growth system wide in the U.S. stayed and paid for the month. Obviously a piece of that is the impact of Easter and you know I think what we would say is at the moment we see some positive signs compared to the last few months, but I wouldn't characterize our comments as sitting here and saying we've got a dramatic shift in transit this month compared to prior months. I think what we see is more steady than that. Again we look at the group data that we've got on the books and we look at sort of the current conditions and we still think this range is a solid one. I think it in fact does depend on GDP growth in the 2% range as opposed as those sort of 0.5% that it appears to be the case from Q1. Again our view is that that's what we're likely to see. ","Harry Curtis","Thank you and Leeny as a follow up to your comment about revenue synergies not yet spelled out in the transaction. Can you give us perhaps the top three or four buckets that you're hoping to get revenue synergies from?","Leeny Oberg","Sure. First and foremost, you know as we move through it we're very excited about the growth opportunities that we see for the overall hotel portfolio from adding together Starwood into ours so I think from a unit growth perspective that first and foremost we see opportunities there. We also see some opportunities through a variety of our partnerships as we think about being a much larger company in ways that as we become stronger and bigger that we'll be able to capitalize on those and last but certainly not least is as we look at what we believe that we can do on the hotel margin side that we would benefit on our fees through being able to deliver better profits to our hotel owners. ","Harry Curtis","And on the partnership side is that really more revenue opportunity or more of a lower fee opportunity? ","Arne Sorenson","Lower across. You mean margin improvement? I think it's both.","Leeny Oberg","Yeah I think it's definitely some on the top line as well. ","Harry Curtis","Got you. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Kent.","Steven Kent","Hi. Good morning. A couple questions. One how is the new push for direct bookings been going? You and one of your competitors have been pushing it pretty hard. Do you think it's boosting your REVPAR growth at all, sort of what's been the reaction? I just wanted to ask an operating question before I ask a deal question which is could you just give us a sense as to how you'll handle the loyalty programs and the timeshare licensing programs whether you can give us an update on that? I tried to leave with the operating and then went to the deal question.","Arne Sorenson","There you go. Thank you. The member only rates that we rolled out are very new in the market. We announced them about a month ago but they became effective a little bit after that. It's still quite early and we have not put as many dollars into marketing those rates yet. Obviously they are visible online and we're doing some things. I think the early response has been positive but it's too early to give you the kind of statistics that you've heard from some others who have been out there on market longer with us. We've obviously done it because we're optimistic about this approach driving an increase in direct bookings and driving that much more awareness of the advantages of direct booking. ","With the sense of the loyalty programs this is going to be very much a work in progress. It is clear that we will be running the Marriott Rewards and SPG programs for some for some period of time. I would think that that's got to be more like two years than a year but part of that is systems driven. Part of that is making sure that we deal with our customers in a way that keeps them excited about these programs and has them participate with us in a way that they evolve. Of course as your question implies we've got a number of very powerful and strategic partners that are keenly interested in this program. Timeshare companies and credit card companies being of the most significant but they're not the only ones and we're going to want to make sure that we work with them in a way that is successful to them and respects their interest. We'll sort of keep you posted on this. Obviously we'd like to get to a place where we have a program which allows our growing group of loyal customers to have the benefits of the full portfolio of 5500 hotels plus another 2000 or so hotels which are in the combined pipeline whatever those precise numbers are and the ability to grow from there. So we'll be working to get as much functionality between those programs as we can and eventually hopefully a full merger but hopefully we'll see how that goes and we'll keep you posted on it. ","Steven Kent","Just from a direct booking side have you shared with your franchise user owners what the positive impact could be to their bottom line? Have you done that yet or is it still too early to even give them indications of how favorable that can be?","Arne Sorenson","Well we have an ongoing conversation with our owners and franchisees with a number of advisory committees that are meeting with our leadership teams very, very regularly and we have been talking about doing this well before we launched it and in the context of that certainly have talked about the economic attributes of what we think is programmed to do. We haven't done that in a way that puts us in a position to give you a forecast for the impact but we'll keep you posted on how we think it goes as it develops over the months ahead. ","Steven Kent","Okay. Thanks. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Greff. ","Joseph Greff","Good morning guys.","Leeny Oberg","Hi Joe.","Arne Sorenson","Hi Joe. ","Joseph Greff","Leeny with respect to your earlier comments about revenue synergies not being included in your 2017 proforma target for the Star reveal with respect to the timing of revenue synergies and this is also for you Arne, are they mostly intermediate or longer term in nature or could we start to see these emerge in 2017?","Leeny Oberg","We could but again as Arne described before we're still several months away from closing. We've got a lot of work to do both looking at things related to the on property cost and comparing it to our system as well as how we look at all these partnerships. So it could but it's too soon to tell exactly when.","Joseph Greff","And presumably you'll call out the transition cost each quarter?","Leeny Oberg","We will be calling out the transition and the transaction cost each and every quarter.","Joseph Greff","Great. My follow up is if we assume the midpoint of your guidance for the Q2 for the balance of the year would you expect group REVPAR to exceed transient REVPAR or how do you do that?","Arne Sorenson","Yes. I mean one of the things obviously won't be lost on you but if you look at the release that we put out last night you can see a meaningful difference in the REVPAR for the manage portfolio of the United States and the franchise portfolio of the United States. Actually what we report externally is manage portfolio and then system wide and the manage portfolio is nearly a full point higher in REVPAR than the system wide numbers are. ","Joseph Greff","So in other words Arne you're not assuming a big corporate transient rebound in the back part of the year?","Arne Sorenson","Again we would say steady maybe a bit better because of the weakness in the first quarter but this is not fundamentally based on a dramatically different environment than the one that we've seen over the last few quarters. I suspect the downside here is that if GDP is for the balance of the year more like the 0.5% in Q1 we're going to be towards the bottom end of this range or in theory it could be below that. I think that's unlikely given the strength of the group business in the books but obviously we can't know about transient business very far in advance. If we on the other hand see better quarters perform better which I would expect to be the case you know transient should perform a bit better than it did in Q1 and maybe Q4 but I wouldn't characterize it as a dramatically different environment. That's not what's built into our forecast. ","Joseph Greff","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker of Canaccord Genuity.","Ryan Meliker","I just wanted to talk a little bit about the group booking pace. You guys said early in your prepared remarks you were up for the remainder of the year; that is obviously a pretty strong number. You also had mentioned that one of the benefits of the group booking pace is an ability to have more transient pricing power. I guess the two questions","I had was last quarter you had mentioned 2Q was a big acceleration in group base, I think plus 2% for 1Q versus plus 9% for 2Q. I am wondering if that is still the case. If you are still a plus 9% or if things have moderated a little bit for 2Q as we have gotten closer? And then the second thing is how are you guys thinking about the impact that your strong group booking pace will have on transient pricing power? Is there any way to try to quantify that?","Arne Sorenson","Yes, a couple of things. I think our Q2 pace is probably down a little from that 9% but still in the high-single-digits 7%-ish. And Q3 would be in the mid-double-digits, so pretty healthy, be careful about assuming that that is an awful development. When we start a year with high group bookings it leaves a little bit less room for in the year for the year group bookings. And as a consequence we often see the full-year number sort of moderate as the year goes along and that is not a sign of weakness.","The other thing that is really important to bear in mind here is that the group business has the most power to help with pricing of a hotel in high occupancy high demand months. So group business being up significantly in January which is a relatively quiet month or December which is a relatively quiet month, is going to be much less impactful in driving rates than in non-holiday impacted weeks and months like March, April, May, September, October, first half of November. And so, we think we have got, again, in a number of these times the group business should be more powerful in helping us drive rate in the transient space.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Just on the pipeline growth, you've been consistently growing your pipeline by about 10,000 rooms a quarter. The first quarter was slightly [indiscernible], just trying to understand if that was related to seasonality or some of the financing issues, Arne, you mentioned earlier. Or has there been any reluctance from developers to build your brands given the Starwood deal? Thanks.","Arne Sorenson","The answer to the last part of the question is no. The pace seems to be steady for us. Remember one of the things, it is probably obvious to you, we tend to talk about our pipeline in round-ish numbers, 5,000 room increments usually as opposed to giving you the single number that we have in our pipeline, for the obvious reason that we can only be so accurate in our pipeline. I think one of the things that happens in Q1 is you end up because of some rounding probably with a growth that is more in the 5000 to 10,000 room range than exactly 5000 or below 5000. And so, that is what has driven it.","We're seeing steady performance. You heard the prepared comments about debt markets being a little tougher in the early part of the year. I suspect as a consequence that particularly some of the more urban, more full scale, full service projects which are typically done with nonrecourse debt financing as opposed to a guaranteed borrower. Those debt markets are a little tougher today. And as a consequence I suspect we will see some projects pull back, but I don't think it is going to be significant for Marriott because of the strength of our brands.","Thomas Allen","Okay and just my follow-up. Can you give us updated thinking by region on your 2016 RevPAR outlook? Thanks.","Arne Sorenson","Stronger in the West, weakest in the oil patch -- positive but probably not hugely positive in markets like New York. I think if then you go to the rest of the world we're all watching for Zika in the Caribbean and Latin America and that could have had a few points of RevPAR impact to us in Q1 in that region. It will certainly have a few points of impact at least if not a bit more in Q2. And we will see how that story plays out over the balance of the year. Obviously Mexico, that strength we expect to continue. Brazil, other than the Olympics, we wouldn't expect a lot of robustness from. You get to Asia-Pacific I think is going to continue to perform well based on the trends that we have talked about. Middle East because of Ramadan will look weak in Q2; I think it will do better in Q3 and Q4. There are important things that need to happen there.","I did an interview with Arabian Hotel investment conference yesterday by videoconference. And for example Egypt has got to do more on airport safety I think before it gets a lot of European aircraft coming back into the resort markets but even to some extent Cairo. In Europe we were pleasantly surprised in Q1. Obviously the Brussels tragedy took place very late in Q1; that is going to have a more negative impact in Q2 than it did for Q1. But at the moment it feels Brussels and Paris focused in terms of weakness as opposed to Europe as a whole. So we would expect to continue to see positive sort of low- to mid-single-digit RevPAR growth in that market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Katz of Telsey Group.","David Katz","So, I wanted to ask about the structure of management contracts that you will be acquiring from Starwood. I think over time we get a sense for the rhythm of incentive fees and how that kind of rolls for your Company. But what does that look like for Starwood and will you be making some major changes in those as you acquire properties and shift them from your own from an owned portfolio into a managed portfolio? And then I have one quick follow-up.","Arne Sorenson","Will we be making changes in the management contracts or in our approach to disclosure, what are you asking?","David Katz","I'm essentially asking are their management contracts different structurally from yours.","Arne Sorenson","We don't think so. Starwood has been a very thoughtful and thorough manager we think. We occasionally because management contracts get filed in SEC filings by either hotel owners or by brand companies we have had some insight into specific management contracts. And generally the structures are the same and the rights and obligations of Starwood seem to be comparable to those of ours.","Starwood, because they skew a little bit more full-service than we do, they also skew a little bit more towards managed as opposed to franchise than we do which will make this a more relevant question I think in terms of the incentive fee performance. We obviously can't give you any sense really on what their incentive fee growth could be year over year; we have got some assumptions in our model but we don't have any detailed inside view on that yet. But we would think generally it is going to be about the same. Obviously we think their biggest owner is our biggest owner as well in Host. And I think the structure of those deals, as far as we know, is very similar.","David Katz","And I assume it counts if I follow up someone else's question, but on the subject of RevPAR growth, over the years we have talked about a point at which, all other things being equal, you are effectively profit or earnings neutral. And that RevPAR growth number is something greater than zero, as I recall it was something in the 3% range. As we move into next year, if one were to assume that RevPAR growth moderates, where do you expect that number to be for Marriott as it stands today and the combined Company? How does that -- where are you sort of profit neutral irrespective of any unit growth or other dynamics?","Arne Sorenson","Let's break it down here. The core question there is most app with respect to the hotel level economics. And we will talk about Marriott's P&L in a minute. And you are absolutely right. We have tended to say RevPAR in the 2% to 3% range is typically what is necessary in order to maintain flat profit margins in percentage terms which would mean that dollars of profit at the hotel level would be up 2% to 3% just as the revenue line itself was up. Look at Q1 our actual results and we have got the 2.4-ish RevPAR growth, but hotel level margins up 90 basis points around the world.","And that is a tribute to our operating team who continues to find a way to improve margins even with fairly modest RevPAR growth. So in that kind of environment we saw -- in an actual Q1 we saw quite modest RevPAR growth and hotel level profit growth on average going up more like the 4% to 5% range as opposed to the 2.5% RevPAR growth. I think when you look forward it is going to vary significantly market by market. U.S. labor costs obviously are going to continue to rise. Some of this will be driven by politics and other things.","I think much more of it will be driven by the tightness of the labor market and the tighter it gets the more likely to see wage growth move. I would think we're likely to see 3% to 4%, maybe 3% to 5% wage growth in the U.S. in the next couple of years and as a consequence you are going to still need that 2% to 3% RevPAR growth to get sort of flattish margins. For Marriott by comparison we have got a number of different drivers. We have got the top line which is going to be driven by that same store RevPAR growth. We've got the incentive fees which are a share of them -- hopefully growing profits at the hotel.","And then significantly we have got both the unit growth which is entirely incremental to that and the impact of what we do with the capital that we produce. And so all of those things I think would cause our fee growth to be significantly higher than whatever the RevPAR growth is in the market. I think simply if you have got 3% to 5% same store RevPAR growth and food and beverage is growing at the same pace we ought to see base and franchise fees grow at that amount for existing hotels plus some upside because of incentive fees. And then in addition to that the unit growth which we're talking about at 7% net of the units that we lose. That is a long answer to a short question, sorry about that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Loeb of Baird Capital.","David Loeb","Arne, I kind of want to hit on the topic you've been talking about since the very first question but from a different perspective. What do you think is going on in corporations that is leading to pretty strong group business and good group ancillary spend, but relative transient weakness?","Arne Sorenson","Well, again, that is where we come to this -- it's probably a bad metaphor, but this notion of a number of different short stories that don't have the same author. I don't think at the moment it is clear that this is a macroeconomic thing. I think this is instead a collection of stories that are driven by individual company dynamics. And I am not going to name companies because these are great partners of ours and I don't want to be trying to tell their stories publicly. But when you read the press you can see a number of big companies who are reducing headcount because of struggle to grow top line.","You can see a number of big companies that have got activist shareholders that are forcing some focus on margins. But then you see a number of companies that are growing robustly. And a number of players in broad parts of the U.S. economy across industries, think about the accounting firms and the consulting firms and banks and some of those things. And what you hear from them is a level of economic activity that seems steady and that causes them to be fairly optimistic and as a consequence I think we end up with different RevPAR performance in different cities.","And I think to the extent those stories are accurate, they tend to have a more pronounced impact on the short-term, meaning transient, than they do on the long-term, meaning group because as long as those companies are still performing well which generally they are, they are going to hold that annual meeting. They are going to make their commitments for what they need to do to launch their new products or to bring all of their customers together. And as a consequence they are going to hold the meeting that was booked a year ago or two years ago and they are going to book today the meeting that they expect to have a year or two from now.","David Loeb","On a related note, the CEO of an ownership company said we're in or approaching a downturn in the industry. Do you see that?","Arne Sorenson","I don't see that. I think there has never been a supply induced downturn. I shouldn't say never. I am most familiar going back to maybe the early 1990s, so think about whatever that is, 25 years I suppose. There has not been a supply induced downturn in our industry which means in effect that there has not been an industry induced downturn in our industry.","What causes a downturn is a meaningful change in the demand environment. And that change is not going to occur unless we have a meaningful change in GDP growth and economic growth around the world, period. And so, that means for us and for all of you we have got to go back and say, okay, what do we think GDP is going to do in the quarters ahead. And the more pessimistic about that you are, the more pessimistic you should be about this industry because we're not going to drive -- yes, okay, we want to outperform and we will outperform, we did in the first quarter on RevPAR index, but by and large we're not going to be able to grow demand if economic activity is contracting because that will cause demand broadly to decline.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research.","Vince Ciepiel","I wanted to dig a little bit more in the group. You mentioned that those corporates are still booking those group meetings. And on prior calls I think you have noted group production in the quarter for future periods up 10% and 7% the last two quarters. Did you see a similar level of kind of production growth in the first quarter? And then also kind of 2017 and 2018 I think were noted to be pacing up high-singles, is that still the case?","Arne Sorenson","Yes. I think when you look at bookings in Q1 for all future periods we were up about 5% compared to last year. But we for 2017 and 2018 would have been up sort of twice that level. And so that is a bit lower. Now to be fair we had very robust growth in the first quarter of 2015 and strong growth in group bookings in the first quarter of 2014. And I actually think built on that growth this is a good respectable number going forward.","Vince Ciepiel","And then on a different topic on leverage and capital returns. You mentioned that you plan to get back to repurchasing once the targeted leverage levels are reached. On prior calls I think you threw out a few hundred million of potential share repurchase in 4Q, is that still the current thinking?","Leeny Oberg","Yes, that is about right.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes of SunTrust.","Patrick Scholes","Well, I wondered if you could help me clarify something here. I apologize, I may have misheard some of your commentary earlier in the call. But I thought I heard that you are not expecting a dramatically different environment for the rest of the year. However, when I run the math to get to that high end of your 3% to 5% range it implies a material uptick in RevPAR in the magnitude of 6.5% growth for the back half. How do I reconcile sort of those two different items? Did I miss hear?","Arne Sorenson","I mean the commentary really is about the underlying strength in demand. And think about that as the transient business. I think we see continued modest growth in transient demand based on modest GDP growth and with it some pricing power. I think we do have a group dynamic as well though that overlays this and that is, to some extent, moving a little bit independently from what is happening in the demand environment because it has got a longer lead time and as we have talked about before, we have got a Q2 and Q3 group that is more robust than Q1. ","A big piece of that is Easter but that is not the only piece of that, part of that is just the vicissitudes of the group booking cycle if you will. And so, when we roll those things together we suspect we will have a stronger headline RevPAR number obviously in the balance of the year than we did in the first quarter of the year. We were below the 3% in the first quarter of the year.","So of by definition of that that way. But again, that would be a reflection more of a group and normalizing of the holiday time than a characterization by us that it depends on a dramatically more healthy underlying economy than the sort of 2% GDP number which we assume to be the case.","Patrick Scholes","Okay. Follow-up question, what was your group RevPAR result growth rate for 1Q?","Arne Sorenson","Low-single-digits, about the same as our RevPAR as a whole. And again, there you've got to remember you have got Easter there which is going to have a pronounced impact particularly on group. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but my guess is January and February our group RevPAR was higher than the transient RevPAR. And then because of March and Easter we end up essentially giving some of that back and ending up more or less in the same place.","Patrick Scholes","Okay. And again, I could be wrong here. When I run the math on your group RevPAR expectation for quarter's two to four versus your previous guidance back in February it would seem that group pace has come down from about 7% to 5.5%. Is that correct that we have seen deceleration?","Arne Sorenson","Order of magnitude that is right.","Leeny Oberg","As Arne pointed out before, you should actually expect that to happen as you move through the year when a year ago you could be doing in the year for the year booking. So it's to some extent -- some of it is as you move through the year you would expect that to happen.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time, sir.","Arne Sorenson","All right. Well, we thank you all for your time and attention this morning and, as always, look forward to welcoming you into our hotels as you travel. Be well.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Marriott International's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Sorenson, please go ahead.","Arne M. Sorenson","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Carl Berquist, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, February 20, 2013, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","We are very excited about our accomplishments in 2012 and encouraged by recent trends. To be sure, Europe's economy continues to struggle with austerity, but the concerns of immediate financial calamity have lessened. Mexico has seen a resurgence in demand. And today, our Caribbean resorts are welcoming greater numbers of travelers escaping the cold. While political uncertainty in the Middle East continues, the region is benefiting from economic growth and easy comparisons. In Asia, GDP growth has moderated a bit but continues to chug along at better than 5%. With the leadership transition complete, we think China travel should regain its footing later in the year. In the U.S., the economy continues to expand, but we are also watching political developments carefully as the likelihood of federal budget sequestration increases to a near certainty.","In fact, it is this likelihood of sequestration that caused us to broaden the range of our 2013 REVPAR outlook. Today, business is very strong. Company-operated North American REVPAR in January increased 8%. But we can't ignore the risk of government spending cuts to the economy, generally, and to the travel industry specifically. So our guidance of 4% to 7% worldwide REVPAR growth for 2013 reflects the risk for lodging demand.","On the lodging supply front, North American financing has become a bit easier for limited-service construction in the past 6 months, but remains challenging for full-service hotels. Overall, Smith Travel tells us that U.S. supply increased only 0.5% in 2012, and they expect supply growth to be only 1% in 2013.","In North America, our brands represented a whopping 24% of industry rooms under construction at year end, demonstrating owner and lender preference for our brands. They recognize the inherent value of our distribution from frequent traveler programs to volume purchasing to Internet marketing, we find efficiencies increase and cost per transactions decline as we grow.","Our Autograph brand is a great example. We've added 24 Autograph hotels in the U.S. in only 3 years and nearly 40 worldwide. By leveraging Marriott Rewards and marriott.com, newly converted hotels have seen their REVPAR index increase 10 points, on average, during the first year after conversion, and owners report significant improvement in profitability. In 2012, Marriot Rewards guests accounted for 45% of Autograph demand.","Our sales organization also leverages our broad distribution. While 1\/3 of our sales staff are based on property typically at our largest hotels, most are off-property and all represent the broad portfolio from Fairfield Inn to Marriott Hotels & Resorts. And our smaller Marriott hotels that are most reliant on off-property sales staff, group REVPAR in 2012 increased nearly 10%.","In recent years, we added incentives for sales execs to book business in hotels outside their typical market area, a system that benefits all hotels. In 2012, this cross-sell revenue totaled nearly $250 million, up from roughly $100 million in 2010.","Early last year, Gaylord Entertainment sponsored a survey of large meeting planners. Not only were Marriott's brands most preferred for group business, meeting planners preferred us by more than 2:1 over our nearest competitor. This was obviously important to Ryman as they selected a manager for their Gaylord brand. Now part of Marriott, Gaylord is also leveraging our cost structure, recognizing meaningful cost savings while maintaining the outstanding service for which both Gaylord and Marriott are known. The integration of Gaylord is going well and the brand is a great addition to our portfolio.","While broad distribution is a competitive advantage, size does not imply sameness. Multiple high-quality brands allow us to tailor products to different markets and different customer groups, while providing attractive growth platforms for owners and franchisees, and new brands open yet more opportunities for growth. We have a very broad luxury portfolio with over 50,000 rooms worldwide in our Ritz-Carlton, Ritz-Carlton Reserve, JW Marriott, Bulgari, and our latest lifestyle luxury brand, EDITION. Our first company-developed EDITION hotel opens in London in mid-2013, with Miami and New York to follow. Over a 5-year period, we are investing roughly $900 million to jump-start the EDITION brand, and we are already seeing incremental developer interest in the brand. We currently have 7 hotels in our development pipeline, and a half dozen more in early discussions. We plan to recycle our investments in EDITION as soon as possible, taking back long-term management contracts.","For our limited-service brands, we are introducing new guest room prototypes for the Fairfield brand in India and Brazil, and the Courtyard brand in Asia and Europe. In North America, the rollout of Courtyard's redefined lobby space, Courtyard's Refreshing Business, should be nearly complete by the end of this year, and customers love it. After conversion, we've seen REVPAR index improve, and food and beverage profits increased by more than 50%.","For our flagship brand, Marriott Hotels & Resorts, new Greatroom lobbies have increased food and beverage sales and guest satisfaction, particularly among younger travelers. Greatroom lobbies should be rolled out worldwide by year-end 2015. You'll hear us talk more about the Marriott brand later this year as we focus on lifting the brand to new heights with additional product innovations and service initiatives.","In North America, you may recall that we were targeting special corporate rates to grow at a high-single-digit rate for 2013. Approximately 85% of our special corporate negotiated rates are now complete, with room rates running up, north of 5%, constrained a bit by uncertainty about the economy. Special corporate rates apply to nearly 15% of our full-service managed hotel room nights in North America.","Group business continues to improve. As of year end, our 2013 group revenue pace for the Marriott brand in North America was up about 6% with more than half of the growth coming from rate. The booking window continues to lengthen as hotel meeting space fills.","Across North America, we anticipate system-wide REVPAR in 2013 will increase 4% to 7% in the first quarter and full year. The high end of that range reflects today's strong demand and limited supply; the low end reflects our view that the federal government's inability to reach a comprehensive fiscal agreement will continue and the automatic sequestration will go into effect on March 1. We know that the sequestration will be a negative to the travel industry. How negative? We don't know. Our view is that sequestration itself is a sign of the failure of our political process, and that the longer it stays in place, the more that failure of our political process will become a negative to economic growth globally. In 2012, North America represented 75% of our worldwide fee revenue.","In Asia, we expect first quarter REVPAR to increase at a mid-single digit rate, strengthening a few points as the year progresses. We believe business in most markets is likely to gradually improve during the year as comparisons ease and travelers in China get back to work after the leadership transition. At the same time, many expect new supply will continue to constrain REVPAR growth in some markets in China. We expect Thailand and Indonesia to remain strong throughout the year.","Today, we have 45,000 rooms open in the Asia Pacific region and another 37,000 in our development pipeline. In China, our hotels are currently in 16 cities, and we expect to be in 50 cities by 2016. We are building on our leading upper-upscale and luxury market share in Shanghai and Beijing, even as we broaden our distribution to secondary and tertiary markets in China. Incidentally, we just opened our 20th hotel in Shanghai last month. This gives us 23% of the upper-upscale and luxury rooms in that market. And in 2012, our REVPAR index in Shanghai exceeded 130%, up 7% from 2011.","In Indonesia, we are seeing strong developer interest in resort markets. India continues to add Fairfield and Courtyard projects, and Thailand offers potential for suburban properties and resorts. In fact, we just signed a development deal that should double our presence in Thailand to nearly 7,000 rooms by 2017. Across Asia, we plan to open a hotel, on average, every 2 weeks for the next few years, doubling our hotels in the region by 2016. Last year, 9% of our fee revenue came from Asia.","In the Caribbean and Latin America region, we expect first quarter REVPAR will increase at a mid-single digit rate, improving to a mid- to high-single-digit rate for the full year. Here, we're more bullish than in October. While the economic growth has slowed a bit in Brazil, we've seen lodging demand strengthen in Mexico and the Caribbean. We are pursuing hotel development opportunities in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Chile. In 2012, roughly 5% of our fee revenue came from the Caribbean and Latin America region.","In Europe, we expect some modest improvement in GDP in 2013. But given the tough comparison to the Olympics and other events, we are still expecting flattish REVPAR growth for the quarter and the full year, similar to our outlook in October. Going forward, the region continues to offer tremendous development opportunities for limited-service hotels and conversions to the Autograph brand. We signed 6 Autographs in 2012 alone. Last year, Europe represented 8% of our worldwide fee revenue.","In the Middle East and Africa, we are modeling a mid-single-digit increase in REVPAR, consistent with our October outlook with double-digit REVPAR growth in the first quarter. In 2012, we signed 11 new projects in the region. Africa's extraordinary wealth of natural resources drives economic growth, and we expect to open our first 3 Marriott hotels in Sub-Saharan Africa no later than 2014. The Middle East and Africa region represent 3% of our fee revenue.","In fact, Alex Kyriakidis, President of Marriott's Middle East and Africa region, will be hosting a lunch and tour for investors in Dubai on March 11. Included on the tour will be our new JW Marriott Marquis hotel and The Ritz-Carlton, Dubai International Financial Center. Alex has deep experience in the region. Prior to joining Marriott last year, he was the Global Managing Director for Travel, Hospitality & Leisure at Deloitte. So give us a call or shoot Laura an email if you'd like to attend that lunch and tour.","Worldwide for 2013, we expect to open 30,000 to 35,000 rooms. Most of these rooms are already under construction or under renovation. Nearly half of our anticipated 2013 openings will be in the U.S., including conversions to our Autograph brand and newly built limited-service hotels.","Overall, outside the U.S., our growth is accelerating. We opened roughly 8,000 rooms in international markets in 2012, and we expect to open more than 18,000 rooms outside the U.S. in 2013. While non-U.S. markets represent 22% of our open rooms today, they represent nearly 70% of our rooms under construction. We increased our international development staff by 10% in 2012, and are growing the team by another 20% in 2013, adding local talent with deep market knowledge.","The UN World Tourism Organization recently reported that international tourist arrivals topped 1 billion trips for the first time in history in 2012. We would like to see 2 billion annual trips 10 years from now. We are all working to make that vision a reality, and we will be ready to serve these new travelers. Part of that work involves encouraging governments to adopt Smart Visa policies to stimulate global travel. Increasingly, across the world, there is recognition that travel and tourism represent trade, and there is a growing consensus to remove barriers and be more strategic in addressing visas and other access issues.","Now for some more thoughts about 2012 performance and our 2013 outlook, let me turn things over to Carl.","Carl T. Berquist","Thanks, Arne. Well, by now, you've seen our results both for the year and for the fourth quarter, and you know they were simply terrific. For the full year 2012, diluted earnings per share totaled $1.72. Adjusting the prior year for the Timeshare spin-off and other charges, EPS increased 31% and EBITDA rose 16%. Even excluding the Courtyard gain, EPS was up 25% and EBITDA rose 12%. Full year fee revenue totaled $1.4 billion, matching peak 2007 levels.","In 2012, North American system-wide REVPAR increased more than 6%, with room rates up more than 4%. At company-operated hotels, property level house profit margins rose 140 basis points. Over 27,000 rooms entered our system during the year, with 20% coming from conversions from other brands. We acquired the Gaylord brand with valuable long-term management agreements. The 509-room New York Essex House became a JW Marriott Hotel. And our Autograph brand increased to nearly 40 hotels, spanning 4 continents.","Our development organization had a great year. We signed over 57,000 rooms and over 300 hotels, ahead of our previous record of 55,000 rooms signed in 2007. At the end of the year, our pipeline of hotels under development or pending conversion increased to nearly 130,000 rooms. Congratulations to the development team.","Fourth quarter earnings per share totaled $0.56, $0.02 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range, largely due to better-than-expected fee revenue. In North America, REVPAR growth was constrained a bit by the election day and Hurricane Sandy, but many hotels benefited from post-storm recovery efforts later in the quarter.","REVPAR in Washington, D.C. declined 4% in the quarter, reflecting election distractions or shorter congressional calendar, lower government travel and flat government per diems. But in most of the country, demand continued to strengthen. REVPAR in Atlanta rose 10%, San Francisco increased 11% and New Orleans soared to 18%.","Across the Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand in North America, group REVPAR increased nearly 6%, with room rates up more than 3%. Food and beverage revenue growth was modest, reflecting the impact of Hurricane Sandy on East Coast conventions and meetings.","Outside North America, fourth quarter system-wide constant dollar REVPAR rose 3%, in line with our expectations. In Europe, REVPAR increased nearly 2% despite the tough economic -- climate. While REVPAR growth in France, Austria and the Czech Republic was strong, we saw weakening demand in London, largely due to fewer arrivals from the U.K. provinces.","REVPAR in the Middle East increased more than 10% in the quarter, benefiting from easy year-over-year comparisons. In the Caribbean and Latin American regions, REVPAR rose over 3%. Demand in Mexico and the Caribbean was strong, while Brazil's economy weakened and Panama suffered from new supply.","In Greater China, REVPAR rose 3% in the quarter. Leadership transition was delayed a bit, which caused a few group cancellations, while attendance at the trade fairs in Hong Kong were disappointing. Indonesia and Thailand saw double-digit REVPAR growth.","Total fee revenue increased by 9% in the quarter. Worldwide property level house profit margins increased 90 basis points in the fourth quarter, largely due to stronger room rates, lower energy costs and the benefit of continued efficiency improvements. This helped drive our worldwide incentive fees up 22% in the quarter. In North America alone, incentive fees increased 32%, largely due to strong year-to-date performance in Boston and New York.","The decline in owned, leased, corporate housing and other revenue in the quarter reflected the sale of our corporate housing business earlier in 2012 and 5 fewer leased hotels. After expenses, results reflected an increase in branding fees from our corporate credit card and stronger results at The Ritz-Carlton in Tokyo. These were offset by lower branding fees from residential sales and lower termination fees.","General and administrative expenses declined 6% in the fourth quarter, largely due to a $6 million reversal of a guarantee reserve in the 2012 quarter, as well as easy comparisons. Last year's G&A included guarantee reserve, loan losses and other charges.","For Marriott International, our adjusted operating profit margin, excluding the impact of reimbursed costs, increased to 40% in the 2012 fourth quarter from 33% in the 2011 quarter. EBITDA in the fourth quarter totaled $358 million, a 13% growth over adjusted EBITDA in the prior year.","We repurchased 31 million shares during the -- in the year. Since the economic recovery began in 2010, we have returned nearly $3 billion to shareholders in repurchases and dividends, $1.3 billion in 2012 alone.","In 2013, we expect worldwide system-wide REVPAR to increase 4% to 7%. Fee revenue could increase 7% to 11%, and incentive fees could rise 10% to 18%. Incentive fee growth will be likely constrained by more modest REVPAR growth in Europe and Asia than we've seen in recent years. License fees for Marriott Vacations Worldwide are unrelated to REVPAR but should increase modestly.","We expect owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses will decline 12% to 18% in 2013, reflecting several issues. First, our leased hotel in London will have a tough comparison to last year's Olympics. Second, we'll be renovating 2 leased properties in 2013, which will be disruptive to their results. And third, lower termination and residential branding fees and higher preopening costs will work against us.","All in all, we expect fully diluted EPS will total $1.90 to $2.05 in 2013, a 10% to 19% increase. Excluding the impact of the $41 million pretax gain on the sale of our Courtyard joint venture in 2012, this is a 16% to 25% increase year-over-year.","Last month, our REVPAR in North America increased 8%. But as Arne said, we can't ignore the risk to the economy associated with federal budget cuts scheduled for March 1. So we are guiding first quarter REVPAR to increase 4% to 7% in North America and 2% to 4% in international markets. Recall that the first quarter of 2013 will include 93 days compared to 84 days in the 2012 first quarter. We estimate the longer quarter alone will increase operating income by roughly $15 million to $20 million for the first quarter. All in all, we expect first quarter 2013 EPS will total $0.37 to $0.42.","Our cash flow is very strong. For the full year 2013, we expect EBITDA to total roughly $1.2 billion. Investment spending could total $600 million to $800 million, including about $100 million in maintenance spending. We will remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and repurchases and expect to recycle capital. In fact, we expect to return $800 million to $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2013.","We are very proud of our performance in 2012. We are also very proud of the results of the recent Fortune magazine survey that noted that for the 16th consecutive year, Marriott was named one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For. Marriott is 1 of only 13 companies that have appeared on every list since it was launched in 1998. Marriott's great workplace inspires the customer service that builds brand loyalty and forms the emotional connection to our brands, it is the foundation of our company culture and is largely responsible for our success.","We appreciate your interest in Marriott. [Operator Instructions] Jackie, we'll take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nikhil Bhalla with FBR.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just in terms of January REVPAR coming in 8%, would you give us some color on how much Washington, D.C. contributes to that?","Arne M. Sorenson","Who's got Washington, D.C. January numbers?","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, I got that. I got that.","Arne M. Sorenson","I think, we believe, that the inaugural impact was less than 1 point in our January numbers, which is maybe where your question is going. As we talk, we'll see whether we can find the Washington area REVPAR number for January or not. But it's about -- it's less than 1 point of REVPAR in that...","Carl T. Berquist","0.8.","Arne M. Sorenson","0.8.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","0.8. Okay. And just in terms of your group pace, the 6% group revenue pace for 2013, how is that looking in terms of quarters? Is that weighted more sort of towards the first half of the year or is it more of a back half phenomenon?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, there's a little bit of difference quarter-to-quarter, to be sure, and some of that is driven by seasonality. I think the back half is probably a bit stronger than the front half. But group is generally a pretty positive story. I mean, you look back at bookings in Q4 as an example. We think revenue that we put on the books in the quarter for the next 12 months was up 8% from a year earlier. So as we closed out the year, group business continues to be a relatively encouraging sign.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just wanted to focus on CapEx. You mentioned you're targeting $600 million to $800 million. If you could give us a sense of where that money is going, how much has been identified and are you assuming any recycling of capital in your cash flow assumptions?","Carl T. Berquist","That $600 million to $800 million is a gross number, it's not netted out any recycling. And yes, we would anticipate recycling during 2013, as opportunities come up to do that. I think, as you break down the $600 million to $800 million, probably 1\/3 of it or so are capital expenditures, the rest being things like key money and mez loans, things like that, Harry. It would be the normal allocation that we experience. We'll probably spend $200 million to $2.25 million on our EDITION construction on the 3 hotels we're building, and that's in that number.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then, my second question is, it looks like you may have built some assumption for share repurchase into your 2013 EPS guidance. Is that correct? And if so, how much has been built in?","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, we would expect to return anywhere from $800 million to $1 billion share repurchase and dividends to shareholders, and that is built into our model.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","But how much of the $800 million to $1 billion? It doesn't look like all of it has been built in to the $1.90 to $2.05 EPS estimate. I'm trying to get a sense of how much has been built in?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think it's all built-in. I think -- you'll find the areas that -- in the year, impact of share repurchase tends to be pretty insignificant. So probably, part of that is the way we model it. We assume that the stock price is staying up, going from where it is today, to a somewhat higher number by year end. And we built in sort of a steady-state share repurchase plan over the course of the year, without factoring in any possibility that there could be weaker times where we could seize more opportunities. And so if you just do the math, it doesn't produce much. It might be $0.01 or $0.02 in there, I suppose, Carl, for the full year, but it wouldn't be very significant.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I know you talked about your concerns about the federal budget after March 1, but it also looks like your corporate negotiated rates came in a little lower than you had -- maybe, had expected. So maybe your conservatism is more than just the federal budget issue, and I wonder if you can talk about that. And then, just, if you had any comments, your -- when you talked about your projected cash return to shareholders this year, it's lower than what it was in 2012. And I don't know if that's just related to timing of cash on the balance sheet, or if there's something strategic there that's causing it to be lower this year?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. Robin, so a couple of questions there. I think the special corporate negotiations came out maybe a little bit lighter than we would have anticipated, but maybe by 0.5 or so. Nothing meaningfully different. We are -- I think that doesn't give us much concern. I think, if anything, that could be explained by the anxiety around the fiscal cliff and therefore, economy, that many companies were facing in the fourth quarter when a lot of those negotiations took place. I think, as we look into the year, we see reasonably good performance from both transient and group business. And really, it's sort of a tough thing, in some respects to say, because we are -- very much, that bottom end of our range is driven by the likelihood that sequestration will take effect and our concern about the effect that, that will have on travel, even though we can't really tell you that we know how significant that impact will be because we really don't know how long the sequestration will last. But that is, singularly, what's driving our broader range and lower number in that range. When you look at...","Carl T. Berquist","Share repurchase.","Arne M. Sorenson","Share repurchase, it is a little bit lower...","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just, in general, return to -- return of cash to shareholders, the comment was in total, I think, share repurchase and dividends, so...","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, and that's about $800 million to $1 billion. I think one of the reasons we were able to drive more in 2012 was the benefit we got from ultimately getting out of the Timeshare business, both in terms of the cash taxes that were paid. We obviously recognized -- starting to recognize the losses that we incurred in that business, and that had impact on cash taxes. We -- you can see when you look at year-end debt levels between 2011 and 2012, our debt levels were up almost $800 million. Part of that is EBITDA-driven, part of that is also on lease and other guarantee reserves which go into that calculation. We did cycle out of some really non- -- unprofitable leases on some hotels in Europe, which also frees up some capacity, which allowed us to return a bit more to shareholders than would probably be normal course.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Loeb with Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can I follow up little bit on the incentive fees, Carl? I appreciated your remarks about the U.S. incentive fees growing. Can you talk a little bit about the outlook? What percentage of international hotels are earning IMF? I know last year, that was -- 2011, that was 67%. It seems like you're a long way from peak kind of participation in IMF, or paying IMF. Where do you think that goes in next year or 2?","Carl T. Berquist","Well, I think as you see the growth in margins and profits in the U.S., they're going to continue to grow. I think the reality is, as we've talked in the past, in the U.S., the likelihood of select-service hotels paying meaningful incentive fees will be a while, but the full-service hotels continue to -- the ones that are paying today, continue to pay more as they grow their margins and their net house profit, and more hotels join in from the full-service side. But I think on the select-service side in the U.S., that's going to stay -- that will not be meaningful for quite a while. I think on the international side, though, you'll continue to see growth in the Asia Pacific region, as well as the Middle East. I think Europe, until the markets come back in Europe, that it will be lackluster a little bit from a growth standpoint in Europe. But as Asia and the Middle East continue to grow, you'll continue to see meaningful growth on that side.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then, to follow up on Harry's question about asset recycling. What do you think the timing is on the sale of the London EDITION? And when do you think you'll start seeing proceeds from either condo sales or the eventual sale of the Miami hotel? And Arne, you said that was -- mid-2013 opening, there was Miami Herald article in December that said 1Q '14, is that still on track?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, so London EDITION will open midyear this year. We are hopeful that we will sell the hotel this year, shortly after opening, but we'll see. The Miami EDITION will not open until late '13. Is it possible it could slip until early '14? I suppose it's possible. But the project is coming along well and we're excited about the way it's coming together. We have -- there are only 26 residential units in that facility. They are on the market today. We are very pleased with the response we're getting from buyers who are interested in those units. And while deposits will be made soon on many of those units as they sell, closing is likely to follow -- formal and final closing is likely to follow the opening of the hotel. So the proceeds really won't come in until late '13 or probably into '14.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Arne, in your prepared remarks, I think you gave us some good color around your conservatism and what that has to do with. And I think last night when we -- a lot of us were looking at the release, we thought that you were just specifically talking about your business that's considerably related to the government. But I think it sounds more like you're just concerned about the impact that sequestration, overall, is going to have on the economy and the mindset of the consumer, is that correct?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I think it's both things, actually, Felicia. I think -- we've talked about the numbers that are driven by government travel before, we think it's about 5% for the industry across the United States. That number in the Washington area is probably more like 12%, something like that. We would expect that government and strongly government-related business, like government contractors of some sorts, will look early in the sequestration process to cut travel expenses. So that is, very much a connection to our industry, and our industry may be get hit a little bit harder than industries, on average, at least in the early stages of this. But beyond that, we are concerned that sequestration will be another ugly chapter. And you all know the details of this, but we not only have sequestration which will come on March 1, but we're going to end up with another debt ceiling issue and we're going to end up with a continuing resolution. As we watch it, we don't see that there's much reason for optimism, that there's going to be a quick resolution to this. And depending on how ugly it gets and how long it lasts, we think it is something that could expand from sort of like government travel-related thing into something that is a broader economy.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, because -- that's helpful. Because the question that I was asking myself is you lowered the low end by 100 basis points. And it would seem that just your exposure to government and government-related consumers alone wouldn't really have 100-basis-point impact on your REVPAR.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I think that's fair. You got to remember that even with the -- the guidance we're getting today is assuming the sequestration takes effect, which we think is the right assumption to make. We're still giving you a 3-point range. So while the 4% number is something that naturally has gotten a lot of your attention, we still think that even with sequestration, we should post numbers in the 4% to 7% range. And we don't -- we can't tell you for certain where it's going to be in that range, but obviously, 2\/3 of that range is above 5.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then, just curious, though, because it seems like the conventional wisdom on the economy and the outlook in the fall was actually worse than it is now when we were facing fiscal cliff and potential sequestration, then, so I'm just wondering what's changed in your mind from when you gave guidance in October until now?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think in October, we were a little less frightened by the fiscal cliff than we became by the time you got to December. And so you can sort of draw some lines and say that things got bleakest later in the year, not 1st of October. I think the 1st of October, we were hopeful that we would see political leadership reach a deal which was much more comprehensive and really have the capacity to put these issues behind us. And what we actually -- we got, then, quite bleak as the year progressed. And as we got into the holidays, I think there was concern that there might be no agreement whatsoever. And certainly, there was some relief that a deal was done on New Year's Eve. But having said that, that deal really resolved extraordinarily little. And the sequestration issues, obviously, were addressed in that, they were extended by 60 days. But here we are 60 days and there has been 0 progress. Debt ceiling issues are, in many respects, the same. They were extended for a very short period of time. And so right now we're looking at a series of federal fiscal crises that, in some respects, are harder to be optimistic that they'll be resolved quickly than it was the case in early October, where we were looking at the fiscal cliff generally.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. I have a very quick balance sheet question for Carl, but if I've overstayed my welcome, I'll ask him later.","Arne M. Sorenson","Go ahead.","Carl T. Berquist","What is that, Felicia?","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So Carl, if I just look at your cash balance for year end, it seems to be the lowest that it has been historically. Obviously, you've returned a lot of cash to shareholders. There's balance sheet, there's cash, there's a bunch of different things. Just wondering if this kind of level is the new norm, and does that protect you for a rainy day?","Carl T. Berquist","That's a good question. We dropped down to like $88 million, I guess. We usually try to stay around $100 million. And as long as we have access to commercial paper markets, which are robust, and our credit rating, we do, we kind of finance the business with the commercial paper markets. And that's backed with $1.75 billion revolver, so that for that rainy day, we always have that access. So we try to keep the cash balances right about $100 million. We dropped just a little below that at year end.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Attie with Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I understand qualitatively what the concerns are regarding sequestration. Can you tell us how you quantified the 100 basis point impact to REVPAR? Was that based on a view of what the GDP impact would be translated down to lodging demand? Or was there another way that you kind of came up with that estimation?","Arne M. Sorenson","All really good questions, Josh, and I wish we had a really powerful and precise answer. We don't? Quibbling with you a little bit, it is not the case that we're saying the sequestration will have 100 basis point impact on REVPAR. We don't know enough to know that, that is a fair number or not a fair number. All we've done is say, as we sit here today, we think we are 10 days away from something which is going to happen, which will be negative to the travel business. And as a consequence, we think, needs to be contemplated in what we say about our expectations for the way our business is going to perform. And it has broadened our range a little bit on the downside. But again, I don't -- sitting here today, we can't tell you what we think the GDP impact will be, and we can't really even tell you what we think our REVPAR impact will be. We sit around and we talk about it, we can see some signs that some government agencies are already looking at, pulling back on meetings and spend a little bit less on travel. And so we know that that's likely, that's -- what we've seen so far doesn't give us material concerns. But the sequestration, really, hasn't started. Now there are some positives in that government is -- I talked about the 5% national and 12%-ish in the Washington area, government business is already weak. So what we're seeing over last couple of years is the government has been much more cautious about travel spending. They have been much more cautious about food and beverage spending when they do hold meetings. In fact, on a number of our hotels, we'll talk about how government groups, over the last year or 18 months, won't order lunch for their attendees in a government meeting. And so the hotels have adopted by offering, in effect, lunch bags that can be bought by them on their per diems at very inexpensive cost. Or in some markets, you see them walking down the street to the local sandwich shop. And so hopefully, this will not become an enormous impact to the business. But it won't be good for the business, and it will be in place, at least, for some period of time.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And I guess given that dynamic and your concerns around it, how do you think about capital allocation and specifically, return of capital? Are you considering timing your buybacks to maybe accommodate some of that risk? Or maybe shifting some of the return of capital to dividends in order to simply not make a call on your stock price, which might be volatile under that scenario? Or is the buyback simply going to be programmatic, as cash comes in the door, it kind of goes back out to the repurchase? How should we think about that for '13?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, we're always factoring in our internal cash flow dynamics as well as some perception of where the markets are when we make the fine decisions around our share repurchase decisions. I don't think that the sequestration or the fiscal situation in the United States, at least, in terms of the current crisis, is a terribly significant factor in our long-term dividend versus share repurchase policy, or even the management of our balance sheet. We've got tremendous cash generation in this model. Carl talked about returning $3 billion to shareholders in the last 3 years. Those are big numbers. There's no reason to presume that we won't continue to return big numbers to our shareholders in the years to come.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker with MLV.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Just real quickly on sequestration. It sounds like you have not yet seen any impact of the sequestration in your forward bookings, but your concern is that you will. Is that correct?","Arne M. Sorenson","That's essentially right. I mean, we've got a few little anecdotes of some meetings that have been canceled. But barely, when we look at our REVPAR numbers to date this year, we don't think it's showing up in any measurable way yet.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, I just was hoping if you can give us some color. In 2012, it looks like -- backing out the Gaylord transaction, it looks like over 100% of your system expansion came from franchise system growth more than managed system growth. Is 2012 an anomaly? Or does your pipeline look heavily skewed towards franchise growth as well?","Arne M. Sorenson","You're -- I mean, we opened 8,000 rooms outside the United States. And I have to go back and double check, but I think many of those were managed units. I think when you look at the way the company as a whole rolls up, you get some contraction in -- the Marriott, for example, if you look at the Marriott brand year-over-year in North America, I think, we were down 1,200 rooms. And the 1,200 rooms, I mean, I can think of 2 hotels off the top of my head, each about 600 rooms, that were managed, that we took out of our system in 2012, basically, for quality reasons. And so you get some decisions like that, which new managed growth maybe refills that bucket to where it was before, and you end up with, obviously, more franchise growth than managed growth. I think as you look into 2013, add 18,000 rooms instead of 8 opening outside the United States, those will still be significantly managed, and we'll see the company numbers, as a whole, good managed growth going forward. Having said that, to be sure that as limited-service hotels begin to open, which will be a little bit in '13 but in '14 as well, that growth is mostly franchise system growth.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then just real quickly, with -- I don't know if you could give us any color or not. We've heard anecdotally that we've seen a lot of construction delays in the Sandy-hit areas, of the northeast New York area and a little bit more in New Jersey and Mid-Atlantic. Have you guys seen any impact with regards to Sandy? Is that going to push some of your pipeline more into the back half of the year than the front half of the year as a result?","Arne M. Sorenson","I haven't heard that. But to be fair, I'm not sure I've asked specifically around construction progress in the Sandy -- most impacted areas from Sandy. I will note, though, just that you raised Sandy, our reported numbers in Q4 include as comp hotels, the Battery Park Ritz-Carlton and the Financial Center Marriott both in Downtown New York and both of which were closed for about 1 month. And they -- because our comp rules basically work where you look at full year performance of an asset or number of rooms available, they did not fall out of our comp set. But they did have an impact, because obviously, during the month they were closed, they posted 100% decline in REVPAR.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was going to ask one about the sequestration, but I think we've kind of beaten that one to death, so I'll move on to -- on the group revenue, you guys gave your group pace numbers as well as a look at in the quarter, for the quarter. But we've heard a lot of owners and other managers talk a little bit about a slower pace for food and beverage spending. I'm just wondering if you guys could tell us what you're seeing there and elaborate a little bit? I think Arne, in the prepared remarks, you might have mentioned that it was soft in the fourth quarter. Have you seen that bounce back at all after Hurricane Sandy?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, Sandy certainly had an impact on food and beverage in the fourth quarter because obviously those groups, some groups canceled. I think we were stronger in the West than in the South in Q4. That's probably mostly Sandy-related, but it could also be some impact of election and some other things which, obviously, have a little bit more of an impact in Washington and in some other places. I would say, generally, that food and beverage doesn't give us enormous concern going forward, that group business actually seems to be building well, and in any quarter, we may have some disconnect between food and beverage growth and rooms growth. I suspect, on a full year basis in '12, we probably saw 1 point or 2 points difference between rooms growth and F&B growth. But F&B is growing, notwithstanding, and should continue to grow in 2013.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. And then, my second one would simply be on China. Earlier in 2012, some things have slipped in the pipeline and the timing of some openings -- and I'm just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of how you guys are seeing the year, both from a demand and supply perspective, play out? Has anything, kind of, post the government transition, has anything slipped or changed on the pipeline? Do you guys feel a little bit more confident about the supply side? And then, how do you think REVPAR kind of trends throughout 2013?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, we are hopeful that we'll see China build over the course of the year. I think the -- there's some sense of stability returning in the months now following the Chinese government transition. Having said that, I don't think sitting here today, we could say we've seen a quick snap back to the levels that were maybe a year ago or before the impending government transition started to have some impact. But we do see some early signs of stability, which should be helpful. We did see our development opening slow in '12. As we've looked at that pipeline, those projects are still alive, they should open in '13, maybe a few in '14 at the latest. We don't think we lost any projects. One other thing on REVPAR, we will certainly see easing comparisons as the year goes along. So if you look by quarter at China last year, we started in the 10% range, and I think we ended in the 3% or 4% range in the fourth quarter with sort of a steady decline quarter-over-quarter in those numbers. And so that will help us as we look at it as well going forward. And then, in terms of supply threat, generally, the South, if you look at places like Sanya on Hainan Island and Guangzhou, these are places that are going to continue to see significant hotel openings. And hotels that are in those markets are going to have to face that supply growth. And by all means, there are third parties that are calculating the supply growth in these markets. But you're talking about, in Hainan Island, 10,000 rooms opening this year, some number like that. This is not insignificant supply growth, it's a great market and it's a growing market. So over time, that supply will certainly be appropriate, but in the short term, it'll put continued pressure on REVPAR in cities like that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions, Arne. You referenced supply growth, and you said it's becoming incrementally easier to get financing on limited service. We're actually hearing that it's getting easier as well for full-service with the banks, the insurance companies, et cetera, getting more aggressive looking for fee income and spreads. Could you talk about that and how much easier maybe it's gotten? And is that kind of next thing we're going to have to deal with in '14 or '15?","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, Bill. This is Carl. It's interesting. We have seen, on the limited-service side, financing getting a little better. But it's still under terms that are requiring the developer to guarantee the debt, provide credit enhancements, and the leverage isn't what it was way back when, so to speak. But that money is becoming available, especially from regional and local banks as the CMBS market has strengthened, providing capacity for those. As for the full-service hotels, especially, whether in suburban or even urban full-service hotels, we haven't seen new construction-type financing. Now financing is starting to show up for asset sales, but not for new construction. You can always get it whether, if you have something where the city is helping out or you're getting some type of mixed-use situation. But by and large, those -- we haven't seen that construction financing becoming available without significant credit enhancements or pretty low leverage with a lot of equity in the deal.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Second question is that we're facing a situation with higher gas prices here over the past, what, 45 days or so, and the payroll tax hike that took effect. It seems like we're seeing pressure on the lower end consumer in other areas. As you look across your brand portfolio, is it becoming apparent that maybe there's some weakness or emerging weakness in the lower price point brands? As you look at, maybe, Spring Break, as the summer vacation season starts to get booked up, anything you're seeing there that would give early indication of struggles ahead?","Arne M. Sorenson","I don't think so. In fact, I think if you look through the end of the year -- and I know that's before the -- some of that tax increases kick in, payroll taxes and the like. But we've actually seen more consistent strength on the weekends than during the weeks, which basically would tell you that the leisure business is a bit stronger than business, business, if you will.","William C. Marks - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","That's true at the lower ADR hotel level?","Arne M. Sorenson","That's certainly true as far a low as we go. And I'm not sure we are, even in Fairfield, we're likely to pick up much of the consumers who are hardest hit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had a question on group. And I know when you talk about group, it's generally limited to the Marriott brand, North America. But at this point, how much of your anticipated group room nights are booked? And how does that compare to the year ago? Then, I have a couple of small follow-ups.","Arne M. Sorenson","It's about the same. It's about 70% as of the first of the year for the MHR brand. And that really has not shifted very much. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, and I know a few of our competitors in the industry have talked about the lengthening of the booking window. And I think that is starting some, but it's not a significant factor yet.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And within your guidance, do you still see full-service outperforming select-service? Or how do you see that transpire this year versus last year?","Arne M. Sorenson","It's a good question. I would -- I think they're about the same ballpark actually.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Earlier on the call, Arne, you were talking about how brands afford you opportunities for growth -- or the new brands afford you opportunities for growth. And I know you were talking in the context of Autograph, EDITION and Gaylord. But at this point -- do you -- and you have a pipeline obviously that gives you a steady unit growth for a while. But at this point, do you see opportunities for you to either acquire or develop incrementally new brands?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. It is -- this is sort of one of the musings we used to sort of talk about internally a bit. But the -- I think 5 years ago, and we could go back and I'll look at transcripts of these calls and I'm almost certain we would find questions along these lines, \"How do you feel about your brand lineup? Is it complete? Do you think you've got any gaps in it?\" And I think the answer is that -- we would have given, then, I personally would have given them was, \"We've got a pretty full brand lineup and we don't see significant gaps. And we wouldn't encourage you to think that we're going to be adding many more brands.\" But then, you look at the last 5 years and we've got Autograph and we've got AC Hotels by Marriott, and we've got EDITION, and we've got Gaylord, and you look at Fairfield in India, you look at Fairfield in Brazil. Those are -- we're using the same name that we've used for a brand in the United States, but in many respects, they are different products and they are focused at a local traveling population, and they're new brands in those markets, in effect. And I think, as the last 5 years has taught us, we think that the next 5 years, as we're pursuing growth around the world, we will continue to add brands to the portfolio. Those brands may not be global, they may play a role in a given part of the world and not beyond that, but they're still -- when you look at our brand lineup by region, there are places where we have gaps. And I think we'll fill in those gaps as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you just talk a little bit about the EDITION brand and what your exit plan might be, or what the time frame is, as think about that brand of buying, building and exiting it?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, we have the 3 hotels under construction. We've talked about London and Miami already on the call. London will open midyear this year. We are optimistic that we'll sell it, hopefully, this year. It is probably not wise to expect, either us internally or you externally, that we will sell the others until after they open. Certainly, the way we model our balance sheet and look at the capacity we have in managing our cash flow, we would assume that Miami would not sell until probably 2014, and New York, Clock Tower building not until late '14 at the earliest, or '15. But for all 3, we remain quite optimistic here about our ability to recover all the capital that we've invested and keep decades long management contracts. And as we mentioned in our remarks, we are already seeing not just those projects come to fruition in a way that's exciting, but we've seen our partners around the world respond favorably to the commitment we've made to that brand and as a consequence, we've signed more deals and we're talking about signing even further more deals in the EDITION brand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.","Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just, I wanted to get a little bit of clarification, and I don't mean to be trivial with this question, but you did say your January REVPAR was up 8%. But I know that for your first quarter, you do get those last 3 days of December. Just to be clear here, is that -- when you say January, is that January 1 or 31, or did you include those last 3 days?","Arne M. Sorenson","January 1 to 31.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Whitney Stevenson with JMP Securities.","Whitney Stevenson","I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the news about the development in Aurora, Colorado and if you can state anything about your plans there, and if you have any other ideas for what you might do with the Gaylord brand?","Arne M. Sorenson","There's not much that can be said there other than what's been stated publicly. Obviously, Gaylord was very far along in working with the state and local authorities in Colorado to get the Aurora project financed in the way that made sense for them. With the transaction they did for us, they stepped back and essentially said they would not be pursuing that transaction. We'd obviously be interested in seeing another Gaylord Hotel if it makes sense and can make financial sense and so we've got our teams working with some prospective partners to see whether or not that makes sense but we've got nothing to announce at this point. And obviously for the Gaylord brand, generally, we love the brand, we love the 4 hotels that they've got. They are, by definition, big hotels that take years to go from idea to opening. Over time, it would be great to see us at a few more, but we'll have to see how that develops and they're certainly big enough that it'd be hard to give any prediction about when that would happen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with ISI Group.","Richard A. Hightower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just one quick question on G&A guidance for the first quarter. It does look a little bit high compared to our model and I'm wondering if there's anything going on there other than simply the calendar change?","Carl T. Berquist","No. I think in the fourth quarter, we had some ins and outs, but I think for G&A for the full year and the quarter, you would assume a run rate of somewhere between 3% and 5% in G&A for '13.","Arne M. Sorenson","But I think the longer quarter is a piece of that...","Carl T. Berquist","Oh, yes, a longer quarter is a piece of -- yes, oh, I'm sorry. Yes, because we have 93 days versus 84, you'll have a higher G&A.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Rennardson with Jefferies.","Ian Rennardson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Accor, this morning, was telling us about the actions it was taking to combat the negative effects from OTAs. Are you seeing any change in the behavior of OTAs?","Arne M. Sorenson","No. I mean, the OTAs are obviously, partners of ours, particularly in the leisure space and they are disproportionately more relevant in leisure destinations. We continue to work with them as best we can to make sure the relationships are constructive and fair. I think we remain reasonably pleased with the level of business which is coming through our own online channels, marriott.com, at over $8 billion in sales in 2012. We think it's one of the top 10 retail sites in the world in any industry and maybe that, because of the power of that site we've got less contribution from these independent OTAs than the industry as a whole does. We know anecdotally from a number of markets, like New York, that we get a relatively small fraction of contribution from those channels compared to many of the independents and even some of the -- some of our branded competitors. But it's a space we continue to watch very carefully.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Laura E. Paugh","Robin?","Carl T. Berquist","Maybe that was the final question.","Arne M. Sorenson","She asked something before, so maybe that was our final question. Thank you, all, very much for your time and interest.

[Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the floor over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer.","Arne M. Sorenson","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Joining me today are: Carl Berquist, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today, July 12, 2012, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","I know that first and most important question you may have is, are you seeing a slowdown in North America, and the answer is no. There's plenty of evidence of continuing strength in our lodging business in North America. In North America year-to-date, the Marriott brand special corporate revenue has been strong, up over 8%. Group revenue rose 7% year-to-date, and group bookings for the second half are even stronger.","Our strong book of business in 2012 allowed us to drive REVPAR aggressively in the first quarter. But in the second quarter, strong seasonal demand, combined with a continuing recovery, yielded an uptick in sellout nights. While we were pleased to show 6% REVPAR growth in our company-managed U.S. Marriott hotels during the second quarter, we realized that we turned away some higher-rated business because our hotels were full. For example, in Hawaii, occupancy at Marriott-branded hotels increased from 79% to 81% year-over-year in the second quarter, while occupancy at our competitive set hotels grew from 72% to 78%. As our hotels reached capacity, we had less room to grow occupancy than the market as a whole.","Looking ahead, this is good news because as occupancies build, further room rate improvement should follow. For North America overall, we expect this strong book of group and special corporate business to yield excellent results in the seasonally lighter third and fourth quarters, and we continue to expect 6% to 8% REVPAR growth for full year 2012.","Outside North America, we are fine-tuning our thoughts on REVPAR growth for the rest of the year. In Asia and the Middle East, REVPAR growth rates for a few luxury hotels are expected to moderate in the second half, largely associated with individual market issues. In Europe, third quarter REVPAR will be helped by the Olympics in London and the Euro Cup Championship. At the same time, the weak European economy will likely create headwinds. So we are expecting total international REVPAR to increase 5% to 7% on a constant dollar basis and about 300 basis points less on a local currency basis.","We've also reduced our room opening expectations a bit for 2012. In the first quarter, we noted slippage in opening dates from 2012 to 2013 for some new hotels in Asia and the Middle East. In the second quarter, the slippage continued in these markets, as well with as with a few projects in Mexico. We continue to see a lot of conversion opportunities around the world, but they, too, are taking a bit longer as some projects require more extensive renovation before flagging. As a result, today we expect to open 20,000 to 25,000 rooms in 2012. Since this reduction is largely timing, we continue to expect to add 90,000 to 105,000 rooms from 2012 through 2014.","Given all of this, we've tweaked our outlook for fee revenue for 2012 down by about $20 million. $15 million of the decline in the third and fourth quarter is associated with REVPAR, unit openings and the stronger dollar, with the balance largely associated with the sale of our corporate housing business. For EPS, the impact of the sale of our corporate housing business is immaterial.","Getting back to the second quarter. As I said, North American demand was very strong. Renovations at a couple of large hotels had a negative impact on REVPAR, but we saw double-digit REVPAR growth in the quarter at our company-operated hotels in Miami, Philadelphia, New Orleans, San Diego and Los Angeles. In fact, at more than 55,000 rooms in California, system-wide comparable REVPAR rose 10% in the second quarter.","Washington, D.C. is another important market. In fact, D.C. is so meaningful that its weak REVPAR in the quarter reduced our company-operated North American REVPAR by 1 point. But even here, there is good news. Interest in the upcoming election is starting to drive political business to the city. Group revenue bookings in D.C. for the Marriott brand are up 10% for the second half of 2012 and 16% for 2013. 2013 should be a good year overall in this market, but we'll have to see how government demand shakes out. Next year's government per diems will be set this August, and we will be watching this carefully.","In total, group business in the U.S. was very strong in the quarter. Group revenue for company-operated Marriott hotels increased nearly 8%. Catering revenue increased 7% and remains quite profitable. Looking ahead for the second half of the year, group booking pace is up 10% and 2013 booking pace is up 8%. Just 12 months ago, our 2013 booking pace was up only 1%.","We are very bullish about pricing in North America in 2013. For group business on the books for next year, room rates are running up 4%. On the transient side, we are targeting price increases for special corporate business at a high single-digit rate on average. We saw strong performance in the second quarter, in part due to the very favorable supply environment in most markets. Smith Travel estimates supply is growing at less than 1% in the U.S. this year. And in total, U.S. industry rooms under construction stand at 60,000 rooms, compared to over 200,000 rooms in 2007.","Outside North America, system-wide comparable REVPAR rose over 7% on a constant dollar basis or roughly 5% using local currencies. Growth in China moderated in the second quarter but continued to deliver outstanding performance, with constant dollar REVPAR up 8%. Weak economic conditions in Europe, India and Hong Kong constrained growth, and some small markets suffered from oversupply such as Hyderabad in India and Shenzhen and Sanya in China.","Occupancies at our hotels in the Middle East improved compared to last year's Arab Spring results. However, travel wholesalers still aren't jumping back into the market, so we are likely to continue to see volatility here for a while longer. Finally, our hotels in Japan recovered from last year's tragic tsunami.","Turning to development. Our brands remain highly attractive to owners and franchisees around the world. Our worldwide pipeline remains at roughly 115,000 rooms, excluding the nearly 8,000 Gaylord rooms in the works. We continue to build market share as measured by rooms. According to STR, in the U.S., we have 10% of open rooms but nearly 20% of rooms under construction. Year-to-date, we've added nearly 100 North American hotels to our development pipeline, compared to just 57 in the first half of last year. Most of this year's new projects in North America were limited service deals, but we also added 15 full-service hotels to the pipeline. And that doesn't account Gaylord.","But lest you worry about overbuilding, financing remains very tight. Conversion activity is very strong, and our pace of new signings remains less than half of the robust years of 2007 and 2008. It's been just over 3 weeks since our China analyst meeting. We were delighted that so many of you were able to join us in both Beijing and Shanghai as we toured some extraordinary hotels. In China, we talked about a very bright future for Marriott. With 115,000-room pipeline, growth on all continents around the world and REVPAR growth running 6% to 8%, we are seeing the makings of that bright future now.","Now Carl will take us through the second quarter quarter's results. Carl?","Carl T. Berquist","Thanks, Arne. In the second quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.42, a 24% increase from the prior year adjusted results and consistent with our $0.39 to $0.43 second quarter guidance. Our year-over-year comparison adjusts last year's results for the Timeshare spinoff and other charges.","There were a lot of ins and outs in the quarter. Compared to the midpoint of our expectations, our fees were about $0.02 below guidance due to weaker-than-expected REVPAR in some markets and the timing of franchise relicensing fees. In contrast, our leased hotels outperformed by about $0.01, with very strong REVPAR growth particularly in London. Timing of branding fees added another $0.01. The remaining $0.01 benefit came from some one-time items, including a termination payment net of a key money charge, the impairment of a property in a joint venture interest and a favorable tax item.","Worldwide constant dollars systemwide REVPAR rose nearly 7%, consistent with our 6% to 8% guidance. This growth in REVPAR, together with ongoing cost controls, resulted in worldwide house profit margins increasing 110 basis points during the second fiscal quarter and house profit per available room increasing 9%. Total fee revenue in the second quarter increased by 7%, with incentive fees up 12%. In North America, incentive fees increased 15% despite lower incentive fees in Washington D.C. As Arne mentioned, we expect D.C. to improve in the second half, with stronger group business already on the books.","Given the recent strengthening in the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange rates were a more significant issue this year than last. We typically hedge roughly 70% of our exposure to the euro, pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen for 1 year at a time. However, we have operations across more than 70 countries in all, including over 30 other currencies. For the full year, our guidance assumes approximately $9 million year-over-year lower fees due to foreign exchange.","Owned, leased and other revenues net of direct expenses more than doubled, reflecting very strong performance at leased hotels in Tokyo and London. In addition, termination fees rose $12 million, branding fees increased $9 million. General and administrative expenses included a $7 million charge for key money related to the termination fee I just mentioned and $5 million in new reserves, largely for guarantee payments. Outside of these items, our G&A expense met our expectations.","Our company margins improved dramatically. Adjusting for cost reimbursements, Marriott International's pretax margins totaled nearly 35% in the quarter, up 160 basis points from the prior year's adjusted results. EBITDA increased 13% over the prior year's adjusted amount, and EBITDA margins totaled 48%. Return on invested capital was very strong.","For the third quarter, we expect worldwide system-wide REVPAR to increase 6% to 8%, with continued strength in group and special corporate demand in North America. Retail demand should also be strong. The recent East Coast storm filled hotels from Ohio to Washington during what was expected to be a slow week. We were glad our associates were able to help their communities.","Through the summer, we expect high occupancy from the Democratic Convention in Charlotte and the Republican Convention in Tampa. Better airlift into the markets in the Caribbean and Mexico is also fueling demand. And as mentioned, the London Olympics and the Euro Cup Championship should help third quarter demand in Europe. Incidentally, congratulations to Spain on their big win. We expect general and administrative expenses will total roughly $155 million in the third quarter, largely related to normal inflation and costs associated with some property workout.","We completed the sale of our minority interest in the Courtyard joint venture early in the third quarter. Marriott will continue to operate the 115 Courtyard hotels under a long-term management agreement. 2\/3 of the portfolio has received the Courtyard refreshing business lobby and most of the hotels will complete rooms renovations in the next 18 months. With this transaction, Marriott expects to recognize about $5 million in fee revenue for deferred base fees and approximately $40 million gain in the third quarter. We've already received $90 million in cash proceeds from the transaction, demonstrating once again our success in recycling capital. Bottom line, third quarter earnings per share should increase 34% to 41% from third quarter 2011 adjusted earnings per share.","For the full year 2012, we expect global REVPAR to increase 6% to 8%, EPS to increase 26% to 34% and EBITDA to increase 12% to 17% over the prior year adjusted amounts. Including a $210 million investment for Gaylord, we expect investment spending in 2012 to total $850 million to $950 million. That reflects about $100 million in maintenance spending.","We expect to return roughly $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2012. We repurchased 10.5 million shares in the second quarter for $400 million, a significant increase from the first quarter levels. To be sure, we continue to look for opportunities for investment in our business. If we find value-creating investments like Gaylord, share repurchases could vary from these amounts. We will remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and repurchases.","As I mentioned at our Analyst Day last month, we expect to share our 2013 earnings outlook with you in February after we complete our budget process. So we will not be providing earnings guidance for 2013 this coming October. We appreciate your interest in Marriott. We are very excited about the future of the company and hope you are, too. [Operator Instructions] Beverly, we'll take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Smedes Rose - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","It's Smedes Rose. I just wanted to make sure I understand -- the $20 million of lowered fee, did you -- I just want to be sure, it sounds like about nearly 1\/2 of that reflects the FX and the balance is just due to slower results at international properties. Is that correct?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I think it's -- to be fair, it's going to be less than that for FX. That FX number is a year-over-year number that we use at $9 million. And the $20 million that we're talking about is basically compared to our prior guidance, so those are not quite apples-to-apples. But FX, relicensing fees -- and relicensing fees, by and large, are driven by the sale of existing franchised hotels. And that volume has been down a bit lower than we expected, a little bit softer REVPAR with some fine-tuning around individual assets. And then the other thing that we didn't talk about in our prepared remarks, the sale of the ExecuStay business. And with it, the elimination of that is a mid-single-digit number millions of dollars on a full year basis, I think.","Smedes Rose - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then when did you guys start to see the trend line for international business start to, I guess, deteriorate and therefore have to bring down your -- the full year outlook for international? And does this bring into question the 3-year outlook that you presented specifically for China just in June?","Arne M. Sorenson","We think on the second question, it does not bring into question on a multiyear basis at all. And let's stress the words we used in the prepared remarks. This is not a thematic reduction but driven by individual market dynamics. So we talked about Shenzhen and Sanya as an example. When we look at the forecasters' -- the forecast that rolled out through our system here for the end of this quarter, what we saw was individual stories. And every time we looked at it to see whether there was a theme, we really did not see a global slowdown theme. But what we saw was some individual markets, particularly some luxury hotels that were impacted either by supply or by some other specific market conditions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just on your -- on REVPAR for this quarter, I just want to understand your full service, and specifically your Marriott Hotels & Resorts brands. The brand reported 6% REVPAR in the second quarter. That's a deceleration from the 7% in Q1, and it's also below Smith Travel results for the second quarter. So I understand the D.C. weighting, but D.C. actually improved first quarter to second quarter. The group side should start to act better. And now we're talking about yield management issues as to one of the reasons why you didn't get pricing. And I guess, I'm trying to understand if there's maybe more of a structural issue here or why we're back to having that question because you're now below Smith Travel again.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. And again, Smith Travel, just as a reminder, is a really blunt instrument. So Smith Travel, you're looking at a broad number of hotels distributed across the United States in a way that which is different from our distribution. And even though we are big, differences in our distribution between the industry as a whole and the performance at individual assets can have an impact on those numbers. So we feel great about the way our sales offices are working and the way our brand is resonating with customers. So I think the best indication of that is the data we've given you on group business and on special corporate, which are up substantially, and there is no sign at all that we've got a problem associated with that. When we look at our headline REVPAR number and we look at the Smith Travel number -- and again, we can run as many theoretical adjustments to this as you can imagine. But the ones that are most significant to us are D.C., which is about 1 point difference, and a couple of big hotels where renovations extended longer and had a more disruptive impact than we thought. And that's probably about another 0.5 point or so to the MHR number, maybe even 0.7 or a point to the MHR number in Q2.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just as a follow-up then on another issue that I'm concerned about that might be structural is incentive fees. Incentive fee growth was 12% in the quarter. We were looking for more like 20%. The REVPAR unit level profits don't seem to be translating into that incentive fee growth. And I guess, again, is there some kind of structural issue here where either the Courtyard or other property management contracts have been revised so much that we're just not going to see the profit increases and those incentive increases as we would have seen in previous cycles? And it does seem like more of them are paying incentive fees, but the amount, the dollar amount, just doesn't seem as much as we used to -- we would've expected at this point.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. And I think we still expect in full year 2012 that our incentive fees will be growing about 20%. And I think that's a more important growth rate than to look at than what we put on the books in any particular quarter. Obviously, a few million dollars more of incentive fees in Q2 would give you a materially different year-over-year growth rate for that quarter. And a few million dollars is easy to miss by because of stories in individual markets. There is not really anything happening here which is structural. I thought it was interesting that in Q2, our domestic incentive fees were up higher than our international incentive fees, which is, I think, maybe the first we've seen that in a while and looks good and feels good. We know that the managed Residence Inn and Courtyard portfolios in the United States have been under a massive renovation program, which as we get beyond that and those hotels no longer suffer from the renovation impact themselves but ramp from that, I think that will be helpful both in terms of the REVPAR performance of those assets. But also hopefully, we'll get back towards incentive fees at some point in time in the future. But we've -- it's as steady as she goes sort of comment from us at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to get a little more color on -- we're sure having -- lowered the range of international REVPAR but maintain the worldwide REVPAR number. Should we think of that as that you're more likely to come in the lower end of the worldwide range? Or are you feeling more confident about North America? In other words, just wondering why that company-wide range didn't move at all.","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I mean, I think to be fair, we've now got 2 quarters in the books at just less than 7%, I think. Year-to-date, it's 6.7%, 6.6%. And so the likelihood of being -- of adding 2 more quarters at 6% to 8% and having the full year math drive us to a high end of that range, I think, is getting increasingly less likely. But we still think 6% to 8% is the right global set of assumptions for Q3 and for Q4. And we think we'll end up within that range for the full year, which is why we didn't fiddle with that guidance range.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But it sounds like maybe more of kind of likely the 6% to 7% than the 7% to 8% seems fair, right? So...","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I think 6% to 7% is more likely than the high end of 7% to 8%. But we're not -- again, business is good.","Carl T. Berquist","So remember, international on total fees is only about 25% of our total fees, with domestic driving 75% of those fees.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just on that international front, what you reported on the quarter, International Luxury looks good in Q2. I mean, the REVPAR is up 11%. I guess, can you talk about when you started to see this kind of inflection point that you're talking about that led you to lower that range today?","Arne M. Sorenson","Again, to talk about inflection point, I think, is to overstate it. I think what we're talking about is the impact of 3 or 4 or 5 significant hotels which drive those numbers, and they would be concentrated probably in a few Asia-Pacific and Middle East markets. And we are not saying with that reduction from 6% to 8% to 5% to 7% for international hotels that, that should be translated into a view that there is a relative slowdown which is more thematic than that.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you actually give a little more specific...","Arne M. Sorenson","Let's -- Robin, you've done 3 now, I think, so let's keep going...","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.","Charles Scholes","Can you tell us what the most recent -- how your REVPAR index has been doing in the last 2 quarters and how that's been trending? I think historically, you've been around 125%. What's the latest on that?","Arne M. Sorenson","We are up a few tenths year-to-date. And that's both a -- that's a North America number, U.S. number mix of all our brands.","Charles Scholes","Okay. So pretty consistent up slightly. And then lastly here, you had a looks like a termination charge of $12 million. Can you just give a little bit more color on that? And I'm sorry, termination fee. And is that the main driver why full year owned, leased, corporate housing guidance is coming up?","Carl T. Berquist","Yes. I think if you look at what we said in our prepared remarks, we said termination fees increased $12 million. The biggest part of that was a $14 million termination fee we received related to 1 hotel. But I point out that as I mentioned in G&A, we had about a $7 million charge against that, a little bit of geography between owned, leased and G&A. So it netted to about $5 million then. And that $14 million is part of what's driving the full year owned, leased and other up for the year.","Laura E. Paugh","But London and Tokyo are both...","Carl T. Berquist","Yes. I think the other thing for the full year, and Laura points out a good point, is our owned and leased hotels are doing very well. And they are -- that's also another big part of that increase for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker with MLV & Co.","Ryan Meliker - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to talk a little bit about system growth. It looks like for 2 quarters now, the managed room count has gone down, totaling about 2,500 rooms over the past 2 quarters and looks flat basically over the past 5 quarters. Can you give us any color on what you're seeing? Are you seeing -- are you not seeing growth on managed side and it's all coming in franchising as you look out to 2014? And then can you talk a little bit about conversions and give us an idea on the majority of conversions that you're going to see coming in franchising? Or do you think you'll get some of those in managed as well?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. So I think this is a different story for the United States and the rest of the world. United States, our growth obviously in a low supply environment is Sea-first [ph] our limited service brands and probably disproportionately Autograph in the U.S. Those, it shouldn't surprise you, are mostly franchise vehicles. And by and large, we're in a state of the cycle where we're not seeing a lot of new build full service hotels. That's where we're most likely to get managed growth. Obviously, if and when we get the Gaylord transaction closed, which we're still optimistic about that, we'll add a number of about 8,000 managed rooms to the portfolio, which we'll be glad to welcome to our portfolio. And I think those are, by and large, what's driving that. Now we have seen, outside the U.S., by the way, is overwhelmingly still a managed growth story. You take a place like China, we manage every single hotel that we have in our system.","Ryan Meliker - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division","Okay. I think that's helpful. And just to refresh our memories, it looked like, I think, at your Investor Day, you talked about roughly 20,000 net rooms through 2014 coming in Asia. How much are we looking at in that 90,000 to 105,000 that you guys are forecasting? Are we talking roughly 50-50 North America versus international and North America will be predominantly franchised and international predominantly managed?","Arne M. Sorenson","That's sounds about right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So just a couple of quick questions. The first is if you could drill down a little bit more on your specific REVPAR expectations in China, Asia in general, Europe and the Mideast for the balance of the year.","Arne M. Sorenson","Let's see, China, Middle East and Europe. We would think Europe will continue to tick along around to that 3% sort of number. Q3 may be a bit better because of the Olympics and Q4 may be a bit worse because we don't have anything like the Olympics, which is likely to help Q4 but still kind of the same rates that we've seen. China, we've been, I think, 10% or above year-to-date. I suspect the right set of expectations would be a high single-digit as opposed to a double-digit growth rate for the balance of the year, reflecting probably a somewhat more modest growth rate there. Middle East, I think, is going to be very interesting. Our team has got some optimism in places like Egypt that we could be pleased to see business coming back a little bit faster than we're planning. On the other hand, we're really wary about building in expectations for a place like Egypt, which are too bullish. Dubai, by contrast, is very strong. It's a safe haven in many respects in the Middle East and, notwithstanding substantial supply growth, is continuing to post good numbers on the books. The rest of the Middle East varies dramatically market to market. You've got political environments, which vary from place-to-place and economic environments which vary from place-to-place. But I think generally, the Middle East ought to be performing reasonably well as the year goes along.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then on my follow-up related to share repurchase. You've got $90 million in the door related to the Courtyard transaction. If you get periods or if you see periods where you get greater lumps of cash in the door, do you plan on continuing with a more measured approach to share repurchase? Or do you have the flexibility to spend that as you see fit depending upon the price and the cash on hand?","Carl T. Berquist","Well, what we do is we look out, for the rest of the year, look at our cash needs, whether it's capital or what-have-you and what opportunities are there and take into consideration our leverage ratios relative to our credit ratings. And from there, we kind of predict out what we think we can buy versus what we need to hold back, so to speak, for known or expected capital expenditures in that. So it's kind of formulaic that way, but we also take into consideration capital transactions such as the Courtyard one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Will Marks with JMP Securities.","William C. Marks - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I wanted to just ask you about in the press release and in some of your prepared remarks, you talked about Middle East, for one, as impacting the -- going from 6% to 8% to 5% to 7% international. You didn't mention Europe in the press release. But in the comments, I think did I hear correctly about 300 basis points less absent Olympics and the Euro Cup?","Arne M. Sorenson","No, I think you heard 300 basis points less in actual currency as opposed to constant currency. Remember, our 5% to 7% is a constant currency number so that is not reflected by the stronger dollar. The stronger dollar will work against us a little bit. And just to state the obvious here, when fees get translated into our financial statements, they are in actual dollars, not constant dollars.","William C. Marks - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","That makes sense. Okay. And so is the situation -- or is REVPAR in Europe any different from where you saw it a few months ago?","Arne M. Sorenson","Generally, no. We still see it as -- it's still the weakest big region of the world, not surprisingly given all the things that they're wrestling with over there. And that's why when we looked at our budgeted numbers for the year, we were expecting Europe at about plus 3%. We told you at the beginning of the year that there was risk in that. And I wouldn't be surprised if we ended up putting numbers in the books which were 0 or potentially even negative. I think we've been really pleasantly pleased to see that we're performing at about 3%. And I guess it's the brilliance of our team over there and their ability to forecast.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Carl, did you touch on this? I might have missed this. Did you talk about how in-the-quarter, for-the-quarter bookings are trending?","Carl T. Berquist","I didn't, but they're running about 30% of our -- are you talking about how much of our mix is in-the-quarter, for-the-quarter? Or are you talking about the pricing of it?","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, more the pricing and just wondering in the past, your in-the-quarter, for-the-quarter bookings have been strong. I'm just wondering if you've seen any change there.","Carl T. Berquist","They're a little lower than in the first quarter because we have a lot of full hotels because of the booking pace we've been having for the -- that we've been talking about for the last 2 quarters being up so high. But for the full year, we would expect the in-the-quarter, for-the-quarter to still represent about 30%, with the other 2\/3 coming from booked the previous year.","Arne M. Sorenson","We are seeing increasing ability to drive rate with group bookings.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, great. And then just getting back to the Europe REVPAR, and maybe you've touched on this a little bit. But I was just wondering to ask very specifically, Arne, if you could quantify for us how much you think the Olympics is having -- what kind of impact or benefit the Olympics in London is having on your international REVPAR forecast?","Arne M. Sorenson","On the global internationals? I can't tell you. I think in Europe, it's maybe 1 point for the continent as a whole, at least the way we define our continent of positive because of London, which would make it -- Europe is, what, 40% of our international distribution, so I suppose maybe the Olympics drives 0.4 or 0.3 of a point for the quarter as a whole, something like that. It's not huge.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to the question on yield management and what you guys are seeing in the quarter's REVPAR numbers. So Arne, you called out Hawaii and said -- kind of said that hotels there -- your hotels were full. I mean, does that imply that given how good the group side is, you guys are seeing some challenges on the transient side? Or is it just taking a little bit more time to kind of push rate? And specifically, any comments on resort markets around that?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. I think, and this is probably less the case in a resort market like Hawaii than it is in some other more business-transient markets. But a couple of things to keep in mind here. One is Q2 includes a couple of months which are seasonally very strong, high-occupancy months. I think on one level, the success we've had with group bookings and with special corporate bookings, both of which are driven by these sales offices that we've spent so much time talking about over the last 1.5 years have driven a higher mix into the hotels from those streams of business. As a consequence, we've had a few less room nights than we probably like to have for rack rate short-term business. I think that is overwhelmingly an opportunity. And the opportunity is that we should be able to convert those demand streams into a better-priced business, not just on the rack rates but including on special corporate, when we get to those negotiations in the fall, and the group business that we're booking now and in the foreseeable next few quarters, if not next few years.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then the second question to kind of dig back in on some of the international comments, you called out oversupply in China, if I caught it in the prepared remarks, particularly in Sanya and Shenzhen. I mean, you guys were just over there and spent a lot of time with your people on the ground there. Everyone's talked about their China pipeline, so could you -- just how big they are and how important it is for kind of unit growth industry-wide. Could you give us just a little bit of a sense of, I mean, how worried should we be about the potential for oversupply and maybe a little bit of a hangover there if demand softens at all from the supply picture in China? That'd be helpful.","Arne M. Sorenson","I don't think you should be worried at all about oversupply risk in China. You've got -- the markets we called out, Shenzhen and Sanya, Sanya is on Hainan Island, it's essentially the premier biggest China resort destination, coastal. Shenzhen is in the south as well, by and large, an industrial center.  It's where Foxconn has got a big operation. This is a city that was a few hundred thousand people 20 years ago, and there's about 8 million or 9 million people today. So it's, in many respects, the sort of emblematic story about China's growth. And that place is booming and it's booming with hotel supply but it's booming with all of the things that drive hotel demand. And so we may see in periods like this quarter or maybe even over the next couple of quarters -- I can't tell you specifically what we're going to see in Shenzhen next month, let alone next year. But we may see periods in which that market is taking in new supply. But the demand is going to continue to grow, and I don't think the supply overhang is likely to be a factor for very long. Compare that to markets like Shanghai and Beijing, which are obviously huge destinations. They have had enormous supply growth, and notwithstanding that, they're posting double-digit REVPAR. And that's a sign about the strength. And one other reference point here. China is probably about 1 million rooms across the country as a whole. The U.S. is 5 million rooms. China will clearly see that 1 million rooms double and then double again over the course of the next period of time. It's going to imply substantial supply growth year-over-year for a number of years to come. But there's every reason to believe that demand is going to be growing with it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Loeb with Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Carl, this is for you. You mentioned the termination fee. But I wonder if you could talk a little more about the other items you called out in owned, leased and corporate housing in terms of timing and whether they're recurring. For example, the credit card and residential branding fees, is that also really one-time? Or are we likely to see a little more of that in coming quarters?","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. The branding fees of $5 million that I talked about is primarily timing. And so we would expect that to come -- we were expecting that come in later in the year. It just came in a little sooner than we thought. I think the other items I've pointed out in there, the termination fee that we received, I talked about that earlier. And then the other thing is our owned, leased properties, especially Tokyo and London, did extremely well. When you look to the full year, on the full year, our owned, leased properties will be a big piece of the increase that we're talking about in our guidance for the full year.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then for my follow-up, the tsunami BNI payment, are you essentially caught up with business interruption?","Carl T. Berquist","Yes. That was a payment from a utility over there that we received as business interruption. It wasn't insurance, so to speak, but...","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Attie of Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You mentioned targeting high single-digit corporate rate growth for 2013. What gives you the confidence that -- in that number so early in the process particularly since you're postponing giving full year 2013 guidance until February presumably to get better visibility?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I don't think our pricing of special corporate accounts have much to do when we're going to give guidance. But we will -- essentially, what we're talking about for special corporate pricing in the fall, I think our special corporate customers, by and large, know that demand has come back and has come back reasonably strong. And as a consequence, that the power in this negotiation have shifted a little bit to the suppliers of the rooms as opposed to the consumers of the rooms because we're going to all be looking at yielding the various channels we've got to get the best rate of business that we can get. Those special corporate rates are still meaningfully lower than they were in 2007 before the recession hit. And as a consequence, this is a bit about negotiating how fast we get back to those rates that we were at before. None of our special corporate customers likes to pay more than they have to pay, so these will be things that will be negotiated. And your question is a good reminder that we should be careful about putting anything in the books until we get through those negotiations. But we do think it should be a good season for negotiations this fall.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, have you started having any of those conversations yet with the customers?","Arne M. Sorenson","Only in the most -- the softest sort of preliminary way. We're not negotiating any of them now, but I think there's some conversations about what the dynamic will look like when we get to it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Arne, of the delayed room openings for this year, how many projects does that represent? And how much of this is China? And are the projects that were\/are scheduled to open in 2013, I know you haven't guided for next year, are they being pushed out as well? In other words, is the pipeline of 115,000 rooms going to take longer to open up than what you thought 3 months ago?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. We -- our best guess today is that we ought to still be open -- be able to open 90,000 to 100,000 -- what is it, 95,000 to 110,000, 90,000 to 105,000? 90,000 to 105,000 rooms in '12, '13 and '14. And we don't think we need to pull off of those numbers. I think the biggest story in this is China. And it's not the only place where there's some impact. But in China, what we're seeing is with a government-encouraged slowdown in some respects -- and again it's all relative, so we're not talking about recession environments. But in a government-encouraged slowdown, we are seeing some projects, which were previously under construction, where construction has paused. And I suspect that's a dozen hotels, maybe a dozen projects order of magnitude. We -- our folks on the ground there are very optimistic that they will be restarted, that when the government gets through the important political transitions, which are underway later this year, and continues its focus on developing particularly some of the secondary and tertiary markets, that we'll see these projects resume and move forward. We can't tell you for a certainty that all of that is going to work out in a way that causes the '12 openings to be opening in '13 and all of the '13 openings to also be opening in '13 or whether it's possible that some '13 openings will shift to '14. But we think generally that we're not seeing projects get abandoned, and our partners are saying they continue to plan to get those things done.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then for my follow-up, based on to the midpoint of your guidance for this year and sources and uses of cash and assume you return $1 billion of capital to shareholders, where does that put your leverage or net debt position at the end of this year, say, versus at the end of 2Q or at the end of last year?","Carl T. Berquist","Well, our leverage, we'll continue to manage our leverage to 3x to 3.25x debt-to-EBITDA so that's what we're targeting for. I don't have a debt number for you right now, but we'll manage to that ratio of 3x to 3.25x. And that's on adjusted debt to an adjusted EBITDA. The rating agency makes adjustments for the peer numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Arne, I was hoping you could dig in a little bit into the government per diem issue. The rumors and the headlines have been pretty negative regarding next year. And I know we're going to find out something in the next few weeks. But maybe you could talk about the percentage of demand that comes from either government directly or contractors that use government rates and how much exposure your D.C. properties in particular have to that particular...","Arne M. Sorenson","No. You're right to ask about D.C. particularly because D.C. would be the market which is most dependent on government and government-derived business, if you will. We think that we're probably mid-single-digits in terms of percentage of government business in the U.S. And so this is relevant obviously. The conversation coming out of the government is to try and reduce per diems. And as a consequence, depending on how aggressive they are, they may well be pricing their employees at a level where they will not be able to stay in full-service hotels and they will certainly not be able stay in full-service hotels in center cities and instead will be essentially priced out of the market and pushed to limited service hotels in the suburbs and all the consequences associated with that for their productivity and comfort. And depending on how hard they push, it's quite possible the government could push too hard and they will hear from their folks that it doesn't work. And this will get -- this will be something that gets revisited. We're engaged in conversations with the government to try and do the best we can to manage this. I think the only good news is that in many respects, we would be, in many hotels, looking at yielding away from government business anyway because we're seeing a higher-rated demand come back both in group and transient travel in a way that in a number of markets would allow hotels that have kind of tried to buttress their performance in a weaker demand time with government business increasingly pull away from that.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. But I guess, in D.C., it would be most impacted but also the smaller secondary, tertiary markets, where you do have a presence. I would imagine military bases, et cetera, would have a disproportionate impact. So are we -- do we face the potential then that next year, as we go through the quarters, we're talking about Washington, D.C. hurting your REVPAR again by 100 basis points or 200 basis points because of this change?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I mean, we gave you the figures on group bookings for Washington for next year because it is actually a substantial piece of positive news. The other bit of positive news we'll have for Washington is just the fact that there will be an inaugural next year, there will be a new administration. I don't mean that. There'll be a either a new President or a reelected President who will be starting a second term. And they will be a sort of a fresh start associated with that, that tends to be a reasonably good year for government demand. And so we ought to see some positive moves towards D.C. But you're right to ask about per diems because as you get to the -- through to the broader D.C. market, where you're looking at some of the Northern Virginia hotels which are heavily dependent on government business which is not political but is more like government contract business, that's the place where our fiscal issues in the federal government will continue to be relevant, and we don't know how they'll get resolved.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ian Weissman of ISI Group.","Ian C. Weissman - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. You've set a fairly bullish tone for the balance of the year, but I didn't hear you mention anything about concern over fiscal cliff. How does that go -- how do you factor that into your thought process on guidance and fundamentals? And have you seen any -- and do you think it's been an impediment to businesses, booking business going forward?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think that if you're talking about the fiscal cliff of the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, the Obama employment tax cuts and maybe deficit impact, as well as the government cuts...","Ian C. Weissman - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And impact on -- and the potential impact on the economy and how businesses are basically position themselves.","Arne M. Sorenson","And I would say today that there is no impact of that threat on the numbers we've put on the books or the bookings that we're seeing. And we have certainly not made any effort to factor in a what-if. And obviously, we haven't given you '13 guidance anyway. But I think, by and large, this is going to be a question about what happens politically and how that translates into a U.S. economic performance in 2013 and beyond. It may be that it becomes relevant in the fourth quarter, but I doubt it. I think this is much more likely to be a question of how it gets factored into real economic growth, maybe a little bit attitude and sentiment as we're doing bookings in the fourth quarter but doubtful in terms of the impact to actual Q3 and Q4 numbers.","Ian C. Weissman - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And finally, there's a lot of focus obviously on the gateway cities. I think last quarter, you addressed at least some of the differences between the performance in gateway cities, and obviously in some of the secondary and tertiary markets that you operate in. And you're starting to see healthier operating results in those markets. Maybe you can just kind of talk about some of the Tier 2 markets and how they have performed to date.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. And I would -- rather than be wrong here, I would encourage you to look at the Smith Travel numbers by city. And you've got some interesting dynamics. I mean, Chicago has been a reasonably good performer. The West is strong broadly. But I'd look to that Smith Travel and you can look at it sort of city-by-city and you'll see what the results look like.","Ian C. Weissman - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Well, I guess, my question is, are you seeing as healthy a recovery in secondary markets as you are in gateway cities?","Arne M. Sorenson","I would say generally yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nikhil Bhalla of FBR.","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes of SunTrust.","Charles Scholes","Last question. I'm going to ask a macro question because I think this is important for the recovery of the overall domestic economy being that the service sector is such a large part. What do you see going forward for the rest of the year as far as property-level hirings? I mean, is that really starting to ramp up now as far as year-over-year growth rates? What are your expectations for the rest of the year?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, that's a good question. I mean, I think we will obviously see hirings track our openings as the year goes along. And we had opened into our system, whether it's managed or franchised, obviously will have an influence on precisely we'll be doing the hiring, whether it's our franchise partners or whether it's us directly. But we'll end up hiring -- I would think the system would hire a few thousand people, maybe 5,000 people, something like that associated with new unit openings. This is a U.S. number only. I think the high occupancy we had in the second quarter is a sign that we're probably also hiring to meet demand as it moves through there. But in Q3, Q3 is not as high an occupancy quarter as Q2. And so I don't think occupancy is likely to drive significant hiring in the very, very short term. I think as we go into 2013, we will see that the hiring, by and large, is driven by new unit growth and less significantly by occupancy growth since I think increasingly as the recovery goes forward, we'll see that the shift of REVPAR growth is driven more by rate than it is by occupancy. As group business grows, so we will see that we're hiring some folks to deal with F&B side of the equation. I don't know if that's responsive to you or not. But generally, it's a positive trend in hiring. It's just a question of how positive.","Charles Scholes","On your typical, let's say, hotels in existence today versus, I guess, sort of high peak staffing levels in 2007, how far off are you? How much -- I imagine you have less employees today. Can you sort of quantify, like percentage? Is the average hotel have 5% less employees today than it did in 2007?","Arne M. Sorenson","A typical hotel would be fairly close. I think the permanent reduction in headcount will probably mostly be around management staff and how heavy that is and how much we've been able to do above property and do a little bit more efficiently than used to be done on property. But that is likely to affect a relatively small number of people in a hotel. The restaurant staff and the housekeeping staff and the other key members of the team that are focused on serving our guests as occupancy has gotten back to and now beyond peak levels. So we're performing at occupancy levels which are in excess of the 2007, 2008 levels. I suspect we've seen staff income most of the way back to where it was before.","Carl T. Berquist","Okay. Well, we all want to thank you for your participation today and keep on traveling. Go ahead, Beverly.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Arne Sorenson. Please go ahead.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","Let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued yesterday, along with our comments today, are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold.","This quarter, we have provided a set of slides to assist with today's discussion. You can find them on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor. In our discussion, we will talk about 2017 results excluding merger-related costs, the gain from the sale of Avendra, and the provisional charge associated with tax reform. These results will be compared to 2016 combined adjusted results, which also exclude merger-related costs and assume Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare businesses were completed on January 1, 2015. Of course, comparisons to our prior year reported GAAP results are in the press release, which you can find along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures on our website.","There are a number of moving pieces in both our fourth quarter 2017 results and our 2018 outlook. In our remarks today, we will try to clarify those items to reveal the underlying business trends.","Simply put, the fourth quarter was the icing on the cake to a terrific year in 2017 for Marriott. Compared to combined adjusted amounts in the prior year, 2017 fee revenue increased 8% to $3.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA rose 8% to $3.2 billion, and adjusted EPS rose 32% to $4.36. As 2017 demonstrated, the global travel industry has never been more exciting, nor offered a better opportunity. Occupancy is at record levels with young travelers seeking adventure, retirees exploring exciting places, expanding numbers of international vacationers, and for business travelers making the connections to drive success.","Technology is making travel easier to book, and strengthening economic climates are fueling the wanderlust. Marriott is seizing this opportunity. Our more than 6,500 properties and 30 brands provide a broad choice of aspirational destinations. Our leading loyalty programs leverage our distribution, driving guest preference and significant RevPAR index premiums. Our tremendous worldwide distribution and diverse brand portfolio enables our sales and marketing channels to be highly effective and efficient. And with our operating know-how, our team executes well against very high guest expectations, while driving hotel profitability for our owners and franchisees.","Owners recognize this market opportunity and continue to seek out projects in attractive locations with our brands and platforms. In 2017, we opened 76,000 new rooms, yielding a worldwide net system growth of 5.6%. We also signed nearly 125,000 new rooms worldwide during the year, including 15,000 rooms that were conversions from other brands.","Construction delays persist in many markets due to shortages of skilled tradesmen, contractors and subcontractors. Despite this, in 2018, we expect we will grow our worldwide rooms by roughly 7% gross, and 5.5% to 6% net.","For 25 years, our powerful brands have enabled us to pursue an asset-light strategy that delivers both meaningful unit growth and high-value management and franchise agreements for our shareholders. But the lodging business is changing. It's not enough today to have outstanding operating scale and well-known brands. Today, hotel operators need scale to leverage technology, loyalty programs and booking engines, all of which are needed to meet ever-increasing customer and hotel owner expectations.","In 2017, we added mobile check-in and checkout to 1,600 hotels, and are now offering mobile service at nearly 6,000 hotels worldwide. During the year, we rolled out guestVoice, our guest satisfaction system, across our entire portfolio, and launched Marriott Moments that allows guests to shop for and book unique experiences. And we formed a joint venture with Alibaba that we believe will drive engagement and loyalty of Chinese travelers.","For company-operated hotels, worldwide house profit margins improved by 80 basis points on company-operated worldwide RevPAR growth of 3.8%. In addition to the RevPAR improvement, our higher margins reflect continued terrific productivity savings by our operating teams and integration-related cost savings in procurement, OTA commissions and loyalty programs.","Our loyalty programs reached just shy of 110 million members at year end, and those members accounted for over half of our occupied rooms in 2017. We lowered our loyalty programs' charge-out rate to owners in 2017 and again in January 2018, and we expect to further reduce charge-out rates as we harmonize our loyalty programs later this year.","As we expected, our recently renegotiated co-branded credit card agreements are allowing us to bring more value to our customers and hotel owners as well as our shareholders. We expect new cards will launch later this year. As part of the credit card agreements, hotel owners will also benefit from lower credit card processing fees beginning in 2018. Leeny will talk about our branding fees associated with these credit card agreements in a few moments.","Our hotel owners can expect more cost savings in 2018. We recently announced a reduction in North America group intermediary commissions, and separately have introduced a new revenue management approach that seeks to book the most profitable business, not just the highest RevPAR business. We also expect to achieve additional synergies and procurement, loyalty and benchmarking in 2018.","Let's talk about RevPAR. In the fourth quarter, Marriott's worldwide system-wide comparable RevPAR increased 4.6% on a constant dollar basis. In North America, fourth quarter RevPAR increased 3.9%, with roughly 1.5 percentage points of the improvement due to the shift in Jewish holidays and hurricane recovery demand. In the fourth quarter, RevPAR growth was stronger than we anticipated in North America, also related to lingering hurricane demand as well as better-than-expected leisure demand in Orlando, Miami, New Orleans and Los Angeles.","For the full year 2018, we expect North America system-wide RevPAR will increase 1% to 2%, consistent with recent trends. While we are hopeful we will see a pickup in U.S. economic growth and we've narrowed the range of our North America RevPAR outlook a bit, we think it unwise to move expectations up broadly this early in the year.","As a reminder, year-over-year comps are tough following 2017's inauguration and the strong 2017 fourth quarter. Booking pace at the end of January for system-wide full-service hotels is up 2% for 2018. While we haven't completed all special corporate rate negotiations, where negotiations are complete, price increases for the comparable special corporate customers are averaging at a low-single digit rate.","RevPAR in the Caribbean & Latin America region increased 5.6% in the fourth quarter compared to last year, also better than our expectations. We saw strong demand in Argentina and signs of economic improvement in Brazil, while Mexico was weak following September's earthquake and the peso's appreciation.","In the Caribbean alone, many hotels across the lodging industry remain out of service. This has created significant demand compression for our 45 open properties in the region, driving our comparable Caribbean RevPAR up 24% in the quarter. For the entire Caribbean and Latin America region, we expect RevPAR will increase at a low-single digit rate in the full year 2018.","In the Middle East & Africa, fourth quarter RevPAR increased 5.7%. We saw strong performance in Saudi Arabia, while at the same time, continued sanctions on Qatar and oversupply in Dubai dampened RevPAR growth in those markets. In Africa, our hotels in Egypt experienced much stronger occupancy, particularly our Red Sea resorts, following that country's currency devaluation. With tougher comps in Africa and a continued challenging political climate in the Middle East, we expect RevPAR in the total region will be flattish for the full year 2018.","In the Asia Pacific region, constant dollar system-wide RevPAR rose more than 7% in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations with strong leisure demand in China, Thailand and Japan. Comparable hotel RevPAR in Greater China increased over 9%, driven by a robust growth in Hong Kong, Macau and in Shenzhen. For the full year of 2018, we expect RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region will grow at a mid-single digit rate, reflecting strength in China and India, but more modest growth in Indonesia due to the active volcano in Bali.","In Europe, fourth quarter RevPAR rose more than 5% with impressive performance in Paris, Brussels and Istanbul. While RevPAR across most of Europe was strong, demand in Barcelona and London weakened. We expect RevPAR in Europe will grow at a mid-single-digit rate in the full year 2018. For the full year, we expect constant dollar RevPAR will increase 3% to 5% outside North America, and 1% to 3% worldwide.","In a few minutes, Leeny will talk about the significant positive impact on 2018 earnings and cash flow from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The takeaway is that our effective tax rate should drop by approximately 8 points to roughly 22%, and hopefully, we will see a stronger economic climate in the United States.","As we considered how we might leverage this good news, we considered our long-term cultural maxim that in the hospitality business, strong guest loyalty and economic results are derived from high associate satisfaction and engagement. To put it plainly, at Marriott, we try to take care of our associates, our associates take care of our guests, and our guests keep coming back. Attracting and keeping the best talent is critical for us, so we plan to invest roughly $140 million for 2018 in our most important asset, our people, with about $70 million of the cost funded by Marriott, and the remainder funded by the Avendra proceeds. We expect to do this by increasing our retirement savings match of associate contributions by up to $1,000 for eligible associates in the U.S. We also plan to invest in other associate support programs during the year.","We are bullish about our future. No other hotel company offers our comprehensive range of destinations, no other company has loyalty programs of the breadth and depth that we do, and none offer the meaningful scale that drives both guest satisfaction and owner returns. But our most powerful advantage is our culture. It is a deep commitment to people, treating each other with dignity and respect, offering everyone opportunities for learning and growth, and working together as a team. Given the outstanding results demonstrated in 2017, I'd like to say thank you to all the Marriott associates who made it possible.","To tell you more about the quarter, I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny Oberg. Leeny?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you, Arne. Welcome, everyone. As Arne said, there are a lot of moving pieces to discuss, so starting with slide 9, let's review two adjustments we made to results in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Aramark purchased Avendra for $1.35 billion in December of 2017. After deducting company debt, transaction costs and other expenses, net proceeds were $1.2 billion, of which Marriott's proceeds and gain were $659 million. This quarter's tax provision included $259 million on the gain. As we've explained in the past, the proceeds from the transaction will be reinvested in our system. Under GAAP, we've recognized the gain in the fourth quarter. Going forward, we plan to incur expenses as the funds are invested in the system and expect to similarly back out such expenses in calculating adjusted results.","Our fourth quarter GAAP results also reflect the impact of U.S. tax reform passed in 2017. The fourth quarter included a $745 million provisional transition tax on Marriott's accumulated foreign earnings, $159 million favorable revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities and a favorable $19 million of other tax impact. In total, the Avendra transaction in 2017 tax legislation reduced our fourth quarter GAAP net income by $167 million, and diluted EPS by $0.45.","On slide 10, you can see 2017 fourth quarter total fee revenue increased 12%. Fees increased due to unit growth, RevPAR growth and higher non-property fees, largely credit card branding fees. Non-property fees, including application fees, relicensing fees and fees from our timeshare credit card and residential businesses, together totaled $122 million in the quarter, 27% higher than the prior year. Incentive fees increased 14% in the quarter, largely due to strong results at full-service hotels in North America and the Asia Pacific regions.","Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $95 million in the 2017 quarter. We benefited from stronger results at a few North America owned and leased hotels with overall owned, leased results declined due to hotel dispositions. Since the beginning of the 2016 fourth quarter through 2017 year-end, we've sold four properties; in each case, retaining a long-term management agreement. These properties contributed $3 million in profits on the owned, leased line in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.","General and administrative expenses totaled $259 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, $25 million worse than the prior year, reflecting $7 million of litigation reserves in the 2017 quarter, higher incentive compensation and an $8 million benefit from a favorable legal settlement in the prior year.","Turning to slide 11. Our fourth quarter results were much better than we expected. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.12, roughly $0.13 ahead of the midpoint of our EPS guidance of $0.98 to $1. On the fee line, we picked up about $0.06 of outperformance due to stronger-than-expected RevPAR and margin growth, and better-than-expected branding fees. The owned, leased and other line gave us about $0.01 due to better-than-expected results at hotels in New York, Atlanta and Anaheim. G&A was about $0.03 worse due to unexpected litigation reserves and development expenses.","Net interest and the equity in earnings line each contributed about $0.01 of outperformance. The provision for taxes helped by $0.07, including $0.03 of tax benefit related to stock compensation, $0.03 from a favorable mix of business, and $0.01 from discrete tax items.","As you know, effective January 1, 2018, our results will reflect FASB's new revenue recognition rules. I want to emphasize that, while these changes will result in some geography and timing changes in our reported results, our cash flow won't be impacted. We discussed these changes in our third quarter 10-Q, and there'll be additional discussion in our 10-K.","I'd like to bring your attention to the third point on slide 12 regarding incentive fees. Compared to our past practice, the new accounting standard may shift recognition of some incentive fees from one quarter to another quarter, with the most significant impact on seasonal resorts. The rule change only impacts quarterly timing. It will not change our incentive fee recognition for the full year, nor alter the quarterly cash receipt of incentive fees.","We expect the overall impact of the first five changes shown in slide 12 will reduce 2018 adjusted EBITDA by roughly $60 million and operating profit by roughly $50 million, but will not change our annual or quarterly net cash flow. We will not adjust our results for these changes in non-GAAP reconciliations going forward.","Moving to number six on slide 12. The new rules also impact the treatment of costs for centralized programs and services like sales and marketing, loyalty and reservations, the cost of which are reimbursed to us by owners.","In 2017, we had roughly $18 billion of total annual reimbursed revenue and cost reimbursement expenses. Roughly 30% of these reimbursements are associated with centralized program and services. We operate these programs on a breakeven basis, although there can be cash differences in the timing of revenue and expenses.","Prior to the new revenue recognition rules, such revenue and expenses netted to zero on our financial statements, and we reflected the cash impact of any timing difference on our balance sheet. However, under the new rules, timing differences of these owner payments and system expenses will flow through our GAAP reported net income, instead. We expect to adjust these timing differences of centralized programs and services in our calculation of adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA going forward, and do not expect to include such timing differences in our earnings guidance. Here again, this change in accounting does not change our annual or quarterly net cash flow.","We appreciate your patience. Given the complicated impact of the new accounting rules on incentive fees for seasonal hotels, we don't yet have a detailed first quarter P&L forecast. Our budget spreads are also delayed as we transition to a unified financial reporting platform. We expect to provide investors with 2017 quarterly results under the new revenue standard in the second quarter. We remain committed to transparency and expect we will resume fulsome quarterly guidance on our next earnings call.","I'd like to take a moment to express my sincere thanks to our finance and accounting team for expertly managing purchase accounting, new revenue recognition rules, and combining ledgers, all at the same time.","Of course, there are a few observations we can make about the first quarter. With tough comparisons to last year's inauguration and Women's March, and the unfavorable timing of Easter, North America RevPAR is likely to be flat to up 2% in the 2018 first quarter. International RevPAR is likely to go 3% to 5%, with continued strength in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. And worldwide system-wide RevPAR should increase 1% to 3% in the first quarter.","Unit growth should remain strong, and credit card branding fees should move higher. In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized about $20 million of earnings from owned hotels that have since been sold.","For the full year of 2018, we can be more helpful. The table on page 13 of the press release and slide 14 in our slide deck show our 2018 full-year outlook. Our guidance is on the left column and reflects the new revenue standard. While we will be reporting 2018 results including the impact of the new revenue standard, for those of you who wish to compare our 2018 outlook with 2017 actuals, excluding the accounting change, we've provided the data for your use in the column on the right.","With 1% to 3% global RevPAR growth and 5.5% to 6% net unit growth, we expect gross fee revenue will total $3.535 billion to $3.620 billion, and we expect incentive fees will increase at a low-single-digit rate in 2018. Contract cost amortization should total $55 million.","Our fee revenue estimate includes meaningful improvement from credit card branding fees. Such fees increased from $173 million in 2016 to $242 million in 2017, as we harmonize terms of the Marriott and Starwood credit card programs, and realized higher card member spend. In 2018, with the renegotiation of our credit card agreements and the launch of new credit cards, credit card branding fees could total $360 million to $380 million.","In 2018, owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expenses, should total $285 million to $295 million, and do not reflect any additional asset sales. Earnings on this line from hotels that were sold in 2017 or early 2018, totaled $55 million in 2017.","We estimate depreciation and amortization in 2018 will total roughly $230 million, reflecting the reclassification of $55 million of contract amortization to the fee revenue line due to the new revenue standard. We estimate G&A will total $935 million to $945 million, including the $70 million one-time investment in our associates in 2018. Excluding this amount, we would expect 2018 G&A to be lower than 2017, consistent with our targeted $250 million of long-term G&A savings from the Starwood acquisition.","In January 2018, we completed the sale of the Buenos Aires Sheraton and Park Tower properties for approximately $105 million. We estimate the gain from this transaction will be roughly $45 million and will be recognized in the first quarter. Our outlook assumes a 2018 effective tax rate of roughly 22%. We expect the provisional transition tax that we booked in the fourth quarter of 2017, less any available tax credits, will be paid out in cash over eight years. We expect our cash tax rate in 2018 will be noticeably higher at roughly 36%, reflecting a negative 11 point impact from cash taxes associated with the sale of Avendra, and a negative 3 point impact from the 2018 installment of cash taxes associated with the transition tax.","For the full year 2018, we expect fee revenue will total $3.54 billion to $3.62 billion, a 6% to 9% increase, despite the estimated $25 million negative impact of the new revenue standard. We expect adjusted diluted EPS will total $5.11 to $5.34, a 17% to 22% increase over adjusted diluted EPS in 2017, despite the estimated $0.11 negative impact of the new revenue standard and a roughly $0.15 one-time negative impact from our estimated investment in our associates.","We expect 2018 adjusted EBITDA will total $3.32 billion to $3.42 billion, a 3% to 6% increase over 2017 adjusted EBITDA, despite the estimated $60 million negative impact of the new revenue standard, the $70 million one-time negative impact from our expected investment in our associates and the negative impact of $55 million of lower owned, leased profits due to sold hotels.","There are a few things not reflected in our 2018 guidance. First, we expect to spend the net proceeds from the Avendra sale for the benefit of our owners, franchisees and our system over the next few years, including $70 million for the one-time additional profit-sharing contribution funded by Avendra proceeds. While Avendra reinvestment will be included as an expense in our GAAP results, we expect to adjust for any such expense in our calculation of adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, and do not expect to include such expenses in our earnings guidance. Similarly, our guidance does not include merger-related cost or the timing impact of centralized programs and services. Here again, we expect to adjust for such costs in our diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA.","Investment spending, including contract costs and loan activity, totaled $612 million in 2017. We expect investment spending will total $600 million to $700 million in 2018, including $225 million in maintenance spending, as we expect to renovate several leased hotels in 2018. We have already recycled $1.3 billion of assets to-date since closing the Starwood acquisition. While we remain confident of our ability to reach our post-acquisition $1.5 billion target by year-end 2018, our 2018 earnings and cash flow guidance assumes no further asset sales.","In 2017, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, reflecting our success with asset recycling, the return of foreign cash, and strong operating cash flow during the year. Assuming no asset sales beyond those already completed, we could return roughly $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2018.","Our balance sheet is in great shape. On December 31, our debt ratio was at the low end of our targeted credit standard of 3 times to 3.25 times adjusted debt to combined adjusted EBITDAR.","There's a lot of excitement at Marriott today. We're embracing change as never before, while remaining true to our culture and commitment to excellence to the benefit of our guests, owners, associates and shareholders.","Thank you for your interest and joining us on this journey. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible on today's call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","I wonder if you could give a little more color around the fee growth guidance. In that 7% to 10% range, just given that it looks like maybe 3 percentage points of that is from higher credit card branding fees. When you combine your unit growth and your RevPAR growth, it seems like all those pieces added should maybe get to a higher range than the 7% to 10%. So, I wonder if you could just give a little bit of color, if there are other moving pieces there. Thanks.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure, absolutely. So let's, first of all, talk a little bit about the other parts of fees that are part of the non-hotel related fees, and that is when you think about timeshare fees and residential branding fees and things like that, which make up a solid maybe 40% of those non-hotel related fees. They are actually when you consider what's going on with the rev rec, they are actually going down year-over-year.","So, that takes your growth in the credit card fees, that is, obviously when you see our number, something like 50%. That brings that overall growth number of the non-hotel fees down meaningfully. And then, on top of that, you've got incentive fees, which as we've talked about before, are in the low-single digits. And that is really a function of the RevPAR guidance that we've given.","There is a couple other oddballs like we actually recognized $6 million of deferred incentive fees in 2017, which obviously, we won't have again in 2018. And when you think about \u2013 we had great margin performance in 2017, but with, clearly, a bit stronger RevPAR than our current forecast for 2018 implies, and so when you put that together, that also is the reason for the overall fee growth to be lower.","And then last but not least is the reality that, as we're adding hotels, there is some fee ramp. And when you think about the proportion of limited service hotels that we're adding, you have some drag as our hotels get up to stabilized fees. And this is something that, quite frankly, is something the whole industry experiences. And if you look at our 2016 to 2017 performance and you back out the growth that we had in these areas, you'll see the same trend there as well. I think the point I would emphasize is, these are all hotels that are coming on board, they're ramping up nicely, and the growth in the future for the fees is there.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Maybe just as my follow-up, just on the incentive management fees, just looking at North America, the percent in 2017 was unchanged from 2016. It was the same 70% paying fees. But just given the RevPAR increase last year and then the increase in operating margins at those North American managed properties, is that \u2013 maybe it's the what you were mentioning that the limited-service hotels are being added, but \u2013 or did it surprise you that there wasn't an increase in the percent of properties paying incentive management fees?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yes, no, not at all. That's really \u2013 we have a number of limited-service managed hotels that are in large portfolios. And we actually were very pleased with the performance of our North American hotels. Margins were only up 40 basis points for the year in 2017 in North America, which is not going to move the needle that much in percentage of hotels achieving IMF.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein Research.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks a lot.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, David.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I'm curious, you mentioned from Q4 particular strength in leisure. Are you also seeing an acceleration at all in terms of corporate spending or corporate group booking activity? And to what extent, if you do, do you expect that to carry through to the remainder of the year?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","One of the things that was interesting in Q4 was the transient business. It was up about 4.1%. This is a U.S. figure. And transient, of course, includes corporate negotiated rates, it includes retail rates, includes leisure, it includes some contract rates, all of which are contributing to that. But the corporate RevPAR was 4.1% too. It was essentially right on with the average, which we take on balance to be a fairly encouraging sign. I think if you look back over the last year or so, you would see that the corporate traveler was a bit weaker than the leisure traveler in the sort of average performance of transient.","I think the second thing, which we take a little comfort in is that group bookings, while \u2013 and undoubtedly, there'll be more questions about this, we can look at bookings for 2018 or bookings for all future periods, what have you. But groups, too, we broadly split between corporate, association and government. And corporate bookings in Q4 showed a bit of a sign of life, not overwhelmingly different than in prior periods, but stronger than in prior periods. So, all of that is at least a hint of something to be optimistic about.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. And as a quick follow-up, just from your conversations with the corporate leaders out there, they spend a lot traveling with your properties, what is the sense that you get of their willingness or desire to increase business travel spend?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","It is \u2013 I mean, I think that, on the positive side, I've been struck by how broad the optimism is among U.S. corporate CEOs, really dramatically improving post tax reform. But the tone, for example, in many of the conversations I've had with folks is really quite bullish. That doesn't sadly immediately translate into somebody saying, therefore, I'm going to have our team out there spending more money on hotels. I think in a sense, that's a detail, if you will, from at least most CEOs' perspectives. But I think if that optimism translates into better corporate profits, if it translates into more investing activity by companies, I think inevitably, we'll see that that is positive for corporate demand for our industry.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. You mentioned some delays in the construction delivery, which I think you talked about last quarter as well. But I wanted to ask you too, it looks like the Sheraton room system has come down about 2% since your acquisition. How do you think about that going forward in terms of the room counts? And is there any kind of update you can provide on how the RevPAR index is trending for that brand?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","We're doing the early work with Sheraton. I think it's going quite well as we've talked about in prior quarters and in other contexts. It's a multiyear task, but huge part of the preparatory work is pulling in owners of existing Sheraton hotels, making sure they understand the standards that will be applied to those hotels, giving them the opportunity to meet those standards. And that you can't necessarily publish standards and say you've got only a week to do that. That's not fair to the kind of partnerships we have with these hotel owners. But that work is well underway. We're deeply engaged with the ownership community and I think making great progress on standard-setting.","At the same time, the early ones to fix are the worst ones. And we have, even while we waited for the total development, if you will, of the standards, we know that there are a number of these hotels that are not going to meet those standards, whatever the details are. And so we've been accelerating our work with those to try and move as quickly as we can to get properties moving forward, hopefully, towards renovation to meet standards. But if not, to have them lose the system.","And I think we have called, what, 5,000 rooms last year, I think, in the Sheraton portfolio. Our expectations is we will call a bit less than that in 2018. Obviously, we don't know for certain how that will go. But those are decisions that, on balance, we feel really good about, because it's the kind of work that needs to be done in order to get the brand where we want it to be.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And then, Leeny, I just wanted to ask you on the calculation of leverage as the ratings agencies look at it. I assume that they're going to use the new sort of definition of EBITDA as they think about that. And also \u2013 well, if you could confirm that. But also the tax liability that you mentioned related to repatriation of profits, do you think the agencies will look at that as \u2013 in their calculation of debt? I think it's like $700 million or something?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Thanks, Smedes. Yes, I would expect that in debt-to-EBITDAR that they would assume that it's done based on the new rev rec standard. However, as you know, many of them actually look at two statistics. One is an FFO-to-debt, so a cash flow to debt ratio as well as the debt-to-EBITDAR. And obviously, from the cash flow one, that will not be impacted. And then, the other part is that, on the liability that's included in the debt, they actually use a discounted amount that is actually more like $450 million because they're using the true cash that we expect, which is not the full $745 million, because we've got some tax credits. So that comes down, and then it's paid over time. And so you get the benefit of being able to discount that. So, it's not the full $745 million that's going to go on to your debt calculation, but we would expect that that goes into the debt-to-EBITDAR.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. So, just sort of net-net, it sounds like if you're running the company at like 3.1 times or 3.2 times debt-to-EBITDAR, that capacity comes down slightly on those new debt \u2013 new standards?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yes, it does. If you remember, for us, it's called \u2013 10 basis point is roughly $350 million, so that does take us down about a tick. But again, part of this is about working through with the rating agencies the issue that this is not affecting our cash flow, and that our \u2013 you would argue actually, with the tax reform, that our cash turnover is actually going to be higher. And so, as we look at what's there, it's part of what we've talked to you in our $2.5 billion capital return to shareholders today. And frankly, as you know, Smedes, we work in this range of 3 times to 3.25 times, so I don't expect it to have a meaningful impact.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Felicia.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Felicia.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. So first, Arne, I just wanted to commend management and the board on your decision to return cash to your employees. That was very refreshing to see.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And so, Leeny, on the credit card, I have a question there on the incremental fees.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, if you kind of take your guidance of the $360 million to $380 million this year, and then you back out the $240-ish million that you did last year, you get an incremental, call it, $118 million to $138 million of credit card fees this year. So, I was just wondering, how much of that is coming just from the underlying growth of the program versus the new contract? And I was just hoping that you could walk us through the various buckets of how the incremental fees got broken down between the program, the owners and then to corporate. I know you don't \u2013 you're not going to be specific, but just if you could kind of walk us through how the, call it, $120 million to $140-ish million kind of came to Marriott.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure, absolutely. So, let's talk about \u2013 let's kind of go first things first. Overwhelmingly, the growth that we've talked about in these fees to get to the $360 million to $380 million over the $242 million that we had in 2017, that is overwhelmingly reflecting the improved economics of the new deal. There is perhaps the normal amount of kind of new cards and credit card spend. But overwhelmingly, the increase is from the new terms. So, nothing kind of unusual besides that. So, kind of when you asked the broader question, we're clearly very pleased with the results of the credit card deal. And I would say that there again, the overwhelming amount clearly well more than half of the increased proceeds that we're getting from the credit card companies coming to the company is going to benefit the consumer and the owners and franchisees.","And as an example, we reduced the loyalty charge-out rate to owners in 2017. And now, as we've got the new credit card deal, we've already reduced the charge-out rate to the owners by another 10 basis points starting January 1 in 2018. And we actually expect additional loyalty charge-out reductions for our owners later this year, as we harmonize the program. So, similarly, as we are excited about what we're going to do with the harmonization of the loyalty program, we've got a bunch of things that we're doing for the consumers that also will be valuable. So, kind of in the broadest context, I would say that, well over half of the increased benefit is going not to the company, not to our shareholders, but that we do believe the split is fair amongst all the constituencies.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, let me \u2013 I want to jump in on this, too. We threw out a couple of statistics in our prepared remarks with roughly 110 million loyalty members and in excess of half of our rooms revenue coming from those loyalty members, who are disproportionately booking direct with us. We believe that the loyalty program is the name of the game for the future. And we've been impressed by SPG from the moment we acquired Starwood about the passionate loyalty that they have in their program.","A big part of that is the value that's been available to those travelers both through their credit card and through the elite benefits particularly that Starwood offered them. And we've got \u2013 we will be announcing these new cards as the year goes along. We will be announcing the plans with respect to harmonization of benefits for the two loyalty programs. And we're making great progress having virtually eliminated all of the restrictions to merging these programs towards a single unified program, hopefully, later this year.","And when we roll that out, we will see that we've got extraordinary benefits to our cardholders and to our hotel guests. We will have a materially more cost-effective program for our hotel owners and we're going to do great, too. And of course, all we're giving this morning is our best guess on 2018. We haven't even launched these new cards yet, and we believe that in the years to come, we're going to see that this program continues to grow in terms of number of members, continues to grow in terms of contribution to our hotels and continues to grow in terms of the contribution of Marriott's own P&L.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And just to understand, is there an incremental step-up from the new terms in 2019 or is this kind of a one-time increase? I mean, obviously, I know it's going to grow as members grow, but is there another kind of leg-up?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","So, of course, it's too soon to make any predictions about 2019. Couple of comments I would make. As you heard Arne talking about, we are really excited about what we see for the potential for our cardholders. And so we absolutely would like to think there will be more. But at this point, we don't know the exact timing of harmonization and exactly how it will all roll out with the cards. So, it's too early to give you any predictions, but I sure would like to think it'll be higher.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just a housekeeping on SG&A, so you came in about $55 million higher than our estimates. And in the release, you called out some of that, but not all of it. And what I'm just wondering is, is the delta just that it might be a little bit longer timing in terms of getting to your synergy or was there a synergy or is there something else in there?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You're talking about 2018?","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","For 2017, I'm sorry, for the fourth quarter results.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, for 20 \u2013 so, let me go back. For 2017, we would say we have not hit the $250 million in 2017.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","But getting close, over \u2013 I would call it over 80% achievement in 2017, if you're comparing back to the last time you had the two companies with full-throated G&A. If you remember last year in the fourth quarter, you had kind of \u2013 in 2016 compared to 2017, you had quite an unusual situation with lots of people leaving Starwood. And as we pointed out, you had one-timers in 2017 fourth quarter. But again, in 2018, when you take the midpoint of the $940 million that we've talked about, back out the $70 million one-time contribution from the company, you get to $870 million, which is 3% lower G&A than our printed number in 2017, and a clear demonstration of achievement of the $250 million.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Super helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura Instinet.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Hi, good morning.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Harry.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Good morning. A quick question on asset sales. It seems like the \u2013 based on prior guidance, you're in the late innings. Yet, you still have a reasonable number of owned hotels yet to sell. And it'd be useful to get an update on what's left to sell and where you are in the process of selling. And I think you've mentioned that, there are no \u2013 in your $2.5 billion, there are no assumptions on asset sales.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","That's right. Sure, we've got 17 hotels left that we own, 10 of which are part of the original Starwood portfolio. Of the 10 that we've got of the original legacy Starwood portfolio, you got two in Canada, two in Asia Pacific, three in CALA, and three in the U.S. And as I talked about before, we continue to absolutely methodically work our way. And they have a variety of kind of situations, whether it's a ground lease, odd ground lease language with one. But as I said before, we are confident there will be additional asset sales this year that gets us to our $1.5 billion.","As we've talked about before, Harry, you've always got a few, and frankly, in Marriott's portfolio too, you've got a couple that are in markets that the timing may just really not be right, whether it is Rio or a market that's got a certain pressure related to oil prices, et cetera. But again, we're really pleased with how it's marching along. The Buenos Aires sale that was done for over $100 million in January was terrific, great PIP that we're going to get out of that deal as well as the long-term management agreement. And we're excited about how they continue to move along.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Very good. And my second question is in reference to the mix of your direct bookings relative to your OTA mix. Can you give us a sense over the last several years of how those have moved in opposite directions? And in a softer demand environment, do you think that what you've done to increase the mix of your direct bookings that you're positioned to continue to outperform?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","So, I'll start with a couple numbers, and then have Arne fill in on the strategy side. Just from the numbers standpoint, direct bookings continue to be around 70% for the company, with property really being where you see it being a little bit less, over time, coming down 1% or 2%. Digital is now a full 26% of total res as part of that 70%. The OTAs in 2017 were 12%, which was up 1 percentage point penetration over the year before. But again, we don't see it growing any more quickly than before. And as Arne talked about, with our revenue management system, we're excited about the things that we're doing that's allowing properties to choose more profitable business. So overall, the trends haven't changed dramatically. The mobile \u2013 obviously mobile, which is terrific for us, mobile is doing really well in terms of year-over-year increases in res.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Okay. And I'm sorry, Arne, you were going to give your thoughts on how these trends should play out? And should there be a softer demand environment maybe in the next three or four years?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, well, time will tell obviously on this. Leeny's description of this, I think, is quite good. We have obviously, within the direct bookings space, seen a massive shift towards online bookings and away from voice, as an example. That's been steady over the course of the last number of years, including in 2017 where voice has been down mid-single digits and our online bookings has been strengthened.","Another observation is, obviously, this is driven, to some extent, by the kind of business in a hotel \u2013 it tends to be the more leisure a hotel's demand base, the higher the third-party contributions are to that hotel. That could be wholesalers or could be OTAs. In part because of that, the Starwood portfolio had a higher reliance on third-party bookings than the Marriott portfolio did. I think some of that we can address internally with sort of a different approach to some of those platforms.","And I think as the loyalty program gets stronger, and as the clarity of the benefits to loyalty members becomes clearer, we feel really good about our ability to drive direct bookings throughout the cycle. Obviously, if you're positing a deep recessionary environment, which we don't anticipate any time soon, we'll fight our way through that. But it's interesting, we've seen great shift towards direct channels in the last few years, even with fairly anemic demand growth. And I think, if anything, our tools are going to get stronger here as we pull this loyalty program together and do what we're doing in the technology space. So, we feel pretty good about this.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Thanks very much, everyone.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Maybe to stick with that same theme, Arne, in the prepared remarks, and I think, Leeny, you just referred to this as well, but you talked about some tools or some things you may be doing to try and help owners focus on the most profitable business, not just the highest RevPAR business. Could you just elaborate a little bit on what specifically you're doing and maybe what's available today or what's coming with some of the property management system rollouts that you're doing?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, it's hard to give you much more than that general comment, in part, because the details are so many, and they're varied across the platform. But RevPAR has been, for better or worse, the principal measure that a hotel can look at to assess its performance against competing hotels in the market. It's the way you look at us compared to our competitors as brand platforms and companies. And everything seems to flow from that.","And it's understandable because RevPAR is the simplest measure of all the measures that might be available from a hotel P&L. But it doesn't really tell the whole story. If you're driving RevPAR on the backs of enormously expensive third-party business that could be charging you, not just teens percentages of room revenues, but sometimes in the 20s or above, you're actually driving revenue at the expense of profitability of the hotels.","And of course, our tools have continued to evolve. We have always been focused on profitable contribution. But we want to make sure that the technology tools that our teams can use make that simple to see, and the first measure they look at as opposed to the second measure they look at. And so, we've been essentially evolving our revenue management systems to look not just at RevPAR from various pieces of business, but to look really at the profit contribution that comes from it.","And in a sense, there is a little bit of risk in that, because it's harder for us to come out and say, yeah, we might have given up a little bit in RevPAR but we gained in profitability. And necessarily have you say, okay, bravo to that because that RevPAR measure is still going to be the one, which is easiest to see. But long term, the name of the game here is to, obviously, continue to drive great associate satisfaction and guest satisfaction, but make sure we are delivering industry leading profitability to our hotel owning partners, which we are absolutely confident we're doing and we think we've got tools to drive it even further.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for that. And then maybe to stay on the same line, just as the follow-up would be, I think that your next large OTA renegotiation is up some time maybe towards the latter part of this year. But could you just give us sort of an update or thought around that negotiation, and is this the first time \u2013 I think, you're able to move Starwood on to your rates, but is this the first time you're going to renegotiate completely as a combined entity or how does that work?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","As usual, you understand it very well. It is the first negotiation we will have had since closing the Starwood acquisition. We did put the Starwood portfolio on the Marriott terms roughly the first of 2017. It took about a quarter in order to get that done after we closed just because of systems issues and the like, and delivered good savings to those hotels as a result.","You're right also that our first round of negotiations takes place \u2013 or the contract, I guess, expires \u2013 existing contract expires late in 2018. Negotiations won't start at that precise date, but obviously will precede it. And we'll see where we end up. You have every basis to know what our aims will be in that process and every basis to know what the OTAs' aims will be in that process, and we'll see if we can work it out.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just a question on group pace. I noted yesterday that Hilton \u2013 or that they stated on their earnings call, that booking pace in the fourth quarter was up in \u2013 for all future periods, up in the mid-teens. I'm wondering how you folks fared in the fourth quarter, higher or lower than the mid-teens.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. We saw that statistic too and, actually, in truth, wondered where it comes from. Let me give you a couple of numbers here which I think are interesting. Our group bookings for 2018 compared to the same time last year for 2017 for comp hotels are up about 2%. If you did a measure, which is looking at total number of hotels, including non-comp, it's about double than that but \u2013 double that at about 4% or mid-single digits. I don't think that's a fair measure in truth, because you're getting the benefit there in adding hotels, which really were not in the base a year ago.","The second point that I think is pretty profound, in four years ago, when we looked at the group booking window, we saw that business booked in the year for the year or booked for the next year represented 71% of all group bookings. In 2017, that is down 21 full points. So, only 50% of the bookings that we are making now are for the next 24 months in effect. And what that shows you is obvious and that is that as group businesses come back, as we've come out of the recession, we've seen hotels that are fuller and fuller, and therefore, near-term bookings have tended to be growing at a lower rate and longer-term bookings have been growing at a faster rate.","When we look at Q4, what we see is that bookings in Q4 for 2018 were down. Bookings in Q4 for 2019 and 2020 were up. And that's really consistent with that booking window pace. To be fair, our bookings for all future periods in Q4 are nothing like up mid \u2013 mid-teens, if that was a number that you heard, and would be, if anything, down modestly from a year-ago period, but we think driven by the fact that the hotels are full.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on that. When we think about the mix of rate versus occupancy for 2018 on the group part of the business, is that almost entirely \u2013 any growth entirely rate-driven?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","It's primarily rate-driven, yeah.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Rate, yeah.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. That's all.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks. Two quick follow-ups to Robin and Felicia's earlier question. I guess, one, what is the sensitivity of incentive management fees to RevPAR and net house profits? And then on credit card fees, can you remind us how a new cardholder spends compare to the spend of a similar customer prior to joining, as we think about potential acceleration from these relaunched programs? Thanks.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yes, so a couple of things. On the incentive fees, broadly speaking, we traditionally think that you need RevPAR growth of solidly 3% to be able to maintain margins. Now, it's part of why \u2013 how we talked about that we were pleased with the performance in 2017 in particular, and clearly has some synergies related to the Starwood acquisition in that margin performance. We continue to expect additional non-RevPAR growth-related margin improvement in 2018 as well, as a result of the merger. So, as we've talked about these numbers of 1% to 2% in the U.S. in 2018, that clearly shows you that, from a margin standpoint, it's hard work to try to be able to get higher incentive fees in the U.S.","Outside the U.S., however, especially where you don't have owners priority, and we are expecting higher RevPAR growth outside the U.S., you clearly would expect they will more than make up for what could be a tougher incentive fee growth here in the U.S.","On the question about credit cards, it's really \u2013 it's not as direct as you described. So, there are a whole host of things going on related to the way the credit card companies pay us across a variety of different metrics. So, obviously, the more credit card holders there are and the more they spend. That is obviously clearly helpful. But there's not a direct relationship that you can look at that's going to be specific to that.","As we talked about before, these are dollars that are coming into the company, and they support the loyalty program for consumers, for owners as well as for the shareholders. So, it's a bit more less direct than the way that you've described.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And I can maybe sneak a longer term question there. As we think about the cumulative cash flow investment \u2013 or cash flow for investment that you've guided to in 2019, I think it was $9.8 billion to $11 billion cumulative from the Analyst Day, what are the biggest puts\/takes across cash from ops, capital recycling and leverage ratios to think about now that 2017 is in the rear view and you've guided to 2018? Thanks.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, sure. Thanks for the question. First and foremost, I'd say we're probably a little ahead of ourselves relative to how you first would look at that about timing from the standpoint of we had terrific asset recycling in 2017. So, it's a little bit like some of that share repurchase was fronted in that three-year plan. I think we clearly are in good shape relative to the metrics that we put out when you see that we repurchased $3 billion in 2017 and you would kind of look at the $2.5 billion that would kind of typically be broken up very broadly in roughly $2 billion for share repurchase and $500 million, in the broader sense, in cash dividend, which again shows you that we're well on our way.","When you think about the EPS, it's a little bit more complicated, given that we've got rev rec to deal with. But \u2013 and RevPAR, I think, has broadly been, over the three years, we're talking about generally in line. One of the biggest differences is obviously credit card fees, which is different as well as tax reform. And the tax reform, obviously, adds another 8 points to our effective tax rate \u2013 lowers it. And that broadly adds $200 million of net income down at the bottom line.","So, I think from an investment standpoint, the other comment I would make is that we are in very good shape relative to the kind of investment parameters that we laid out for you in that three-year plan.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's great. Thanks. Best of luck this year.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Hi, Joe.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question is on the contribution from the credit card in 2018. I'm presuming, of the roughly $130 million of incremental fees this year versus last year, the majority of that is coming from the renegotiations of the two programs. Can you talk about the ramp of that throughout the course of 2018? And is it more second half weighted, just given the timing of when those new cards roll out?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure. So, first of all, as we were talking about before, it is overwhelmingly from the credit card economics rather than from specifics about kind of an assumption about a big increase in either spend levels or numbers of cards. So, it is kind of the vast majority of it is related to the fact that we've got a stronger economic premise and contract that we're working with.","So, it's not per se going to \u2013 there's not as much variability around the credit card spend amounts in the number that we've given you. Frankly, I would expect, Joe, with the introduction of the new cards, it's a little bit hard to predict both in terms of exact timing and behavior on the part of the cardholders. But broadly, I would expect that assuming that people are as attracted to these new cards as we think they will be, that you could expect it to see some ramp during the year. But I would not look for \u2013 I think it'll be fairly even with a tendency towards some ramp during the year, but not massively so.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just my second and final question. When I think about your assumptions for 2018 and your sources and uses of cash, and let's assume that you've returned $2.5 billion, where do you end up at the end of the year in terms of absolute leverage level? How much additional leverage do you put on the balance sheet?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, about $700 million to $800 million, because remember, we've got this year, Joe, we've got a big cash tax bill related to the sale of Avendra. So, kind of relative to what you're normally \u2013 I'll just kind of quickly run through it, and that's you've got roughly $1.9 billion, then you've also got the cash tax and the investment that we've talked about and that gets you down close to $1 billion. And then, you've got loyalty growth that you get from the program, that's, call it, $300 million to $400 million. You've got D&A of another, call it, $300 million. That gets you up close to $1.8 billion. And then you've got additional leverage, which if you think about it, our EBITDA is going up ever so roughly $200 million. You're able to lever that. That gets you another $700 million to $800 million of cash that gets us to our $2.5 billion.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Great. And just to clarify, the cash tax rate of 36% for this year, is that one-time? And what would be the cash tax rate then looking ahead?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yes. So, if you see normally, kind of, put apart Avendra, as you heard us talk about, there's about a 3 point hit from the fact that we got to pay the cash repatriation. So again, in broad terms, if we're talking about a 22% book, you could see that that would be higher by 3 percentage points or 4 percentage points. As we pay off this liability over the next number of years, the way that liability breaks out is for the first five years you pay 8% of it back. And again, we're only paying back net of the available tax credits we have. So, that works out to be, call it, $60 million to $70 million a year that kind of is above what you normally would pay compared to your normal book tax.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Guys, thanks for taking the question here.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","I want to go back to a comment, I think, you made on the last earnings call where you said that, within the U.S. guidance for 2018, select-service hotels were more likely to outperform this year versus full-service. I wonder if that still holds, and if you could add a little more color to that?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You think I said which way, select-service would outperform or full-service would outperform?","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Select-service would outperform full-service.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I guess I still remember the opposite. I think the \u2013 or I don't know that I've got a schedule actually to look at or forecast by brand. You might pull those up. But the \u2013 as I recall, the \u2013 I think it's going to vary obviously a little bit by destination. I think as we go into 2018, we've got guidance, which is fundamentally forecasted on a bit more of the same. In other words, what we saw in 2017 with relatively weak corporate demand with stronger leisure demand. I think at the same time, we've got relatively greater supply growth in the select-service space.","And my recollection, and again, we'd go back and take a look at the words, I may have misspoken here or maybe remembering wrong. But my recollection of what I said then, and I think our views today would be that given the relatively higher supply growth in select-service, we would expect full service, which probably also means some urban select-service to be stronger than select-service in 2018.","Now, you do have some geographic issues here when you get to a market like Texas, for example. It probably has \u2013 it skews a bit more towards the select-service space than full-service space. Texas is, right now, very strong because of hurricane recovery. Before the hurricane, it was quite weak because of the economic issues in the oil patch. I think in \u2013 they will skew the numbers a little bit, but in the first part of 2018, we should continue to see some benefit from hurricane recovery. I suspect that will dissipate as we get further into the year, and that the fare comparison will favor full-service modestly in 2018.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","All right. There is a chance I have that precisely the opposite, so thanks for that. I will go back and...","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","That makes two of us.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","We're also seeing some support in the resorts where because of some hotels in CALA, for example, that were closed, we're seeing really strong demand in our full-service resorts, for example, in Florida. That's going to again lead you towards Arne's comment about full-service.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's helpful, guys. Thank you. And then I want to ask you a quick question just about the episode with the China website shutdown earlier this quarter. And I know it's a sensitive topic, but just what could you tell us about maybe the financial impact on the first quarter? And then, is there a lesson learned there that just in terms of doing business in China that you guys took away from that, that we should be aware of?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, let me take the financial part of this first. We don't expect there to be a measurable impact to our financial results. Now, to be fair, that depends on our not making more mistakes in this space, which we're doing everything in our power to avoid doing.","But what we went through in January principally probably spilled into a little bit of the first few days of February was, we think not \u2013 didn't really cost us in terms of significant business impact to the hotels. It's a classic story. We relied on a third-party vendor to deliver a customer survey, online customer survey to us, which listed not just Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as separate countries but also Tibet, extraordinary sensitivity about issues like that in China.","We should have caught it, even though it was provided by a third-party and we didn't catch it. And we moved quickly to fix that mistake. And of course, we're moving as quickly as we can to look at all of the stuff that we've got exposed out there online to customers in China and customers around the world to make sure that we are not making similar mistakes in the future. It is both \u2013 it is principally something that Chinese social media is looking at. It is not a geopolitical issue fundamentally, and we don't think anybody particularly wants to make it a geopolitical issue.","But to state the obvious, we weren't intending in that customer survey to make comments about sovereignty issues in China. It's not our position to really take a political position. And we're going to do what we can in the future to avoid sort of entering into those sort of political conversations. What we want to do is run the hotels as best we can in China for our associates, our guests and our hotel owners, and we remain extraordinarily bullish on prospects for us in China.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thank you, Arne.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just one question for me. We're halfway through the first quarter. Can you give us any commentary about how trends have been? Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, let me talk about \u2013 I'm surprised we're 45 minutes into the Q&A without a question really about the RevPAR guidance and whether it's conservative or aggressive. And this is as close as I guess we're getting to that.","I'll say a couple of things here. The fourth quarter numbers, obviously, were better than we anticipated. Take note of the statistic we gave you in the prepared remarks, up 3.9%, but we think about 1.5 points of that was holiday and hurricane-driven, so it puts you at 2.5%. That is \u2013 or 2.4%, I guess if you do the math precisely. Even that was a bit better than we anticipated, and a principal reason for the really strong Q4 results, which we feel great about.","But when you look under the national averages, you see some things which are pretty interesting. New York City was essentially flat in the fourth quarter plus a few tenths of a point. South Florida up almost 17 points, Houston up 25% in the fourth quarter. Both of those markets were driven by the hurricane recovery efforts, which are obviously driving demand there. Chicago was down a few points in Q4. But you've got markets like LA and San Francisco and D.C., which on average, between the three of them, were up about 4%, so up about the same average as the market.","I dragged you through all of that, because it tells you something about the hazards of relying on the strong fourth quarter and saying, we know, therefore, that this is a sign of sort of a meaningful shift in generic demand across the United States.","Now, we did better in Q4 than we anticipated. So there's more good news here than negative news, but it is still early in the year. I think we would describe January is off to a really good start and a bit better than we would have anticipated. But again, we're talking about one month, and we want to see how the rest of the year goes. I think at the moment we would think there's more upside possibility than downside risk.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning. Arne, this question stands from the investment announcement of the EDITION Hotel in Las Vegas. I'm just curious whether you're seeing more opportunities to invest directly in properties, whether there's more of a need for you to invest in properties and given maybe the Marriott valuation today, whether it might be more appealing to invest directly in opportunities. Can you just talk about your capital allocation decision at this point?","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, this is a roughly 4,000-room hotel, principally JW Marriott, but also in EDITION Hotel. We're, obviously, thrilled to be on measure to be entering into Las Vegas with a big managed hotel platform with about 500,000 square feet of meeting space. So, this is going to be spectacular for us long-term.","We're investing $50 million over time in the equity in this project, which we're also very pleased to do in the context of a transaction of this size. We think the equity investment is likely to yield good positive returns. But if, in theory, it delivered nothing, it would still be an excellent deal for us because of the strength of the fee stream and the strength of the contribution this hotel will have to our system.","And so I wouldn't read our investment in the Las Vegas project as a predictor of more capital investing by us. I think there is still plenty of capital out there willing to invest in good projects. You see that from the 125,000 rooms that we signed last year. And I think we'll see that \u2013 we might see some interest rates move up a little bit this year, obviously, based on what's happened so far. But as long as that is being matched with more optimism about performance, I think we'll see that both we can continue good unit growth and relatively little need for capital.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful. My follow-up question, Arne, is on international inbound travel and whether you're seeing any reversal of the loss of market share that we've experienced the last 12 or 18 months.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","No, I mean, one of the challenges here is that the data is really hard to get for the industry as a whole. Actually, I was having a conversation yesterday about a couple of government agencies that \u2013 U.S. government agencies that have data, which does not seem to be exactly the same. And so, it's really hard to get sort of current data as you look at it. I think a couple of things that we would say that a number of different data sources tell us that international arrivals to the U.S. in 2017 were down about 4% to 5%, while total international travel around the world was up about 7%. It doesn't take a genius to know that, that means we're losing share.","When we look at our data in a market like New York, as an example, we think international arrivals in New York City last year were down, in our system, 7% to 8%. Fred Dixon, who runs NYC & Co., will have probably better industry data than we will. But I think generally, we're seeing that the United States is losing share.","We don't believe, and I don't think there's any voice in the industry that believes, it is wrong to focus on security and protecting our borders and those sorts of things. But we do believe that we can do those things politically and still communicate a welcome to the rest of the world and have people come here both to do business and take our vacations. And that's the kind of encouragement we're trying to give to our government and trying to use Brand USA and other platforms to make sure we deliver that welcome or that invitation to the rest of the world to come here.","Bill A.

Baird & Co., Inc.","I just wanted to kind of follow up on Bill's question on the capital allocation front, just as you think about buy backs stocks at 18 times EBITDA, has anything changed for you? And then, is there or will we ever get to a crossover point when maybe tuck-in deals or more investment in your portfolio make more sense than buying back stock at 18 times, 19 times, 20 times EBITDA?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Well, first and foremost, growth in our business of how we want to invest our money \u2013 growth in our business comes first. We will always be seeking opportunities to spend our money in value-added ways for our shareholders, for our system, for our customers first. The reality is we've got tons of owners and franchisees and contracts where they want to be part of our system and aren't looking for capital. And we still are in a position where the vast majority of the contracts that we sign require no capital on our part.","However, we have been robust investors in projects, where they make sense and where there's good kind of return above our cost of capital for a long time, and we continue to do it. We talked about that we recycled close to $200 million worth of loans that we made last year. Those are terrific examples, two of which were related to our new Moxy brand in the U.S. So, there are great opportunities to invest, and we want to always make sure to be doing that first and foremost.","However, the reality is we generate well more cash than we need to grow the system organically. We, of course, continue to \u2013 we would take a look at tuck-ins just like we have proven to do and execute on well before. From a share repurchase standpoint, you saw what we did so far in Q1. We continue to be purchasers of our stock. Clearly, the stock moved a lot after the tax reform was passed. And we will continue to be opportunistic. So, that means around the edges, we are definitely going to be keeping our eye out on what's going on and how the stock is performing.","But when we get down to fundamentals of what we believe long term in the value that we are creating, as we said before, we would expect to return $2.5 billion to our shareholders this year through a combination of share repurchase and dividends.","Michael Bellisario - Robert W.

Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","770 \u2013 757.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","750 deals last year. Again, a vast majority of those would not have capital required.

Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Good morning.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I just had one. As you reflect on 2017 and the merger, Leeny, are you able to quantify the revenue synergies from Starwood or at least kind of help us with the RPI gains? And then going forward, should we expect any revenue synergies to occur in 2018 or could those maybe be pushed back to 2019 after the loyalty points are merged? Thanks.","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Sure. So certainly from an RPI standpoint, we were pleased with the gain that we had worldwide system-wide across the portfolio and, clearly, do believe that we are gaining revenue benefits from the merger as well as from the great work that our teams are doing in the hotels and what we're offering to consumers.","But yes, to your point, we do believe there is more to come. We think what's going on with the credit cards and the combination of the loyalty program will be critical pieces to kind of taking a leg up on our share of wallet. And so we would expect more of that in both 2018 and 2019 and, frankly, for what we hope is for some time to come.","In terms of kind of specific timing, I think again, the harmonization and the unification of the program will fold out later this year and into 2019, so we look forward to excitement on the part of the customers to know that they'll be able to go have one program to spend their dollars at any of our 6,500 hotels.","You've seen us be doing a lot in the way of innovation to try to make the process, your entire travel process seamless with us. So, whether it is our PlacePass investment, which will attract people to be able to do more than just choosing a hotel, to the Alibaba work that we have to make it easier for Chinese consumers to book our hotels worldwide, all of those things, we believe, are important additions to what we're doing to make that share of wallet happen.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","I want to add something here, too, just on the strength of the integration so far, and give kudos to Leeny and team, but also all the operators out there. As we mentioned, we have been really focused on delivering economies of scale to our owners. Loyalty rates have been reduced already twice and they will be reduced a third time, while strengthening the benefits to guests and strengthening Marriott's own P&L contribution from the credit cards, and that's because of the bigger program.","Because of that and other things that we've been doing, you can see that in Q4, for example, U.S. managed hotels, we drove margins up 100 basis points. We gave you the number in the prepared remarks for a global full year margin improvement. And I am absolutely convinced that our margin performance is leading, and it is leading because of a number of things that we've done around the integration.","We had a specific 50 basis point incremental margin target in 2017 because of the integration, so over and above whatever the impact might normally be from RevPAR, we have another 50 basis point target in 2018. And through every tool we can imagine, procurement, OTA contracts, we mentioned in the prepared remarks something about credit card commission, transactional costs and all of that is, I think, moving very well.","On the revenue side, the most exciting thing is yet to come, which is the merger of these loyalty programs into one loyalty program. And when you look at the enhanced benefits that the customers will achieve and you look at our portfolio of luxury and lifestyle hotels, particularly, which are the things which motivate people to earn points with you, we think we're going to drive increased share of wallet from our loyalty members, and the revenue lift will be something that hopefully, we start to see the latter part of this year, but certainly as we get into 2019 and beyond.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Stuart Gordon with Berenberg.","Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Yeah. I have a couple of questions, please. First of all, on the leverage, could you tell us how the Avendra cash is being treated? Is that being treated as your cash until you spend it or is it being restricted cash? And how does that fit into your leverage target?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Right. It's not restricted cash because we will \u2013 we are likely to spend that over a number of years.","Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Okay. And as a follow-up, could you share with us \u2013 obviously, you've given us some detail on the new credit card deal and what's coming to you. Could you give us a guide on the headline gross revenues that were incrementally added from the deal?","Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.","Yeah. It's not really a meaningful \u2013 because of the way it comes in, it's not a meaningful comparison because of a host of different ways that we are paid. We also have the reality that we are still operating under two different \u2013 we've got two different loyalty programs now, they'll ultimately be harmonized. So, frankly, it's not really that relevant a number, so we wouldn't be able to make that available.","Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Okay. Thank you.","Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.","Thank you. And thanks to all of you for your participation this morning. We'd love your interest in our story.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Carl Berquist. Please go ahead.","Carl T. Berquist","Thanks, Paula. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Joining me today are: Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.","Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today, October 4, 2012, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com\/investor.","Well, our third quarter was terrific. We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.44, a 52% increase from the prior year adjusted results and ahead of our $0.39 to $0.41 third quarter guidance. Our year-over-year comparison adjusts last year's results for the Timeshare spinoff and other charges. Compared to our third quarter expectations, earnings per share was about $0.04 higher than the midpoint of our expectations.","Total fees were on track, as was REVPAR. Owned, leased and other, net of costs, exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by about $0.01 per share, largely due to favorable residential branding fees and termination fees.","On the G&A line, we remain disciplined in our spending, picking up about $0.01 in lower administrative costs. Also on the G&A line, a favorable litigation settlement was partially offset by higher legal expenses, contributing about another $0.01. Finally, workout costs were lower than expected, which contributed roughly $0.03 of outperformance.","Somewhat offsetting these favorable items, our gains and other line was about $0.01 short of expectations due to an impairment charge for an investment. And on the tax line, a higher-than-expected tax rate cost us about $0.01 as well.","Compared to the prior year, REVPAR results were very strong in the quarter. In North America, REVPAR for our flagship company-operated North American Marriott Hotel & Resort brand rose over 7%. Transient REVPAR for these hotels increased 6%, largely from higher average daily rates. In particular, we saw stronger demand from technology and professional service companies.","Group REVPAR for the Marriott brand in North America increased 8%, with average daily rate up 3%. Meeting planners spent more on food and beverage and added last-minute upgrades and events to their meetings. Planners are increasingly concerned about tight availability and are consequently booking meetings earlier.","REVPAR was strong in most North American markets in the third quarter. We saw double-digit improvement in Boston, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Orlando and Los Angeles. Manhattan REVPAR rose 5%. New supply in the city constrained pricing a bit, but occupancy remained strong. And despite lower government travel, the Greater Washington market reported a 5% increase in REVPAR, largely due to strong leisure and group demand.","Outside North America, third quarter system-wide constant dollar REVPAR rose 5%. In Europe, REVPAR increased 4% due to strong demand associated with the Olympics and the Euro Cup. REVPAR in the Middle East region increased 13%, benefiting from easy comparisons and a pickup in occupancy at our Red Sea resorts. In the Caribbean and Latin America region, favorable leisure and group demand drove REVPAR up 3%. And in the Asia-Pacific region, REVPAR rose 7%, with much stronger business in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Indonesia and Thailand.","Total fee revenue increased by 11% in the quarter, with incentive fees up 24%. Incentive fees in North America more than doubled in this seasonally slow quarter. 16 North American properties that did not earn incentive fees in the 2011 quarter contributed a total of over $2 million of incentive fees in this quarter.","And margins continued to improve. At the property level, worldwide house profit margins increased 180 basis points, with lower energy costs and the benefit of continued efficiency improvements.","Our company margins also continued to improve. Adjusting for cost reimbursements, Marriott International's operating profit margin totaled 41% in the quarter, up substantially from the prior year's adjusted results. EBITDA in the third quarter totaled $284 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $223 million in the prior year. The 2012 quarter included $36 million in gains in other income compared to just $3 million in the adjusted 2011 quarter.","In the third quarter, we opened roughly 5,000 rooms and signed new deals totaling nearly 13,000 rooms. For the full year 2012, we expect to add roughly 28,000 rooms, including the 8,100 rooms from Gaylord. We are pleased to welcome Gaylord's outstanding stars and properties to the Marriott family.","As measured by rooms, we continue to build market share in the U.S. Lenders, owners and franchisees continue to be attracted to the REVPAR index premiums of our brands and the strong economic returns of our hotels. According to Smith Travel Research, we have 10% of open rooms in the U.S. but over 20% of rooms under construction. Worldwide, our pipeline of hotels under construction, development or pending conversion increased to over 120,000 rooms in the third quarter, not including the 8,100 Gaylord rooms.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect REVPAR to remain strong in North America even as we shift from a leisure-heavy quarter to one more driven by business travel. Our fourth quarter guidance reflects 5% to 7% growth in system-wide REVPAR in North America. While our group booking pace is up nearly 9%, the fourth quarter includes a U.S. presidential election week and a midweek Halloween, both of which will likely temper last-minute business-related demand in the quarter.","Outside the U.S., we assume roughly 3% constant dollar REVPAR growth for the fourth quarter. In Europe, we expect REVPAR will increase at a low-single-digit rate, reflecting the weak economy and absence of special events like the Olympics. In the Caribbean and Latin America, the fourth quarter is seasonally slow, with only modest leisure demand. This year, slower group bookings will likely place REVPAR growth for the region also at the low-single-digit rate for the quarter.","In the Middle East, forecasting is quite challenging today. In the fourth quarter a year ago, group business held up surprisingly well despite the social unrest in some parts of the region, so comps are more difficult in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are forecasting REVPAR will increase at a mid- to high-single-digit rate in the fourth quarter.","We're also expecting a mid- to high-single-digit REVPAR growth in our Asia-Pacific region in the fourth quarter, including the impact of the recent China-Japan and Korea-Japan political tension.","Turning to the P&L. Our fourth quarter outlook for the fee line reflects our REVPAR assumption, the Gaylord acquisition and lower franchise relicensing fees. We also expect fourth quarter G&A to decline with less noise compared to last year. Our run rate for interest expense should increase modestly in the fourth quarter. At the beginning of the quarter, we issued $350 million of 10-year bonds, with a 3.25% coupon. We had not expected to issue bonds until 2014, but we were attracted by the low yields in today's market. Given where short-term interest rates are today, this should increase our interest expense by about $4 million in the fourth quarter.","All in all, we expect EPS to total $0.52 to $0.56 in the fourth quarter and $1.68 to $1.72 for the full year 2012. That puts fourth quarter EPS guidance $0.04 lower than our guidance implied a quarter ago, but we fall within the same, albeit tightened, range for the full year. We expect 2012 EBITDA to total more than $1.1 billion, in line with our prior guidance. Including the $210 million investment for Gaylord, we expect investment spending for the full year 2012 to total $850 million to $950 million. With strong cash flow, we've repurchased more than 24 million shares for $900 million year-to-date through the third quarter, and we expect to return roughly $1.1 billion in share repurchases and dividends in 2012.  As you know, we remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and repurchases.","So as we think about 2012, we'd like to remind you modelers that we will report 2013 on a calendar quarter basis rather than our traditional 13-period year. We expect to provide REVPAR statistics on a comparable basis to reveal top line trends, but we will not restate 2012 or provide pro forma financials to match up the 2013 quarters.","So to talk a bit more about our 2013 outlook, I'd like to turn the discussion over to Arne. Arne?","Arne M. Sorenson","Thanks, Carl. Good morning. We're very excited about our accomplishments in the third quarter and optimistic about our prospects for 2013. Given that our budget process is just beginning, we aren't prepared to offer EPS guidance yet, but we still have much to discuss about the future.","In the U.S. today, the big question is the economy generally and the fiscal cliff in particular. Despite our just outside the Beltway headquarters, we are by no means well positioned to opine on how our leaders in Washington are likely to deal with these complex issues. So as we consider 2013 today, let us assume that a solution to the fiscal cliff will be found.","Better understood is the continued government pressure to cut costs by focusing on travel. The GSA recently announced flat government per diems for 2013. Fortunately, at many full-service hotels in the United States, business is strong enough that we will probably replace this government business with other customers paying higher rates. In Washington, we expect occupancy rates to increase in 2013 as the politicians and lobbyists get back to the city.","And we anticipate the inauguration festivities will also drive results. We estimate that the inauguration alone should increase annual REVPAR growth in the downtown D.C. market by 150 to 200 basis points. With this strong downtown performance, we expect REVPAR for greater D.C. to grow at a mid-single-digit rate in 2013. You may recall that roughly 5% of our North American room distribution is in the D.C. area.","Nationwide, annual GDP in 2012 is growing at a pace slightly north of 2%. Assuming that pace continues into 2013, our system-wide North American hotels would likely remain in the 5% to 7% REVPAR growth range that we expect for the fourth quarter of this year. PwC, Smith Travel and Lodging Econometrics are all forecasting less than 1% supply growth in 2013. This, combined with nearly peak occupancy levels, positions us to drive room rates higher.","With a strong book of group business and a sales organization that is doing an outstanding job booking new business, our revenue management team is leveraging that success to drive rate. Our group booking pace for the North American company-operated Marriott brand for 2013 is up over 7%, with nearly 4% improvement in room rates over a strong 2012. Meeting planners and transient guests are booking earlier, and some customers are requesting multiple-year contracts. Given this climate, we are targeting corporate-negotiated rates to increase at a high-single-digit rate in 2013. In short, we expect North America to be steady as she goes. North America represents about 75% of our annual fee revenue.","Europe contributes about 9% of our fee revenue. In Europe, the big 2013 story will likely continue to be the economy as many countries struggle with sovereign debt burdens, austerity programs and modest economic growth. We will also face tough comparisons to many 2012 special events, including the Olympics, the Euro Cup championship and a record-breaking 2012 fair schedule in Germany. In most markets, modest supply growth is a positive, but supply is increasing faster in a few markets where we have distribution, such as Amsterdam and Berlin. Looking at demand, our geographic distribution should help us. Our hotels in the region are concentrated in the major European gateway cities such as London, Paris and Moscow that draw many of their guests from outside the region. Given all this, we are expecting flattish constant dollar REVPAR performance in our European hotels in 2013.","In Asia, in addition to more moderate GDP growth, 2013 REVPAR should reflect significant supply growth in a few markets and slower inbound traffic from Europe. However, as in Europe, we have a meaningful concentration of hotels in better performing gateway markets. In fact, REVPAR in Beijing, Shanghai and Jakarta rose a combined 12% in the third quarter, and we expect those cities to perform well next year. To be sure, there are weak markets as well. Manufacturing markets such as Guangzhou and Shenzhen and urban properties like Mumbai experienced weaker demand, stronger supply growth or both in the third quarter. And we think these markets are not likely to improve materially in 2013. But overall, netting the pluses and the minuses, we expect REVPAR in the Asia-Pacific region will increase at a mid- to high-single-digit rate on a constant dollar basis in 2013. In 2011, Asia contributed roughly 9% of our fee revenue.","In 2013, the Caribbean and Latin America markets should benefit from economic growth throughout the region, stronger leisure business in the Caribbean and a newly renovated hotel for us in S\u00e3o Paulo. Here, we are targeting constant dollar REVPAR growth in the region will increase at a mid-single-digit rate. CALA represents only about 5% of our fee revenue.","In the Middle East, we've already seen a pickup in demand at our Red Sea resorts, although absolute occupancy rates are likely to remain low in 2013. Dubai, by contrast, should remain strong and infrastructure development should help business in Saudi Arabia. While quite difficult to forecast, we are assuming constant dollar REVPAR growth at a mid-single-digit rate in 2013. The Middle East represents only about 2% of our fee revenue.","All in all, we are expecting 2013 worldwide constant dollar REVPAR will increase at a mid-single-digit rate. But REVPAR is only part of the story. We also have a very compelling unit growth story. In the U.S., financing for new full-service hotel construction remains very limited unless the project has exceptional owner sponsorship or some type of government support. But it isn't just financing holding back development. Industry REVPAR for upper upscale hotels is nearly back to 2007 levels, but house profits remain well below peak levels. Given the cost inflation since 2007, we expect hotel industry operating margins won't be back to 2007 levels until 2014 or 2015. And once the economics support new construction, it could take anywhere from 24 to 60 months to develop a new hotel. So it will be some time before we see many new full-service hotel openings.","At the same time, transactions for existing hotels are increasing. Today, CMBS new issue market is quite robust, with low interest rates available for existing properties with solid cash flow. We haven't seen a lot of foreclosures. Recapitalizations are more the rule. This environment offers significant opportunities for conversions as we saw with the recent JW Marriott Essex House deal in New York. Including our Gaylord acquisition, we expect conversions to account for roughly half of our global room additions this year.","In contrast to full-service development, new construction of our limited service brands in the U.S. is picking up. Thus far this year, we've approved nearly 150 new U.S. limited service deals compared to less than 100 deals in the year ago period. While we are pleased to see these numbers improve, new approvals are still far off the level we saw in 2007. We don't see meaningful near-term risk of overbuilding in most markets.","In 2012, we expect to add 28,000 rooms globally across all our brands. As we discussed last quarter, this year, we've seen some hotel openings slide from 2012 to 2013, particularly in Asia and the Middle East and Africa, but the 8,100-room Gaylord transaction nicely fills the near-term openings gap.","The number of newly signed deals is very impressive, particularly outside the U.S. In the third quarter, we signed nearly 13,000 rooms, roughly 2.5x the pace of our openings. Most of these 13,000 rooms will open between 2014 and 2016. Half are outside the U.S. and 2\/3 of those are in Asia. With all these new deals, our third quarter development pipeline increased to more than 120,000 rooms. For 2013, we expect to open 30,000 to 35,000 rooms, and we expect to open 90,000 to 105,000 rooms over the 3 years from 2012 through 2014.","Incidentally, Carl mentioned our recent outside market share gains in the U.S. One brand that has performed particularly well in recent years is SpringHill Suites. Just a few weeks ago, we opened a SpringHill in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. Bill Marriott was there for the grand opening along with our owner, Arnold Palmer. The property bears the unique distinction of being the only hotel to offer guests an exclusive opportunity to play at Palmer's Latrobe Country Club, a members-only golf club where Arnold Palmer learned to play. We opened our first SpringHill Suites just 13 years ago, making this brand one of the fastest-growing limited service brands ever, and there are another 55 hotels in the pipeline. Guests and franchisees love the brand. With nearly 300 hotels, SpringHill earned top honors for guest satisfaction by J.D. Powers recently.","Our strong brands position us for success. We have significant competitive advantages in marriott.com, Marriott Rewards, group sales, revenue management, marketing, purchasing and even back-office accounting. More than anyone, Marriott leverages the tremendous economies of scale in this business. We are committed to delivering strong returns to our owners and franchisees.","New brands also fuel our growth. We've added 33 Autograph Hotels since we announced the brand just 3 years ago. Our 3 company-owned EDITION hotels that are under development have already fueled greater EDITION growth. Three more EDITION hotels are now in our development pipeline, with another half dozen projects under discussion.","Before I close, I'd like to welcome the Essex House back to Marriott. The Essex House is a terrific 500-room hotel located on Central Park South in Manhattan. We owned the property until 1984. Today, it's owned by Strategic and was reflagged as a JW Marriott Hotel on September 18. While its renovation has only just begun, in its first 2 weeks as a JW Marriott, the hotel has already achieved a nearly $540 room rate and has 40% of its business coming from Marriott Rewards customers, well ahead of our expectations. We congratulate the operating team on their outstanding opening.","We'll have more to say in February, but as you can tell for now, we feel very good about the prospects for our brands and our business. Now let's get to your questions. So that everyone gets a chance to participate, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. Paula, let's get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Harry Curtis of Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","A quick question on the last bullet point where you actually called out the group revenue for the Marriott brand in the U.S. up 8%. Do you think that the brand from a market share perspective has turned the corner? And if so, to what degree do you think it's related to Sales Force One? Or is it simply the timing of group business coming back to the brand?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, I think both are factors. I think in the early stages of a recovery, group is never going to contribute as much in REVPAR growth as transient will. Transient will bounce back faster and the group will still be held back a little bit by the length of the booking window and by the fact that the rates on the group business reflect rates that are put on the books at weaker times in the cycle. And I think as -- the longer we get into a recovery cycle, the more that factor ought to dissipate. I also think that the sales transformation efforts that the company is engaged in are performing very well. We have just been now 5 quarters, I think, since the last markets were rolled out with this new sales transformation process in the United States. And the feedback we're getting from our customers and the numbers that are coming in are both very encouraging to us. We anticipate this year that we will refer, in a sense, from one market to another in excess of $200 billion bookings this year. That is possible only because of our sales transformation effort, which really pulls these efforts above property and make -- allows us to compensate people for bookings no matter what hotel they're going to.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And a quick follow-up on Gaylord. Can you discuss your strategy with respect to how you will lift the hotel's operating profit? Is there much low-hanging fruit? Or is this going to be a longer process?","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, it's -- there are some things which are easier than others. Gaylord, to be fair, has done an excellent job with these hotels. They have great service scores with group customers. I think the groups appreciate very much the boxes that Gaylord has. They're great hotels. They're great places to hold meetings. And so there's a lot of good there that we hope obviously to preserve and continue to build on. But Gaylord has had one obvious challenge. And that is they have had to support only 4 hotels as a standalone brand. And so it's very hard to get economies of scale around reservation systems, around accounting systems, around any of those sorts of things. And I think those things will be the easiest places to drive margins. Gaylord obviously will be communicating directly with you about this, but we've been going through very specifically with them before we signed our preliminary documents and certainly as we've gotten ready for the transition, which officially commenced on October 1, Monday of this week, when we took over management of those hotels. But we think the management \u2013 that the margin fee potential for those hotels particularly is very strong.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Attie of Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Let me just preface my question by saying I don't think there's anything wrong with the 5% to 7% REVPAR outlook for next year, but it is below the 3-year outlook that you talked about in June of 6% to 8%. Has any part of the business decelerated over the last 3 months? Or has anything changed in the way you're thinking about it that might explain the difference?","Arne M. Sorenson","That's a good question. We're obviously mindful of the fact that the 5% to 7% are different numbers than the 6% to 8%. Just as a refresher, 6% to 8% was, we thought, a relevant range for our model and was done without the benefit of a budget. It was also a 3-year number, not a 1-year look at 2013. As we've gotten closer to 2013, I think we'd say most things feel about the same. I suspect on balance, we're a bit more cautious about the rest of the world than we were in the summer in Beijing when we put that conference on. In the United States, that 5% to 7%, we're maybe a bit more cautious about GDP growth. We've put another couple of quarters if really pretty modest growth on the books in the United States economy in the quarters that have succeeded. And we're now sort of thinking 2%-ish GDP growth for next year that's implicit in this model. I don't remember off the top of my head, but I suspect we were more in the 2.5% range in our thinking as we were together in Beijing.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Has any of that cautiousness -- is that strictly the outlook? Or when you actually -- when look at the business that you had in the third quarter and what you're seeing early in the fourth quarter, are you seeing the business decelerate at all? Or is it just lower GDP forecast for next year?","Arne M. Sorenson","No, I mean, just the reverse. I think we used the phrase, \"steady as she goes\" in the prepared remarks quite deliberately. What we're seeing in the United States is very encouraging in terms about a continued recovery in demand and a continuing shift towards rate growth as a contributor to REVPAR growth. Obviously, the group bookings look good. I think where we sit in terms of our targeting for special corporate negotiation feel good. Supply growth stays low. So we're very encouraged by what we see in the United States.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of KBW.","Smedes Rose - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","It sounds like the contract signings in China continue to grow and you're adding more units there. But did your expectations for room openings this year into next year, did they slide a bit more from 2Q into 3Q? Or is that pretty much stabilized in terms of the pace of actual units coming online?","Arne M. Sorenson","China is more or less stable from what we thought a quarter ago. And a quarter ago, we saw about 5 hotels out of a pipeline of 60 or 70, I don't remember precisely the number in the pipeline in China, which looked to us like they were slowing from '12 into '13. We've not added any in that category over the course of the last quarter. We do see some incremental slippage in some hotels in India and Thailand. Those are -- it's hard to say that those are driven by economic factors because each of them seems to have its own story, but we also can't ignore the fact that India is wrestling with some economic issues, which I think are significant. As we look at each of these, whether it be the 5 in China that we talked about a quarter ago or these incremental ones in India and Thailand, none of them seems to be a canceled project and we expect all of them to continue to open in our system.","Smedes Rose - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And I just wanted to ask you, on the Essex House, the way that your guarantees are structured with the $40 million cumulative guarantee, it seems like you think profits can get quickly to well over, what that hotel has done over the past few years, at least based on information housed in the CMBS data. And what are sort of some of the components there where you think, is it more top line driven or are there a lot of costs that can come out? And you mentioned the $500 -- $540 room rate. Is that up year-over-year, or what does that kind of compare to?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. Well again, it's always dangerous to hold out some numbers after 2 weeks of performance at the Essex House. And to be fair, September and October in New York are a great time for business. But the -- I think that probably the data point there that's most interesting is 40% of the customers in the first 2 weeks are Marriott Rewards members. And it gives you just a sense of how powerful that customer pipeline is being connected to a hotel of that quality and in such a great location. And that is the overwhelming driver of upside in performance that both strategic and we would expect from that hotel. We are bringing a brand, a rewards program, a set of relationships with special corporate customers and with groups, all of which will drive, we think, meaningfully more business into that hotel than it's experienced over the last few years. We'll obviously do what we can working with Lawrence and the team at strategic to make sure we're finding additional margin opportunities as well. But I think the biggest driver and the simplest one is going to be driving revenue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, I wanted to ask about incentive fee growth because back in June, I think you talked about kind of a 22% to 28% CAGR for the next 2 or 3 years based on kind of a 6% to 8% REVPAR growth. And now that, that June guidance -- now that 2013 is maybe coming a little bit below what that would have suggested, what's your expectation for the incentive fee growth piece of next year?","Arne M. Sorenson","We don't really have anything to say about incentive fees for next year. Apologize for that, Robin. I think the, obviously, incentive fee growth in Q3 was strong, and we feel encouraged by that. When you look at fourth quarter, I suspect we'll see incentive fee growth at lower rates than we've experienced in Q3. And that's fundamentally going to be driven by that 3%-ish REVPAR expectation for international hotels in Q4. If we come in at those numbers, it will clip our international incentive fee growth a bit. And obviously, in February, after we've gotten through the budget process, we will update you on 2013 expectations for incentive fees.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker of MLV & Co.","Ryan Meliker - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question. You talked a little bit about booking windows expanding. Can you just elaborate on how much they've expanded maybe over the past quarter or 2 and where they are today versus, say, at the peak 2007, and I'm talking about group obviously here?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, Carl maybe has this. I can't tell you exactly what the booking window is, but I'll give you a statistic which I think is quite illuminating. So when we look at bookings in Q3 for the Marriott Hotels & Resorts hotels in the United States that were put on the books for all future periods, what we see is that the bookings for the next 13 periods were down a bit like 5% in revenues from the bookings we made a year ago for the next 13 periods. Again, 13 periods for us in '12 is 1 year. Next year, 12 periods will be 1 year, but that's another story. But when we look at the bookings for the 13 periods after that, so that's essentially the second year after, bookings are up 10%. And what that is showing is nothing to be concerned about. That first statistic of 5% decline is not showing a lack of demand. It's showing that we are getting to a point where we're capacity-constrained, and we're getting to a point where group customers are increasingly looking a little bit farther out. And I think we'll continue to see that shift go forward as long as the recovery moves.","Ryan Meliker - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And relative to 2007, how does that plus 10% 2 years out look to, say, back at the peak, is that in line with what you guys had back then?","Arne M. Sorenson","I couldn't tell you. It's a good question, Ryan. We'll have to take a look at that.","Ryan Meliker - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division","Yes, I'm just trying to get a feel for whether group bookings are -- have already recovered back to those types of levels, because that obviously [indiscernible].","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, I mean we know we're already running at occupancy levels which are essentially equivalent to 2007 levels.","Carl T. Berquist","We're about 3% off quarter-to-quarter, third quarter 2007 versus this third quarter of 2012. It's about 3% on REVPAR behind, and occupancy has basically gotten back and it's a little bit in rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I am trying to understand a little bit better out what gives you the confidence for the 5% to 7% REVPAR growth next year. And concerning the negotiated rates, I guess specifically that you're talking about now for 2013, are you seeing clients increase their anticipated room demand for next year versus this year? Or has there been any shift in their appetite for any higher price point rooms?","Arne M. Sorenson","I think generally, we are seeing a modest increase in expected demand from our special corporate customers. We're obviously still very early in the special corporate negotiations season. Most of our proposals are out to our special corporate customers but very few are back yet. But based on what we've put out, that's one of the things that gives us some insight into the next year. And what we hear from our customers is generally a modest further increase in demand, let alone the recognition that rates are likely to go up. You take that plus group bookings at plus a bit over 7% for '13, and we look at the way pricing is starting to respond including in Q3 of this year. Those are the kinds of things that we're relying onto to look at that 5% to 7% growth for next year.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up on that negotiated rates. What is the goal, if you will, this season? Is it -- are you guys trying to grow your share with existing clients, take on new clients or maybe it's something more granular like, for example, cutting back on last room availability? I'm just curious if you guys have an internal goal this season.","Arne M. Sorenson","Well, we do have an internal goal. I won't be more specific than the high single-digits rate increase. I think that is driven though both by pricing growth in like-for-like accounts and I suspect some of the lower-rated special corporate accounts we will essentially not play with, or we will play with fewer hotels with those accounts. And that will give us a little bit more risk with rack rate business, which is not special corporate and not last room availability business. But that mix is an important piece going into that 5% to 7% calculation for next year, too.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just want to go back to the group versus kind of transient outlook because it looked like to us, in the quarter, group revenues came in certainly better than we expected and were up in the high single-digit range. It seems like you're seeing similar indications on the books for next year. But when we look at both the REVPAR guidance as well as from the transient numbers that came through, transient actually came in a little bit below group. So I was wondering if you can just give us a little bit of color on what you think is driving that and kind of how you think that plays out for what the implications of that are for next year.","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. I think that part of it is you have to look at the mix. Group is 40% for the Marriott brand or around 40% versus the transient side, so that's going to -- that mix is going to affect the overall REVPAR for the quarter for the brand. I think that's part of it, probably a big part of the driver of it.","Arne M. Sorenson","I think we're seeing -- you've also got the \u2013 a couple of things going on here. I think the sales offices are doing great, and I think the focus on group business and the pitching and catching from one market to another are helping us grab a greater share of group business, which is in the marketplace. And that's all good. I know a quarter ago, we had some conversation about whether that was squeezing out some transient business. And I think in some hotels on some nights, that probably does. But this is still business that we would much prefer to have because of the non-room spending that's associated with group. And particularly, as the rates continue to move, I think that's great. The other thing you get is some of these markets which are more transient-dominated. So you think about New York, which was 5% REVPAR growth in the quarter. New York has good group business, but it is a transient market. And that -- those much more heavily influenced transient REVPAR numbers are driven both by the impact of supply growth, by the impact of the strengthening dollar, which they have some impact on international business and from some of the other factors that are driving that kind of REVPAR performance in that market in Q3. Demand equation still though looks pretty good to us, including in both the group and transient segments, which is, I guess, fairly obvious if we talk about a 5% to 7% set of expectations for next year.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great, that's good color. I guess my other question would simply be on the, Carl, on the stock repurchase. So you guys are already at looks like $900 million and it looks like you upped the target for the return a little bit for the remainder of the year. But just wondering, it would imply a significant slowdown in the fourth quarter for stock repurchases. I'm just kind of wondering if you're going to remain opportunistic on that front just given how much cash you guys generate.","Carl T. Berquist","Yes, that's a good question. We look at that on a realtime basis. I do remind you, we, as part of the Gaylord transaction, we funded the $210 million during the fourth quarter. That goes into the equation as well. But we'll continue to look at it and look at our cash flow positions, and we'll be disciplined about how we invest that money, whether in the business or return it to the shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A lot of my questions have been asked already, but I did want to ask about your group outlook, the forward group revenue outlook, and maybe this is just splitting hairs. But Arne, you said it was over 7%, and I thought in the last quarter, you said it was 8%. So I'm just -- you sound very optimistic, so I'm just trying to understand if there's a change there.","Arne M. Sorenson","Not really. I mean, the 7% is kind of almost 7.5%. And so it's -- to me, it's more or less the same number that we had a quarter ago. It's still a very positive kind of number, that's good confirmation for us.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, helpful. And then you -- when you were talking about the different aspects of your business and on the select service side, you highlighted SpringHill Suites, and that certainly did very well this quarter. There were some of your other select service brands that underperformed. I was wondering if you could talk about what's going on in the portfolio a little bit and how you might be thinking about some of the other brands.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, the -- essentially, if you look at the REVPAR schedules, you've got the -- as we've done every quarter, you've got the managed block that we show on the top of the page and then the franchised added to that for system-wide numbers at the bottom of the page. And different brands are acting a little bit differently. I think if you look at the full-service Marriott brand as an example, the managed portfolio tends to be a bit more group-reliant, and its geographic distribution is probably a bit more in center city urban markets. And as a consequence, those numbers are a bit stronger than the system-wide numbers for the MHR brand as a whole. I think to some extent, we're seeing the same thing when you look at the limited service brands. So the Courtyard, as an example, where we manage probably about 300 Courtyard hotels, high 200s anyway, and the franchise portfolio is probably 300 to 400, our portfolio will tend to be a bit more urban. Now this is all relative, obviously, within the Courtyard brand, but will tend to be a bit more urban. And I think those are probably a bit better performing markets. So geographic distribution will be a piece of it. I suspect there's also a piece which could be driven by things like the Courtyard refreshing business renovation cycle, where the managed portfolio is probably getting closer to stabilizing after completion of those renovations, and franchise is probably a little bit behind by a few quarters but making great progress. Those are the kinds of things that we would think are probably driving a little bit of that disparity.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you just talk more generally about the lower G&A in the quarter and how much more you could think about in 2013, whether this is an ongoing program? And then more specifically on the G&A issue the -- Carl, I think you mentioned the $0.03 for a workout and then some loss on an impairment. Could you just give a little bit more color on those 2 issues?","Carl T. Berquist","Sure. In the quarter, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we saved about $0.01 in the, what I'd call, the net admin area, this discipline around cost. And then we had about $0.03 we saved from -- we had put in our forecast those amounts anticipating that we may have to incur some costs relative to some workouts. It turned out we didn't have to do that, so we saved on that, and that's more of a onetime item. I think as you look at our G&A costs, and obviously, we haven't done our budgets yet so we don't have numbers for the -- for 2013, but we typically run a 3% to 4% G&A increase on a run rate basis year-in and year-out, and we try to be disciplined and manage to that. In any given quarter or any given year, we're going to have some of these onetime items. Would caution in the fourth quarter of 2011, we had a $5 million onetime item. That's in that number that's making -- helping in the comparisons as you look at the fourth quarter, although we do have some savings in there too for '12. As far as the impairment goes, we have an investment in a partnership that we had to write down by about $7 million in the quarter. Just as we looked at it, it has a number of hotels in it, Marriott hotels, well, there's a few Marriott hotels in it, that they I looked at it, values dropped under the accounting rules, we needed to impair it.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just for my second question or follow-up, the $850 million, $950 million investment spend getting pretty close to the end of the year, how should we think about that as you get closer? Are you getting to hit that number? And then also for 2013, should we think about a similar number on investment spend? Or could there be an increase given the desire for sliver equity and mezzanine financing out there?","Carl T. Berquist","I think as far as our guidance for the rest of the year, that's our best look at it as it is right now. And that also includes, just to remind you, the $210 million for Gaylord that I just mentioned. And then again, we haven't done the 2013 forecast yet. But I think you can go back and kind of look at our trends over the last couple years as to what we've spent relative to capital. And also as we talked out in China when we were out there, we kind of laid out what we thought a 3-year look would look like. So I think you could kind of correlate those things to kind of get a gut feel for it. But we really haven't done the detailed roll-up yet, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Greff of JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","What percentage of your anticipated 2013 group nights is on the books? And I guess we're talking about the Marriott brand. And how does that compare to a year ago for 2012 group nights?","Arne M. Sorenson","We'll end up the year around the same place, I would think, maybe about 2\/3, maybe a couple of points higher. This sort of gets back to that booking window question that was asked before. I wouldn't be surprised to see us end the year at 1 point or 2, maybe 2 or 3 points more of our group business on the books as of the first of the year than we would have had the year before. But it won't be a dramatic shift from the year earlier.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And what would be that percentage?","Arne M. Sorenson","It's about 2\/3. About 2\/3 at year end. And again, one of the things to keep in mind here is group business ranges from 5,000 to 10,000 room nights in some of these big association meetings, which are always booked long in advance to, particularly when you get to some smaller hotels and more urban locations, business which is always going to be booked fairly short term. Even when demand is building, they're going to take the risk that they're going to pay more in rate, and they're just going to -- they're not going to definitize their business because you're talking about a few hundred rooms maybe depending on what they're doing. So we'll get some shift but not -- it still should be year-end about 2\/3.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And if you can remind us what percentage of your U.S. business has contracted special corporate rates?","Arne M. Sorenson","What percentage of our U.S. business today for next year is completed contracts? Or what's the total volume in our hotels of special corporate\u2026","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, percentage of the total room nights sold in a given year in the U.S. related to these corporate rate negotiations.","Arne M. Sorenson","In the Marriott brand, it's going to be in the 12% to 15% range would be special corporate. And actually, the other brands obviously vary a little bit from that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust Robinson.","Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about most recent trends in Europe. When we looked at the Smith Travel data for the month of August, even excluding U.K. and the Olympics, it was actually a very strong month especially in northern Europe. Do you think that August result was a bit of a head fake? And how did September fare for you? And what do you think about October for Europe?","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes, it's all -- I mean, obviously, you can get the Smith Travel data and you can see fairly regularly what they're reporting for Europe. We talked about this a quarter ago. We're still on balance pleasantly surprised by the numbers that Europe is putting on the books. Now to be fair and to give credit to our team over there, we budgeted about the kinds of numbers that we're delivering. I personally thought there was more downside risk on that budget coming out of Europe than there was upside potential just based on reading the newspapers and watching the economic data that's coming out of Europe. It seems to keep ticking along at sort of modestly positive numbers as opposed to flat or negative numbers. We obviously talked directionally about flattish numbers for '13. Is it possible we could be surprised to the upside? It is, based on performance the way it's happening. On the other hand, even if it keeps going essentially the way it's going today, we will lose nearly 2 points of REVPAR because of the Olympics, the Euro Cup and the comparison in German fairs or German conventions year-over-year, which would get us pretty near to 0. Europe, I think, is very hard to predict. I would guess that next year, we'll see London and Paris perform meaningfully better than southern Europe, maybe better than Germany, depending on what happens with their economic environment. I still think the right expectations is kind of flattish for next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Crow of Raymond James.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Quick question, you talked about slowing GDP growth. We know China slowed, Europe is in a recession. All of this incrementally worse since your 3-year outlook was presented in China. Part of that outlook revolved around increasing your leverage, use the proceeds to buy back stock and make investments. How do you think about leverage, adding more debt going into this uncertainty and the fiscal cliff, et cetera?","Carl T. Berquist","Well, we look at that on a realtime basis, Bill, as I mentioned. And you're right, as we look at it going out, we do take into consideration where we think we are in the cycle and how we're -- things are behaving relative to the cycle long term. We kind of target a 3% to 3.25% adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA range and kind of hold ourselves to that as we go through. But we do look at what's happening in the economy as we do that as well. The one thing about repurchases rather than dividends is, is that it gives us the flexibility to increase and decrease as we see these trends take place on a realtime basis.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And so as you saw these...","Arne M. Sorenson","And Carl, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the other thing based on the bond issuance you did in Q3, we've got most of the fixed-rate long-term debt that we would envision putting in place here now for at least the foreseeable future, which means you've got high flexibility on share repurchases and high flexibility on using commercial paper on financing the company. So it's very easy to adjust these things up and down based on what we're seeing on the horizon. I quibble with your question a little bit, Bill, on the sense that there may be modestly more reduced expectations today than we had when we were in Beijing. But I don't think it's a dramatically different world. In fact, I think in some respects, though 5% to 7% is a point lower than 6% to 8%, with another couple of quarters of good strong performance in the United States and good group bookings, continued low supply growth, I think our confidence levels in the United States are every bit as high as they were before. And then when you look around the globe, you see a picture which varies a little bit from place to place. And I wouldn't say it's dramatically different but probably you're right, modestly, we're a little bit less bullish.","Operator","Your next question comes from Will Marks of JMP Securities.","William C. Marks - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about New York. You've given some commentary on the quarter, and I'm curious on the outlook. It seems that everyone's maybe brushing off a little bit the weakness that we've seen the last couple months. And seems that supply is always absorbed is what we hear. But is there any concern at all about next year? Could we see kind of weakness relative to other top markets in New York next year?","Arne M. Sorenson","We're -- our guess at this point, again, we haven't done a budget, so we don't have individual New York hotels yet. But our guess is that New York will be within the range of the other significant markets in the United States next year. On the positive side, it is a fabulous destination. It's got everything going for it. It's got a lot of commerce that brings people in for business travel. It's a great leisure destination. If people can get the rooms to do their group business there, it's a great place to host a meeting. And so it's got great drivers of demand, which have gotten better and stronger as the globe has seen more and more folks traveling. So visitors from Latin America, visitors from Europe, visitors from Asia, everybody wants to go to New York. So that's on the positive side. On the negative side, I think that the obvious point is supply growth in New York is, I suspect, as high as any big urban market we have in the United States. Has been the last couple of years, is likely to continue to post supply growth numbers in 2013 and 2014, which are at or near the top of the big markets in the United States. And the way the dust settles on all that, we'll have to see. I suspect that's been a bit of an impact in some of the quarters we've had over the last 1.5 years or so. On balance, we think that demand should do okay sucking up that supply, and we should still post fairly good numbers in New York.","Operator","We have a question from Alistair Scobie of Atlantic Equities.","Alistair Scobie - Atlantic Equities LLP","I'll be quick. I think most of mine had been done. But just maybe talk, if we can, a little bit around the sort of net rooms growth number, very encouraging to see some of the expectations for gross additions. But it was once again in the quarter the case that you had a lot leaving the system and typically much larger average size hotels than those that were entering the system. Could you just talk a little bit around what we should expect on that going forward? And I guess what proportion of those hotels are leaving at your behest rather than guys that are converting elsewhere? Just a little color around that.","Arne M. Sorenson","Yes. No, those are all really good questions. We continue to think that about 1.5% of the system is the right kind of deletion number for the foreseeable future. Every hotel that leaves our system has got a different story. And we are, on our side of this equation, we're only a piece of it. So a piece of it could be what an owner wants or it could be about whether a hotel has failed. It could be about other dynamics in a market. On our side of the equation, we have gotten a bit more comfortable with saying goodbye to hotels, which are in the lower-quality tiers of our portfolio. And maybe in years past, we would have fought harder to keep some of those. But there's still a lot of stories. So we lost, I think it was in Q3, it might have been in Q2, I apologize for not remembering precisely, we took out 4 hotels in Thailand that didn't pay us much in fees. And they were okay hotels, but it seemed to us to be the right place to exit that portfolio, in part because they were under severe economic pressure. We took some rooms out of 1,000-room hotel in China because it had too many rooms. This was a hotel in Beijing which, based on its location and based on the owner's desire to do some residential, seemed like a better use of that asset and one that actually would cause the surviving hotel to perform even better. And in the quarter, we lost a hotel like Doral. I don't know how many of you know the Doral in Miami, but that was a hotel that essentially was going through a bankruptcy process. And we received a significant termination payment in exchange for leaving and terminating that management contract. I'll leave it up to you who know the Doral, how you think about that from a quality perspective. But all these stories are a little different. I -- we still think 1.5% is probably about the right expectation to have.","All right. Thank you all very much for your time and attention this morning. We appreciate your interest in Marriott, and we look forward to welcoming you into our hotels on your travels.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes your conference. You may now disconnect."]}}
