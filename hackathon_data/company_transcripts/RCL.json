My name is Erica, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Royal Caribbean Cruises Limited 2014 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Jason Liberty, CFO for Royal Caribbean, please begin your conference.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you, for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Laura Hodges, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our Investor website, www.rclinvestor.com. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide.","During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.","Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview of the business. I will follow the recap of our fourth quarter and full-year results. I will then provide an update on the current booking environment and will end with full-year and first quarter guidance for 2015. We will then open the call up for your questions. Richard?","Richard Fain","Thanks, Jason, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. As always, I welcome this opportunity to provide a bit more color on our results for the year and on our perspective of the year ahead of us.","Before I begin, I\u2019d like to take a moment to acknowledge the recent promotions of two accomplished veterans and leaders; Michael Bayley, who has taken over as President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Lisa Lutoff-Perlo, who has taken over as President and Chief Executive Officer of Celebrity Cruises.","It\u2019s been gratifying to watch their careers develop, over the several decades they\u2019ve been with us. They really have differentiated themselves with their passion and their tenacity. One advantage of promoting such experienced talent is that there is no learning curve, they both hit the road running and they were already implementing changes that will drive both brands forward. I say congratulations to them both.","It\u2019s also a pleasure to be talking to you as we finished with one very good year, and as we start another exciting one. At Royal Caribbean, we start every discussion with how it will affect our Double-Double goals and I\u2019d like to do that here too. I\u2019m pleased to confirm that the results that we\u2019re announcing for 2014 and the results that we are forecasting for 2015 are very much in line with our Double-Double program. We remain convinced the program has realistic goals and they were on the right track for success.","You\u2019ll recall that the three pillars of this program, which we\u2019ve outlined on Slide 2, are growing revenue yields, maintaining cost consciousness and moderate capacity growth.","On the revenue front, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our newest vessel Quantum of the Seas and we\u2019re thrilled to be taking delivery of her sister ship, Anthem of the Seas this spring. Both vessels are experiencing healthy bookings and are large drivers of the positive revenue picture for 2015.","Now, the last time I spoke on one of these calls, Quantum of the Seas was still under construction. You may recall, I was optimistic even then about how she would be received, but one can never be certain until the construction is complete. In this case, my expectations have proven accurate and the demand has been simply extraordinary.","The reaction in China has been particularly exciting. The Royal Caribbean International brand continues to be synonymous with cruising in China, and the market anxiously awaits the arrival of Quantum. We are thrilled with her booking and pricing performance to-date, but we expect her to help further increase our market share in this important market.","Our capacity in China is growing 66% this year, and we look forward to continue yield accretion in this profitable market. At the same time, the Oasis class vessels on the Royal Caribbean International brand and the Solstice class vessels on the Celebrity brand, remain the best in their competitive set and continue to deliver returns, while the rest of our upgraded fleet continues to demonstrate improved performance.","Our brands have never been stronger and we will continue to capitalize on their equity as we move through 2015. In this regard, it\u2019s important to note that our guest satisfaction for 2014 was at record levels. Equally important, our employee engagement surveys also reached record levels. Obviously, these factors are related. We continue to believe that a more engaged employee team drives greater guest satisfaction, which in turn, drives greater brand strength, which ultimately drives greater returns on investment for our shareholder.","Separately, we are also very pleased that the SkySea cruises will begin operations later this year. SkySea is our joint-venture with Ctrip, and it will begin operating a revitalized Celebrity Century in China in the middle of 2015. This is yet another opportunity for us to broaden our reach and to take an increasing leadership position in this fast growing market.","On the cost side, I am impressed with the efforts being made, and congratulate both our finance organization and our operating management on generating solid cost reductions in 2014. I know we originally target cost to be down slightly, and our ultimate result of down 0.6% was better than I had expected.","In 2015, we continue our commitment to maintaining a cost-conscious culture. We\u2019re projecting cost being held to 1% or better while still investing in strategic initiatives that drive rapid returns. I think it\u2019s particularly interesting to note that virtually all the unit cost increase in 2015 is attributable to ramping up our operations in China.","Lastly, on the capacity component of our Double-Double program, our growth is immutable, at least through 2017. We did recently announce two new additions to the Celebrity Cruises brand under the name Project EDGE, but those vessels won\u2019t join the fleet until 2018 or 2020. We also continue to be open divesting older tonnage as opportunities arise.","Now returning to last year\u2019s results, 2014 was happily a record-breaking year for our company. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.39, am increase of 40% over the previous year. And we were pleased in \u201814 to be added in the S&P 500 index, by any measure a great year.","I would like to thank the management team, as well as all the employees of Royal Caribbean Cruises Limited for their dedication, their hard work in achieving these milestone results. The year ended on a slightly schizophrenic note. On the one hand, forward bookings were robust and we ended 2014 the best book status in our company\u2019s history. That\u2019s pretty good. Starting the year with fewer berths to fill really helps us raise our yields as the year progresses.","On the other hand, closing bookings in the fourth quarter were more sluggish than we expected. The culprit continues to be a stubbornly challenging Caribbean and the dynamics which are driving that situation carry on through the first quarter.","Fortunately, lower costs and better performance by our equity investments offset the yields. The big winners on revenue were in Asia, Europe and Alaska, with all products over delivered. Onboard revenue, another positive, with another year of good yield growth.","Now looking to \u201915 as you know, we are now entering or have entered our Wave period, and we watch the pace of bookings during this period closely. While, it\u2019s still early in the Wave, overall we\u2019re encouraged by what we see. Of course we always want Wave to be especially powerful, but what we have seen is a good, solid and typical start to the Wave period.","Looking again at 2015, it remains a tail of two periods. The first period is the first quarter, which as we have said before continues to struggle. This is the tail-end of a period with large capacity additions in the Caribbean, and also has the fallout from 2014\u2019s Caribbean malaise. But the last nine months of the year are a very different story. Once we lap - sorry, once we lap the first quarter, yields on all products are expected to be up in the mid-single digits.","As a result, although it\u2019s still early days, we are expecting yields to increase 2.5% to 4.5% in 2015. Given all the above, we\u2019re pleased to provide adjusted earnings guidance in the range of $4.65 to $4.85 per share for the full-year 2015. Midpoint of this range implies another 40% increase in earnings, and another step, good step towards our Double-Double goals. We\u2019re well on our way to doubling our 2014 earnings, as well as reaching double-digit returns on invested capital by 2017.","I don\u2019t have to tell you that an added benefit of moving towards the Double-Double is that our free cash flow improves. We believe it is reasonable that are Board would consider returning capital in due course vis-\u00e0-vis increasing dividends and\/or buying back shares.","Everyone knows that the world price of oil dropped precipitously soon after our earnings call at the end of October. But the impact on us from sharp movements in price are a little more complex than many peoples\u2019 world dropped suddenly staring in the early November. The black line on this chart shows that the prices we actually paid at the pump. Over the three months, our price dropped roughly the same 50% that Brent dropped. But just as it does at your local gas station, it took a little longer for the new cheaper oil to wind its way through the supply side of the equation.","Another factor is that we don\u2019t instantly use the fuel that we take onboard. We take it onboard, but we use the inventory on a FIFO basis, which causes another slight lag in realizing the impact from rapid fuel improvement - for price improvements. During \u201cnormal times\u201d, these lags are immaterial, but when you have as precipitous drop as we experience at the end of last year that delay makes a difference.","Looking into 2015, our guidance is based on today\u2019s price of fuel and we continue our historical practice of remaining about 50% hedge. This results in an improvement in our projected fuel bill, as foreign exchange rates. Increasingly, we are a global company and our greatest currency exposures today are to the pound, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and Australian dollar in that order.","We\u2019ve also shown on Slide 3, our foreign exchange rates movements occur during the same three month period. This chart is the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the weighted basket of our net currency exposure.","As you can see over the last three months, the dollar strengthened about 6%. Overall for 2015, the current strength of the dollar is about 9% stronger than the average was for 2014. We\u2019ve taken that differential into our projections. The impact compared to where we were at the end of October is about $0.54 a share. So the net result of those two factors is $0.59 from fuel, offset by $0.54 hit of foreign exchange, a net benefit of about a nickel in 2015.","Now on Slide 4, we also take a look at the longer term perspective of fuel and foreign exchange. This slide shows the price of Brent over a decade and the strength of the dollar over the same period. I think the chart shows very nicely the historically inverse correlation between these two features. And it also explains why we believe that there is a natural offset in place.","With that, it is my pleasure to turn it back to Jason. Hi, Jason.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Richard. I will begin by taking you through our results for the fourth quarter. Unless I state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant current basis.","We have summarized our fourth quarter results on Slide 5. For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $0.32 per share. While there were several puts and takes from a business perspective, earnings would have been above the midpoint of our guidance if not for the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, net of fuel, which costs us $0.07 for the quarter.","Since our October 23 earnings call, the dollar versus our basket of currency has strengthened over 6%, while fuel prices have dramatically declined. As we have discussed in the past, the change in currency impacts our P&L immediately, while there is typically a four to six-week lag for a change in fuel price. Also rapid changes in fuel prices within a period typically results in some ineffectiveness in our fuels cost. The net impact of these changes was $0.07 for the quarter.","Net revenue yields were up 2.7% for the quarter, which was lower than guidance due to a slowdown in closing Caribbean demand and subsequent pricing reductions on non-holiday sailing. This was somewhat offset by double-digit yield improvement on Europe, Latin America and repositioning sailing. We were able to offset the balance and the revenue mix through better cost, including taxes, and better performance from our equity investments.","Onboard revenue was up 4.9%, which marks the 12th quarter in a row of growth. Strong performance on New Year\u2019s sailing and further demand for our beverage packages showed year-over-year improvement. Cost for better than guidance for the quarter with net cruise costs excluding fuel, up 2.3%. The improvement was mainly driven by a series of programs to reduce crew movement costs and further realize back office efficiency.","I will now discuss full-year results, which we have summarized on Slide 6. For the year, we generated record earnings of $756 million in adjusted net income, a 40% year-over-year increase, resulting in $3.39 per share. As I mentioned during my remarks on the fourth quarter, it would have come in ahead of our guidance, if not for the $0.07 impact from the strengthening of U.S. dollar, net of fuel.","Revenue yields increased 2.4% for the full-year. The story for the year has been very consistent. Double-digit yield improvement in Europe and China, combined with another year of strong onboard revenue performance, more than offset the weakness in the Caribbean.","On the cost front, we executed on our commitment of keeping our costs flat to slight down for the year. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, were down 0.6% year-over-year.","Now, I would like to update you on what we are seeing in a demand environment. I will start by taking you through the first quarter trend. Caribbean capacity is up 8% in the first quarter, and will represent about 70% of our capacity. Over the past few months, the Caribbean has required more than anticipated promotional assistance to stimulate closer end demand. While Quantum has been booking exceptionally well, the short and seven-night Caribbean have been challenging.","Increased capacity and our higher yielding itinerary like Australia and Asia are helping offset the yield declines in the Caribbean. Trends for the balance of the year have been far better than those in the first quarter. And our book-load factors and APDs are nicely up versus same time last year for the Q2 to Q4 period. These strong trends have particularly been driven by the shift of capacity from the Caribbean to Europe, China and Australia.","In addition, we are doing well across most itineraries on a like-for-like basis. Caribbean capacity for Q2 and beyond will be down 2% for our brand, and approximately 4% for the industry.","For the full-year, bookings have exceeded prior year levels over the past three months, cumulating and back-to-back record bookings during the last two weeks. In fact, when we turn the year, we were in a best book position in the company\u2019s history. While all other itineraries are booked ahead of same time last year, our book load factor is farthest ahead for the Caribbean and European sailing.","Caribbean capacity is up slightly in 2015, driven by the addition of Quantum of the Seas in Q1, and the product will account 44% of our overall capacity. Booking trends for Q2 and Q4 Caribbean sailings have been very good so far. And as a result, full-year Caribbean load factors are not just higher than same time last year, they are also above levels seen in all other recent years at this point in time.","Caribbean yields are expected to be down mid-single digits for the first quarter and up low-single digits for Q2 through Q4. We are slightly increasing capacity in Europe this summer with Anthem of the Seas and Allure of the Seas, replacing smaller vessels on existing itinerary. Our Europe capacity is up 5% versus 2014, while remains well below 2011, 2012 and 2013 level.","Bookings over the past three months have more than kept space with capacity gain, and the product has booked well ahead of last year in both rate and volume. Recent demand has been particularly strong for North America and we are also booked well ahead from the U.K. We are expecting yield improvements in the mid-single digit range for Europe this year.","Our most significant capacity growth in 2015 is in the Asia Pacific region, with the addition of Quantum of the Seas in China this summer. In total, our Asia Pacific capacity will increase by 33% and it will account for 15% of our total capacity. Despite the fact that we have been increasing capacity in those regions for the past five years, these products continue to generate superior yields. Overall, we expect to see yields up in the low-to-mid single digit range for these product set.","Taking all this into account, if you turn to Slide 7, you will our guidance for 2015. In October, we communicated that we expected our 2015 net yields to exceed 2014 level. I am pleased to share that we expect 2015 to be the seventh year in a row of yield improvement for the company, with yields increasing between 2.5% and 4.5% for the full-year with all key market delivering positive yields.","I find it even more encouraging that once we lap the top Q1 Caribbean environment, yields are expected to be up approximately mid-single digit. Net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up 1% or better for the full-year. We remain committed to driving efficiencies throughout our business, investing strategically in technology enhancements, and in growing markets like China that provide rapid return, while keeping us firmly on our path to Double-Double target.","We have included $806 million of fuel expense for the year, and we are 52% hedged. This is a reduction of a $132 million since our last earnings call. Net of our hedges, 10% change in fuel price equates to approximately $25 million for the year. Based on current fuel prices and currency exchange rate, we expect another record-breaking year with earnings per share between $4.65 to $4.85. The midpoint of this guidance represents a year-over-year increase of 40% on top of the over 40% growth we experienced in 2014.","Before I move on to your guidance for Q1 2015, I would like to make you aware of one small change in presentation that we are considering. Historically Pullmantur\u2019s results have been reported with a two months lag. As part of consolidating shared service function for this brand, we are working towards eliminating the two month lag and reporting Pullmantur\u2019s financial as we do for other brands, with the year ending December 31.","We anticipate this change becoming affective in the second half of 2015. If so, this would mean that Pullmantur would have two Novembers and two Decembers in 2015. For simplification and comparative purposes, this immaterial adjustment has been excluded from forward guidance for all key statistics and will be excluded from adjust metric once the change is made.","Now, I would like to walk you through our first quarter guidance on Slide 8. Net yields are expected to be down between 1.5% and 2% for the first quarter. As a reminder, we began prorating revenue and cost on all voyages starting in the third quarter of last year. As a result, a portion of high-yielding New Year\u2019s business that would have been entirely recognized in Q1 under the previous pro-ration policies was recognized in Q4 of 2014, making the Q1 2015 comparables more difficult. Yields would be slightly down after this change.","Net cruise cost excluding fuel are expected to be up 2% to 3%, driven by higher spending on marketing during Wave and investments in China associated with our growth strategy. We have also included $207 million of fuel expense for the quarter. Taking all of this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.15.","With that, I\u2019ll ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Richard, this is a question for both, Richard and Jason. Richard, when you started with your prepared remarks and you were talking about Double-Double and your commitment there, and how the company is still on plan, I mean, on track. And Jason, I believe you touched on that as well. I\u2019m just wondering, now there is another kind of wrinkle in the Double-Double, which is with FX, right. So I\u2019m just wondering if you could help us understand what happens to that plan or to your outlook if FX continues to pressure earnings?","Richard Fain","Thanks, Felicia, and good morning. Yes, obviously FX has always been a factor, as has fuel. As we\u2019ve said the two have tender to offset each other, although it\u2019s not perfect. But it\u2019s not a new factor. We knew it was factor when we entered into the Double-Double. It has been a little more dramatic, particularly when you look at the quarter, but if you look over the time, in fact we\u2019ve been raising our projections, and I will tell you that internally we are in a better position vis-\u00e0-vis the Double-Double today than I guess with six months ago when we first announced it. So nothing - and what has happened over the last six months or the last three months has been anything other than positive.","And I think the two elements that really drive it are the - or will drive it are the yields. And the yields are doing quite nicely and we\u2019re guiding this year 2.5% to 4.5%, which is a pretty good increase on a constant currency basis. And the first quarter is difficult, but we always knew the first quarter would be difficult. Bookings, once you get beyond the first quarter are really very powerful. And so I am - I think my tone - certainly my tone and when I drafting my comments was that we\u2019re in a very good position and I am quite comfortable, particularly as we\u2019re looking forward.","The fourth quarter always looks a little awkward, because it\u2019s always the most sensitive quarter to small changes. And this first quarter we know it would really be difficult. The other thing that we look at, and one of the things, that\u2019s very important to us is the Wave period. So we\u2019ve essentially had the first month of Wave. And that is important most because of the absolute amount of bookings that we take during this Wave period and during that first month.","But it\u2019s also important because of the tone and sense of the year. And I would have been heck of a lot more concerned if that tone had been negative. Instead the tone is very positive. It\u2019s a very strong typical Wave period, which gives us encouragement that our yields are going to be there. And yes, again we could have another change in foreign exchange. This year over last year, we have 9% weaker other outside currencies, 9% stronger dollar, which is extraordinary. It\u2019s probably one of the biggest changes we see in a long time and we are still reporting 40% increase in profitability.","So we\u2019ve always noted it will be an issue. It will continue to result in dips up and down, but it doesn\u2019t make me any less comfortable with the Double-Double. I think I better ask Jason to comment to see his view on it.","Jason Liberty","Well, I would concur on with that. And so, as Richard commented, that relationship between currency and fuel has really held up over time. And I think when we put a Double-Double program together, we also realize that we need to also be able to play when it rains, and there is always going to be puts and takes in a business, but by keeping that focus so that the business is driving towards that.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. And then, Jason just a quick question. You guys said earlier that you are 50% hedged. I was just wondering, would strategically where fuel prices are now - I know historically that\u2019s kind of been where you are, but given where fuel prices are now, why wouldn't you hedge more?","Jason Liberty","Yes. So it\u2019s for a few reasons, one of which is this relation or this inverse relationship has been really strong over time. And also the forward curves, try to lock in kind of further out are quite steep, because they\u2019re in contango and that\u2019s some of the reasons in the considerations that why not hedge out more further out.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, clear and helpful. Thank you.","Jason Liberty","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.","Steve Wieczynski:","Hi, good morning guys. So Jason, you did a pretty good job of breaking down some of the markets, specifically the Caribbean and Europe, but when you look at your yield increase this year of, what you\u2019re saying, 2.5% to 4.5%, can you maybe go into a little more detail of maybe some of the other markets in terms of what you guys are expecting from an yield perspective? And then also, maybe how you guys are thinking about onboard as well?","Jason Liberty","Sure. Thanks Steve. Maybe just to kind of start off on the onboard side, obviously the entry of Quantum and Anthem, and we\u2019re having a full-year of Quantum and Anthem are really good new stories for the onboard side, as well as Quantum going into Asia, which as we\u2019ve talked about in the past indexed a little bit higher than the average for the onboard side.","Also, the investments we\u2019ve made on the technology standpoint as we\u2019ve commented in the past with our - the increase in the bandwidth whether it\u2019s with O3b or Harris CapRock, has really also further engaged the consumer to spend for internet package.","So to kind of give you maybe some more color on some other products. We are expecting Alaska to be up nicely. It\u2019s in a good book position, and the pricing is doing quite well. Also I would say on the Australia side, obviously there is a lot more capacity that\u2019s going into Australia which were kind of in my comments around the Asia Pacific. And so there will be some stress on yields. So we do expect it to be positive.","Richard Fain","Steve, one other thing I might add. You asked about onboard revenue, and we\u2019ve talked before about the fact that we\u2019re doing more integration between onboard revenue and ticket revenue. As we evolve the sophistication of our revenue management systems, one of the things you\u2019ve seen is that we are doing more and more with value-added versus discounts.","We really feel that the consumer prefers that. It works up better for the travel agents. And by combining that - and I think a perfect example to put in tangible terms would be Celebrity\u2019s program last year of 123go! program, very successful program. So instead of offering a discount, we say, well, we will bundle in drinks package or an onboard credit or prepaid gratuities or whatever it was that you wanted to choose. And I think those kinds of value-added packages are proving from the market point of view to be very popular with the consumer.","Again as I say it\u2019s popular to travel agent, because it effectively increases their commission because it bundles more into what is commissionable. And it means that instead of touting ourselves on price, we tout ourselves on what we are offering. And we are - we think that the market is ready for, and we are very much focused on trying to upgrade ourselves, the image and do less price fighting, and more, this is why you\u2019re better on this kind of cruise.","So I do think that one of the implications of that mathematically is to the extent that there is more bundling that actually could have a little bit reduction in onboard revenue. But the other thing is we have also gotten so much better at what we\u2019re offering, some of the things Jason talked about. So we are looking for a positive momentum in both sides.","Michael Bayley","Steve, this is Michael. We\u2019ve also invested quite significantly over the past few years on upgrading and revitalization the addition of specialty restaurants and changing out much of our retail offering and changing on bar offering etcetera, etcetera. So I think we\u2019re seeing a nice uplift from the investments that we\u2019ve made over the past few years in terms of the actual onboard revenue options that we have onboard of ships.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay, got you. And then, second question is a bigger picture question, more so for Adam. But Adam, I know when you became COO a couple months ago, back in April, one of the areas that you were focused on were these shared services between the brands, and how could you improve those. So could you maybe give us an update on your progress to-date there, and then maybe what kind of opportunities or synergies you\u2019re seeing as you kind of move forward? I guess, we heard a little bit of that this morning with the Pullmantur announcement. Thanks.","Adam Goldstein","Sure, thank you. Well, one of the key elements of course is to work with the brands and their organizations to ensure that we can deliver against our cost commitments over time as we pursue Double-Double goals. But another crucial element is to enable our global aspirations to activate the global footprint through superior approaches to human resources, to information technology, to the supply chain. And these areas are all progressing with a great determination.","I\u2019m glad enough that China has taken our shared services to a new and different level from anything that we\u2019ve seen before, while we\u2019ve been expanding our global footprint for many, many years, that was almost entirely on a sales and marketing aspect, was now we\u2019ve got operations involved and the supply chain is in China and everywhere around the world.","So the principal payoff of the shared services environment you will see in the yield projections and the yield deliverables and in the cost projections or in the cost deliverables. And there is no question that we have momentum in these areas and that the shared services groups are being challenged and given opportunities in ways that they haven't seen before and we\u2019re trying to be very concrete in terms of the service level agreements and the KPIs that the shared services owe to the respective brand.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay, great. Thanks for the color guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Greg Badishkanian","Great, thanks. I just wanted to talk a little bit, or ask some questions on - that you mentioned the last few weeks in January that Wave has been solid. So, I mean that\u2019s really encouraging, but I just wanted to get a little bit more color. Is that primarily the booking volumes, pricing. Also do any regions stand out? And I\u2019m assuming that was an acceleration from the trend that you saw towards the end of the 2014. Correct?","Michael Bayley","Hi Greg, this is Michael. I think we\u2019ve been pleased with what we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of weeks. The Wave has been quite strong for us. We\u2019re seeing certainly strength in Q2, Q3, Q4. We\u2019re also seeing very good volume coming into Q1. I think we mentioned earlier with the capacity increases in the Caribbean in Q1. There was quite a promotional environment, but the promotions and the pricing stimulation that we put into the market seems to be generating very good volumes.","So I think that\u2019s a positive sign. When you look at the different markets performance globally, certainly the North American market seems to be in good shape for us. Europe, we saw a slight little blip after the events in Paris, a couple of weeks ago, which for a few days we saw things slow down, and then about four or five days later, everything started to come back quite nicely. So our European business seems to be in good shape. And that\u2019s also I think as we\u2019ve mentioned previously in Asia Pacific, Australia and China, we\u2019re feeling good about what we\u2019re seeing, particularly out of the Chinese market with the addition of Continental China. So overall, the Wave has been good.","Greg Badishkanian","And you would say that is that a good indicator for the next few months or historically. How would you - how should we think about that as kind of a future indicator for 2015?","Michael Bayley","Well, I think as Richard had mentioned, when we - and both Richard and Jason. When we came into \u201915, we were in a particularly strong good booked position. I think were in the best position that we\u2019ve ever been in. So really we\u2019re writing off a good book position, and that bodes well for really getting into an even stronger book position by quarter for each quarter across all of our markets. And that of course means that we\u2019re probably not going to be subject to the kind of discounting that we\u2019ve seen previously, because we\u2019ll be in a much stronger state for our company.","Greg Badishkanian","And just finally, Wave for Europe. Does that start sort of mid-February? When do you start seeing the acceleration in bookings for that market?","Michael Bayley","Well, out of the U.K. market, that\u2019s pretty much similar to the U.S. market in terms of the Wave. And out of the Northern European markets, it\u2019s very similar to the American Wave. We see come a little later out of the seven European markets, and we typically see things strengthen as we get into the beginning of the second quarter, but what we\u2019re seeing is good. And particularly out of the U.K. market, it\u2019s been very good.","Richard Fain","And Greg, since you asked about Europe, and to add to Michael\u2019s comments, we had an extraordinary 2014 in Europe. A little bit of frankly of a corollary to the malaise in the Caribbean and for many of the same reasons there was so much capacity that moved from the Caribbean to Europe, It was an extraordinary year. So we were a little bit euphoric about that.","This year, it\u2019s a much more balanced view, but if we haven't had 2014, we would be singing the praises of Europe. It\u2019s strong. It\u2019s doing well. It\u2019s not euphoric like last year was, but it is strong and it\u2019s doing well for us. I think that\u2019s part of what\u2019s giving us a good feeling for 2015.","Greg Badishkanian","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim Conder","Thank you. A couple of questions here, staying on the European question thing first. Can you just give us a framework of how many of your European itineraries, what percent was filled with European-sourced guests versus North Americans in \u201914? And then do you see that changing much for 2015 at this point? And then on the currency side, Jason, just maybe refresh us, you gave us the four major currencies of where your exposure is. How much is your net exposure in each of those currencies? And then have you hedged anything either related to your operational exposure or in particular the euro, where you get paid from TUI? And then I have one additional question after that.","Jason Liberty","Okay, Tim. Thank you. So, just to start off in terms of the mix on Europe. Typically about two-thirds of our guests on European cruises come from Europe and a third from the rest of the world, mainly North America. That tends to vary a little bit based off of demand patterns, because the European product is probably the most leveraged on our global sourcing model, because it is in such demand in so many different markets. So that percentage amount can change here and there.","As it relates to currency, we do provide kind of in order, how those currencies impact us. And it does tend to change by quarter. We\u2019re actually going to publish for you guys bi-quarter the order of the impacts of those currencies, but we will not be getting into what the net amount would be. And on a hedging perspective, like we\u2019ve said with fuel, which was pointed out on the slide that natural relationship in our view comes to a hold and so we don\u2019t really do any operational hedging. We do, do hedging currency-wise for our new building specifically.","Tim Conder","And then just to the other piece of that, your currency guidance factors in what you receive from TUI on the equity income link?","Jason Liberty","Yes, it\u2019s part of our net exposures.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then, my other question was as it relates to maybe Michael and the changes and responsibilities there, clearly built on the successes at Celebrity. And now coming to Royal and knowing that the prior Royal bosses, that remains is now his boss too. So what do you see going forward there, Michael, as far as opportunities in the Royal brand?","Michael Bayley","Well, I have to say that my former - the former CEO, acting CEO of Royal did a really good job.","Adam Goldstein","Thank you, Michael. You\u2019re absolutely correct [ph].","Michael Bayley","And I recommend him for getting everything so well prepared for me. So that\u2019s kind of come back to Royal, but I\u2019d come from Royal, so I\u2019m very familiar with the brand. I feel quite fortunate. It\u2019s genuinely an outstanding brand. We have really high brand awareness. We have a strong global infrastructure. We have winning teams in China, internationally and domestically. We truly have innovative hardware. We\u2019ve got Quantum class and Oasis class coming online in the next few years. We have very passionate loyal guests who genuinely love the brand.","We have huge bench strength with our ship board and shore side employees. And probably most importantly, we have very loyal and long-term travel partners who sort of stayed with us through the course of all of these years and who we have a wonderful relationship with. So I\u2019m very fortunate. I am spending obviously a lot of time developing the forward strategy for the brand. And obviously my key focus is leveraging the power of this brand to drive performance forward, and that\u2019s really my focus. That\u2019s where I am. And it\u2019s a great joy to be back in Royal and to be leading the Royal brand team.","Tim Conder","Okay, great. Thank you all.","Michael Bayley","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven Kent","Hi, good morning. A couple questions for you. Can you just talk a little bit more broadly about your strategy on China versus principal [ph], especially in the light of a couple of announcements they\u2019ve made, even just some this week. And what your initiatives are to target that consumer? And then the second thing, and this is I know, a very near-term issue, but given what seems to be the strengthening of the US consumer, the decline in close-in bookings that noted in the fourth quarter seemed counterintuitive. And I just wanted to understand how that plays out. It would seem to me like as the U.S. consumer strengthens, they would be willing to book further in advance and also pay up as they get closer into the bookings. So I'm trying to understand that balance, but also want to understand the longer term issue, which could be a big opportunity for you in China and how you are looking at it versus your competitors?","Richard Fain","I\u2019ll start, but I think Adam, Michael may want to chime in on China, Jason on the strengthening the U.S. Although I would emphasize, we will have ups and downs in any given quarter. And I think that\u2019s a point we really - I think I almost emphasize I have seen on every call that it\u2019s remarkable to me that we are as - we have been as accurate as we have been. And I think we may have spoiled ourselves by always seeming to meet those, but the degree of accuracy here can't be that great.","I mean this year, our initial forecast for the year was a midpoint of 2.5% constant currency yield improvement. We ended the year with 2.4%. It\u2019s just hard for me to imagine us being able to maintain that kind of accuracy on an ongoing basis, but the others comment more specifically on the strengthening the U.S. because I think you have put your finger on something that\u2019s very important.","Our strategy for China is really very clear. We want to be synonymous with cruising in China. We want to have the strongest product that we know how to do. The Chinese consumer are clearly loving the Royal Caribbean product there. And in China, brand is very important. So we are investing heavily, both in terms of management and in terms of hardware, and ensuring that we are continually strengthening the perception of our brand, and educating the Chinese consumer, because it\u2019s still such an embryonic industry there, most consumers don\u2019t know about it, and they don\u2019t have the same kind of infrastructure with travel agents and others that we have in the United States.","So we\u2019re working hard to expand that. We\u2019ve been growing at an extraordinary rate. We grew last year at 45%. We\u2019ll grow next year at 66%. And we think this is a market that our product is well suited for, and where the market itself is growing. The middle-class in China is growing at such a fast rate that it won't be long that there are more people in the middle-class in China than there are people in the United States.","And so it\u2019s a great potential for us, and we\u2019re working to address that, both through the Royal Caribbean International brand, but also through our partnership with Ctrip, a very aggressive, dynamic, and frankly, inspiring company that\u2019s very strong in the travel industry in China.","So we intend to continue to push that. I think there is room for others, I\u2019m not going to comment one or just two, but I think frankly it\u2019s a good thing to see that the overall industry is growing. And then there is not much interest from others, because as I say, part of the issue here is we need to work to make cruising or relevant vacation there. And so we have some of the same problems we faced in the United States 20 years ago in terms of educating the consumer of all that cruising has to offer. We intend to continue to do that.","Adam Goldstein","If you\u2019re just talking about the kind of the counterintuitiveness with the U.S, consumer getting stronger relative to what happened in Q4 and also our thoughts on Q1. Yes, I think going into our last call, we were seeing that the strength in the U.S. consumer on ticket as well as on the onboard side.","The onboard piece continued on while the onboard performance was quite good. But the reality is that we don\u2019t operate in the vacuum. And so I think some of the competitive forces and the level of supply that was out there caused the environment to be more promotional than we had thought, outside of the holiday sailings which actually you saw quite a bit of strengths from the U.S.","Michael Bayley","Steve, it\u2019s Michael. Just to add to that, I think one of the things that suddenly we saw last year, for example some of Europe, we really saw a strong demand out of the U.S. market, at fairly high price points. So I think that speaks about the growing affluence in the American market that we\u2019re seeing more and more Americans wanting to travel, for example, further, and willing to pay a higher price to do that. And I think that\u2019s quite reflective of how we see part of the emerging opportunity in the U.S. market with regards to the growth of affluence in the U.S.","And then just a quick comment on China. China is really one of those ultimate opportunities, those infinite possibility because the entire market really is a new to cruise market and therefore our brand as we\u2019ve been in the Chinese market for several years and the recipient each year of the top cruise line in China, I think we\u2019re really well positioned in terms of the opportunity that we see. Just to confirm Richard\u2019s perspective, that competition is always good in the market anyway. So I think we welcome the competition.","Steven Kent","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, due to the time constraints, please - for the rest of the question please remain for one question per person. Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley","Great, thanks. I know you\u2019ve talked about how the percent of Europeans and North Americans on a European cruise can change from year to year, but do you anticipate just there are concerns out there about the European economy, that the demand from Europe, and it sounds like its still early for kind of southern European Wave. But are you kind of anticipating maybe you\u2019ll have to shift some more sourcing, shift kind of more of your inventory to be sold to North American passengers versus last year? And then, even though I know we just keep it to one, just my other one is really quick, which is just, how much did the holiday shift in the calendar add to Q4 yields. You mentioned that what it took out of Q1. I just want to think about what it added to Q4? Thanks.","Jason Liberty","Hi Robin, it\u2019s Jason. On the European side, I think that watching what\u2019s happening in that market, there is always going to be puts and takes. But we really did enter the year in a very strong book position for our European sailings, and especially with that driven from North America and the U.K. So there might be some shift in the sourcing, but current booking patterns post year-end have been actually quite good recently on the European sailings. And again having that strong book position will limit the need for us to modify sourcing too much as well as to have to take any practical pricing actions.","As it relates to the - as we had indicated on the last call, the impact on yields as it relates to pro-ration is really immaterial the basic point or two, but we can - after the call we can get to that in more detail.","Richard Fain","But Robin, I think one of the questions is the shifting which has no impact on the year as a whole, but when you do look into first quarter, it has a slightly unfortunate thing because last year\u2019s first quarter had all holiday sailings, and last year, that is the holiday sailings of 2013 were terrific. And so almost all the deterioration this year is because \u201913 had holiday sailings, \u201914 didn\u2019t. Assuming that \u201915 holiday sailings continue to be positive, we simply make it up to the fourth quarter.","And frankly that\u2019s probably the right thing that we have done anyhow. So yes, when you look again at the quarter, most of the deterioration in the first quarter is simply because of that.","Robin Farley","I guess that\u2019s what I - then I don't know if I understood Jason's comment, because it looked like in the release you were saying that the holiday shift was really most of that sort of 1.5 to 2 points decline in Q1 maybe would have been closer to flat\u2026","Richard Fain","That\u2019s what we said. You\u2019re exactly right, Robin. That\u2019s right.","Robin Farley","So if it added 150 to 200 - or I'm sorry, if it took 150 to 200 basis points out of Q1, how would it only have added one or two to Q4, is that because of the year-over-year?","Richard Fain","No. I think what he was saying was the overall year the impact was immaterial. It just shifted some of the benefit. So instead of having better first quarter, we have a better fourth quarter. But the year as a whole, it\u2019s negligible.","Robin Farley","Right, great. And I totally understood that it\u2019s not a meaningful thing. I'm just kind of looking at Q4 results reported today and just wondering what in there was helped by the holiday shift? But maybe I can follow-up after.","Jason Liberty","We can get back to you after Robin. And also I mean it always contemplated in our guidance.","Robin Farley","Yes, understood. And that was a great color on the capacity, really probably not having to shift where you\u2019re targeting, that was helpful. Thank you.","Jason Liberty","Thanks Robin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry Curtis","Hi. Just to get your perspective on, if there has been incremental weakness in the demand from European customers, reflected in your bookings into the U.S. in the second, third and fourth quarters given the strength of the dollar?","Jason Liberty","Hi Harry, we haven't seen - as Michael mentioned, there was a little bit of a dip around the tragedy in Paris. But outside of that, the demand patterns from European consumers for the Caribbean or Alaska so forth has remained pretty in line. And also everything we do, we do in local currency. So it\u2019s not necessarily more except at a point where we start raising pricing because of change in the demand environment.","Richard Fain","And obviously, there has been the euro, the sterling a lot weaker. And so if you\u2019re British or you\u2019re a Continental then you want to buy a vacation in United States, that\u2019s more expensive. So there is obviously some impact. What we\u2019ve tried to do Harry, is incorporate all that into our guidance, so that we\u2019ve looked at it based on where we are today. And that\u2019s where the guidance is coming from.","And yet, we\u2019ve been able as you\u2019ve seen, if we compare where we are overall, ignoring the fuel effects specific impacts, we\u2019re better off today than we were three months ago. And so we think that the general trend has been more positive even though obviously if you look at any particular area there will be puts and takes.","Jason Liberty","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Your last question comes from the line of Jamie Rollo with Morgan and Stanley.","Jamie Rollo","Yes. Thanks for that. Just on the guidance mid-single-digit yield growth for quarters two through four. I think I heard you say the Caribbean will be low-single-digits for that period, Europe mid-single-digits and Asia-Pac low-to-mid-single-digits, which looks overall to be sort of a bit below the sort of 5% figure you need to hit the mid-point of the guidance. And then just the other quick one was on the other financial income from the joint-venture. If I take out the $33.5 million from Spanish tax reform, is it fair to say that the remaining $21 million is pretty much all from the joint-venture with TUI? Thank you.","Jason Liberty","Hi Jamie. One of the other things that happens like in Q2 and Q3. So our commentary for example about the Caribbean being lower single-digit Q2 and beyond, that also factored some structural changes. So for example Allures is coming out of the Caribbean and going into high-yield in Europe.","So a lot of that just a mix change between low yielding products going to higher yielding products through the course of the year. And that\u2019s kind of how you average out for the 5%. If you do take out the tax component, then the majority of that is our joint-venture with TUI Cruises [ph].","Jamie Rollo","Okay, great.","Jason Liberty","Well, thank you for your assistance, Erica. And we will thank all of you for your participation and interest in the company. Laura will be available for any follow-ups you might have, and I wish you all a very good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Royal Caribbean Cruises Limited Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to introduce Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jason Liberty. Mr. Liberty, the floor is yours.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carola Mengolini, our Vice President of Investor Relations. During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our Investors website www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Please note that we do not undertake to update this information in our filings as circumstances change. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP historical items can be found on our website. Unless we state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency adjusted basis.","Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview of the business. I will follow up with a recap of our fourth quarter and full year results for 2019. I will then provide an update on the current booking environment, then provide guidance for the full year and fourth quarter of 2020. Richard?","Richard D. Fain","Thank you Jason and good morning everyone. Obviously the biggest issue of the day is the Wuhan Coronavirus, and as you all know this virus has infected over 20,000 people in China and they have taken unprecedented steps to contain it. They've essentially locked down the country and they're acting quickly and aggressively to combat the spread, so have other countries. Unfortunately, no one knows how this outbreak will play out, and we don't know how it will ultimately impact us. So far, we've cancelled some sailings and we've modified some itineraries that extend through March 4th. These actions will cost us approximately $0.25 per share, but it seems likely that we will have to cancel more, but we don't yet know how many. We also expect that there will be an impact on future bookings in China, especially in the immediate aftermath of the illness but again we just don't know. ","One important bright spot is that looking beyond the current outbreak we aren't seeing a big impact on overall bookings elsewhere. But again, and here I'm sounding like a broken record, we just don't know. To put things in context, China was expected to account for about 6% of our full year capacity and 4% of the capacity in the first quarter. Spectrum of the Seas is currently our only ship in China with two other ships scheduled to enter the market in May and July respectively. Spectrum was doing very well before this outbreak, so this is all very disappointing to us. So far, we've had to cancel eight China sailings and modified several itineraries that go through March 4. Unfortunately, there are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding the situation to calculate the overall impact on the business or give you a good estimate of what the ultimate impact will be. That said, we continue to feel positive about and committed to the long-term growth potential in China, a market that we've been in for more than 10 years. ","In conjunction with CLIA, our industry trade group, we have initiated strong safeguards to help contain the spread of the disease and to protect our guests and crew. These include regardless of nationality, the company will deny boarding to any individual who's traveled from, to, or through Mainland China or Hong Kong in the past 15 days. These guests will receive full refunds. There will be mandatory specialized health screenings performed on guests who have been in contact with individuals who have traveled from, to, or through Mainland China or Hong Kong in the past 15 days. All holders of China or Hong Kong passports regardless of when they were last in China or Hong Kong, guests who report feeling unwell or demonstrate any flu like symptoms, and these standards also apply to employees, crew members, and contractors. All these steps that we're taking and others are taking are expected to ultimately contain the virus, but we don't know how long that will take. ","Now, returning to 2019. I will start out by saying that it was another incredibly busy and successful year. Our teams achieved all-time record financial results delivering an adjusted EPS of $9.54 while introducing three new vessels, launching the very successful perfect day destination, consolidating Silversea, modernizing six ships, and implementing its Excalibur on most of the fleet. Our guest satisfaction scores are at an all-time high and so are our employee engagement scores. I'm gratified to note that our teams achieved these record results while also having more than their fair share of unique incidents like the Oasis dry dock, Cuba, Hurricane Dorian, etc. I believe that this is a testament to a strategy that works, a product that's great, and a group of people that is the best at what they do. ","Now this particular earnings call is special as we are once again announcing a new set of long-term goals. Our management team is very goal oriented, and we have found that establishing clear, simple, and ambitious targets motivates our people and drives superior results. This worked successfully with projects as diverse as Double-Double, Perfect Day, and Project Edge. Our people are amazing and when we get all of them pulling in the same direction, nothing stops us. In this case, our idea is to focus on what we're calling the three P's: people, profit, and planet. We strongly believe that if we attend to these three elements we can achieve even greater heights. We're calling the program 20>25 by 2025. The program consists of five goals, the first two of which are reflected in the title. ","Slide 1 shows the logo we're using internally for this program. The first goal is to reach adjusted earnings per share of $20 per share by 2025. We think that's a worthy goal on its own, but I remind all of you on this call that our real objective is not to reach these goals but to exceed them. It's a bit like tennis where they always tell you not to hit the ball but to hit through the ball. Our goal is not just to improve 2025 results, it is to use that as a steppingstone to a new base that will take us to new and better highs. The second goal is to reduce our carbon footprint by an additional 25%. That's on top of what we've already achieved with our WWF commitment today. Now this goal that we're announcing today is 10% greater and will be achieved five years earlier than the International Maritime Organization's goal, it's a big deal. The third and fourth goals are to increase our employee engagement from the record levels we're currently enjoying. We always emphasize that our success is based on the awesome work of our employees, and we want to ensure that we're taking the steps necessary to generate their continued commitment. We are also proud of the level of guest satisfaction that this commitment produces. Our fourth goal therefore is to continue to raise those satisfaction metrics. ","Lastly we need to accomplish all this while ensuring that we keep our focus on the returns we generate on invested capital. This involves maintaining a high level of discipline on capital spending and on operating leverage. We believe that we will do well even without such a program. Nevertheless adopting the clear and simple 20>25 by 2025 goals will help guide our decision making every day. That will focus our attention on people, profits, and planet. These 2025 goals really motivate and drive performance which in turn not only makes these goals -- makes achieving these goals more likely, it makes exceeding these goals more likely too. We do intend to provide greater detail on the specifics of the 20>25 by 2025 program in our 10-K which will be out in a few weeks. ","Now I'd like to update you on the booking environment for the year. Jason will give a little more but I want to focus on it and given the uncertainties around the virus all of my comments will exclude the impact of that. We're always eager to start the year and see what Wave season brings. It's an important part of our volume but it also serves as a harbinger for the rest of the year. And I'm happy to say that this year's Wave makes us very optimistic about 2020. I'm always amazed by how accurate our revenue management teams have been in the past and this year they expect yields to increase broadly in the range of 2.25% to 4.25%. As always there are some areas that do better than others and some special circumstances for example the brushfires in Australia but overall our forecast was for a nice bump to our already excellent 2019 yields. ","Now it's also important to look at the cost side of the equation and we estimate that our net cruise cost excluding fuel will be up 1.75% to 2.5%. Our cost outlook reflects our culture of continuous improvement and innovation. Nevertheless as I've mentioned in the past costs are not always perfectly aligned with the benefits they carry. For example we continue to invest in our people, in new technology, and our sustainability efforts as well as digital. In all these cases we've spent money in the past two years and we will continue to spend money in 2020. Something similar can be said regarding the employment of our capital. These decisions are focused on the long-term of our business and I believe they are very much in our investors best interests. ","Lastly I will brag a little bit about our stunning new ships in 2020. Among them is the first full year of operation of Spectrum of the Seas, Celebrity Flora in the Galapagos and Mein Schiff 2 in the German market. All these ships had a phenomenal inaugural season in their respective markets and we're very happy with their performance. However during 2020 we'll deliver four additional new ships Celebrity Apex for the Celebrity brand, Silversea Moon and Silver Origin for Silversea Cruises and Odyssey of the Seas for Royal Caribbean International. All these new vessels attract significant premiums and will help position 2020 for another year of strong yield growth and success. With that I will now turn the microphone back to Jason. Jason. ","Jason Liberty","Thank you Richard. I will now take you through our results for the fourth quarter of 2019. These results are summarized on Slide 3. For the quarter we generated adjusted net income of $1.42 per share which is slightly higher than the midpoint of our guidance. In summary, revenue came in as planned and better than expected performance from our joint ventures and below the line activities more than offset the increased costs. On the revenue side net yields were up 6.8% for the quarter in line with our guidance. Approximately 300 basis points of the yield growth was driven by the benefits of Silversea, Perfect Day, and Terminal A. New hardware and like for like yield improvement drove the other 380 basis points of yield growth for the quarter. On the cost side net cruise cost excluding fuel per APCD were up 15.9% which was higher than guidance driven mainly by marine related costs and employee related expenses. In addition during this quarter we repurchased $100 million in shares. ","I will now discuss our full year results which we have summarized on Slide 4. By all accounts 2019 was another year of very strong performance. We generated over $2 billion in adjusted net income resulting in earnings per share of $9.54 making 2019 another record year. This record result was achieved despite the unfavorable impact from the incident in the Grand Bahama Shipyard, the abrupt cancellation of voyages to Cuba, and the operational disruption generated by Hurricane Dorian. Our leading brand and world class workforce delivered this strong financial performance while also driving record net promoter scores and record employee engagement metrics. ","To summarize the revenue performance for the year, yields were up 8% crowning a decade of uninterrupted revenue growth. This result was almost 50 basis points higher than our initial January guidance despite an 80 basis point headwind from a combination of a Cuba policy change, Hurricane Dorian, and the Grand Bahama incident. Strong demand from our core products for our key markets, the higher pricing related to our private destinations in the Bahamas drove the overall outperformance for the year. Now the main driver of the year-over-year improvement was strong like for like yield growth, our incredible new hardware, the launching of Perfect Day, and the consolidation of Silversea. On the cost side net cruise cost excluding fuel were up 11.4%. The main driver behind the year-over-year increase was the consolidation of Silverseas operations, the new operations of Perfect Day, and our terminal in Miami. Lost APCDs due to the Grand Bahama Shipyard incident and investments in technology and digital capabilities drove the balance. ","Now I will update you on what we are seeing in the demand environment, over the last three months bookings have been consistently outpacing same time last year and Wave is off to an excellent start with 2020 booking trends ahead for each of our four brands. In fact the second full week of January was a record booking week for the company. Pricing has also been strong and as a result 2020 is booked ahead of same time last year in both APD and load factor on a like for like basis. We've been highlighting ongoing strength in demand from North America for at least two years and I'm happy to say that there are no signs of a slowdown. In fact we are seeing better overall pricing and demand from North America than ever before with Perfect Day and our ship modernization program providing a clear boost. We are centered to the fact that this is an election year in the U.S. consequently we have modified our booking curves to reflect the short lived slowdown that we typically see during the second or third weeks surrounding the election. ","Now I'll give you a brief overview of our capacity and deployment changes for 2020. Our overall capacity will increase 4.8% year-over-year. Itineraries in North America account for close to 60% of our capacity and are trending very well. We've slowly increased our capacity in the Caribbean driven by inaugural winter seasons for Celebrity Apex and Odyssey of the Seas and therefore the product will represent just over half of our overall deployment. Other key itinerary changes include a year round short Caribbean program or Independent to the Seas visiting Perfect Day and a summer program for the modernized Oasis of the Seas in the Northeast. Bookings for the Caribbean have been nicely higher than last year and all signs point to this year as being our best Caribbean season yet. ","Alaska sailings account for about 5% of our capacity and are booked nicely ahead of same time last year. We've said we increased our 2020 capacity with an incremental ship for Royal Caribbean more than offsetting the redeployment of an Azamara ship. As it pertains to Bermuda, this product only accounts for a small portion of our overall capacity and is also booked well ahead of same time last year. Now the robust booking environment trends from North American guests are also benefiting itineraries in Europe. We also expect trends in the UK to be more predictable this year given the recent BREXIT withdrawal agreement. That being said we have made some changes to our European itineraries to reduce dependence on European markets and provide even more global appeal. Overall European sailings will account for 17% of our capacity this year with dry dock, timing, inaugural seasons for Celebrity Apex and Silver Moon driving capacity up year-over-year. Bookings were similar to the same time last year over the past three months and had been up nicely during Wave. ","Now moving to Asia Pacific, these itineraries account for 17% of our full year capacity and account for 21% in the first quarter. China in particular represents 6% of our capacity for the full year and 4% in the first quarter with one ship Spectrum of the Seas at home ports in Shanghai. China sailings were trending particularly well prior to the outbreak of the Coronavirus with APDs up nicely year-over-year and load factors in line with our expectations. As I've noted it's clear that the virus will impact revenue in China at least in the short-term but nevertheless our plans to continue to grow in this profitable market remains unchanged. ","Australia sailings account for 7% of our capacity and our books slightly behind for the year. However recent trends in Q1 and Q2 have been better with particular strong closing demand from the Australian market during Wave. Taking all of this into account if you turn to Slide 5 you will see our guidance for 2020. As a reminder and as Richard mentioned there remains too many variables and uncertainties to reasonably estimate the overall financial impact relating to the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak. As such our guidance and key metrics for the full year and the first quarter do not include any financial impact that relates to this very fluid situation. ","Our yield outlook for 2020 is very strong, we expect net revenue yield growth of 2.25% to 4.25% for the full year which makes 2020 our 11th consecutive year of yield growth. The underlying yield improvement is driven by new hardware, strong demand for our core products, and continued growth from our onboard revenue areas. As I previously mentioned we are very excited about the introduction of our four new ships during 2020 as they will be important contributors to the overall net yield growth. Now the timing of the new ship deliveries will result in more significant yield growth in the second half of the year than in the first half. ","Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be up 1.75% to 2.25% for the full year. Cost control continues to be a focus, however, this metric will have an uneven cadence throughout the year mainly driven by the dry dock schedule, the new ship deliveries, and year-over-year comparables. This will result in a more significant cost increase in the first half of the year than in the second half. Our depreciation for the year will be in the range of 1,376 million and 1,392 million. As a result our investment in technology and digital projects are becoming a larger mix of our capital program and generally have a shorter useful life than our typical capital investments. Also this year we will deliver two new Silversea ships. ","As I mentioned in the past being in a luxury expedition segment Silversea's depreciation per berth is significantly higher than our corporate average. We have included 744 million of fuel expense for the year and we are 54% hedged. Based on current fuel pricing, currency exchange, and interest rates, and excluding the impact from the Coronavirus, we expect another record breaking year with earnings per share between $10.40 and $10.70. ","Now I would like to walk you through our first quarter guidance on Slide 6. Net revenue yields are expected to be down approximately 0.5%. Demand for the core products is very strong and our core Caribbean yields are up nicely for the quarter despite a difficult comparable. Now while Wave bookings trends have been strong for itineraries based in North America and Europe, recent events around the globe have impacted demand for some of our international itineraries specifically the unprecedented bushfires in Australia and recent activities in Hong Kong and the Middle East are each having an outsized impact on revenue for the first quarter. Moreover it is important to highlight that first quarter is also being negatively impacted by other structural elements such as the discontinuation of Cuba sailings which equals a headwind of approx me 120 basis points, the lack of new ship deliveries, and a tough year-over-year comparable as we are lapping the inaugural season of two new ships during the first quarter of 2019. Notably both Symphony of the Seas and Celebrity Edge had very successful inaugural seasons in the Caribbean last year. Additionally FX and fuel are negatively impacting the quarter year-over-year by approximately $0.15. ","All these issues make for a tough first quarter in terms of revenue growth. Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be up approximate 3% for the quarter. Taking all this into account and excluding any impacts from Coronavirus we expect adjusted earnings to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.85 per share. Before we open up the session for the Q&A I will highlight that we are very excited about the introduction of our 20>25 by 2025 goals that will further support our focus on our people, driving profit, and taking care of our planet. We have stressed before that our strong financial performance is driven by modestly growing our yields, effectively managing our costs, and moderately growing our business. With that formula in mind we have now set a goal of $20 in earnings per share by 2025 which equates to a compound annual growth rate of almost 14% while delivering strong returns on invested capital. This is a meaningful growth trajectory but we believe that we have the right formula and the right people to get this done. ","At the same time we are pairing these ambitious financial goals with environmental targets specifically with reducing our carbon emission by 25%. This does not happen overnight. We have been working on this for some time already with our world class design, engineering, and operation teams developing new and different products and processes to meaningfully and positively affect our environmental impact. With that I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is open. ","Steven Wieczynski","Hey guys, good morning. So I know you are going to get a bunch of questions about China and I know this virus noise is a total unknown. But have you guys thought about any contingency plans in case this virus impact lasts longer than expected, and I guess what I mean by that is what options do you have for those ships that are in affected markets? Can you can you move those, would you try to move those, or could you actually take them out of service for a period of time?","Michael Bayley","Hi Steve, it's Michael. Yeah, I mean obviously we have contingency plans for all of our ships deployed globally, and it\u2019s part of our overall planning process. So, in the case of -- at the moment, it's really Spectrum that's been removed from the China market and that's safely sailing with our crew. We have plans obviously, but I think as we've all said, it's really difficult to understand what is going to happen. I think we're all waiting to see. But we do have alternative plans in place, and we can either redeploy regionally or outside of the region, but we do have plans in place.","Steven Wieczynski","Okay got you. And then Richard or Jason, you gave a lot of good details about your new 20>25 program, but can you help us think a little bit about -- think about what some of your underlying assumptions are that go into that, and I guess what I mean is that you're basically assuming around kind of 14%ish earnings growth per year which is obviously very, very strong. Are your yield assumptions for the next couple of years kind of still inside that normal what you guys would call a normal 2% to 4% yield range?","Richard D. Fain","Yeah, Steve we set up these programs really to motivate our management, and I emphasize that these aren't -- we're not making predictions here, we're setting goals. And our focus is to try and not only get people to focus on doing their job more effectively but also to use innovation to find new and different ways to do it. So, I don't think I'm in a position to say well, we're going to do this by yields and this by costs and this by new investments, etc. We're looking at the whole panoply. And again, I would also emphasize we're looking at five goals and we think these are all very much interrelated. We're not going to get the earnings we want if we don't get good returns on our invested capital. We're not going to get good growth in our yields if our guests aren't happy and our crew members aren't engaged, and our people aren't focused. So, all these things work together and we think together that's the way to achieve our best outcome. But we haven't broken it out in terms of this much from yield, and this much from something else. ","Steven Wieczynski","Okay, got you and then Jason one quick housekeeping question if I could. Your capacity growth for the first quarter is 4.5%. Any idea what that would look like once you remove the eight sailings that have been canceled right now, is that material to that number?","Jason Liberty","Well, it will certainly decrease. I think it will decrease it by about a 100 basis points for those eight canceled sailings based off of what goes through the March 4 date. ","Steven Wieczynski","Okay, great. Thanks guys, appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Your line is open.","Harry Curtis","Hi, good morning everybody. My first question has to do with the first quarter. You had given us a great deal of detail, but there seems to be a fair difference in the equity pickup line item in 2020 versus last year. Can you speak to what the extent of that is and to what degree the Grand Bahama JV contributed last year, and your expectations that have been built in for 2020? Thanks. ","Jason Liberty","Yeah, good morning Harry. Actually, you really hit on the main driver below the line is the Grand Bahama Shipyard, and the loss of the dock for that yard, and so we do not expect that dock to be back on line in 2020, likely in 2021. So, the income that we were receiving which of course since it is a joint venture, and it's an equity pickup, that's where we had expected it to be and that's what's affecting us.","Harry Curtis","Okay, and the second question, going -- looking out to 2025. How much cash do you think you should be able to generate after all CAPEX over the next five years, and are you in this goal, not necessarily guidance, are you assuming any share repurchase in this? Thank you.","Jason Liberty","Yeah. So, we're not going to get into the ebbs and flows of what's there. I mean I think our formula for success, which is moderate yield growth, good cost control while investing in our business and growing our business, and I think at least for the next three or four years there's a very good understanding on how our capacity is going to grow as part of that. I think when you look at -- if you run that 14% CAGR and you keep in mind that our goal is to maintain our leverage between 3x and 3.5x that that will leave you with a substantial amount of cash that will be available to shareholders. ","Harry Curtis","But you should, just directionally, you should be also generating some operating cash, a reasonable amount of operating cash net of CAPEX? ","Jason Liberty","With that growth rate, yes. ","Harry Curtis","Okay, very good, appreciate it. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Jared Shojaian","Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So in the prepared remarks you noted that you're not really seeing big impact on the non-China booking since the virus, can you maybe elaborate a little bit on that in terms of what you have seen with bookings or cancellations in the last week, and then can you also just update us on what percentage of your deposits today are non-refundable versus what that was maybe five years ago and how that could be helping in this environment?","Michael Bayley","Hi Jared, this is Michael. Good morning. Yeah I think we're kind of pleased with what we're seeing in all of our markets around the world with of course the exception of what's occurring in China. When you look at the call center inbound activity as it relates to questions, concerns that both our trade partners and our customers are asking us, any issue related to the virus is relatively small. There are inquiries asking what our policies and practices are, etc. But it's really a tiny percentage, it's under 1.5% of the calls coming in. And we feel good about the booking activity for Caribbean, Alaska, and Europe and generally international. With regards to the second question on the non-refundables, we didn't have them in place five years ago. I think if I recall we introduced them about three -- two to three years ago. I'm very pleased with the results that we have. I don't think we've ever given an actual percentage number of non-refundables but they're very attractive to the customers and of course they're very sticky bookings. So we're pleased. Year-over-year we've seen improvement in the number of customers who choose that option. ","Jason Liberty","Just to add onto it, I think last week just remember that it was the Chinese New Year. So our expectations on booking activity was actually pretty low. Our commentary or my commentary around the booking environment is really what we're seeing to date. So when we think about being in a strong reposition, load factor position, our commentary or strength around North America's demand for North American products and European products, on the positive commentary about Europe is all kind of incorporating what we've been seeing. If you actually look at our 2020 bookings since our last call our booking activity is up 6% versus a person at that point in time. So if you take out the Coronavirus just for a moment what you're seeing is really kind of continued strength in demand for our brand and for our products.","Jared Shojaian","Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then just as a follow up last year you were talking about double-digit premiums for itineraries that had CocoCay, are you still seeing that right now or is there some degree of when you bring a new ship on there's inaugural pricing and then you start lapping that, are you still getting those same type of premiums today. And then in your yield guide of 2.25% to 4.25% how much of that is because of CocoCay both the ticket and the non-ticket assumptions?","Michael Bayley","Hi Jared, this is Michael. I'll let Jason respond to the question on the yield guide but with regards to Perfect Day and the demand that we're seeing coming through we're very pleased with both demand and rate, and I think the volume that we're expecting out of Perfect Day sure is close to 2.4 million guests. We've deployed more ships into Perfect Day and we've been really pleased with both the demand and the pricing for the product.","Jason Liberty","So you're taking the midpoint of our guide about a 100 basis points is going to be driven by the new hardware that's coming on and the balance of that which also includes Perfect Day is coming from like for like improvement. So we're -- I would say we are very, very kind of encouraged and we're not going to break out five months of Perfect Day in terms of our yield guidance.","Michael Bayley","Just to add to that on Friday we opened up the Coco Beach Club in Perfect Day and that is another new element of the experience and the over -- well the cabanas is selling for $1500 a day and they are pretty much booked at. ","Jared Shojaian","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","We kindly request that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up question. Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning and thank you. Jason I was just wondering if you could dissect for us the $0.25 impact or the anticipated I should say $0.25 EPS impact from the cancelled eight cruises just wanted to clarify or ask if that's mostly cost, I know that when you cancel cruises there's usually not -- there's usually not a corresponding yield impact since you're removing the APCDs but in this case especially the Chinese New Year cruises some of those yielded -- I'm wondering some of those yielded higher than your corporate average and if so if there was any yield impact or if you're anticipating any yield impact from the cancellations? ","Jason Liberty","Yeah, so on that $0.25, the vast majority of it, so maybe a couple pennies of it is cost related and the balance of it is really -- it is going to be a top line driven. As you pointed out Felicia we did lose two sailings that were during that very high yielding New Year's week. So we do expect it to play a little bit on the yield especially in the first quarter and less so on the balance of the year as those APCDs get taken out. Obviously on the absolute revenue side the vast majority of that $0.25 will come out of our top line? ","Felicia Hendrix","Right, but is there any way to kind of help us understand in your guidance how you were -- I guess it's not in your guidance but how to maybe think about the higher yielding -- loss of the higher yield increases because like if they were lower yielding than your corporate average they would not have an impact on the yields, right?","Jason Liberty","Right, but in the first quarter they are slightly higher than our quarter average but as it is for the full year it's pretty close to the overall average.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, but there is no way to help us figure out if we wanted to layer it in our estimates?","Jason Liberty","No, we're not going to be guiding for the first quarter or the full year as it relates to us.","Felicia Hendrix","Alright, and then just regarding your commentary on Australia, I'm just wondering if you could help us understand what your deployment to Australia is specifically on a quarterly basis and for the full year and maybe help us know what are you doing to mitigate the lower demand you're seeing for the region or any alterations you're making to accommodate for this situation there? And then also just hoping you can reconcile the comment that closing bookings are strong for Australia with the impact you're seeing in Australia?","Jason Liberty","Sure, so Australia for the year Q1 and Q4 are the heavy periods. There is a little bit that happens in Q2 so in the first quarter Australia is about 12% of our capacity, in the fourth quarter it's about 11% of our capacity. In the second quarter it is about 4% of our capacity. So really the commentary was during those brushfires what we saw was obviously the consumer, the local consumer was very focused on what was happening there in their country. So we saw a little bit of pullback in terms of activity for close in. What we did see as things kind of settled down there is an acceleration of demand. And so we were able to fill those ships, we were able to fill the ships but at slightly lower pricing just due to the timing of all of it. ","Felicia Hendrix","Are you seeing more normalized behavior now.","Jason Liberty","Yes. ","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, great. Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Katz with Morningstar. Your line is open. ","Jamie Katz","Hi, good morning. You guys have made some commentary that you were reducing dependence on European markets. I think that's not surprising given some of the commentary we've heard in recent quarters. But do you have any additional insight on the implied weakness that that would offer us maybe what you're seeing on a more country or regional specific basis?","Richard D. Fain","Yeah, I'll just make a few comments and Michael can jump in. It's not a question of us shifting our sourcing based off of what we're seeing today. Based off of what we were seeing last year our brands made changes to their deployment that really maybe the global appeal greater. Meaning that you can source from more markets versus maybe having a ship that was significantly dependent on the UK market as an example. So our sourcing is a little bit different for Europe this year but a lot that's just driven by us globalizing the sourcing markets for our brands and our products that are based in Europe.","Jamie Katz","Okay, and then can I just get a clarification on Alaska. I think you had said that it was ahead in bookings but I don't know if there was a commentary on pricing and I know for Carnival that was sort of a dodgy area last year. So if you have any insight on the pricing in the region that would be helpful? Thanks.","Richard D. Fain","Yeah, I would just comment in general if you take out Azamara, because Azamara won't be in Alaska this year, it is one of our higher yielding brands. We expect a yield improvement in that product this year. Okay, next question. ","Operator","Your next question comes from James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","James Hardiman","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So obviously pretty encouraging to hear that the Coronavirus issue hasn't impacted any of or doesn\u2019t seem to have impacted the Western bookings. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the flight cruise market coming out of China, how big is that, and is there any impact in that $0.25 number from the potential passengers flying out of China getting on ships elsewhere?","Michael Bayley","Hi James, this is Michael. Yeah, I mean we've actually been quite active in developing the outbound market and of course this kind of really hit during the spring festival week. So we had some outbound business going to ships around the world. But of course a lot of that ended up canceling. That number is built into the $0.25 that we've already spoken about. Now obviously there are -- there's really no outbound business but it peaked during the spring week and then it dropped down significantly after that. So it's really minimal impact at the moment.","Jason Liberty","And James just to add into it, the benefits, I mean obviously the ships like Spectrum of the Seas which is really dedicated to the Chinese market has a greater impact to us because 99.5% of those guests are Chinese. With the outbound space we have the opportunity to be able to source guests from other markets which will help abate some of that risk.","James Hardiman","That's helpful. And then just as a follow up and this might be difficult at this point obviously but are there any rules of thumb as we think about modeling your earnings power not just as of today but as news develops, there is sort of rule of thumb every time a voyage gets canceled, the $0.25 eight voyages would get us to about $0.03 per ship, is it that simple, I'm assuming that it's not but how do we think about that and have you thought about your communication strategy as we move forward and you learn more we're going to be getting sort of updates, press releases, or are we likely not going to hear from you for the next two or three months as news develops?","Jason Liberty","So it's not that linear or you just take a certain number of per voyage. There is variations depending on the timing of those sailings inside the months that are out there and obviously we don't have a second ship coming in now for several months. I think in terms of our communication strategy I don't think we have a set timeline to it. But I think that we kind of pride ourselves with being transparent to the investment community and as we learn more I think we would we would try to take the opportunity to share that impact.","James Hardiman","Got it. Good luck. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank your next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Timothy Conder","Thank you and thank you for the color gentlemen, just a couple more. Jason you'd said that obviously as you continue to ramp up the technology component of your CAPEX that does have a shorter depreciable life. And then that's where some of the additional spending is occurring along with some employee costs in 2020. But is there anything you're doing maybe amping up a little bit of marketing just given everything that's gone on here year-to-date and maybe the increased uncertainty as to how that could or could not impact other areas, thankfully it hasn't so far, is there any component of that in your spending? And then also related to the cost, can you quantify for us the Grand Bahama impact to the equity income or just some ballpark area as well as the wildfires and the other geopolitical items? Thank you. ","Jason Liberty","Sure, so on the marketing side there's really more marketing costs in the first half of the year. Most of that is just driven due to the election coming up so we are trying to get ahead of that cycle. As it relates to Grand Bahama as I said the first quarter there's about $0.12 or $0.13 -- I'm sorry 12 million to 13 million of equity pickup loss due to that dry dock being closed.","Timothy Conder","Okay, and then any quantification on the Australian wildfire impact or Hong Kong and Middle East impacts?","Jason Liberty","No, but certainly Dubai due to the Middle East, Australia and Hong Kong have weighing on our yields in the first quarter.","Timothy Conder","Okay. If I may throw one other, two week cruise, how's that looking at this point, the demand from that JV on a year-over-year basis? ","Jason Liberty","Yeah, so 2019 was a more challenging top line year for the German market. But as we look into 2020 we're seeing a lot of strength in booking on both a rate and volume basis.","Timothy Conder","Great, Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open. ","Robin Farley","Thanks, two questions [Question Inaudible]. ","Jason Liberty","Robin we're having trouble hearing you, it's very in and out. So I didn't even hear the question.","Robin Farley","[Question Inaudible] if you came in at the range where you've been growing yields the last three years that there would be upside to that 2025 number?","Jason Liberty","Sure, sure. So, first as Richard says we're not just trying to hit the ball we're trying to swing through the ball. And if you look at -- or in my commentary I think what we're looking for here is to leverage the investments we're making to have moderate yield growth and continue to have good cost to someone.","Robin Farley","[Question Inaudible].","Jason Liberty","So, the only word I heard there was China Robin. So why don't -- I'll follow up with you after to answer the question. But it was very difficult to hear you as well. I will follow up with you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Stephen Grambling","Thanks, two follow-ups and can you hear me.","Jason Liberty","So I can hear you perfectly, yes. ","Stephen Grambling","Awesome, so first on TUI how do you think about the value opportunity in continental Europe brands whether organically through TUI or via M&A longer-term? And then second on the near-term first quarter targets, can you just talk to what is embedded in the net cruise costs, kind of across dry dock, puts and takes, marketing costs, etc.? Thanks. ","Jason Liberty","Well as it relates to your two cruises obviously I mean the performance of that brand has been exceptional and we really believe that in the German market and TUI cruises is positioned in that market. How it's trading, how it's growing in its demand. We're very happy and which makes us very excited about the German market and the overall European market. As it relates to on the cost, I think you were talking about the first quarter your cost piece, the main drivers in that first quarter are really just driven by investments in marketing and technology and in G&A. Certainly Perfect Day plays into that a little bit about 60 basis points of the first quarter cost increase.","Stephen Grambling","So I guess a quick follow up on that. So can you -- is there any way you can help quantify the dry dock puts and takes as we think about the ships that are in and out and maybe the cost of each?","Jason Liberty","Well the dry docks for the first quarter in itself it's lighter in the first half of the year than it is -- I am sorry there's more dry docks in the first half of the year than there is in the first. So probably about a point of that cost increase more or less about a point of the cost increase is driven by us having more dry dock days in the first half of the year -- in the first quarter.","Stephen Grambling","Great, thanks. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Brandt Montour Montoya with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Brandt Montour","Great, thanks for taking my questions. So you noted the contingency plans that you have in place in China. I'm just wondering if the present situation continued on like it is and the Greater China industry also looking to move ships elsewhere which markets do you think will most likely be the most popular targets and how does that play into your strategy?","Jason Liberty","So Brandt obviously we're monitoring events and we're looking at competitors. We have our plans in place, we have alternatives, we thought it through. I really don't actually want to go into detail on this call about what those plans are because we are in a very competitive environment so we don't want to start talking about where we're planning on deploying if this really does play out to much longer time span.","Brandt Montour","Fair enough, okay. And then on fuel just given the mix shift in the way that your hedge book is probably changed now versus 12 months ago can you give us sort of a sensitivity between the two fuel grade or fuel grade mix on the at the pump portion of your exposure? ","Jason Liberty","Well, our goal is to mainly have a similar mix of our fuel to the balance of 2020 as we had in 2019. We are more hedged on the MGO side and in those schedules we will get published [indiscernible] later in the day for you to be able to have the mix of fuel and those hedge positions and then from there you should be able to look at the flex in MGO and IFO fuels.","Brandt Montour","Great, okay. Thanks everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research. Your line is open.","Assia Georgieva","Good morning, couple of questions. The first one in terms of China and enforcement of people who have travelled to China in the past within the past 15 days that seems to be somewhat easy looking at their passports but it seems that a couple of the other items that you intend to enforce seem to be on an honor system whether they've been in contact with individuals or reports feeling unwell. Do you think that would be enough to prevent a negative event where you have even let's say one passenger reported with the virus because we saw what happened with Costa and that was a significant hit?","Michael Bayley","Yeah hi it is Michael. Obviously it's a very dynamic and moving situation. We're monitoring this on a daily basis where we have a medical team as part of our company and we're very connected to the World Health Organization and CDC. I think you'll see that as each day passes different countries enforce different rules, protocols, and regulations. We implemented protocols early last week about almost up to two weeks ago. And we're monitoring all of these different protocols. So I think with regards to people who from, to, or transited through Mainland China or Hong Kong nearly all countries now are adopting the same kind of protocols generally. We also have as you say part of it is an honor system. But we have a secondary screening system in place on our fleet that's been in place now for quite some time which monitors activity in passports and of course the passport holder themselves. And we are taking temperatures etcetera, etcetera. So yes, you're right. I mean I think it's of course a possibility but not only our countries but our company itself are taking a series of what we believe to be very prudent and sensible actions that will not entirely eliminate the risk but massively minimize this risk.","Assia Georgieva","Thank you Michael and I definitely will not be allowed on the ship because I'm under the weather as you might be able to hear from my voice. But it's good to know that you're monitoring temperature etc. And as a follow up airlift that has been limited could that affect voyages that sail out of Japan or other destinations in the Pacific including to Australia?","Michael Bayley","Yeah, I mean I think again to my previous comment it's really a dynamic moving situation. There are various changes that are being put into place by different countries, etc. We've seen change with airlift from the for example the Western American Airlines where they did suspend flights in and out of China until the end of March. We're not really seeing a lot of regional disruption in terms of flights, etc. What we are seeing is different countries adopting these various protocols which seem to be moving to a similar protocol. I think the World Health Organization made a point last week when they spoke about the smaller countries that obviously have less resources to deal with this and they tend to still be making different decisions as it relates to their individual protocols. But that's more of an impact on individual itineraries and of course we always have alternative ports to go to visit. So again it's difficult to answer specifically. I think it's just a dynamic moving situation. The good thing is, is that there is a really universal effort to work together to contain and minimize the impact of this situation.","Assia Georgieva","Fair enough and then if I can sneak one last one and here's my wishful thinking possibly with 2020 now in place do you think and maybe Jason you might be able to answer this best, do you think that we might see a decline in ISO prices which would offset the increased demand for MGO to a point where we're not going to see quite as much of a pickup in fuel prices post hedge? ","Jason Liberty","Yeah, well I think that is a working theory. It's also why if we look at our hedge position we are hedged more in MGO than we are in IFO because it is rational that as time goes on here demand for IFO is going to drop -- continue to drop in and of course demand for MGO is going to continue to rise. Operator we have time for one more -- operator we have time for one more question. ","Operator","Thank you. Your last question comes from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Vince Ciepiel","Great, thanks. Just big picture, just curious how you feel today versus back in November setting aside the impact of Coronavirus, kind of across your core North American or European markets, how do you feel about the trajectory of bookings and pricing growth and maybe specifically I think it was in November that you noted pricing was tracking ahead for all quarters, I'm just trying to reconcile that with 1Q which I guess it's kind of guided flat. But has anything changed in the last 90 days with 1Q specifically?","Richard D. Fain","No. This is Richard. I think we were feeling quite good then and we have been reassured by seeing the call volume and the response on bookings in the Wave period. As we said there are some exceptions and we've pointed it out a couple in the Gulf and in Australia. But the strength of the bookings frankly we have found outside of the Coronavirus we have found really very reassuring. So I think just from an overall point of view we feel quite good about the year. ","Jason Liberty","And Vince just to add in our last call when we talked about the cadence of our yield growth we did point that we expected Q1 to be wider because our yields last year were up over 9% and then of course we had Cuba, we were going to have to deal with which is impacting us by 120 basis points. So we knew that Q1 was going to be a more challenging quarter which is why we said it at that point in time. But if you -- but if you listen to our just our what we say since our last call our bookings have trended up by 6% for 2020. That would just show that our sentiment broadly is very, very good.","Michael Bayley","You know we've made this point in previous calls, most industries when you look through the calendarization it is -- this cycle is time to define. And so you expect a certain sequence between the quarters. Our quarters within the year tend to be more defined by specific events the delivery of a new ship, when the dry docks take place. So ours is more episodic and we have known and tried to telegraph for a while that the first quarter of this year episodically is low. But that doesn't impact our overall position for the year. ","Jason Liberty","Okay, thank you for your assistance, Mariama with the call today. And we thank you all for your participation and interest in the company. Carola will be available for any follow ups you might have and we really wish you, all of you a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

At this time all participants have been placed in a listen only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions, following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Jason Liberty, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carola Mengolini, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures.","Please note that we do not undertake to update the information in our filings as circumstances change. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP historical items can be found on our website. Unless we state otherwise, all metrics on a constant-currency adjusted basis.","Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview of the business. I will follow-up with a recap of our fourth quarter and full year results, for 2017, and then I'll provide an update on the current booking environment and we will end with full year and first quarter guidance for 2018. We will then open up the call up for your questions. Richard?","Richard Fain","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everybody. It does feel good to be able to provide some color on our results of this beautiful 75 degree day here in Miami. You know for the last three years you have heard me talk repeatedly about the double-double and I must admit that it feels very good today, to formally say that we have accomplished what we committed to do three years ago. Our earnings per share have more than doubled to $7.53 and our return on invested capital is 10.5%. These figures are $0.75 and 50 basis points better than our targets. Our company worked very hard to achieve the double-double and now we\u2019ve done it. The feeling is very fulfilling and I want to thank each and every member of the teams that reached these aggressive goals. ","I also think it's important to emphasize that while the EPS and ROIC targets were essential goals of the company and the program, our aspirations were actually much higher. In order to reach such inspirational goals, we had to raise our gain in many, many areas. We need to increase the preference of our brands earn in the market place. We needed to upgrade our already excellent revenue management systems. We needed to upgrade our onboard product, we needed to reduce our energy footprint and we needed to upgrade the caliber and engagement of the men and women who produce these results. We also used the double-double program to strengthen our credit metrics achieving investment grade and to return capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. ","Because this achievement would not have been possible without the passion and the commitment of our people the company has decided to give them a surprise reward. Every one of our 65,000 employees will receive a bonus equal to 5% of their salary. We're calling this a thank you-thank you bonus. It will be in the form of equity grants, investing over three years, thereby giving every employee a stake in the company's future. The program also includes major upgrading of crew [ph] facilities and recreation areas. Our people are what make our business. We wanted to show our appreciation in a tangible way and we wanted it to reach every employee regardless of level of the organization. ","Today's announcements also addressed another issue that needs to be considered, we're looking at the program like the double-double. There is always an inevitable risk that such a program could motivate a management to favor short-term expediency over long-term value. Ours is a long-term capital-intensive business and we simply can't afford short-term decision making. Our announcements today with respect to forward prospects demonstrate clearly that our work over last few years has enhanced not to practice from our longer-term prospects. We believe that our double-double efforts have not only helped us reached these specific targets which created a cultural vision that position us to jump head with our 2020 vision. ","Speaking of which, our indicators denote that we're heading into another record year, we're currently booked ahead of last year in both load factor and rate. Now you may recall that a year ago I said and I'm quoting, my senses at the booking window have stretched as far as we will ever want and I don\u2019t expect to announce another record level bookings a year from today. Well I wasn\u2019t terribly accurate, here we are a year later and we're announcing another record level bookings. ","Notwithstanding my prediction, our revenue mangers concluded that the market is so strong that we could eek out yet another increase and that having this much book would help us raise our prices as the year progresses. However, my overall sentiment from last year still applies. We manage the booking curves to maximize revenue and I feel and I predict that next year we will choose to leave more available for bookings during the coming year. ","Now Jason will provide more detail on our expectations for 2018. But we believe our strong forecast looks like the power of our brands. Recent trends have been particularly strong for North America, Europe and Asia Pacific itineraries. These trends coupled with strong onboard spend are position the company for another year of the yield growth. Having said that it's also important to note that we are still early in our wait period and we are up against particularly strong year-over-year comparables. Based on all of this we expect yields to increase probably in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% in 2018. ","Now it's also important to look at the cost side of the equation. As we estimate that our net cruise cost excluding fuel will be up 1.5% to 2%. Last year on one of these calls, we were asked the following question, quoting the cost performance has been really exceptional, any thoughts about your ability to continue to find things to cut and also whatever inflation that you have. ","Now at that time we answered that we've not been in a professional state of cost cutting, but in fact our cost performance reflected our culture of continuous improvement and innovation. However, and thinking about this important topic, we realized that this is actually very complicated and it has many variables impinging on it. For example, many of our expenses are directly linked to driving revenue but they are not necessarily linked in time to the revenues that they generate.","For instance, we grew just marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of last year and are doing so in the first quarter of this year because our marketing people thought that would be the most impactful way through spreading it over the year. ","Another example would be our investments in our people a big investment here and in new technology. In both cases we've spent money in 2017 and we will spend money in 2018 and we don\u2019t expect any of those expenditures to have a significant benefit until 2019 or 2020. Such cost and timing of cost can drive any one-year assets out of line with past or future trends, but we still think that the result is very much in our investors' best interest. In fact, we continue to remain overall such low level of cost despite our very aggressive revenue enhancing investments I find to be very encouraging. ","Now as I noted in our last call and we said earlier, we are experiencing very strong demand for our product driven by among other things, changes in consumer preferences that don\u2019t necessarily particularly relate to us but we benefit from them. Those changes also call for us to respond and adapt quickly as we look to position ourselves as a leader in travel. ","This past November some of you got a glimpse of the kind of innovations we are pursuing in order to make the whole cruise vacation as frictionless as possible. We are rolling out an unprecedented WAVE of digital innovation, touching every aspect of our business and focusing on the overall guest experiences. ","Consumers are buying experiences, they are not buying things so we are creating vacations which are rich in made to order and memory making moments. The technological transformation also encompasses many areas beyond simply the guest experiences including innovations to make our ships more energy efficient, enhanced ship management and put connectivity in the hands of our crew members. ","As consumer preferences change, we are also enhancing our product offering by increasing our experientially focused itineraries. This past November, celebrity cruises unveiled the celebrity flora a stunning new ship delivering in 2019 designed specifically to operate around the Galapagos Islands. In March we take delivery of the spectacular new Symphony I'm always amazed that how our new building team keeps coming up with new ways to make these ships ever more impressive. Symphony will start operating in the Mediterranean and almost over to the Caribbean next fall. The excitement and therefore thankfully the bookings have been heartwarming.","And by the way speaking of excitement, next fall Celebrity Edge will hurrying [ph] on your season. It's been extremely gratifying to see the extraordinary level of interest this ship has generated. We spent a long time since any new vessel generated so much anticipation, and I can tell you right here that all that attention is warranted. Actually 2018 will be the first year with three of our brands welcome the new ship, since SMR Club Cruises [ph] is also introducing their SMR Pursuit in the summer.","This year we are also kicking off a transformational fleet upgrading program, for Royal Caribbean International it's called Royal Amplified and for Celebrity Cruises it's called Celebrity Revolution. These programs will expand our lead in terms of brand preference with both active cruisers and the new generation of cruisers. We are redefining the experiences that drive choice, guest satisfaction and ultimately revenue. ","With respect to our Caribbean itineraries last month we also added more capacity in Cuba with now two ships sailing to the island, Majesty in the Seas and Empress of the Seas. We also added two new destinations.","Now looking at other accomplishments important to our business I wanted to share with you the Royal crew men has again been recognized as one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute. This is an organization that measures corporate ethical standards and promotes best practices in corporate ethics. Ethical leadership is an important part of our worldview and we greatly value this honor. ","In summary, 2017 was a phenomenal year. Double-double is done and we have now all our focus on delivering a successful 2018 and hence our 2020 vision.","Now with that I get to turn it back to Jason. Jason?","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Richard. I'll begin by taking you to our results for the fourth quarter of 2017. These results are summarized on Slide 2. For the quarter we generated adjusted net income of $1.34 per share being the midpoint of our guidance by $0.17 per share. Our yield increased 3.9% for the quarter which is 165 basis points higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance. Better-than-expected closing demand for our core products and continued strength in onboard trends drove the outperformance. ","On the cost side bet cruise cost excluding fuel were in line with our guidance up 8.7% for the quarter. Better fuel consumption, fuel rate and a weaker dollar benefited the quarter by $0.04. In our continued efforts to return capital to our shareholders we repurchased $100 million in shares in the quarter which was on top of the $128 million in dividend that we declare for the quarter. ","I will now discuss our full year results, which we have summarized on Slide 3. To summarize our revenue performance for the year strong demand for our North American and European products combined with increase spend on, on board experiences help offset challenges from the redeployment of our Korea sailings and the unprecedented impact from the 2017 Hurricane season. As a result, we generated more than $.6 billion in net income resulting earnings per share of $7.53 which exceeded the midpoint of our latest guidance by $0.16 and our January guidance by $0.53 per share. ","This result marks the fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth and earnings per share. Net revenue yield increased by 6.4% exceeding the midpoint of our November guidance by 40 basis points and our January guidance by 140 basis points. On the cost side, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, were up 2% which was in line with our previous guidance. Before getting into the current booking environment, I will touch on double-double. In July of 2014, we set our course to double earnings per share and reached double-digit return on invested capital by the end of 2017. ","To achieve this, we said that our formula for success would include mainly growing yields effectively managing our cost and modernly growing our business. To the unWAVEring execution of this formula, we\u2019ve successfully surpassed our double-double targets. As you can see on Slide 3, our earnings per share for 2017 are $7.53 per share which is $0.75 better than the double-double EPS targets we set in the middle of 2014. ","We also delivered an ROIC of 10.5% which is 50% better than our double-double target. Over the same period the company successfully returned to investment grade, delivered EBITDA margin is over 40%, increased our dividend by 140% and repurchased $725 million in shares. ","A stronger dollar and numerous geopolitical activities provided strong headwinds throughout the double-double period. However, the strength of our brand, the resiliency and diversification of our sourcing and deployment model, our unWAVEring cost and capital discipline and most importantly our world class work force successfully let us through the headwinds to over deliver on our targets. ","As we pivot towards our three-year financial target under our vision, we will continue to employ our formula for success in combination with enhancing the guest experience and employee engagement and remaining set fast in our commitment to the environment. These factors will lead us to achieve double-digit earnings while improving on ROIC. ","Now I'll update you on what we\u2019re seeing in the demand environment. Booking volumes exceeded prior year levels for the past three months and we once again turn the year in a record book position. The critical WAVE period is upon us and is off to a very good start with booking trends above same time last year. ","Last year's WAVE season was incredibly strong, so we're encouraged that bookings are trending even higher this year. As a result, we're booked ahead of last year in both load factor and rate. ","The strength and demand we've been seeing for the past couple of months has been particularly evident in North America with bookings up nicely for sailings on both sides of the Atlantic. As we discussed on the last earnings call, growing bookings were relatively soft for the six weeks following the hurricanes. Trends normalized in November and had been in line with our expectations since then. ","First quarter Caribbean sailings were on a very strong book position before the storms, recovered relatively quickly afterwards and are currently ahead.","Our Asia Pacific itineraries have also been trending well. About 17% of our deployment is in this region split between Australia, China and Southeast Asia itineraries. While these products are important for our success for the full-year they are particularly influential on the first quarter where they count for 27% of our capacity and are collectively booked well ahead of last year in both rate and volume. ","I'll finish with a few comments on booking trends for the upcoming European season. Demand for both Mediterranean and Northern Europe selling's has consistently surpassed our expectations with all key source markets booked nicely ahead of last year in both rate and volume. As you would expect symphony overseas is gartering significant premiums but APDs are also up nicely for the rest of the fleet. ","In regard to 2018 capacity each of our brands were welcoming new ship into their fleet this year, Royal Caribbean International will welcome Symphony of the Seas in April, Azamara Club Cruises will introduce Azamara Pursuit in August, Celebrity Cruises will introduce Celebrity Edge in Fort Lauderdale in November. These additions will result in a full-year capacity increase of 3.9%. The introduction of this new hardware as well as our ongoing efforts to optimize itinerary mix has resulted in some changes to our deployment in 2018. Caribbean itineraries will account for just over half of our full-year capacity and will include more quality Cuba than in 2017 in an expanded program in the northeast and inaugural winter season for both Symphony of the Seas and Celebrity Edge beginning in Q4. ","We will also welcome Mariner of the Seas back to South Florida market mid-way through the year after she repositions from Singapore and undergoes a significant modernization during a six week drydock. ","With Mariner transitioning back to the North America to make way for Spectrum of the Seas arrival in China in 2019 our Asia Pacific capacity is decreasing year-over-year and will account for 17% of our total inventory. ","And finally, we are building on a very successful 2017 European season with 17% of our capacity in this region in 2018. Symphony of the Seas will spend her inaugural summer season in Europe replacing Freedom of the Seas in Barcelona and Azamara Pursuit able debut in Europe towards the end of the summer. ","Taking all of this into account if you turn to Slide 4, you will see our guidance for 2018. We expect net revenue yield growth of 1.5% to 3.5% for the full-year which makes 2018 our ninth consecutive year of yield growth. The yield improvement is coming off of an extra ordinarily strong 6.4% increase in 2017. Strong demand for our core products, new hardware and continued growth and experience driven onboard revenue areas are expected to drive the yield improvement. ","On our November earnings call I mentioned that factors such as drydock timing and earlier Easter and tougher comparable during the summer will likely result in more yield growth in the first quarter and fourth quarters than on the second and third quarters. This is still our expectation. ","Net cruise costs, excluding fuel are expected to be up 1.5% to 2% for the full-year. The main drivers behind the increase in this metric are investments and the guest experience and revenue generating activities, additional drydock days related to our upgrade programs and the lapping of some benefits from hardware changes. ","We included $675 million of fuel expense for the year and we are 50% hedged. Based on current fuel prices, currency exchange and interest rates we expect another record breaking year with earnings-per-share between $8.55 per share and $8.75 per share and therefore another year of double-digit EPS growth.","Now I would like to walk you through our first quarter guidance on Slide 5. Net revenue yields are expected to up in the range of 3% to 3.5% for the first quarter. ","First quarter yields benefit from additional drydock days, the earlier timing of Easter and the year-over-year benefit from hardware changes. Net cruise cost excluding fuel are expected to be up approximately 10% for the quarter, somewhere to last year the cadence of expenses for 2018 are not linear. With the first quarter weighing heavily on the overall increase in the cost metric. The increase in the quarter is mainly driven by the timing and scope of drydocks related to our ship upgrades together with the lapping of the benefits from hardware changes. Taking all of this into account we expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $0.95 per share.","With that I'll ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski of Stifel.","Steve Wieczynski","First question is around at the yield guidance for the year and you guys have said in kind of a so-called normal year, you think yield growth should be about 2% to 4% meeting a midpoint of 3%. Obviously your 2018 midpoint is slightly below that at 2.5%, so I guess the question is, is that 2% to 4% range still in play long term? And I guess the second question would be if you didn\u2019t have such a strong fourth quarter which made the year-over-year comparison that much tougher, would your midpoint have been closer to that 3% range and I hope all that makes sense.","Richard Fain","Thanks, Steve. So first just to kind of address the 2% to 4%. I think that fairly represents on how yields have grown over the past four years and so it's tough to say that's how we will see it going forward but we do expect our yields to grow moderately. Your math is exactly right. Obviously Q4, the acceleration in close and demand and the better performance and on board increased our yield performance for the full year, by about 50 basis points. And of course, that increased the base and so mathematically our yields for 2018 if not for that acceleration would have been at a midpoint of 3%.","Steve Wieczynski","And then second question still about your yield guidance can you give us a thought about maybe how that breaks down in terms of how you're thinking ticket versus on board, the on board continue to grow really nicely and I guess what we are just looking forward is maybe some color on how you view that this year?","Richard Fain","On the onboard side obviously, some of that onboard revenue include some of the packaging that goes on when we go-to-market and might include something like beverage or shore excursion or something like that, I would say that we expect onboard yields to trend slightly higher than ticket this year which has been a similar performance relative the past. But some of that just to stress again it's just a geography of the accounting of us selling that package some of that revenue gets recorded in onboard versus ticket.","Steve Wieczynski","One quick final question I guess around the Caribbean, there are clearly some concerns out there that the Caribbean has starting to see some softness pickup in kind of 2Q and 3Q. And given your prepared remarks I didn\u2019t really hear too much of that. So, can you may be just address some of those concerns that are out there? ","Michael Bayley","Hi, Steve its Michael. I mean I think, we're feeling pretty good about the Caribbean as Jason had commented earlier after the hurricanes in September, we saw that softness for about four to six or seven weeks but that recovered and picked up and we're in a good book position for Q1. And overall we're feeling pretty good about the Caribbean for '18. ","We\u2019re fortune because we've got Symphony of the Seas coming into the Caribbean towards the end of the year, we have also got celebrity edge and we're introducing Mariner of the Seas after an extensive modernization and revitalization and we're putting that product into the short market, so that\u2019s quite a lot of volume that\u2019s coming into that market but we're actually very excited about what that products going to do, this bookings very well and still outside of its typical booking window because it\u2019s a short product. So overall, we're feeling okay about the Caribbean. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. ","Felicia Hendrix ","Richard, now your hurdle's even higher on the vision 2020 given the double-double. ","Richard Fain","Thank you, I'm not sure I should thank you for that but I think we're well aware of it. ","Felicia Hendrix ","I just wanted to commend management as a whole on the recognition of your employees through the thank you-thank you, that was impressive. ","Richard Fain","Well deserved. ","Felicia Hendrix ","Michael maybe we could just stand Caribbeans for just one moment understanding that Royal Caribbean has introductions of ships and revitalizations and all that kind of stuff that might set you apart. Just trying to may be triangulate what companies see versus what we hear from the trade and I think there has just been this consistent commentary that recently there's been a bit of a lull in Caribbean bookings as people might be differing, there decision to go to the Caribbean. So, despite the fact that you guys are potentially well positioned, have you been seeing that on the margin more recently?","Michael Bayley","No, obviously we're coming off a very strong 2017 and when you think about the WAVE in 2017, it was really a strong WAVE. And our WAVE for 2018 has been stronger than '17, so we're feeling pretty good about what we're seeing in terms of both the rate and the volumes of bookings that are coming in. I think when you look at capacity overall certainly for Royal, capacity skewed more towards Q3 and Q4 because that\u2019s where we got Mariner coming into the shorts market and symphony coming online into the Caribbean and of course Celebrity Edge. But all three of those products are in a good place and with, as I said before we're quite excited about what those products are going do for us. ","So, we\u2019re not seeing that, your comments, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about Caribbean. ","Jason Liberty","Just to add one point, just more kind of broadly in our commentary around our book position, being at a strong book position also means that you have less inventory to sell and so some times when you are doing some of those channel checks, the volumes may not be what we are looking to fill because we are in a stronger book position, so the volume can sometimes be lower.","Felicia Hendrix","Well I can just say that\u2019s a segway to my next question but I'd love to hear what you are about to say.","Jason Liberty","Well I was just going to say that there are occasions sometimes when a new product enters into the market and sometimes from competitors and they may have some challenges initially and you may see some fairly aggressive pricing going into the market. I mean that can be disruptive but it's very localized, so that maybe that's what you are hearing or seeing.","Felicia Hendrix","Do you want to be more specific on that?","Jason Liberty","No. But I would add just one other point, just also will always be mindful that when we are sourcing guests for our products that sourcing is happening globally and so again some of the trading activity might be taking place more a different market other than the local markets that you guys might be checking.","Felicia Hendrix","And then maybe can you guys just help us understand how booked you are for this second and third quarter in the Caribbean?","Jason Liberty","I would just comment that we are well booked for the year.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, and then Jason can we just talk about project Excalibur for a moment. If I understand correctly that's going to be rolled out to 50% of your fleet this year. Is that fact giving you some of the optimism for onboard this year that you highlighted in the press release this morning?","Richard Fain","No, I don\u2019t think we think that it will have that immediate impact. We think it's simply part of the overall growth of the business obviously and also it tends to be a little bit back-ended as the rollout works well and it gets accelerated so I think actually we are thinking that is more something that will help us longer-term rather than have an immediate impact this year.","Felicia Hendrix","And just housekeeping, just the drydocks accelerated this year is '19, how should we think about drydocks?","Michael Bayley","On the drydock side it's more of a normal year, I mean very similar to what you would have seen in '15 and '16 and so I would expect going forward for us to have a similar drydock schedule to '18 mainly driven by the upgrade programs that we are planning.","Richard Fain","If I can actually come back I just want to say I didn\u2019t want to suggest that I wasn\u2019t incredibly excited about what Excalibur is going to do and I really think it is going to transform -- you've seen sort of mark-ups of it. I think it's going to be fantastic but I think it will take a little while for us to rollout and so the public to see just how exciting it is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel of Bernstein Research.","David Beckel ","So, I just want to circle back to annual guidance if I could and I want to know if my math is wrong here but in 2017 if you were to remove the benefit of Pullmantur I believe your guidance for next year at the midpoint is implying a pretty steep deceleration at the midpoint and that's just like very strong global macro backdrop, potential increase in demand for the U.S. and after normalizing for hardware potentially even growth lower than inflation. So, I'm wondering one, if I'm missing something there and two, were there any sort of extraordinary demand drivers in 2017? You mentioned tough comps but it is a growing business that may not be expected to repeat in 2018.","Jason Liberty","Yes, so first the impact from Pullmantur was 125 to 150 basis points in our '17 yields. So yes, 2.5% is lower than your 4.5%. But I don\u2019t think we look at this at all as deceleration. I think we look at this as a compounding off of a very strong 2017. I think the thing to keep in mind on the yield side is that your averaging up and averaging down as that business is coming on and I think as we pointed out through the course of all of last year you pretty much had everything on the ledger outside of Korea and the Hurricanes walking your way and that is not a typical year, its typically we talked about in the past like a stock portfolio of products in markets that you do better as expected and sometimes not as expected but in a given year. And I think again the acceleration that we saw in 2017, and not for that acceleration in the fourth quarter your yields would have been closer to the midpoint of 3.","Michael Bayley","David its Mike, I would just like to add that contrary to deceleration on demand drivers I think what we've seen is an acceleration of new to cruise coming to our brands and we feel pretty good about the kind of results that we are generating with our new to cruise strategy that we started to execute a couple of years ago. So, we are seeing a very good improvement in that segment.","Unidentified Analyst","And as a follow-up I wanted to know, it sounds like you might be pulling the curve back a little bit year possibly but I was also wondering part of the double-double program was installing a price integrity, program on short-term discounting. Now that double-double's been achieved are your willing to revisit that policy at all going forward?","Richard Fain","Absolutely not, and I'm glad you asked, because the -- remember as we kept emphasizing, the double-double wasn't to be a finite period of time it was -- help galvanize everybody in the company to work in a certain direction. And the price integrity program was a part of that and we think the benefit keeps growing over time. So, the price integrity program has been a big success for us. We've been fairly religious about executing against it, and we continue to expect to do that.","Michael Bayley","Just to add one more point to this on the price integrity, we introduced several months ago nonrefundable deposit pricing program for the Royal brand and that has proven to be also very successful for us. So, we have a significant percentage of our 18 bookings are in this non-refundable category which means that we will see significantly less share in our bookings as we move through the calendar year for '18 and then to '19.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian of Citi.","Greg Badishkanian","I think did you mentioned that during way price was also up during that same period and then bookings you said were up.","Jason Liberty","That\u2019s correct, we are up on both a rate and volume basis.","Greg Badishkanian","And for 2019, I don\u2019t know if it's too early to ask this but how that looks, how much you\u2019re typically booked at this point and particularly as it relates to Richard's comment that he doesn\u2019t expect the booking curve to be as lengthen as it was coming into this year a nice surprise for your last two years, but are really well booked for 2019. ","Jason Liberty","So how you started off was correct that it is too early to talk about 2019. But I think what I would say is, is obviously with assets like Symphony of the Seas coming in or full year of that ship edge coming in, there is a lot of excitement and demand for those assets which have a strong part of our 2019 picture. ","Michael Bayley","Great just to add to that to Jason's points, we also opened deployment for Royal Caribbean International for 2019 four months earlier than we typically do. So, the small relatively small number but our book position for 2019 versus 2018 same time last year is significantly further ahead but there aren't very small base numbers because we open so much early for '19. ","Richard Fain","And Craig I just like to follow up on the question of the booking curve. Because one of the things I like to emphasize is, we really determine what the booking curve is, it's really our revenue managers who decided whether they want to take more bookings now or save their powder for later on. And they are making a decision, Michael at least or Larry have to choose exactly how they want to ramp up. ","And probably I don\u2019t want to give the impression that the bookings are so strong, that the booking curve got longer out, it's really looking at all the factors our people felt that it should be a longer-term booking curve. And my guess is that next year, even if it\u2019s a stronger year, they will want a slightly shorter booking curve but that\u2019s a decision we make rather than something that is determined based simply on there is enough demand and so we book up ahead. So, if at the end of this year, we actually end up saying we want or we have fewer bookings for the following year but at higher prices, that wouldn\u2019t be necessarily a negative sign. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. ","Patrick Scholes","My question concerns your various regions, if you think about in relation to what you gave for your net yield guidance, where would you place your various geographic regions, what would be at the higher end of the range, what would be at the lower end of the range?","Jason Liberty","We don\u2019t obviously provide right yield guidance by market but I think some of the things that you would have heard in my remarks is strong demand from North America on both sides of the Atlantic, so meaning effetely Europe and on North American products seems to have very strong yield trend but overall, we're expecting yield improvement in our core products. ","Patrick Scholes","Okay fair enough and then as we think about 2018 as the year progresses, how should we think about the net yield growth candace by quarter. ","Jason Liberty","Also as I comment on, the expectation is that Q1 and Q4 yields will be higher than in Q2 and Q3 yields and some of that is as comparable to our yield growth in the second quarter of last year was about 11% that quarter had Easter in it this year Q1 has Easter in it so there is some of those structural elements of it but that's the expectation is that it's effectively a smiley face fine Q1 and Q4 and lower than Q1 and Q4 for Q2 and Q3. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","Can you give us the first quarter yield guidance excluding the benefits of the drydock?","Jason Liberty","We don\u2019t give that specific breakdown Jared in terms of what's -- there is lots of things that are driving the differential in the quarter but certainly one of the drivers we had called out was that coming from the drydocks which has already APCDs in a rolling yielding period. ","Jared Shojaian","Okay so let me try asking it for the full-year than of the 2.5% yield guide can you just tell us how much of that is coming from same ship yield growth and then maybe how much is new tonnage related or anything else?","Jason Liberty","It's about half and half so half is coming from the new hardware changes for the year and the other half is coming from like for like business improvements.","Jared Shojaian","And then do you expect your yields to be up in every single quarter this year and would you expect yields to be up in every single geography as well?","Jason Liberty","I'm not going to break it down by geography but we do expect our yields to be up in each quarter this year.","Jared Shojaian","And then just one quick last one for me. If the higher CapEx guidance is that just the function of the weaker dollar and I know this is a record CapEx year do you expect to be free cash flow positive this year just looking at up cash and CapEx and would you still buyback stock regardless.","Jason Liberty","So, the main driver on the CapEx increase is the weaker dollar and I think as it relates to share repurchase or just returning capital to shareholders the more of the guide for us is maintaining our net-debt-to-EBITDA on staying kind of within the 3 to 3.5 zone and so points that are lower than that will be opportunity to lever above and beyond any additional free cash flow that we generate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva of Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","Congratulations on a great end of 2017 and that will double. I had one question which I never thought I would be the one to ask. Ships ex-China you've reduced capacity there but there seems to be continued reduction in price including when we compare to the post South Korean ban or advisory. Is that because capacity continues to be absorbed, is there anything structural that we can look forward to including more divide the business that could change that trend?","Michael Bayley","Capacity is down for the industry in China overall which I think for first year and then number of years the capacity is down. Capacity for Royal of us is down probably because we move Mariner slightly early than we had originally planned to put it until the show market but we are not seeing pricing down for our product in China, in fact current book position contracted cash down is significantly stronger than the previous year. ","So not quite sure what comparables you are looking at in terms of pricing, it could be maybe the -- I don\u2019t know but it could be contracted pricing before the Korean situation, which certainly was higher before the South Korea situation hit, and then of course there was a lot of renegotiations last year as a result of South Korea that dropped the pricing down. But overall for Royal in '18 we are in a good book position and we are feeling pretty good about where market is going, of course it's China. So, every year China is a gifted that gives, so we were always aware of that but it's currently looking quite good in China.","Assia Georgieva","And again, that is not that market that I find to be the most transparent of all the ones that I\u2026","Michael Bayley","Exactly.","Assia Georgieva","And you are giving me a very good Segway and maybe I can ask Jason so, Mariner is going to go through what I seem to think is 36 stages, right out of the drydock before it enters the Caribbean and that is going to affect Q2 we also have pursuit being in drydock. Should we expect similarly to Q1 to have a decline in APCDs and the higher cost level because of those two pretty significant drydocks?","Michael Bayley","Yes, the Mariner is of other drydocks that are going on but the fewer APCDs are relative to the absolute cost is a key driver for the cost increase in the first quarter as well as you know Richard's comments around timing of sales and marketing activities and those type of things.","Assia Georgieva","And again, to some extent having Mariner out and in drydock should that help yield if you are looking at the same store basis Q2 '18 versus Q2 '17 which was a fantastic quarter. Do you think that Mariner being out of service in Q2 is helping yields somewhat this year because it's another vessel?","Jason Liberty","Yes, it helps a little but it's not going to be the main driver of yield growth for sure. As I said most of the yield growth was coming from hardware and like for like improvement.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin Farley","I know you have addressed a lot of questions about the guidance and how things are shaping often. Maybe I'll just ask sort of one more clarification, not because we are picking up on weakness I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case but just maybe to address the concern. Can you comment on whether bookings for the Caribbean during WAVE you said overall bookings have been up in price and volume, is that the case for the Caribbean specifically? Or is the situation just that you have so much [indiscernible] maybe it can't be up in volume but maybe that will be helpful for people to hear?","Jason Liberty","We are not looking to give commentary specifically product by product but we are -- as I have said in my commentary we are quite encouraged in terms of the booking volumes in pricing across our core products and I think to your latter point Robin that\u2019s exactly right as our need is less overall and so if you are hearing some of that noise, some of that is volume need that is less and also potentially sourcing from other markets.","But I just want to add, I mean, I think as Michael commented, I mean, we're feeling positive about the Caribbean and we appreciate that there might be some channel check concern that\u2019s out there. Our trading overall is just doing quite positive. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman of Wedbush Securities. ","James Hardiman","I guess the feeling to answer to this is either really difficult or really early but is there any evidence whatsoever that the recent tax cuts are going to stimulate demand from your customers, if you talk to the various travel agents, is there anything that\u2019s showing up there, that would be helpful. ","Richard Fain","Hi James, nothing really but certainly we feel in the sense of the consumer confidence is in a really good place and we feel that really globally across many markets but that\u2019s just the confidence that I think is coming through in people's vacation decisions and how they are buying up products. But nothing directly related to tax cuts. ","James Hardiman","Got it and then secondly here, obviously the dollars weakens pretty meaningfully over the course of while but certainly over the course of the last month, do you think that could potentially be an on board benefit for you, jog our memories here, your Europe customers are flexing for the most part in U.S. dollars and that should in theory help and over a number of years we were worried about the dollar going in the other direction help us understand that the potential impact of the dollar weakening here. ","Michael Bayley","James its Michael, I think that\u2019s right, it's a great point and its correct. I think as the dollar is strong then we see a little bit more softness in the international on both spend and as the dollar weakens we see a little bit more strength but it has no material impact to the American customer. So that\u2019s right we will see an uplift because of that. ","James Hardiman","Got it and then I guess lastly from me, Richard you have some comments in the preamble about net cruise cost and how the timing of cost doesn\u2019t necessarily sync up with expenses. May be dig in a little bit more on that, help me understand the one and half to two for 2018 on top of about 2% growth in 2017. Is the point that is out of line with what the normal is or is the point that that\u2019s the new normal. And I guess as we look forward, should we expect after some really fantastic years, where cost was down in some instances. Is this more sort of the normal in terms of what we would expect and you touched on the new fleet upgrade program, does that play any role in 2018 long-term in terms of the net results. ","Richard Fain","No that wasn\u2019t what I intended to convey. I think rather than say that that cost was likely to be higher, it was likely costs were likely to be bumpier, I think that\u2019s a theme that we had before, people look at the fourth quarter and the first quarter and I think my comments were specifically focusing on the quarter to quarter type numbers. And cost is bumpier whether we do a drydock or we do a special bonus for our employees or whatever it is, it will distort particularly when you look at individual quarters and I think overall, we've continued I think, we've got a very good culture at a stage of people being careful about those costs but not so much being obsessed if saving money is going to cost us in revenue. So, I wasn\u2019t trying to communicate anything other than it was bumpier and I think I was mostly focusing on a relatively high number for the quarter both in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter.","Michael Bayley","And again, just add to that I think just to keep in mind that it's now been several quarters where we had capacity declines and really now as we start getting into the back half of this year we're kind of again in that posture where we can take advantage of economy to scale as capacity improves which has been kind of one of our levers on cost management.","James Hardiman","Well let me ask you this way if I may. You had a couple of years there where net cruise cost were down 60 basis points, last year it was up 200 basis points. I'm struggling with what the normal cost increase that is that we should think about it. Is it closer to that minus 60 or closer to the plus 200?","Michael Bayley","So, I'm not going to guide for '19 and '20 but I would say is that, I think we expect to behave and we've installed a culture to behave similar to how we imagined cost over the past several years. So, we don\u2019t think '17 is a reflection or '18 is a reflection. We look at the period as continuing to effectively managing our cost and a lot of that again comes from taking advantage of innovation and taking advantage of scale as we manage cost in the forward-looking period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet.","Harry Curtis","In your comments you referenced the acceleration of new-to-cruise strategy and the increase in your technology spend impacting 2019. My question pertains to the list in supply growth in 2019 and to what degree does this incremental tax spend focus on new-to-cruise, how does that help you get ahead of this incremental capacity coming in 2019 and what else are you planning to get ahead of it?","Michael Bayley","We've been shifting marketing investment, marketing, organization and expertise gradually an increasingly more aggressively over the past few years towards the different channel in terms of moving more digital and traditional and certainly we've seen the results of that in terms of the growth of our new-to-cruise customers coming to the brand so we are continuing on that journey. ","So in terms of marketing investment more and more if our marketing dollars are going towards that channel rather than traditional and then off course our focus on social media and our whole integration in terms of our organization and our product into this kind of digital universe is going to be massively accelerated by Excalibur which really is going to take us to into the future and so we are quite excited about what Excalibur will deliver for our customers and for our business over the coming years so it's really part of the overall strategy that we have in place. ","In terms of '19 overall with regard to capacity obviously we have been -- we are planning for the future and we have been looking at '19 and '20 for some time so we have the benefit of a very large and maturing global infrastructure. So that's one of the benefits that we believe we have overall competition in terms of our global footprint. And so, a lot of that capacity will be spread across our brands across our markets and most importantly across segments which is where we come back to our focus on new to cruise.","Harry Curtis","Do you feel like you need to lift your marketing budget ahead of the capacity increase in 2019?","Michael Bayley","You know what's interesting about the marketing is that digital is a lot more accurate than we believed in traditional. And so, we have a significant marketing budget and investment that\u2019s pretty much related to our capacity and increasing capacity but what we are seeing is an improvement in the efficiency of that marketing investment over time because of digital, because it's a lot easier to track and understand the results that you are generating through digital versus traditional. So, I think it's yes, we are investing more in our marketing and yes, we are investing more as we look into the future but we are also seeing an improvement in the efficiency of that investment.","Harry Curtis","And then a quick one for Jason. The 80 million in the thank you-thank you, was any of that realized or expensed in the fourth quarter. If not, how do you see it being expensed by progressively throughout 2018?","Jason Liberty","So, some of was going to '17 and then most of it is a three-year grant that investor over the three years so it really spreads itself through '18, '19 and '20 but there are costs related in Q4 and the forward-looking periods.","Harry Curtis","And then the fourth quarter can you give us a sense of how large those costs were?","Jason Liberty","No, no.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jaime Katz with Morningstar.","Jaime Katz","I'm curious how you guys are thinking about share re-purchases versus dividend given the run up in share price over the last year and whether you feel there is a more tactical road this year on reallocating capital in the year ahead?","Jason Liberty","I think our objective very much remains the same as we are going to continue to be opportunistic in repurchasing shares. We have over a couple of 100 million left in our share repurchase program but our point of view is to do it opportunistically over the period. But we do continue to believe that there should be a mix between our share repurchase and dividends.","Jaime Katz","And then can you just remind me, I think in the past you have talked a bit about on asset disposals and that the capacity growth that you guys have given does not include asset disposals. Do you have an idea maybe what that might be if you continue to tear back a ship a year? I think you offered those numbers at the November Investor Day?","Jason Liberty","Yes. That\u2019s exactly right. we have on average, sort about a ship a year, and obviously depending on the size of the ship that could make a 5200-basis points impact on the capacity, fewer growth with a period. ","Jaime Katz","Okay and then lastly is there any commentary that you guys have on how you guys are reallocating the square footage on some of the revitalization programs that you're doing, are you taking out may be, some of the retail and putting in some other more activity-based opportunities to drive that onboard spend because it seems like that\u2019s where the consumers are going. ","Jason Liberty","I would just say where we're constantly looking at, how to improve the guest experience as well as how to improve the performance of the ships on a per square foot basis. So sometimes that comes from us having cabin, sometimes that\u2019s lease more onboard revenue and many times that\u2019s just creating more fun activities for people to do whether that\u2019s in culinary or other elements, so it's not a perfect formula except that, we\u2019re just constantly revisiting it to see how we can enhance the experience and off course leave stability to enhance the yield. ","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Timothy Conder of Wells Fargo Securities. ","Timothy Conder ","Whoever wants to take these, first a couple of clarifications, Jason the double-digit that you talked through 2020, was that EPS or earnings just to clarify that and then on the new to cruise, here Michael is that new truly new to cruise is that first timers on, RCL related brands. ","Jason Liberty","So, on the first one Tim, the double-digit is earnings were obviously already at 2.5% ROIC, so our goal is to continue to improve that ROIC metric and then for our earnings per share in 2020 to be double-digit. ","Michael Bayley","Hi Tim, it's new to cruise as in new to cruise, not new to brand. ","Timothy Conder","Okay, okay and then on the capacity what I wanted to ask here is, given the emission requirements tightened further in 2020, do you see the potential for second tier players to have a greater desire for ships that yourselves, Carnival, Norwegian, may sell? Would that have a longer life of that ship to make those emission investments. So therefore, could the secondary market get hotter and we see a little bit faster retirement over the next couple of years. And then related to that, how do you see the Eastern Med potentially rebuilding over the next couple of the years and the industry going back there. ","Jason Liberty","On the used ship market, it's possible that us having ships that can fulfill many of the eco regulations can make those assets more valuable. Yes, we will see how that comes to view overtime, so it's possible at this point, I wouldn\u2019t say that a trend that\u2019s out there. ","Michael Bayley","Tim, on the Eastern Med, I think what we're seeing is kind of stabilization and there is certainly an -- it\u2019s a relatively small percentage of our total capacity, although in '18 we increased that number but from a small base and we are seeing a lot of the Northern European and European tour operators and returning to some of those Eastern Med destinations so with the stability, if it continues then I think we should see the Eastern Med and that coming back in the next couple of years.","Timothy Conder","Michael remind me isn\u2019t that historically been one of the higher yielding reasons somewhere to Alaska and Northern Europe. ","Michael Bayley","It's done very well for us in the past.","Michael Bayley","Okay, thank you, for your assistance with the call today and we thank you all for your participation and interest in the company. Carola will be available for any follow-ups you might have and we wish you all a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Jason Liberty. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason Liberty","Good morning. I would like to thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Rice, our Vice Chairman; Adam Goldstein, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Celebrity Cruises; and Liz Oates, our Director of Strategic Planning. During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which we have posted on our Investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, as well as a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.","Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview of the business. I will follow with a recap of our fourth quarter results and will provide an update on our business environment. Adam will provide an update on Quantum of the Seas as well as revitalization efforts. Michael will provide an update on onboard revenue and the trade, and then I will walk you through our outlook for the year. We will then open up the call for your questions. Richard?","Richard D. Fain","Thanks, Jason, and good morning everyone. As always, we welcome this opportunity to provide a little more color on our results for the last year and our perspective on the year ahead of us. Before I start however, I think I should make note of a significant occasion. This is Brian Rice's last earnings call. Brian has been an amazing partner over the last two decades. His impact on our Company and indeed on the industry has been remarkable. It's really not an exaggeration to call him the father of advanced revenue management for the cruise industry and he has helped shepherd Royal Caribbean through some very turbulent times. Brian will be surely missed, but he has crowned his career with a transition process that should be in the textbooks I know everyone here joins me in thanking Brian for his leadership and for his friendship. Brian has agreed to continue to help us on an ad-hoc basis but it won't be the same without him here every day.","Returning to the financials, it's been an interesting time in the cruise industry, and I don't have to tell you how pleased we are to see us emerging from it. Perhaps the best indicator of our strength as a company and the strength of our industry is the fact that we ended up 2013 spot on the guidance we gave at the beginning of last year. At that time, we provided guidance of $2.30 to $2.50. Then, none of us imagined that the industry would be subjected to so much negative coverage. That much bad news would threaten any industry, but our team worked hard to overcome the challenges and our final result was precisely, that's amazingly accurate, at the midpoint of that early forecast. It's a remarkable feat and I would thank all the Royal Caribbean team who worked so hard to accomplish it.","The big benefit on the revenue side came in two areas. Firstly, onboard revenue really excelled. We've invested heavily in ship revitalizations and other enhancements, and these are obviously paying off. The other pleasant surprise was the amount of late-bookings that we achieved. It provides a good omen for the future when we are able to top up the last little bits on a vessel post the sailing date. This is usually a sign of a stronger general demand and it certainly reinforces our optimism about the future.","As you know, a new year doesn't start with a clean slate. We normally begin every year with about half of our capacity already sold. This tends to buttress yields during difficult times but holds them back in good times like these. Thus the impact of the 2013 challenges is holding back the kind of yield increases we would otherwise be enjoying for 2014. The net result, we expect the year-over-year increase in yields of between 2% and 3%. The Caribbean of course is weaker due to two factors. Firstly, it's the area hardest hit by the media storm of 2013, and secondly, we have a large capacity increase here, for both the Company and the industry, of 13%.","I'd also like to take this opportunity to talk about the other steps we're taking with respect to our principal focus, improving our rates of return. To this purpose, I'll talk a little more about our brands and asset classes than we usually do when we focus on geographic markets. Fortunately for us, our newer ships have proven to be remarkably popular amongst the travelling public and amongst travel agents. Our Oasis class ships for Royal Caribbean International and our Solstice class ships for Celebrity are simply the best in their competitive set. They are proving to be not only popular but reliable projects throughout this period. I remain in awe of our new building teams and our management teams who have created such powerful ships. Looking forward, our current focus is to take advantage of this amazing hardware, particularly these newer ships, while at the same time divesting or fixing the returns from underperforming assets.","Looking at the opportunities by brand, I'll start with the Royal Caribbean International which has continued to be our strongest brand even in this period. Of course this is where we have made our greatest investments, and because of its size and its exceptional hardware, this is where we have some of our greatest opportunity. Celebrity has been undergoing a dramatic shift in its operations and in its marketing and this shift really seems to be working very well indeed. Its yields have shown strong growth, and its cost, significant declines. We're therefore expecting Celebrity to be a significant contributor to the 2014 improvement in investment returns. Azamara is facing uphill struggle due to market forces, but it's established an enviable reputation for delivering as amazing vacations. As a result, Azamara looks set to achieve some the highest yield improvements we have ever enjoyed in a single year.","But our biggest transformational focus is on the older vessels and on the performance of Pullmantur, our Spanish cruise operator. Here, we're making the greatest strategic changes and here we expect the greatest relative benefit. The most visible changes involve the shift to having a Latin American headquarters and the recent sale of Pullmantur's non-cruise businesses. By increasing Pullmantur's focus on Latin America and by eliminating the need to focus on its tour operations, we believe we're setting the stage for transformational improvements. Of course, the Spanish market remains key to Pullmantur's long-term success but the immediate growth in Latin America should be significant. We do expect this transformation to take some time and for 2014, the year will be a transitional year. We expect the biggest benefits of Pullmantur's changes to occur in 2015 and beyond.","In summary, we expect the big improvement this year to come from exploiting our superior hardware and improving the marketing of our already successful brands. We also see improvement coming in the results of our underperforming assets. In particular, we are setting the stage for a significant bump in the performance of Pullmantur, but I would note again that we're not anticipating that bump to happen overnight.","Taking all together, we're projecting almost a 40% increase in profitability in 2014 and that's in a year with essentially no capacity increase. This is a real testament to the strength of our brands and the people that manage them. But talking about no capacity in 2014 reminds me to comment on what I believe will be one of the most impactful events this year, and that is the delivery of Quantum of the Seas. Unfortunately, she won't deliver until near the end of the year but the buzz is already very strong and we haven't even finished disclosing all of her sexy features. The introductory video was an absolute home run but we have a few more aspects of the ship's design that we will be rolling out over the coming months. We believe these innovations will excite the public as much as the ones we've already disclosed. This ship will be another game changer for our Company and indeed for our industry.","Interestingly, we are experiencing a phenomenon or Quantum similar to what we saw prior to delivery of Oasis. People are speculating about our innovations and they are doing so in terms of improved or expanded features from our existing ships. There's a natural tendency to start with the innovative features people already know and assume that the new ships builds on those features. In fact, I'm happy to say that they will be surprised. As we've done with our radically new designs in the past, Quantum is a totally new type of vessel. She'll deliver a fantastic new experience in a way that is novel and exciting. Truly, she is a quantum leap. And with her new features and her energy efficiencies, she'll generate a fantastic return on our investment.","With that, I'm pleased to turn it back to Jason who will give you more detail on the figures. Jason?","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Richard. Before we get into our operating results, I would like to mention that as expected and communicated on our previous calls, we have incurred some restructuring and related costs associated with our various profitability initiatives. These totaled $43 million in the fourth quarter and $56.9 million for the full year. These changes relate mainly to the pending sale of Pullmantur\u2019s non-core businesses and the previously noted restructuring and consolidation of parts of our global operation. As we previously mentioned, accounting rules dictate the timing of when we take these charges, so we expect to incur an additional $23 million in 2014. This will all be detailed in our 10-K which will be filed in late February.","So our profitability improvement initiative was an ongoing program that will continue, so we do not anticipate any additional restructuring charges beyond what has already been identified. Now, I would like to talk to you about our operating results. So that you can better understand our operating performance relative to our prior guidance, I have included Pullmantur's non-core businesses during the 2013 numbers. Unless I state differently, all metrics will be on a constant currency basis.","Now let's look at our fourth quarter results which I have summarized on Slide 2. For the quarter, we have generated net income of $0.23 per share, which exceeded the top end of the range we provided on our October call by $0.03. Net revenue yield increased 3.8% for the quarter, which was significantly better than our guidance of an increase of 2% to 3%. Continued strength on European and Asian sailings coupled with another stellar onboard revenue performance drove the majority of the improvement and more than offset a slight decline in Caribbean yields. Net cruise cost excluding fuel were up 1.8% for the quarter, which was in line with the guidance.","I will now discuss full year results, which we have summarised on Slide 3. Yields increased 3.2%. Yields were flat in the Caribbean and were up about 8% in Europe. We also generated yield growth from itineraries in Asia despite significant capacity growth and some of our itinerary modifications resulting from the ongoing dispute between China and Japan. Benefits from our ship revitalization program, packaging initiatives as well as short cruise enhancements drove a 7.6% improvement in onboard revenue. Net cruise cost excluding fuel increased 1.8%, which was in line with prior guidance and 70 basis points better than the midpoint of our January guidance. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.40, which was spot on the midpoint of our January guidance.","Now, I would like to update you on what we are seeing in the demand environment. Booking activities during the fourth quarter was consistent with historical levels. As you can see on Slide 4, we entered 2014 in a very strong booked position with 5% more revenue on the books as compared to same time last year. The first week of WAVE was somewhat softer than last year as much of North America was weathering a polar vortex. While cold winter typically means increased demand for Caribbean sailing, the severity of the weather kept people indoors and clearly resulted in lower bookings for several days. Demand was softest out of the Northeast and Midwest but stronger in the warmer markets. Excluding the first week, demand has been more typical of WAVE level.","We have made a number of deployment changes this year, so I will walk you through the trend we are experiencing by product which we have summarized on Slide 5. Our Caribbean capacity in 2014 will be up 13% from 2013 while also representing 40% of our inventory which was similar to 2010 level. Currently our book load factors and rates for the Caribbean are lower than same time last year and we expect yields for 2014 to be down for the Caribbean at low single digit. In the Caribbean, we are generally seeing demand and pricing hold up better for long and more expensive itineraries than we are for shorter itineraries.","Europe will account for 22% of our capacity this year, which is a 17% reduction from last year. As of okay, our book load factors and APDs are significantly higher than same time last year and we are expecting another year of significant yield improvement in Europe and expect yields to surpass pre-recessionary levels. Asia-Pacific will account for 12% of our capacity. Both our book load factors and APDs remained ahead of same time last year in spite of a 12% increase in capacity. We expect yields to be up nicely for our Asia-Pacific itineraries.","The remaining 20% of our inventory is spread across a number of itineraries. In aggregate, these itineraries are booked ahead of same time last year, above rate and volume, and we expect yields to be slightly up. In aggregate, our APDs are up in all four quarters, load factors are flat in the first quarter but are up in Q2, Q3, and Q4. Capacity is expected to be at 1.7% for the year. This is driven mainly by normal changes like [drive-out] (ph).","Now, I would ask Adam to give you an update on Quantum revitalization program and Michael to provide an update on onboard and the trade. Adam?","Adam M. Goldstein","Thank you, Jason. Having worked with Brian, as Richard has, for over 20 years, I would like to add my appreciation and wish Brian all the best in the future. Richard and Jason have summarised the current status of the WAVE booking period and I will not add further commentary other than to say, we are highly focused on leveraging our strength in branding, distribution and product delivery over the Caribbean and also around the globe.","Richard briefly mentioned this year's arrival of Quantum of the Seas. While Quantum was meant to be my topic for today, his possible enthusiasm is understandable. For all of us who collectively undertook the daunting task of creating a class of ship that would follow Oasis class, we are more than anxious to take delivery and begin operation of Quantum of the Seas. As the Quantum class project has unfolded, with the exception of sheer size, we have thought to push the boundaries of what can make a 21st century cruise-ship both more effective for our guests and more efficient for our shareholders. We have revealed the principal physical amenities of this ship, 270, the Seaplex, the North Star and RipCord by iFLY. For us, four of those wild features are unprecedented on the water. In addition, we have announced we will perform the hit musical Mamma Mia! for our guests.","We have not yet said much of anything about our culinary offerings, our other entertainment options, or our technological capabilities. We are equally excited about these elements of our product delivery. We are also enthusiastically looking forward to the fuel efficiency in Quantum class ship and to a variety of back of the house efficiencies that will contribute to the ship's return on investment.","We wish we could announce that the ship will be ready 10 months early, but the reality is we will take delivery of Quantum as scheduled in October, an introducer in South Hampton, England and then in the New York area in October and November. We are very pleased with the progress of the ship's construction in Germany and with the current load factor and APDs at this stage of the booking curve.","Moving now to the topic of revenue management, last fall we significantly upgraded the manner in which we present our prices and promotions to the market. We have increased the visibility, logic and value of our pricing to consumers and travel agents. For example, there is greater visibility of our offers in our automated booking tools and on our brand website. Also, promotional values are applied instantly on guest reservation rather than requiring subsequent manual processing.","Simultaneously, we have enhanced the back-of-house efficiency of our pricing administration. While some of the benefits of this new approach show how to measure in the short-term, we have already seen measurable and significant revenue benefit in certain respects.","Before I turn it over to Michael, I will give a quick update on a topic I mentioned on the last call, which is the revitalization of our five Voyager class ships. The first to undergo revitalization is Navigator of the Seas. She is currently in the Bahamas for the project and we are expecting a completely successful and exciting result on her scheduled return to her Galveston Texas home. As a result of the project, Navigator will have more suite and stateroom type and a refresh of the existing staterooms and suites. She will have multiple new specialty restaurants, a FlowRider surf machine, new shops and bars, and multiple technology enhancements including the industry's first virtual balcony. We expect to revitalize the other four Voyager class ships over the next several years. Michael?","Michael W. Bayley","Thank you, Adam, and good morning everyone. As Jason mentioned, onboard revenue performance in 2013 has been particularly strong with constant currency yields up 7.6 for the full-year and 8% for the fourth quarter. We have now seen year-over-year onboard revenue growth for eight constructive quarters. As we look forward into 2014, we feel optimistic about the continuation of this strong performance.","As you know, we have invested in our onboard revenue programs for a number of years and these investments are generating healthy returns. We have added over 40 specialty restaurants over the past four years and have continued to invest in the refreshing and updating of our casino technology, and on certain vessels we have upgraded our casino footprint in response to demand from source market. We continue to invest in our pre-cruise capabilities and today you can book our shore excursions, speciality dinings, spa appointments, beverage packages and packages generally, and over the past 12 montrhs, we have significantly rationalised our tour offering and improved the quality of our tour product.","At Celebrity cruises for example, we added dedicated destination concierges onboard each of our ships whose focus is to create branded and segmented tours, targeted to our higher value guests and this is beginning to generate incremental revenue. Our focus on technology has allowed us to expand our bandwidth while reducing cost of increasing our revenue. Additionally, in 2014, Oasis of the Seas, Allure of the Seas, and Quantum of the Seas will lead the industry with high-speed satellite delivered broadband service on their Caribbean sailings commencing later this year.","When we look at our onboard revenue by key revenue stream, source market and product, it's really a positive news story across the board. 2013 was a very rewarding year for onboard revenue as all of the investments into the development of our revenue streams materialized. We feel confident about what we have built for our customers as we see the increased demand for these products and services realised.","I'd like to also make a few comments regarding our distribution channels. Our guests have their choice of booking charnel and we will continue to provide every opportunity for them to select the channel that best suits their needs. But by far the most important channel are our trade partners. Travel agencies continue to be the primary and most important source of sales for our ships. The travel agent network is an efficient distribution model for our business and we believe in the value of this channel, so we invest heavily in maintaining strong relationships with our travel partners across the world. To accomplish this goal, we have always maintained a holistic approach to our relationship through training, support, technology, integrated promotions, and marketing partnerships.","We have been consistent in our support to this channel through good times and bad, formally by Celebrity Cruises' commitment and Royal Caribbean International's Loyal to You Always programs, and informally through trade friendly promotions. We have invested significantly more year-over-year in consumer marketing, trade co-op, and trade support staff. We provide highly trained, brand dedicated sales representatives, we serve the role of a trusted advisor to our travel partners to grow their business with ours. We also provide award-winning customer service representatives, call centers, and online training tools.","We were pleased in December when Travel Weekly, one of the most influential travel agent publications in the United States, held their Travel Agent Readers Choice Awards and we received multiple honors. Royal Caribbean International was voted best cruise line overall, best in sales and service, best domestic cruise line, best cruise line in the Caribbean, and Allure of the Seas was voted the best overall individual cruiseship. Celebrity Cruises was voted by Travel Agent Readers, the best premium cruise line, the cruise line in Europe, and Celebrity Reflection was awarded the best premium ship award.","Globally, we are the recipient of multiple trade awards across the markets we operate in. We believe this demonstrates the strength of our brand with our travel partners. In the past, present and future, our fortunes are intertwined and we will continue to strengthen our relationship with our trade partners.","With that, I will turn the call back to Jason.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Michael. As a quick correction to one of my previous statements, the Caribbean will represent 46% of our capacity in 2014. Taking into account all we have just told you, I would now like to take you through our guidance for 2014. If you turn to Slide 6, you will see our initial guidance for next year, for this year. Because we expect to close soon on the sale of Pullmantur's non-core businesses, I have excluded these businesses in the guidance metrics. Thus, our guidance metrics are on an apples-to-apples comparison.","Net yields are expected to increase between 2% and 3% for the full year. We expect yields to be slightly down in the Caribbean but we expect to more than offset this with double-digit yield improvement in Europe and further yield improvements in Asia-Pacific and Alaska. In July we communicated that we expected our net cruise cost excluding fuel for 2014 to be better than flat. We remain committed to this target in 2014 despite inflationary pressures, rising insurance costs as well as continued investment in our product offering and marketing.","We have included $944 million of fuel expense for the year and we are 55% hedged. Net of our hedges, a 10% change in fuel prices equates to about $41 million for the year. At today's prices, the impact from our swap is $57 million lower than it was in 2013. Based on current fuel prices and current exchange rates, we expect earnings per share to be between $3.20 and $3.40 for the year.","On Slide 7, we have recapped our guidance for the first quarter. Net yields are expected to be approximately flat. The first quarter of 2013 was a difficult comparable as yields were the highest since the turn of the century millennial cruises in 2000. We also didn't start to feel the effect of the negative industry publicity until after the first quarter.","Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to increase 2% to 3% driven mainly by the timing of some maintenance cost and the full year effect of cost enhancements that were implemented after Q1 of 2013. Fuel expenses are expected to be $742 million for the quarter and we expect adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.20 and $0.30 for the quarter.","With that, I will ask the operator, Holly, to open the call for question-and-answer session. Holly?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from the line of Gregory Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory Badishkanian - Citi","Few questions just on the initial WAVE season and how that's going. So last year, it was a phenomenally strong WAVE, I think your bookings were up like 20% during January, and you mentioned that this year it's typical. So how should we think about year-over-year bookings this January? And then I know comparison has got a lot easier throughout the year, when do they particularly \u2013 they are particularly easy?","Jason Liberty","This is Jason. I think in describing the typical WAVE, it's really kind of how it's played out over the past several years. I would not describe it to be as strong as it was in 2012, but it's not far off those levels \u2013 I'm sorry by 2013. And then as it relates to, I think the comparable really becomes easier going into the second quarter, but all the negative industry media really kind of leagued throughout the year but really didn't take effect until the second quarter in terms of our yields.","Gregory Badishkanian - Citi","Okay, that's very helpful. And then the cold weather, I know it hurt you initially. Does it end up helping just because people are cooked in and they would like to take a cruise, when do you think that starts helping?","Adam M. Goldstein","It's Adam. Obviously we are continuing to root for cold weather and we are seeing what is more or less an endless stretch of it, and our general sense based on history is that that should be relatively helpful to us. But as Jason I believe mentioned earlier on in his comments, the weather was so nasty that it actually affected the first week of the WAVE in a negative way. So it still stands to reason that if there this cold snap goes on and on and on, people will eventually be more inclined to have something on the books in the warmer climate than what they are experiencing at home.","Gregory Badishkanian - Citi","That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Harry Curtis, Nomura Securities.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities","I had two quick questions. The first question is that in 2013, your net cruise costs were up 1.8% and you've guided for relatively flat for this year. Can you give us a sense of where you're actually seeing the savings?","Jason Liberty","This is Jason. The saving efforts that we have put forth, we kind of describe them as, they are not 10 things, they are really a thousand little things and a lot of it has been centered around back-office, global restructuring efforts, but also a series of benchmarking efforts we did on the ships. I think they really did not affect the customer experience but where we saw opportunities for savings. But I wish I could say it's three things but it's really a collective effort of our management team in the organization to find savings.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities","But it seems like you're in the early innings. How long is this process likely to go on and if some of the competitor brands, these cost savings can be realized over multiple years?","Jason Liberty","I wouldn't describe it as really early innings, I think we look at this as a journey, as we identify other profitability opportunities, we're certainly realizing them. But additionally I think what we're looking to do is as we grow, to ensure we realize this scale going forward.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities","Okay, then quickly moving to the balance sheet, it's possible that your leverage ratio net of cash could be down to roughly the low 3s multiple by the end of this year. What is your target and once you're there, what do you plan to do with your free cash?","Jason Liberty","I think in terms of end cash, our net debt-to-EBITDA numbers, I think there are some components or the commitments that are factored in, but our goal is to really get to investment grade of 3.75 times cash flow and I think as cash becomes available that then kind of drives to be a Board decision on what's the best way to allocate capital.","Richard D. Fain","And I'll just add a comment on that. I think we've shown, recently increased the dividend rate, I think we are feeling more comfortable that we are moving quickly towards investment grade. The objective is not to continue to make that an A rated company or anything like that, and so I think we have the opportunity, given the very high cash flow from our business, to also use that money to give back to shareholders.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Securities","Okay, has the Board touched on the topic of share repurchase?","Richard D. Fain","Of course we look at all those kinds of things and the Board has talked about it, but I think we don't announce anything until we've actually made a decision and we have announced the decisions we made to date.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Regarding your market overview, I just wondered if you could give us some more color about the strength you're seeing in Europe and Asia and actually especially Europe, is that across all of your European businesses, is it mainly U.S. sourced, just wondering if you could parse through that for us?","Michael W. Bayley","It's Michael. You're referring to Europe as a source market or Europe as a destination?","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","That's what I'm asking you, as you said that you're seeing strength in your European business, so I was wondering if you could give us some more granular color behind that.","Michael W. Bayley","Yes, I think our European products and brands are seeing strong demand from the North American market, which is very positive. I think a part of that is because of the stability we're seeing with the air cost and a lot of the programs that we initiated in 2013, with our ChoiceAir program, which is a way of better positioning air earlier on in the transaction with our customers which allows them to purchase the package at an earlier period. So I think we're seeing good demand from North America for European products.","Out of the European markets, again I think we're seeing very good overall demand coming in from the European markets for our various brands and products. So I think it's kind of a good new story overall for Europe. I mean part of it obviously is capacity, because capacity is down for the industry and somewhat for the brand. So it's a combination of these different factors I think all coming into play. But overall, it's very positive story.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Okay, that's helpful, thank you. And Jason, can you help us out as we think about our models going forward, and obviously our own models aren't going to be apples-to-apples, so are you going to provide us with some performance for net yields and costs or is there some kind of rule of thumb that we can use?","Jason Liberty","Sure. Are you talking more in terms of\u2026","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Our models are going to \u2013 we haven't \u2013 historically you're going to include Pullmantur and now we're going to be growing off of non\u2026","Jason Liberty","If you actually look, I think it's on the last couple of pages of the press release, that we actually breakdown our business within the [indiscernible] \u2013 they're not referring to Pullmantur.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","That refers to past quarter but are you going to give us performance for other quarters, so we know how to model throughout 2014?","Jason Liberty","Yes, we will.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","And that will be in your Q?","Jason Liberty","That will be in the K.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","In the K, okay. So in the K, of course. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","I have a similar question on Europe and Asia to follow on Felicia's, if you could just fill that part on Asia, how that is picking up? In the past you have cited the ongoing issues between Japan and China as a second in area, but if you could just give us a little more color where you're seeing that strength from and what is turning there? And then late-bookings, particularly could you delve a little bit more into what's going on here from the U.S. sourced passengers for the Caribbean here on the late bookings? And then finally, net yields, what are your expectations, Jason, that are built into the 2014 guidance for the onboard component of net yields?","Adam M. Goldstein","It's Adam. First of all on Asia, an example that Michael was saying about Europe, so when we speak about Asia, we're talking about really the whole Asia through Australia area. I believe Jason mentioned earlier that it's about 12% of our capacity in total for that whole region. So it's obviously still a relatively small but increasingly meaningful portion of what we do. And we are generally pleased with how things went last year and with the outlook for this year for the Asia-Pacific region. Clearly the institution, what they expect in a Voyager class ship or the Royal Caribbean brand in China went well in 2013. It was received well, as Voyager of the Seas has been before it, I'm talking about Mariner of the Seas. So the products and services that we're delivering to that market which is clearly in its infancy seem to go on the right direction. There is still a lot of research and development involved in that effort.","And then on the Australian side of the equation, which is where most of the ships are at the moment under the southern summer, it's a robust market. I mean notwithstanding that quite a lot of capacity has gone there and the Australian dollar has been weaker off late, it's still a very solid cruise market for our brands. And so when you put the two together, Asia and Australia, we are pleased with the outlook but we have a lot of work to do, and as you mentioned, the Japan-China dispute is still a wildcard that we're having to work our way around. I mean we wish we could know for sure that we could deliver all the Japanese ports on the itineraries as we intend them. We weren't able to do that last year, and at the moment, we are not planning on being able to do them this year, but we're certainly open to a positive trend in that relationship.","I think you were also asking about later bookings in the U.S. Obviously in the fourth quarter, we were generally pleased with late-bookings and that helped us to exceed our yield guidance for the quarter fairly substantially. A good amount of those late bookings actually were for European and Asian products, it wasn't just what was going on in the U.S. and the Caribbean, and given that we're in the beginning of the WAVE period and the beginning of the first quarter, we can't really say by definition what the late bookings will be for Q1, but we're certainly marketing to encourage them wherever we need them.","Michael W. Bayley","And to your question on onboard, it is actually estimated to be very similar to our overall yield guidance of approximately 2% to 3%.","Timothy Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, great. And Brian, congratulations, enjoy the increased amount of off.","Brian J. Rice","Thanks Tim.","Richard D. Fain","Tim, don't encourage him.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs","Couple of things. Could you be a little bit more specific on the expense reductions? You said that they were dozens or hundreds of them but maybe you could at least bucket them into where you are seeing the opportunities, so that we can understand them better and have a better sense for how long they could go on for and how much more opportunity? And then I think I remember that earlier this year or earlier in 2013, you did talk about some industry discounting and some promotional items, is that happening to the same degree industry-wide so far in the fourth quarter and in the WAVE season?","Jason Liberty","This is Jason. I'll take the cost one. I'll try to bucket a little bit more. I think the big chunk of it comes from our global restructuring and going kind of market by market and looking at what is costing to us to acquire guests relative to what we are getting on a revenue perspective and rationalizing that, but there's a lot of savings that happened there and that had a lot of back office element to it. There was also a lot of action looking at on a back office side, how are we doing versus on a scale perspective relative to prior periods and right-sizing some of that. And then just overall, I'd say more kind of the back of the ship opportunities that we saw, not touching at all maintenance or anything that had to do with the [indiscernible] security of the vessel, and finding opportunities to benchmark it.","Adam M. Goldstein","Steve, as it relates to promotion in the industry, I think it's been sort of a regular feature of these conversations over the years that a fundamental part of the revenue management equation is putting the right promotions in the market at the right time in the very dynamic industry environment, and I would say that discounting is definitely a part of the equation right now in the WAVE marketplace. I think all of the industry is working very hard to get load on the ships at the desirable rate.","I don't think there's anything really very different fundamentally from what we have encountered in the past or would expect during the future. I mentioned before in my comments that we have just invested significantly in our ability to do our promotions in the most effective manner possible, and that's because we know the promotions and discounts will be a regular feature of the landscape, and our goal like with anything else is to do that as well as we possibly can.","So there's not going to be \u2013 there isn't just a moment, that we set our prices and that's it, there's nothing to talk about. The travel agency community does a great job for us in navigating the promotional offers that we put out there for the benefit of the guests and all that contributes to the positive yield guidance that we have given.","Steve Kent - Goldman Sachs","So then you'd say that it hasn't improved but it hasn't gotten worse, so it's just regular normal business as the way you'd describe it from the discounting and promotions?","Adam M. Goldstein","I would say it's generally at a level that we wouldn't consider to be normal business as usual, which means that it's a very competitive affair.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley - UBS","A couple of questions. First is, with Q1 prices on the books up and the load factor flat, it sounds like you're expecting that closing Caribbean pricing to be down. So just I wondered if you could give us a little more color on how you're comfortable, is that just a Q1 issue and not a Q2 and beyond issue? And then I don't know if you can comment a little bit on Alaska, which I don't think you broke out specifically, and just from what we're hearing, I don't know if there was anything other than the polar vortex that's making Alaska not popular for bookings right now but if you can comment on that?","Adam M. Goldstein","Robin, this is Adam. I'll address your Caribbean question and then Michael can take the Alaska question. We're at a point in our first quarter where obviously the long lead time business is what we have on the books and now the question that remains is, what happens with the short-term bookings, and while they could be robust, if we're in the fourth quarter, that's not anything that we can count on, so we obviously make our most educated projection that we can in a rational way as it seems to all of us who are engaged in the revenue management effort, let's project out what our first quarter guidance will be.","Now, you have seen from the earlier commentary and from the slides that we showed during this presentation that our overall load factor position for the year is strong, and we're going to continue to do everything that we can so that it remains that way and so that we're relatively less dependent on late booking business, and to the extent that we have it, we can continue to generate high APDs from it. So structurally, our load factor situation is positive and we would expect \u2013 and so we built that into our forecasting for Q2, Q3 and Q4. For Q1, we'll just have to see how it pans out over the next few months as we do every time we have one of these calls.","Michael W. Bayley","Hi Robin, it's Michael. I'll just make a couple of comments about Alaska. I mean obviously Alaska is almost like a mini Europe in terms of its importance. It's about 5% of our total capacity. It certainly, as you know, during the high yielding period, and it's \u2013 we feel pretty good about how Alaska is booking. I mean obviously it has its puts and takes but our capacity overall is pretty much the same as it was in 2013 and our products seem to be selling at a relatively good pace. So I think we are fairly confident with how Alaska is shaping up.","Robin Farley - UBS","Okay, great. And then can you also just lastly give a little bit of color on maybe some of the areas in onboard revenues that are driving \u2013 that are the big drivers of the 8% increase?","Michael W. Bayley","I mean I think I said in my comments, that when you look at onboard revenue either by revenue stream or source market or product or brand, the story is universally good. We're seeing strength across every single revenue stream and from every single market. So the entire story is positive. There's just a general uplift that we are seeing in our onboard revenue across all of our brands. There is no one particular revenue stream that's really outshining the rest. I mean obviously different revenue streams have different relative scales of leverage, gaming, retail, et cetera, and shore excursions make up a significant portion of our revenue, and they are all really doing quite well.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of [Andrea Farris] (ph) with Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","I have two questions. My first question is that if I look at the net yields that you've delivered in each of the last five quarters you speak in every time, so I was wondering from your point of view what has driven this, has it been generally the stronger late-bookings or onboards and where could we be surprised looking forward? And then, if you could give us an update on your estimate for the impact of the ECA costs coming in next year? I think last year in the 10-K you said it would be $65 million to $70 million, but I was wondering if you've done anything on the technology side to drive an improvement here?","Adam M. Goldstein","This is Adam. As it relates to your first question on our yield performance over recent quarters, there's a factor that you mentioned, it has absolutely been relevant. First of all, as you know, we don't know what the onboard revenue will be until it happens, and based on the commentary that Michael has provided here today, you know that onboard revenue has been continually robust throughout the period that you referenced and so that has definitely contributed on a regular basis to any peaks that we've had on our revenue guidance.","And generally speaking, over the last five quarters, we've been pleased with the quality and the quantity of the late business that we've taken on, and as I just mentioned before, we can't count on that happening in the future. But we \u2013 in fact this is what we have experienced over the recent year or so.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, and on the ECA cost?","Jason Liberty","On ECA cost relative to 2014, it's pretty modest. We haven't quantified in our 10-K filing but the larger impact will really impact more 2015.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, that's what I was referring to.","Jason Liberty","We have a series of efforts, and I'm not sure if Adam, you might want to comment on the efforts we're doing on the scrubber technology, so how we address.","Adam M. Goldstein","I would just say that as we sit here in early 2014, we've been very conscious of the tougher level of [indiscernible] emissions coming-in the ECA at the beginning of next year, and so we have been engaged in a whole variety of initiatives including scrubbers, or as we would call them, advanced emission purification equipment, to mitigate particularly the burden that will come into effect next year. So as Jason said, we'll quantify that more precisely in the 10-K, at least for 2014 at this point, and it's a huge effort taking place in our Company to come up with the best mitigation technique that we can and part of that is seeing where the AEP or scrubber equipment can get us.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Richard Carter with Deutsche Bank.","Richard Carter - Deutsche Bank","Couple of questions from me. Firstly, could you just talk through what's driving the year-on-year fall in net interest costs? Should we expect this trend to continue into 2015? And then secondly, Richard, you talked about 2014 that yield guidance obviously being impacted from what you had to go through in 2013. Is it possible to give us some sort of flavor or some sort of run-by in terms of what you think yield guidance would be if you're looking at it currently, so if we were to take out the weak 2013, I mean are we looking at sort of several hundred basis points above where you set the guidance?","Jason Liberty","I'll just take in the first piece on the interest chunk, our interest expense is expected to be down somewhere between $50 million and $60 million for the year. The main drivers of that is, over the past year and a half we've \u2013 [indiscernible] of refinancings are almost $2 billion worth and our weighted average cost of that almost \u2013 overall has really jumped by about 55 basis points. As well we had about $500 million left in debt. So the combination of those things is what's driving the lower negative [carry] (ph).","Richard D. Fain","And with respect to how much better 2014 could have been if we hadn't had the impact of all the events in 2013, I'm afraid that our systems are really geared to quite sophisticated in measuring out the demand levels that do exist. It's very hard to measure what they would have been under a hypothetical scenario. And so I don't think we have an estimate of actually how much better it could have been. Obviously we think it would have been better but our focus is on given where we are today, what do we expect to happen, and this takes all that into account.","Richard Carter - Deutsche Bank","And then just finally, I think historically you've talked about capacity pricing sort of 20% premium to the sort of net yield leverage. Is that a reasonable assumption [indiscernible] in 2015 that sort of assumption or should we expect it to be a higher premium?","Richard D. Fain","Yes, I think we actually have said that historically we were \u2013 our newer ships had a 25% premium to our older vessels. Now we'd have to divide that out because much of our existing fleet is in fact newer ships today. But yes, we would assume that the newer vessels would continue to attract a nice premium, and forward bookings for Quantum certainly reinforces that.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva - Infinity Research","Couple of questions. First of all, in terms of European prices and demand, how much of that is Europe's sourced at this early point? I think in the past we have noticed that European passengers tend to book much closer in, and so I wondered if you are seeing primarily North American source trends or some indication of how the European sourced passenger is behaving?","Michael W. Bayley","This is Michael. I think we're certainly seeing very strong demand out of the North American market for the European products. Out of the European markets, we are seeing good demand. We create our own track of expectation of booking, volume and rate out of every individual market within Europe and North America for each of the brands and I think we have been, again, pleased with what we're seeing out of North America, and from the European markets, they are generally meeting our expectations.","Assia Georgieva - Infinity Research","Okay, thank you, Michael. I appreciate that. And maybe, Adam, you can help me with this. Given the large capacity increase industry-wide for the Caribbean in the summer, it would seem wide I guess in this early point in WAVE to assume possibly some future discounting. Is that something that you are already [indiscernible]?","Adam M. Goldstein","When I referred to the current situation earlier as a competitive affair, it certainly encompassed the Caribbean environment for Q2 and Q3. It's not just that we expect that that will happen, this is what is happening and these expectations are baked into our overall guidance for the year and we will [play it hard] (ph) for the business.","Jason Liberty","Holly, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of James Hardiman with Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","I hopped on a little bit late, if you already these, I apologize. I guess just real quick, Exploder of the Seas, sounds like there were some issues there, needed to come back to port, doesn't seem like a real big deal. Do you think that will end up being at all material to your first quarter?","Adam M. Goldstein","James, it's Adam. Thank you for saving the best for last. So this has been a difficult situation and both a considerable and a rare outbreak of what appears to be norovirus, because that's something that actually takes a little bit of time to confirm but most likely that is what is happening onboard Exploder disease. Very happy to say that after the initial spike in illnesses which happened on the 23rd, two days into the cruise, we have sequentially experienced far lesser numbers of guests being ill, but nevertheless it's a serious situation and we feel very badly for the guests that became ill on the ship. We are doing lots and lots of things for them, which includes compensation for the ports that they missed. But to your question, we don't expect that the impact of this event will be significant or meaningful for the Company or its results, but it is obviously meaningful to the customers who have experienced illness. So we're doing everything we can do to make the ship as clean as possible and the rest of the cruise as enjoyable as we can.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","Very helpful, that seems about right. And I guess along those lines though, if we sort of circle back to your 2% or 3% yield guidance for 2014, and just the fact that the point that you started the call out with, which was you had all these terrible events and media and yet you were still able to reach your guidance, I guess big picture, how do you think about your guidance as you're putting it together with respect to these exogenous events? I mean do you just assume that nothing is going to happen or is there some base level of the unexpected that you built into your model over and above just the base case, which is that what everybody I think is hoping for is that you have a very uneventful WAVE season and beyond, how should we think about that?","Richard D. Fain","I think it is obviously a challenge for any company doing this and I don't think that we are any different than anyone else and we try and provide a balance. So I don't think it's reasonable to assume that nothing goes wrong in the year. And I remember back to the time when having to divert a ship because of hurricane was the big kind of variable there. And so, we try and give some thought to it. But of course, when you're talking about the kind of events that we've looked to in last couple of years, those are outside of anybody's ability to even remotely predict or incorporate. So we try and be realistic but we also don't try and imagine Black Swan type things happening.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","Got it. Thanks guys and good luck this WAVE season.","Jason Liberty","Thank you for your assistance, Holly, with the call today and we thank all of you for your participation and interest in the Company. Liz will be available for any follow-ups you might have. And with that, I wish you all a great day.","Operator","Once again, we'd like to thank you for your participation in today's Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. 2013 fourth quarter earnings conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Brian Rice. You may begin.","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, Cassandra, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Ian Bailey, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides which we have posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Additionally, we will be discussing certain financial measures which are non-GAAP as defined, and the reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.","Richard will begin with his comments. I will follow with a brief recap of our results, give an update on the booking environment and our forward guidance. Adam will talk about our brands, and then we will open the call for your questions. Richard?","Richard D. Fain","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I should note that we have some comments about holding this call the morning after the Super Bowl, but I should assure you that we've checked all of our electrical connections, and we're ready to go.","As you can see from the release, the late bookings boosted our year-end results. And overall, the WAVE period has started on a nice, solid note. I really do have to apologize to Charles Dickens for stealing his words, but the title, A Tale of Two Continents simply captures our current situation too well to ignore. We're happy with the strong bookings we're seeing in the United States, but we're unhappy about the weakness we're seeing in many of the European Union countries, most notably Spain and the U.K. Even though the economies in the U.S. and in places like Germany and France still aren't very good, or aren't great, it's really the weakness in Southern Europe that is keeping our yields from truly exciting growth. I think, overall, this demonstrates the power of our brands even in a lackluster market.","I should also note that last year at this time, the Concordia tragedy caused a significant disruption in our booking patterns, and that complicates our ability to make clear comparisons. We do try and go back further to compare to previous years, but there were complications then too; and the further one goes back, the less comparable the figures become. We are, therefore, necessarily cautious in making comparisons; but overall, we're optimistic about the direction.","Of course, it's particularly disappointing to have to take such a large write-down related to Pullmantur. However, it's important to note that the write-down is purely a noncash item, and it will have no ongoing consequences looking forward. More importantly, it doesn't reflect on the admiration we feel towards our management team in Pullmantur, and they have struggled so hard and so aggressively against the headwinds of the Spanish economy. Besides working to maintain and to improve Pullmantur's performance locally, they've aggressively pursued a strategy of diversification, which is systematically and dramatically reducing their dependence on the Spanish market.","Simultaneously, we're taking advantage of the mobility that our fleet has to reduce our reliance on weaker markets, and we've done that significantly during 2010, we have the opportunity to do even more in 2014 if that seems appropriate. For example, this has been a 10% reduction of capacity in Europe and the corresponding expansion of our focus on Asia Pacific. It's particularly interesting to note how well both Australia and China have held up. Both are looking towards flat to higher yields despite really very large capacity increases. And in the case of China, that's in spite of the impact from the territorial dispute with Japan.","In addition to our focus on structural gains, we're starting to feel a bit more comfortable that already in the United States and Asia, the consumers are surging as a positive driver of yield improvement. Even in Europe, which continues to struggle with a fiscal and banking crisis, we're optimistic that the public is coming to terms with this new normal, and that the base we're laying in 2013 will bear ripe fruit in 2014 and beyond. That's part of the reason we feel so good about the order for Oasis 3, which we have recently negotiated.","Overall, I'm pleased with how we performed in 2012 given the external pressures, and I'm encouraged with the profitability improvements we are targeting for 2013. Frankly, I would probably be ebullient right now if we were experiencing the same demand levels from Europe that we are experiencing domestically. Our goal remains to improve our returns to double-digit levels despite only minimal support from the economy and to re-earn our investment-grade rating.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Brian for a more in-depth look at the numbers. Brian?","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, Richard. I'd like to begin my comments by talking about the noncash impairment charge we took in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we performed our impairment analysis of Pullmantur's goodwill, deferred tax assets and long-lived assets, and concluded that a noncash impairment charge of approximately $414 million was appropriate. As we have noted in the past, the continued deterioration of the Spanish economy, compounded by the government's austerity measures and the effects of the Costa Concordia incident, have been significant risk factors that could cause an impairment of Pullmantur's goodwill.","During the second half of the 2012, the Spanish government introduced another round of austerity measures, further impacting consumer spending. The IMF, which only a year ago was predicting a GDP growth rate for Spain of 1.8% in 2013, recently lowered their forecast to a contraction of 1.5%. And while the WAVE season is off to a promising start in most markets, we have seen a significant deterioration in demand from Spain.","All indications suggest the continued challenging operating environment in Spain for an extended period of time. This has resulted in significant changes in our plans and expectations for the brand. Accordingly, we have lowered our forecasted net operating cash flows for Pullmantur, which has negatively impacted our impairment analysis. The net result of this is a total impairment charge of approximately $414 million. Of this amount, approximately $319 million relates to goodwill, and the balance relates to a valuation allowance for Pullmantur's deferred tax assets, a reduction in the value of the trademarks and name and an impairment charge related to 3 aircraft that Pullmantur owns and operates.","We have incorporated a rather grim view of the Spanish economy in our forecast and are confident that our projected cash flows are appropriate given the current environment and believe we have adjusted our carrying balances properly. You may be interested to know that our remaining goodwill balance for Pullmantur at year end was $144 million, and the value of the Pullmantur trademarks and name was $208 million. We believe these adjustments are appropriate and also have the utmost confidence in Pullmantur's management team as they diversify the brand's customer sourcing to markets outside of Spain.","Now I would like to talk about our operating results. So that you can better understand our operating performance, I'm going to exclude the impairment charges from the numbers I discuss. On the second slide, we have summarized our fourth quarter performance. We generated net income of $0.10 a share, which was $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance. Both ticket and onboard revenue showed year-over-year improvement and came in better than our forecast. Net yields improved 1.8% on a constant-currency basis, about 110 basis points of which was driven by our deployment initiatives and changes in our international distribution system. Yields for our European itineraries were down slightly, but we saw yield improvement in the mid-single digits for the Caribbean. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, increased 1% on a constant-currency basis. Excluding the itinerary and international distribution changes, our costs were up 40 basis points year-over-year.","On Slide 3, we have summarized our full year results, again, excluding the impairment charges for Pullmantur. Earnings per share were $1.97, which was at the midpoint of our initial guidance range back in January. Yields improved 3% on a constant-currency basis, again, at the midpoint of our original guidance of 1% to 5%. The total of 240 basis points of the increase was due to changes in deployment and international distribution. For the full year, yields were up in the Caribbean, Asia and South America. Excluding Europe, ticket yields increased 3.4% for the year. Yields in Europe were down significantly in the peak season and by a lesser degree in the late season. Overall, ticket yields in Europe declined about 3.5% for the year. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, increased 4.2% on a constant-currency basis. And of this, 350 basis points were due to the changes in deployment and international distribution.","Now let me update you on what we are seeing in the demand environment. As of today, our total booked load factors in booked APDs were slightly better than at this same time last year and better than this point in time in 2011. Booking activity in the fourth quarter was slightly lower than the same time last year, with the greatest decline coming in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. With each consecutive week after the storm, we saw improvement though. During first part of January, bookings were in line with the same time last year. Since we lapped the Costa Concordia incident, overall bookings have been up 20% versus a year ago.","As Richard mentioned, though, we are seeing different stories by source market. U.S. source business is up significantly versus the same period last year. Asian and Australian bookings have more than kept pace with the added capacity we have placed in both markets. And with the exception of the U.K. and Spain, Europe has been pretty solid. The U.K. has been disappointing from a volume standpoint, but pricing is above last year. Spain, however, is down significantly in both volume and pricing. Our brands have adjusted their guest sourcing targets accordingly, and we hope to minimize the overall impact these 2 markets will have on our performance.","At the itinerary level, the Caribbean will account for 44% of our 2013 capacity, which is a 4% increase from last year. We are seeing solid booking trends for this product group. And based on what we know today, we expect a record yield -- year for yields in the Caribbean. Europe will account for 27% of our capacity this year, which is a 10% reduction from last year. As of now, our booked load factors for Europe are similar to this same time last year at higher APDs. However, we have sold less than 50% of our European capacity so far, so it is still too early to have a definitive view on how much yield we can recover in 2013. Clearly, we view the performance of European itineraries as the largest swing factor in our projections.","Asia Pacific will account for 10% of our capacity this year, which is an increase of about 45%. Our booked load factors look strong for sailings in the first half of the year, although pricing is behind a year ago. Overall, we expect yields to be about flat for this region despite the large capacity increase.  Alaska represents about 4% of capacity, and early bookings are looking good with both load factors and pricing running higher than a year ago. The remaining 15% of our inventory is spread across many other products, including South America, Bermuda, Panama Canal and trans-Atlantic itineraries. In aggregate, load factors are higher than last year for these products, with pricing running slightly ahead.","If you'll turn to Slide 4, you will see our initial guidance for 2013. Net yields are expected to increase between 3% and 5% on an as-reported basis and between 2% and 4% on a constant-currency basis. As I mentioned before, we currently view Europe as the largest swing factor. Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to increase approximately 3% on an as-reported basis and between 2% and 3% on a constant-currency basis. Our brands continue to be very focused on driving higher yields, and most of this increase relates to increased marketing activities and investments in information technology to improve revenue. We expect to receive some benefit from these investments in 2013, but even more in the coming years.","In addition, while we have been able to mitigate pressure on most of our insurance premiums, we have seen an increase of more than 50% in our protection and indemnity insurance costs. Unfortunately, the reinsurance costs incurred by the P&I clubs because of the Costa Concordia incident were substantially higher than previous indications. We have included $960 million of fuel expense for the year, and we are 55% hedged. Net of our hedges, a 10% change in fuel prices, equates to about $43 million for the year.","At today's prices, our swaps provide a $65 million benefit, but this is $46 million less than we realized in 2012. Included in our fuel calculations is an incremental expense of $11 million due to the full year impact of the North American Emissions Control Area or ECA regulation that went into effect in August of last year. Based on current fuel prices and currency exchange rates, we expect earnings per share to be between $2.30 and $2.50 for the year.","On Slide 5, we have recapped our guidance for the first quarter. Net yields are expected to increase 2% to 3% on a constant-currency basis and approximately 2% on an as-reported basis. We expect yield improvement in all key itineraries, with the exception of Australia. As I mentioned previously, we have a substantial increase in capacity in this market, so there is some pricing pressure. Nonetheless, Australia remains a very high-yielding market for us. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to increase approximately 2% on a constant-currency and as-reported basis, and we have included $245 million of fuel expense for the quarter. We expect earnings per share to be between $0.10 and $0.20 for the quarter. Our capital expenditures this year are forecasted to be approximately $700 million. This includes the revitalization of 6 vessels, progress payments for new construction and investments in information technology.","We do have scheduled debt maturities of $1.5 billion this year and the remaining EUR 745 million balance of our eurobond maturing in the first quarter of 2014. We have already refinanced the vast majority of these maturities as evidenced by our $2.2 billion in liquidity, and we do anticipate strong cash -- free cash flow this year. To the extent necessary, we have numerous options available to us to refinance any remaining balance and have provided for this in our interest forecast.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Adam for his comments. Adam?","Adam M. Goldstein","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As Brian and Richard have both noted, strong late bookings contributed to our exceeding the 2012 expectations we communicated 3 months ago. I would like to thank our men and women, shipboard and shoreside, for their effort and dedication to overcome the many obstacles that 2012 presented.","You have heard commentary already from Richard and Brian on various aspects of the annual WAVE period that is currently underway. The Caribbean represents 44% of 2013 capacity, up 1.1 points versus 2012. In general, we are seeing positive performance across short, 7-night and long Caribbean sailings, and we expect to post yields that eclipse last year's record Caribbean yields for the company.","There was a lull in Caribbean bookings following Superstorm Sandy, but we have seen notable year-over-year improvement during the first weeks of the WAVE. Europe represents 27% of 2013 capacity, down 3.2 points versus 2012. Against the backdrop of the Arab Spring in 2011 and both the industry and macroeconomic adversity in 2012, we expect a yield increase in 2013 relative to both years.","Northern European capacity for the industry and the company are substantially up, and our year-over-year yield expectations are lower in the North than they are for the Eastern and Western Med, where our capacity is down on each sector for the second consecutive year. We are seeing more interest from the U.S. source market for 2013 Europe cruises than we experienced last year. And to this point, we are not hearing much, if any, noise about consumers' inability to find air seats from the U.S. to Europe.","Turning to the China market, our 2012 performance with one Voyager class ship and one smaller ship was favorable. This gives us confidence for 2013 when we will have 2 Voyager class ships in the market as of the summer. It also bodes well for the long-term development of this high-potential market, which is clearly in its infancy from a consumer awareness, distribution and port infrastructure standpoint.","Unfortunately, in the short term, the political issues between Japan and China surrounding the disputed islands in the East China Sea are affecting our itineraries and our demand generation. From the 2 main Chinese home ports of Shanghai and Tianjin, the destinations are concentrated in Japan and South Korea. For nearly all of our cruises into June, we have eliminated virtually all Japanese port calls and are offering cruises that only visit South Korea. It is not clear what will happen in the summer months. We certainly hope a reduction of tension emerges in the very near future.","Since the last earnings call, we entered into a contract with STX France for the construction of a third Oasis class ship for delivery in 2016. While delivery of this exciting ship is still over 3 years away, all of us at Royal Caribbean International are looking forward to having a third of this magnificent class of ship in our fleet. Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas are now well established as industry-leading in both guest satisfaction and profitability. We are pleased to renew our relationship with the French shipyard, which has previously built 8 ships for the Royal Caribbean brand.","Before the next earnings call, 1 of those 8 ships, Monarch of the Seas, will leave our brand for her new service in Pullmantur, operating Southern Caribbean itineraries, targeting Spanish-speaking guests primarily sourced from South America. Monarch has been a mainstay of Royal Caribbean for over 21 years, carrying approximately 4 million happy guests. We thank her for her service and wish her well in our sister brand.","Finally, it is my pleasure to report another year of increased guest satisfaction across our fleet, according to the various metrics we track. Despite the diversity of itineraries and guest nationalities, we continue to deliver the WOW even more powerfully as time goes on. Brian?","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, Adam. We'd now like to open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Cassandra, if we could open the call, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Brian, you talked a little bit about some of the drivers of the cost increases. Just wondering if we could go a little deeper. Regarding the insurance cost increase, you did say that it had gone up. But how much of the increase that you're seeing now is incremental to what you were expecting before? And then I was wondering if you could just discuss the investment spending in more detail that you also highlighted as a driver for the higher costs?","Brian J. Rice","Sure, Felicia. Our interest cost in total are up about $20 million year-over-year, so that's a little more than 0.5 percentage point, about 60 basis points. Most of that...","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's insurance?","Brian J. Rice","That's insurance. Most of that, as I mentioned in my comments, is related to P&I, which is we're just now in the renewal period. We were actually talking to the clubs last week. We had anticipated some increases. We had, I believe, it was about a 10% increase in hull and machinery, which we had anticipated. But the P&I was much larger, and the allocation of the recovery of those costs to the cruise lines was more substantial than we had anticipated. We are in the midst -- I'm going to let Adam talk about some of the marketing investments that we're making, but we also -- both on capital and on the P&L, we're doing a lot of investment in IT right now. We're working a lot with our websites, our core reservation system, our ability to do a much more intuitive presentation to our customers, as well as be able to do a lot more revenue management in a more granular level. And those are benefits that have begun to start coming in, but they will also snowball over the next couple of years. So we've included some benefit this year in our revenue, but I think it's going to be 2014, 2015 that we really hope to get the biggest gains out of that.","Adam M. Goldstein","Felicia, this is Adam. When we talk about technology investments and marketing investments, we're often talking about essentially 2 sides of the same coin. We clearly want to invest in the new available ways of doing target marketing, of reaching people on a one-to-one basis and engaging with them in conversations that weren't possible even 5 or 10 years ago, to take advantage of the interest that people have in cruising in general and in our brand specifically. Second, the distribution of our industry continues to evolve. It's a very competitive space. And we need to continue to invest in ways of reaching travel agents and motivating them to sell our products first and foremost. And then the third aspect, which will not surprise you based on all of the previous conversations, is we need to invest in our global marketing capabilities. As we begin to be an active marketer in virtually every significant market in the world, whether that's China, Australia, Brazil, the United States, the U.K. or what have you, we find that we need to continue to invest in new marketing capabilities and new systems capabilities to support that.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And also, I guess, Adam, just a follow-up for you, last question. You mentioned -- well, you all, as a whole, mentioned that you could achieve record yields in the Caribbean and in Alaska this year. Just wondering if you all have any insight into the Mediterranean sailing season yet or if it's too early?","Adam M. Goldstein","Felicia, sorry, it's Adam. I had you on mute there for a second. It's a little bit early, and we have said that because with all the different things that have transpired in Europe over the last 24 months, besides the fact that we're a little less booked there percentage-wise, we're a little bit less confident in how the market will react to the different techniques that we typically use. So we really need a little bit more time, I would say, in 2013 as we approach the summer season to see how it will go.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Robin Farley.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You talked about reducing European itineraries and European passenger sourcing this year, and I think you quantified the itinerary changes. I wonder if you could give a little bit more of that kind of color on the European passenger sourcing, just what you're targeting for the year and how that had changed from maybe what you were targeting a few months ago.","Adam M. Goldstein","There haven't been, Robin, dramatic changes. But at the margins, we're probably looking for a little bit more business from the United States. Typically, in recent years, when we've been talking about this on these calls, we've had the percentage from the U.S. at or maybe a little bit below 1\/4 of our business. We're probably looking for a little bit above 1\/4 of our business this year. But again, as I was just saying, we really need to see how the next few months develop. It is nice to know that there does seem to be a fairly robust level of interest from the United States to cruising Europe this summer, a little bit more than we've seen in the past few years at this point in time. And so we have the ability to leverage that to the extent that we need.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And so you're just talking about that 25% and just the percent of your European itineraries that are North American sourced?","Adam M. Goldstein","Correct.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then can you sort of just ballpark what your North American yields -- obviously, given the guidance for the company overall and the weakness or the uncertainty in Europe, what your North American yields would look like, just looking at North American sourced?","Brian J. Rice","Robin, we don't get that granular and it's a mix of itineraries. I think we certainly try to indicate that we're being, I think, the most bullish on U.S. sourced business right now when we compare to other markets. The U.K. -- I'm sorry, go ahead.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I know you don't normally, I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of whether your guidance leaves room for European-sourced business. For those yields to actually be down this year, is there, would you say, there's enough room in your guidance where that's at some end of the range for...","Brian J. Rice","I think we read a lot about what people expect us to come out with guidance. We try to be as transparent as possible and actually try to offer a little more granularity on what we're seeing right now. Clearly, we're expecting the yields to be down in Spain this year. The U.K., our volumes are off, but our pricing is up a bit. The other markets are actually holding up okay, but we've tried to give some variability. We believe the largest swing factor will be Europe, and we've tried to accommodate that for a little more deterioration or a little more upside within our guidance.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Brian, I guess if you look at your NCCs, you basically are saying they would be flat if you stripped out the higher insurance costs and the marketing costs. So I'm just -- I mean that seems like a very optimistic, very strong -- or a very strong -- what I'm basically trying to get at here is how are you guys keeping that number flat at this point? Seems a little bit aggressive, I guess, to us.","Brian J. Rice","Well, as I mentioned, about 50 or 60 basis points is going to be insurance, and the other really marketing and IT costs are the 2 areas that we're seeing increases. The brands worked very hard to try to do cost containment. We're perpetually looking for synergies and how we can consolidate some of the back-office operations and improve efficiency. I think it's fair to say we are leveraging the technology to get efficiency as well. And our supply team has done a great job in negotiating and keeping any inflationary pressures in check. So I think we feel good about the guidance we've provided.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. And then second question, just maybe how you're thinking about onboard yields for '13 as well.","Adam M. Goldstein","Steve, this is Adam. Looking back at last year, we had a year of reasonable progress, I would say, with our onboard yields. Overall, some of the areas that were helpful to us were short excursions and beverage. Also, in general, being more present in the Asia Pacific region is good in terms of the spending by those guests. And then the third thing I would mention is that of the revitalization of substantial part of our fleet across brands is creating new revenue -- onboard revenue opportunities. And we were able to take some advantage of them in 2012 and would expect to continue to do so in the 2013. Just as Brian was discussing with costs right now, as it relates to onboard revenue, there's a tremendous effort taking place across all brands to create onboard revenue upside. And I would say we're cautiously optimistic at this point in the year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I apologize if I missed this, but could you talk about the drivers of the occupancy being down a little bit year-over-year? And then secondarily on onboard spending, just curious if you could kind of prioritize where you are seeing that strength? I know you've made some changes in some of your beverage programs, and I'm curious how that's playing into the onboard spending.","Adam M. Goldstein","Sharon, it's Adam. Yes, we have made a number of tweaks in different areas. Also, let me start with short excursions. I know you just mentioned beverage, I'll come back to that. But as we become a more global operator with a more diversed guest sourcing, we have found both needs and opportunities to create more to our product for guests from different nationalities with different language capabilities in different parts of the world. I'd like to think we're getting better and better at that across the brands. And we saw opportunities in that area in 2012, and we would expect to see more opportunities in that respect in 2013. So that would be one example. The beverage area has been also relatively productive for us, both in terms of the introductions of a variety of different beverage packages across brands that give more consumer choice to our guests, both before and during the cruise in terms of how they would like to structure their beverage experience. And then, as I was just saying, I think in general, as we get more knowledgeable serving a more diversed group of nationalities across our various brands, we're simply finding new and interesting onboard revenue opportunities. And as we revitalize our ships with more specialty restaurants, different kinds of entertainment, different and better bars and so forth, we are finding areas of improvement. So all of those things together give us some optimism for 2013 and also in the years beyond.","Brian J. Rice","Sharon, I apologize, I don't have a reconciliation of the occupancies for you. I'd say for the year we're down 40 basis points; and we're down, I believe, it was 1.2 percentage points in the fourth quarter. I know we did have an increase in cancellations due to Hurricane Sandy, but I don't know how much that impact was. But if you don't mind, we'll try to get some details. And if you could follow up with Ian, we'll try to help you out after the call.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Sure. Can I just ask one quick follow-up then? I mean, do you expect occupancies to be relatively stable in 2013? Or should we expect more downward pressure on that?","Brian J. Rice","No, I think we're always within 1% or 2%, and our yield management team will make decisions that they believe is going to optimize the overall revenue equation. And sometimes, particularly on our higher-end brands, we may sacrifice load factor in order to drive yields up. But for the most part, we keep our load factors within a very narrow range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva.","Assia Georgieva","Two questions. First of all, I was somewhat surprised that the U.K. is lagging Germany and France in terms of demand. Given that you have a small price advantage at this point but the booked load factors are lagging, do you think you might be able to keep that price advantage as we go through WAVE? Or do you expect that at some point, you'll have to be reducing price to get the load factors up?","Adam M. Goldstein","Assia, it's Adam. It's hard to compare the difference, either European countries or actually any 2 countries. The U.K. is the #2 market for cruising in the world. For example, in the case of Royal Caribbean International, we are doubling the number of ships we have out of Southampton this summer with the Venture of the Seas joining Independence of the Seas. And clearly, the U.K. is under some stress macroeconomically. So we find that we're having to work pretty hard in the market right at this point, and we're waiting to see how the normal kinds of promotional activity will develop. There's always a heavy level of promotional activity in the U.K. going on, no matter how robust or not robust the market is for 25 years that I can remember. So it's really a question of being how, over the next 2 or 3 months, the market responds to the types of techniques we've used in the past and whether we have to get more aggressive or not. But it's a big cruise market, it's experienced in cruising, there's very well-established distribution. Our products and services are well received in the market, and we would expect to be able to find the customers that we need as we go forward.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. So it will be another couple of months before you have a better view into the summer season out of the U.K.?","Adam M. Goldstein","Yes.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. And my second question relates again to decrease in net cruise costs. I understand the P&I in the marketing pieces are the drivers. But last year, we already had a pretty significant increase related to deployment initiatives in the international distribution. I actually would have expected that we would get some of that benefit in terms of yields, but wouldn't have the need to raise costs and, in fact, had hoped that maybe costs could be flattish year-over-year. At the same time, marketing spend, obviously, if a 1% increase in costs can help drive yields by 1%, that's a benefit. But again, could you come in a little more detail -- I know you've discussed this already -- but I just wish there had been less of an increase on the cost side, if you will.","Brian J. Rice","Assia, I think we are trying to drive higher revenues. We do believe that the best way to grow our bottom line is through these investments and getting the revenues up. 1%, as you pointed out, on the revenue line means a lot more to us than 1% on the cost side. I think we've done a good job of controlling costs. If you exclude the investments that we're making in IT and marketing and the adjustment for insurance, our costs are basically flat, which I think has taken a lot of hard work by the brands and by our infrastructure team. And we're quite proud of that. But we do believe making these investments is both good for the short-term and the long-term results that we can drive.","Assia Georgieva","Well, the brand, it seems that we already had a higher cost base in 2012, again, because of those 2 types of initiatives that were more of a onetime item or had significant...","Brian J. Rice","Assia, I'm sorry, they're not a onetime item, they continue forward. It will actually be a pleasure to stop talking about deployment and international distribution changes in my script every time. But those are changes that occurred in 2012 from 2011. They do continue forward. I believe I called out early last year, one of the structural changes was the relationship that our Pullmantur brand has within Brazil. We did previously have more of a tour operator sort of structure where we shared revenues and costs, and that changed in 2012. And we have a more broader distribution system. And as a result of that, we got more of revenue and more of the cost. That continues going forward. So we really are looking at apples-to-apples as we compare 2013 to 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","The first question -- sorry to beat a dead horse here, but going back to Europe, if you -- with 50% of your capacity still yet to book, based on the most recent trends in pricing, would your gut tell you with that, that incremental pricing from here through the end of the summer is going to be on the positive side or on the negative side?","Adam M. Goldstein","When you say, \"from here,\" do you mean from here being the United States?","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","No, no. No, from this point in time.","Adam M. Goldstein","I'm sorry. So it's from here on in time?","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Correct.","Adam M. Goldstein","Well, as we've said in a couple of different ways that we need to see how this develops over the next 2 or 3 months. We have a wide array of tactical options available to us in this business, both in our consumer and our trade communications. We have considerably more experience in all of the European countries than we had even a few years ago in terms of how to select and promote the activities that we need to do. So we have a lot of capability, but we're also facing a market environment that's certainly altered over the last 2 or 3 years into something that is a little bit different. I think when we're talking about United States market and the Caribbean and Alaska and the different techniques that we have available there, we're pretty confident when we say what -- when we look at what the different choices are as to how to go forward, what to select and when to put it into the market and what will probably happen. Europe is simply more uncertain at this time. And also because we source most of our customers on our European cruises from Europe, for them, it is closer-to-home, later-in-time booking proposition. So there are several different factors that sort of push towards needing the next few months to see how it will go. But we're optimistic that we can do the things that we need to do to keep the ships full and to be consistent with the pricing -- the earnings guidance and the yield guidance that we've given you today.","Richard D. Fain","Harry, I think I would -- since there have been a number of questions on Europe, and quite rightly because we have highlighted that as an issue, macroeconomically, where we continue to see continued uncertainty there, issues with the banking system and the fiscal crisis that they've been undergoing. So it's a little hard to measure that. I think, overall, we feel that it has stabilized. It's gone -- Spain has been somewhat of an outlier because of the depths of the issues there. But we're not seeing the kind of improvement that we would like to see, but I think, overall, our forecast that we have presented to you here today are based on what we, and frankly most observers, are seeing in terms of the economic activity there. I think the fact that we have held up and continued to show the kinds of yield improvements that we're doing despite that economic situation is really a tribute to the brands and the strength of those brands. But it has been a long period of disappointing economic news in Europe, and that news hasn't ended yet and, obviously, we're hoping it continues to do so.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","In that case, why don't we move to something that hopefully is a little clearer to forecast. In the press release, you gave guidance of CapEx through 2016 in aggregate of $4.2 billion. Can you walk us through the breakdown of new ship versus renovation CapEx for your existing fleet?","Brian J. Rice","Harry, if you wouldn't mind, I think it would be best if you could follow up with Ian after the call. He's got the detailed reconciliation and can certainly make sure your model covers the different categories appropriately. I will mention we have guided traditionally that our maintenance CapEx is generally in the neighborhood of around $200 million to $250 million a year. That could be slightly higher in a couple of these years due to some of the IT investments, but we've included that. And the vast majority is obviously the new ships and the revitalizations. But Ian can give you the details of that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tim Conder.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First of all, I apologize if I missed this in the early part here. But Celebrity, if you could maybe give us some color on how the brand's tracking with some of the new marketing initiatives there? And I know you mentioned at the investor meeting a couple of months ago that, again, you're absorbing all the capacity and the challenges related to that. But with the new marketing focus and you're further trying to differentiate that brand, give us an update, if you could. And then also, on the booking curve, if you could maybe compare and contrast North America to Europe, where that stands at this point relative to last year?","Richard D. Fain","Sure. Tim, I'll take the first part and Brian will take the second question. With respect to Celebrity, as you know, we've had significant management change there as Michael Bayley has taken over. And he has -- is actually responsible for a lot of the marketing increase that we're talking about here. And we are also at the end of Celebrity's large and rapid capital build-up with the 5 Solstice series ships. And so far, that really seems to resonate. We are looking for -- a lot of the improvement here is, in fact, coming out of the Celebrity brand, and the early indications are very good. Michael would say he's been in the job for 1.5 weeks, and so it's a little early to judge the performance, a little longer than 1.5 weeks. But the early indications are really quite promising, and that's part of what has enabled us to be projecting the kinds of yield improvements we have.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And maybe this is a derivative of that. Brian, of the marketing spend in total, roughly what's that in basis points or absolute dollars of these 3 major components?","Brian J. Rice","Well, the insurance is about 60 basis points. We didn't break out the marketing or the IT. But they're sharing, I would say, roughly equally in terms of driving the incremental expense.  Tim, on your question on the booking curve, I think the U.S. is, for the most part, we would say in line with a year ago. We do have some pockets, some products where people are actually beginning to book a little bit further out, which is obviously helpful. Northern Europe, for the most part, is very consistent with what we were seeing last year, but we have seen contraction in Southern Europe. The Southern European countries are actually booking about a month close to sailing than they had been a year ago.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Richard Carter.","Richard A. Carter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. Sorry to just keep laboring this point on Europe. You sort of confused me. But all right, saying, so, 50% of capacity is still to be booked. You're expecting flat yield in Europe. Is that sort of factored into your guidance? Is that correct? And would it be...","Brian J. Rice","Richard, I'm sorry. We said that we have sold less than 50% of Europe at this point. In aggregate, we're feeling as though we will have yield improvement in Europe this year.","Richard A. Carter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And is that North Europe sort of flattish, just slightly up; Southern Europe, down; and West Europe, up. Is that sort of a fair assessment of...","Brian J. Rice","We haven't been that granular, but we've taken a lot of capacity out of Southern Europe. We've added capacity to Northern Europe.","Richard A. Carter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So that would be probably a fair synopsis of potentially what could happen. And then secondly, on the marketing and technology costs, of these one-off costs, would you expect them to continue to reoccur going forward? And then just on the technology side, you talked about increasing your direct communication. Can you just say where you are relative to that? I mean, is this a new development for you or is it just building up on previous technology? And what sort of changed for you to want to go down this road? And just finally, do we expect that to come through in lower commissions going forward?","Adam M. Goldstein","Richard, this is Adam. I would say that we are in a phase that's more than a 1-year phase of ramping up investment and marketing and marketing-related technology development. That is a function both of the sort of cycles of technology investment over time, as well as the realities of being an aggressive global marketer in the 21st century and wanting to be very determined, I should say, to have successful globally oriented brands, as well as some very specifically nationalistically oriented brands that want to be preeminent in their respective markets. And so we're in a period right now where we're emphasizing that type of development. And as Brian noted earlier on the call, that means that it's incumbent upon the management team to find efficiencies and look for cost management opportunities in other areas to allow this type of investment to occur, so that we're able to drive yields on the revenue side, which is what the business is most about and what we are determined to achieve. So those are developments that are a focus for us strategically at this time. I wouldn't link the development of distribution costs to these marketing investments. The distribution around the world is in very differential states of evolution, so cruise distribution in the United States and I would say the U.K. is pretty mature. There's a lot of attention towards our products and services. Travel agents often build their economic model around what we and the rest of the industry are doing in cruising; whereas in places like China, it's a brand-new game. There really isn't cruise distribution in the way that we've known in the past in other markets, and we're trying to build that so that we can take advantage of the market's potential. So there's a lot of different factors that will propel distribution compensation independent of what we're doing with marketing and technology investment.","Richard A. Carter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Richard, just like to comment on something that was at the end of your question, which I think Adam addressed but I think it's worth emphasizing. Your question was kind of leading towards the extent to which these things would tend to reduce or increase our level of direct business and reduce that which goes to the distribution system. And while technology is evolving and people's use are evolving and in particular, as Adam pointed out, there's huge geographical differences. What we're really doing is trying to find better ways to communicate with our guests and with our travel agents. And the technological investments that we're talking about aren't so much focused on changing the current structure that we have today. The bulk of our business continues to come through travel agents. Travel agents are key to help people understand what cruising is all about. And particularly, as we look at growing the business, the need to do a better job of communicating with people is important, and the travel agent is particularly good at that. So I would not, in terms of your model, think in terms of this making a dramatic difference, these investments make a dramatic difference in the distribution cost in terms of commissions. What it will do is make us and the travel agents more efficient and we think provide a better way to communicate with our guests and our travel agents going forward.","Richard A. Carter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Do you think this will take you above your competitors in terms of what technology they have?","Richard D. Fain","I'm not going to make competitive comments on the call. I think we want to be -- in almost anything we're doing, we try and be the best at what we're doing. And we think that our technological investments, and they're big, will be -- will have a very good return on the investment.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just to focus on net yields a little bit. So beyond the easy compares, when you're looking at the U.S. bookings, still seem like they're very strong from what you talked about. Any color from travel agents or just from your people who are handling direct calls in terms of what's really driving the strength here?","Adam M. Goldstein","Well, the travel agents are just doing whatever the business is that they're doing. And I think in the United States market, they have a general perception that the U.S. economy is coming along, that people are taking some confidence from the housing market turning into a somewhat more positive direction, that the country didn't fall over the fiscal cliff into the abyss. And the value of cruising is coming through in a good way. In this winter's booking season, we've been, I guess, reasonably fortunate with the weather patterns that have existed so far. Sometimes, it's hard to tell how much influence that has. But last winter, probably, wasn't beneficial to us in the weather respect and this year, probably more so. So there's an overall sense that it's a good time to be booking cruises, that the cruise industry and our company are bringing forward exciting and attractive products and services, both new ships and revitalization of older ships, and that the market's stability is in pretty good shape here. So there's a lot of reasons why the U.S. market would be in a relatively positive stance, and that's consistent with what we hear from the travel agents around the country.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Good. Good to hear. And then my second question is just assuming that trends continue decently and you achieve the upper end of your 2% to 4% net yield guidance, how much of the net yield growth would you expect to come from pricing versus greater utilization in the prior year?","Brian J. Rice","Greg, I think as I indicated to Sharon, we really manage within a narrow range of load factor. Unlike hotels, you don't see a lot of volatility in our yield performance based on the load factors. I think, at this point, we would look at it all to come from pricing leverage, as well as some accretion in onboard spending.","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Andrea Forez [ph].","Unknown Analyst","[indiscernible] for yield guidance particularly because Q1 looks very strong given that it's your toughest comps. Because last year, I think we saw -- excluding the distribution and deployment changes, yields were up 3.5% in Q1, so your guidance implies a 2-year growth rate of around 6%. Whereas your full year yields were just up around 0.5% excluding these deployment changes, so your 2-year run rate for the full year implies just around 3.5% increase. So I was just wondering if it's just this uncertainty around Europe or there's anything else that I might be missing?","Brian J. Rice","Sure. I think part of it is driven by the product mix. In the first quarter, we had very little Europe. We actually reduced capacity in the first quarter within Europe, which did not perform too well last year. And I think as we've indicated, our brands are performing particularly well in the Caribbean. We were up, as I mentioned in my opening comments, mid-single-digits in the fourth quarter, and we're looking at just core strength within the Caribbean. I know the Royal Caribbean brand in particular, with the Oasis class ships, have done very well, and I think that's predominately why we're seeing good performance in the first quarter despite the harder comp.","Okay, thank you. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. And as I mentioned before, Ian will be available throughout the day for any follow-ups, and we wish everyone a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Second Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Rice. You may begin, sir.","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, Sabrina, and good morning. I'd like to thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Ian Bailey, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which we have posted on our website, www.rclinvestor.com. Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide.","During this call, we will be making comments that are forward looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Additionally, we will be discussing certain financial measures, which are non-GAAP as defined, and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.","Richard will start with his comments. I will follow with a brief recap of our results and give an update on the booking environment and our forward guidance. Adam will talk about our brands, and then we will open the call to your questions. Richard?","Richard D. Fain","Thanks, Brian, and thank you all for joining us this morning. As always, I look forward to this opportunity to discuss our business. I'd like to start my comments, though, this morning by noting that for a very long time, we have always had exactly the same people in this room. But today, for the first time in about 6 years, there's a difference. As you know, Dan Hanrahan, President and CEO of our Celebrity Cruises line, is leaving us to assume the reigns at Regis Corporation as their CEO. We extend to him our best wishes, while at the same time knowing that his leadership will be missed. Fortunately, as is the trait of any strong leader, Dan has not only built a terrific brand, but he's built a strong bench of leadership that provides great depth of talent, one that will seamlessly continue to provide the exceptional experiences that our guests at Celebrity Cruises come to expect. We anticipate announcing a successor for Dan in the near future.","Turning to the business environment, 2012 is certainly living up to its billing as an interesting year. We knew that the Concordia grounding would hurt us in the short run, and that expectation unfortunately has proven very accurate. Fortunately, our other expectation, that the -- i.e. that the impact would wane over time has also proven to be accurate. And also fortunately, most of our markets continue to perform well despite a very challenging economy. The Caribbean continues to perform nicely and in a very solid manner. Alaska is holding up reasonably well, even having as comparable the record yields that we enjoyed last year. In Asia, revenue yields are making us feel exceptionally good, despite the fact that we have an 80% capacity increase. In Asia, we are seeing some of the largest regional increases in our company's history. Part of this is due to easy comps from last year, but most of it is simply due to better penetration in areas with better economies. The bummer, of course, is Europe. We all knew there were challenges there, but we had not anticipated either the severity of the financial crisis or the roller coaster ride that the politicians and the media have precipitated. And, of course, the Concordia impact there has been the greatest and the slowest to dissipate. These European pressures have outweighed all the good news for the rest of the world and is driving our yield guidance down by about 1%.","As we reported in our release, we're working hard to offset those changes with cost reductions wherever possible. Of course, all of us feel frustrated over the combination of Europe's economic malaise, together with the impact of the cost of the Concordia tragedy. They have hurt us in what should have been exciting improvements in our returns. But regardless of these setbacks, we'll continue to focus our energy on controlling costs and improving pricing, the primary drivers of improving returns. We've had glimpses of the fruit that these initiatives can bear, as our yield improvements prior to the Arab Spring last year and the Concordia financial meltdowns this year were exceptionally promising. So we know we're on the right track, and we're making the proper structural decisions for the future. But we, like so many others, are frustrated by these barriers. Having acknowledged this, we've remained exceptionally bullish on our industry and with our brands in particular. As I've said before, we've shown how resilient we are as a company and as an industry. Looking forward, we're not relying on too much economic improvement to drive our earnings. Our plan has been to improve pricing mainly through lower capacity growth, complemented by global expansion of demand, smarter use of technology and deployment optimization.","Again, as I referenced earlier, these initiatives are working, and I am quite confident that with a little breather from these outside events, the platform we have built will generate the returns that we must have. With that backdrop in mind, we're faced with an interesting dichotomy: frustration with our current returns and a long-term conviction of significant pricing potential in an era of reduced capacity growth. We have been transparent about our intent to slow berth growth, and we have done so drastically. From 2012 through 2016, our berth capacity growth is less than 3%, and in fact, we don't have any ship deliveries in 2013 at all. But as we said before, we also can't stagnate. Given the long lead time for a new vessel, we're approaching the point where a new order could not be delivered until the middle to late 2016, by which time, we will be enjoying much better profitability and much improved credit metrics. We continue to make strong progress towards our goal of investing great results, and we are determined to continue on that path.","On the cost front, I'm pleased with our management's responsiveness to the current environment. This is not an easy task or a short-term challenge, but it is one we are determined to pursue aggressively.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Brian for a more detailed discussion of results looking forward.","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, Richard. On the second slide, we have summarized our performance in the second quarter. We incurred a net loss of $3.6 million or $0.02 per share. This included a below-the-line mark-to-market loss on our WTI fuel options of $0.05 per share, for which we do not get hedge accounting. So on an adjusted basis, we had a net profit of $0.03 a share or slightly better than the midpoint of our previous guidance.","Net yields improved 4.5% on a constant currency basis and 1.8% on an as reported basis. Approximately 280 basis points of the constant currency improvement came from the distribution and deployment changes we talked about back in February. So on a like-for-like basis, our yields were up 1.7% for the quarter. Overall, second quarter ticket revenue on a constant currency basis was slightly better than our forecast, driven by strong closed-in demand for our Asian products. Yields in the Caribbean were up just over 7%, and yields in Asia more than doubled from the depressed levels seen a year ago after the Japan earthquake. As we expected, yields were down year-over-year in Europe. Onboard revenue increased modestly in the second quarter, but not as much as we had seen in the first quarter and less than we had forecasted.","On the cost side, excluding fuel, our net cruise costs were up 8.3% on a constant currency basis and up 5.8% on an as reported basis. Approximately 600 basis points of this increase was due to the structural changes I mentioned previously. Looking forward, with the notable exception of Europe, the overall demand environment has been relatively consistent with our earlier expectations. Over the past couple of months, bookings have been running slightly ahead of this time last year from both Europe and North America. We have seen a shift to a closer end booking window in key European source markets, particularly those in Southern Europe. The booking window for North America and most other non-European countries is largely the same as it was at this time last year.","Now I would like to walk you through a series of slides that I think will help illustrate the different behaviors we are seeing for bookings in the second, third and fourth quarters. This is much more granular than we usually provide, but I am hopeful the additional transparency will help you better understand the current demand environment.","On Slide 3, we have graphed the evolution of both our load factors and average per diems for the second quarter as compared to last year. The green line shows that our booked load factors were slightly behind a year ago as of the time of our last earnings call. On the other hand, booked APDs on a constant currency basis, which are represented by the red line, were slightly ahead of the same time last year. As the quarter progressed, you can see we were able to close the load factor deficit with very little change in our year-over-year pricing.","On Slide 4, we have provided the same chart but for the third quarter. As of the date of our last earnings call, similarly to the second quarter, load factors were trailing a year ago, but booked APDs were higher. The load factor deficit was slightly higher than in the second quarter, mainly due to the lost bookings during the WAVE period, especially for European itineraries. You can see that while we have made up many of these bookings over the last couple of months, the discounting required to drive the demand has been significant, and our booked APDs are now lower than a year ago.","On Slide 5, we have broken out the pricing portion of the chart by product for the third quarter. Clearly, Europe has required the most discounting, and we now expect European yields to be down for the year. Alaska has seen some price reductions recently, but considering last year was a record year for Alaska, the overall story is still pretty good. On a more positive note, our Caribbean itineraries and the balance of our product line have seen a relatively stable environment and continue to perform better than a year ago. The impact of Europe is expected to be felt the most in the third quarter, where European itineraries account for 53% of our capacity.","The fourth quarter is yet another story. On Slide 6, you can see that as of the time of our last call, both load factors and APDs were running ahead of the same time last year. For the last few months, bookings have been rather stable, and with only 28% of our inventory in the more volatile European itineraries, we are hopeful to return to yield improvement in the fourth quarter.","On Slide 7, you will see our guidance for the third quarter. We expect yields to be down 1% to 2% on a constant currency basis and down approximately 5% on an as reported basis. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to increase approximately 3% on a constant currency basis and be flat to up 1% on an as reported basis. Embedded in our third quarter guidance is approximately 130 basis points of benefits to yields from the previously disclosed distribution and deployment initiatives. Approximately 230 basis points of the net cruise costs, excluding fuel, increase in the quarter relates to these same initiatives. Based on current prices, we have included $213 million of fuel expense for the quarter, and we are 56% hedged. Earnings per share are forecasted to be between $1.40 and $1.50 for the quarter.","On Slide 8, we have provided our guidance for the full year. We expect yields to improve between 2% and 3% on a constant currency basis and between flat and up 1% on an as reported basis. Approximately 200 basis points of the yield improvement is due to the structural changes. So on a constant currency basis, we are looking for like-for-like performance of flat to up 1%. While our yield projections remain within the range we provided both in early February and in April, we have lowered the midpoint slightly. This reduction is due entirely to the performance of European itineraries. In fact, if we exclude European itineraries, our ticket yields for the year are expected to be up between 5% and 6% on a constant currency basis.","Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to increase approximately 4% on a constant currency basis and approximately 2% on an as reported basis. Of this, approximately 350 basis points are due to the international distribution and deployment initiatives. On a like-for-like basis, we are projecting net cruise costs, excluding fuel, to be flat to up 1% or about 100 basis points lower than in April. Based on today's fuel prices, we have included $899 million in fuel expense for the year, and we are 58% hedged. We are now forecasting EPS for the year to be between $1.70 and $1.80.","On Slide 9, we have provided a bridge between our April guidance and our current forecast. The midpoint of our April guidance was for earnings per share of $1.95, and we have reduced that by $0.20. The lower revenue expectations, driven by Europe, account for a $0.32 reduction. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has cost us about $0.13, but this has been mainly -- mostly offset by lower fuel costs. As I previously mentioned, the mark-to-market accounting for our fuel options cost us $0.05 below the line, and our across-the-board spend reductions have saved us about $0.19.","Lastly, I would like to take a moment and bring you up to speed on our recent refinancing actions. As many of you know, we have some bond maturities coming up in 2013, and we have been proactive getting ahead of these. We have worked hard to avoid as much negative carry as possible while removing refinancing risk. First, we increased our revolver capacity by approximately $225 million. We also closed on a delayed draw, 5-year, EUR 365 million syndicated bank loan facility.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Adam for his comments. Adam?","Adam M. Goldstein","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As you have heard this morning, second quarter business conditions remained solid in the Caribbean and certainly were challenging in Europe. Asia, while still a small share of overall revenue, performed well. Voyager of the Seas' entry into China was well-received, and we are excited about the prospect of offering Voyager class cruising in Asia for the rest of this year and beyond.","Yields were positive on most products, but this progress was partially offset by the decline in Europe yields. In general, we find we are able to source late business where needed. While we would prefer not to have to engage in the level of discounting we have had to do in Europe, we continue to demonstrate our ability to fill ships even in difficult market conditions.","We are able to attract both first-time and repeat cruisers with tactical efforts, but our percentage of repeat cruisers is slightly elevated in comparison to prior years. It's not surprising that in more challenging times, experienced cruisers, who viscerally comprehend the value of our products, will gain share of our mix.","It is premature for us to comment on 2013 bookings. However, I will note a couple of strategic aspects of the upcoming year. First, Royal Caribbean International will decrease in capacity by 4% in 2013. Our growth trajectory will not resume until we take delivery of the first Sunshine ship in late 2014. The overall year-over-year growth for the company in 2013 will be up by just over 1%.","Second, since the last earnings call, we announced the redeployment of Mariner of the Seas to China next year. With Mariner's reassignment and other deployment changes, the result will be a large increase in our Asia and Australia capacity, a small increase in our Caribbean capacity and decreased capacity in Europe. Specifically, with respect to Europe, the company, overall, will have 10% less capacity in Europe in 2013.","Moving to onboard revenue in the second quarter, the year-over-year spend was slightly up. A number of onboard areas contributed to the positive momentum, offset by a year-over-year decrease in gaming spend. In addition to Americans spending more on a year-over-year basis, we continue to improve our ability to generate higher onboard spend from guests than many of our priority markets. On the other hand, we saw a decreased year-over-year spend from guests from the major Southern European markets.","Richard and Brian both noted that we have managed to offset some of the decrease in expected revenues with additional cost savings. We continue to focus on cost control even as we expand globally and generate our highest guest satisfaction ratings in recent years. Given a highly competitive environment, vis-\u00e0-vis other cruise competitors and myriad land vacations, we intend to strengthen our product offering even as we manage our cost slightly. Brian?","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, Adam. We'd now like to open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Sabrina, if we could open the call for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] You have a question from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. So I do have a few questions, one on bookings, but first, I guess, on capacity. It sounds as if you're likely to order another ship in the next 3 months or so or maybe by year-end in order to get something by 2016. So I wonder if you could give us a little color on what your thoughts are strategically about what that ship -- any sort of thoughts on the brand or size, that kind of thing.","Richard D. Fain","Robin, Richard here. That's -- it's a broad question. I think we clearly are looking at that sort of thing. I don't think we're in a position to be specific about it. I think what we're looking at is, we see that even in this market, we could get some very attractive returns from some of our vessels that have performed well. And we do see both the better performance in terms of revenue, the lower cost and a better fuel consumption from some of our ships. And so, yes, we are looking at some possibilities. As I indicated though, in today's market, you couldn't get a ship before 2016 anyhow. So it's a ways off in the future. But we are looking at the kinds of ships that are, even in today's world, generating nice returns.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then the question on bookings. If I'm reading the charts right -- and thank you for the granularity, the detail you're giving in the booking charts. It's very helpful. Just looking at the sort of hole that still needs to be filled for Q3 in terms of load factor. I guess, how should we think about -- I assume -- I guess we think that there will be more discounting ahead then to fill that. Or -- has Q4, if I'm looking at the chart right, are you actually -- it's looks like you're ahead in load factor in Q4. I guess I'm just trying to get some color on how do we know that the promotional environment won't continue past Q3 if we've got more discounting ahead?","Brian J. Rice","Robin, I'll comment; I don't know if Adam wants to add anything from his perspective. But clearly, Europe has required more discounting, I think as you saw in the slide, than we had projected. We knew that we were going to have to stimulate the market to some degree and had assumed that we'd have some pricing deterioration in Europe for the third quarter, but it was more pronounced than we expected. Alaska, we've seen a little more discounting in the market than we expected. But as I mentioned in my comments, we're very close to matching the record yields that we had a year ago. I think we feel as though we have a pretty good handle now on Europe for what it's going to take in the third quarter. As we get to the fourth quarter, Europe becomes much less important to us, and we shift more of our capacity share to the Caribbean that, we had seen in the second, third and fourth quarter, the Caribbean pricing has held up pretty well. We are running for Q4, we are ahead on both load factor and APD today. I think if you extrapolate from our guidance that we are looking at modest yield improvement in the fourth quarter on a constant currency basis, it would be low single digits. And we think that the order book that we have in place and what we've seen from an elasticity perspective, that those are good numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So just kind of along those lines, if we just try to think about -- you have your load factors year-over-year on the charts, and that's pretty clear. But if we look at historical booking trends, third quarter, you're usually 85% to 95% booked, fourth quarter, 50% to 75% booked. How are you -- how was your business in each of those quarters relative to those historical guidelines?","Brian J. Rice","We would be within the ranges that you're mentioning. For Q3, we're obviously behind where we would normally be at this time, and for Q4, we're doing a little bit better than we would have expected. It's interesting we -- what we're seeing from a load factor perspective is somewhat consistent with what we experienced during the WAVE period and through the second quarter, where most of the gap that was created in booking activity in the post-Concordia environment really related to the second and third quarter. As we mentioned back in February, we really weren't seeing much of an impact on the longer-term bookings. I believe we even commented that Q4 and Q1, albeit at very small volumes, they were maintaining their pace quite well. And I think as you can see from the graph that we provided, Q4 has held up that way since the April call.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then, I meant to throw in there Q1. Are you -- did you -- I don't think you gave any color on Q1 yet.","Brian J. Rice","No, we were purposely being somewhat evasive about 2013 at this point, just not getting ahead of ourselves. But our order book is solid at this point, our load factors are running ahead of a year ago.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. If I'd wrapped that into that other question, that would have been one. So can I ask one more quick one?","Brian J. Rice","Sure.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Just -- you guys talked about the cost reductions that are going to help offset some of the revenue declines. So I'm just wondering if you could just give us some examples of what you're doing.","Adam M. Goldstein","I don't know that there's -- this is Adam, Felicia.","I don't know if there's anything, any one thing that's so notable that it jumps out. We have noted over the last several years where there has been sort of ongoing macroeconomic challenge that our constant intent is to make efficiency gains that do not affect the quality of the product that the guests experience. And also, we, of course, have been expanding our global footprint from a sales and marketing and deployment standpoint. So it really is a lot of attention to small changes in cost of the margin and which would affect net cruise costs, x fuel, and then at the same time, doing everything within our power to try to minimize fuel costs, which, of course, have no benefit for the guests.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So Brian, you talked about the booking window in Europe, and you said that is contracting some. Is there any way to break that out versus kind of Northern Europe versus Southern Europe? Or is that too hard to do?","Brian J. Rice","I think what we would say is that we've seen more contraction in the booking window in Southern Europe than we have in Northern. Northern has held up better. I think the closer -- the Southern European economies are clearly the ones that are on the radar, and I think we're seeing a little more of a lingering impact from the incident back in January, the closer you get to the epicenter.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got you. And then a bigger-type question, I guess maybe it might be more for Adam. But the decrease in capacity in Europe in '13, I mean, clearly, you guys are trying to move out of that market. Is it more, you think the market is going to be impaired for a couple of years? Or is it something where you think there's better opportunities in other parts of the world?","Adam M. Goldstein","Well, clearly, we feel that there are opportunities in the Asia Pacific region that are emerging for our company and certainly the Royal Caribbean International brand. That is an effort that we've had in place for several years that's beginning to bear fruit; would have borne fruit in 2011, but for the situation that unfolded in Japan. And the China market is beginning to catch on to cruising as a preferred vacation type. I believe a number of people in China refer to Voyager of the Seas, which is there now, as the \"Asia super boat\". And so we are moving, in a measured manner, capacity there. Next year, that takes place in the form of Mariner of the Seas going there replacing Legend of the Seas, which is, of course, an uptick in capacity, and will leave us with 2 Voyager class ships in the region. We pointed out during this call in a number of different ways that the Caribbean remains solid for us. And we've made certain adjustments, for example, Royal Caribbean International would be back to offering a year-round San Juan-based product, which has been successful for us over time. And we'll resume that. But I want to make sure that people understand that even with a 10% decrease in the company's capacity in Europe next year, that still keeps Europe as an important, strategic element in our deployment program and in our company's assessment of market opportunities. Even with Europe's difficulties, it's this tremendous size of vacation market and a lot of opportunities to go on cruises nearby. So we are changing things at the margin in the direction of Asia Pacific and to some degree, in the direction of North America. But it's still our intent to do profitable business in Europe as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Richard, you mentioned earlier that you're running at 3% sort of long-term supply growth, but it now looks increasingly likely that GDP, especially in Western economies, are going to be maybe even 1 to 2 percentage points lower than that. So maybe supply should be even lower than that 3%, especially as you've now noted that low supply does create some pricing power. So I just wanted to know sort of what you're -- is that 3% going to 1%, 1.5% over a longer-term view? Or is that 3% where you want to keep it?","Richard D. Fain","Yes. Steven, what I actually mentioned was our -- specifically, our growth rate over that period was a little under 3%. I think -- of course, one of the things that happens with cruise capacity is,  it's not a continual curve. You don't say, \"I want 2.38%\", because the ships come in large increments. And so getting it smooth and getting it precise within a percent or so -- it frankly isn't the way we look at it. The other thing I would emphasize is, in terms of the market, we're not dealing with an existing market that is growing, although that is happening in, for example, United States or in Europe. A lot of what we are doing with our capacity is shifting it to new markets, and in essence, opening up new demand. So, for example, this year, Adam talked about moving the Voyager of the Seas from Europe to Asia, and particularly, China. That was -- that actually brought down our capacity in the existing markets. And the Voyager this year and the Mariner next year, those are going into entirely different markets that essentially didn't exist before. So to relate to your comparison, which I think is an interesting one, I would actually say you ought to look at what we're doing with, in effect, the existing market, which is growing -- which is either pretty flat or only slightly growing, as opposed to taking capacity out of those markets and moving them into what's proving to be a very exciting Asian market. So I think that's the way we are looking at it. But I also would emphasize, we're not just focusing -- we're not going to get it accurate within 1% or 2%.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I guess the only reason I want to come back to you on that is because just recently, Carnival noted that New Zealand and Australia were showing some weakness because of oversupply. And Europe, just a few years ago, was viewed as the big, hot new market and then it got overbuilt. So I'm just concerned that as you move some of the supply into Asia, we just sort of repeat that pattern, and that's maybe why that supply growth overall needs to calm down.","Richard D. Fain","Well, I think there is no question that we, like any other industry -- you do have cycles and you have times when you do too much into an area. And we have said that we think the lower capacity growth will be a driver of demand -- sorry, a driver of increased rates. So we think that's a good trend to go in. But, for example, you talk about Europe. It wasn't that we overwhelmed Europe. Frankly, it was that Europe suffered 2 calamities that we really didn't anticipate. We did not anticipate the unfortunate tragedy in Italy. We didn't anticipate the financial and capital markets meltdown in Europe, and we didn't anticipate the Arab Spring. And so I think in those cases, it is a question that the market actually changed, and I'm not sure we'll ever be able to anticipate those things. We do have -- you mentioned Australia and New Zealand, and that's true, because those markets have been so robust that we probably, as an industry, put too much into them. And I'll actually come back to something Adam said. It's not doing -- it's not growing as quickly as it did and it's not getting the kind of rate increases, but it's still getting very robust rates. So I don't regret having more capacity in a market that is getting very robust rates, but those rates may be stable instead of going up. So I think that's the overall way we're looking at it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just as it relates to somehow trying to put some quantification on what would be go-forward next year in Europe. Brian, you very, very distinctly called out, and so does Carnival, that the majority of the impact has been in the second and the third quarters, and then you're seeing that in the charts that you guys have. And by the way, thank you for those also and for the additional verbal color on everything. But if you look at those and you look at the adjustments, can you -- and I know it's a very difficult question. Can you somehow say, \"Okay, we believe we're starting to get some normalization, post-Concordia\" from that aspect alone? Anything you can give along that line, Brian.","Brian J. Rice","Tim, I think it's very premature to try to speculate how Europe is going to recover. I can -- I'll give you a couple of statistics we have. For 2013, I'll give you the percentage of our capacity that is in Europe by quarter. It's 1% in Q1; it's 31% in Q2; it's 49% in Q3; 24% in Q4; and the overall is 27%, which is down from 30% this year. I think we are seeing in Europe a gradual healing, I think, from the incident in Italy. The economy is still -- depending on what day you listen to the news reports, we're going into a depression in Europe. In other days, they're feeling very good. Like today, the euro had a nice pop this morning because they think that they're going to support the euro. I can tell you that we do a lot of price shopping, as I know all of you do. I think on average, we're seeing the pricing above the current levels for next year but lower than they were back in the beginning of January. I think -- the base of business is -- we're -- on a load factor perspective, we're doing a little bit better in Europe right now than we were a year ago with tough comparables. [Indiscernible], a good part of that is probably driven by the capacity reductions, but I think it's just way too early to speculate. I think it's really going to probably be until we get into the WAVE season that we're going to have a pretty good handle on what we're going to see in Europe next year.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. That's definitely helpful. And then, I guess, just a little bit specific color on Pullmantur. How is that going? I know that's part of the itinerary in overall deployment-related changes there. But how is that, specifically, within the context of a very challenged European environment?","Richard D. Fain","Very challenged. You're absolutely right. Spain, of course -- we've talked about 2 things that are impacting Europe, Tim; we've talked about the impact of the tragedy in Italy, and we've talked about the impact on the economy. And both impact Spain, and particularly, it's probably bigger on the economic side. Spain is clearly one of the most challenged economies in Spain. And that is the euphemism, I think, we all use because it is really a very difficult economic environment. And so it is one of the biggest sufferers within our fleet. Having said that, I think the management of Pullmantur has done an outstanding job of dealing with a very difficult situation, and they have done that both by positioning themselves better within Spain but also by shifting a lot of their capacity out. So Pullmantur, for example, has gone from -- I think it was 87% Spanish customer base to now closer to 40% Spanish customer base, as they shift demand to places like South America and Brazil. But unfortunately, if there's one particularly painful area and one that looks like it's -- may be with us for a while, I would have to say the Spanish economy fits that bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","For North American source passengers, just over the last month or so, kind of any color on the change in trend of those passengers going to Europe and maybe if there's any airfare impact on those bookings.","Adam M. Goldstein","Greg, it's Adam. We certainly have heard a fair amount anecdotally and from certain travel agents, and to some degree, from the packaged tour sector about higher European airfares being an impediment to American travelers going to Europe. I think on the last call, I mentioned that one of the options that we have, because we're marketing at a high level in both North America and Europe, is that to the extent that European customers might not buy our cruise products in Europe as aggressively, then we could market more to North Americans and to some degree, fill in. And so notwithstanding the anecdotal stories about high airfares as an impediment, in fact, the percentage of our customers on our European cruises in 2012 that are coming from North America will be a few percentage points higher than what they were last year or what we had originally expected them to be. It's not a seismic shift, but it is slightly higher, which means that notwithstanding whatever the airfare impediments have been, we have, in fact, been able to get some additional help from North America with the various challenges that we face in Europe.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. No, that's helpful. And I'm just wondering if over the last month or 2, there was any change in that trend.","Adam M. Goldstein","I don't think that there has been a notable change in that trend. We mentioned earlier that we've been able to drive late business in Europe, albeit at discounted rates. And that is primarily a function of European sourcing. So that's probably more where the action is at the moment.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. And my second question, just from European-source business, just -- and again, if you look over the last month or 2, the change in trend, is it Southern Europe that softened a little bit or is it also Northern Europe or is it broad-based?","Adam M. Goldstein","The only trend that I would note -- I don't even know if it's fair to call it a trend. It was a big question as to whether we would see significant late booking business in Europe from the European countries as we headed into July, August for the sailings that are occurring in August, September, October. And what we see is that we are in fact able to drive the late business at good volume. Clearly, not at the rates we would like to be commanding for these products, but we are able to drive the business. So that is coming from actually all European-source markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Katz with MorningStar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Maybe you can talk just a little bit about how you guys think about your hedging strategy. And has it changed at all, with respect to at least currency and the volatility in oil prices in recent months?","Brian J. Rice","Sure, Jamie, it's Brian. In terms of the fuel strategy, we disclosed in our press release our hedging, and it's pretty thorough, frankly, going out. We are in the money for the balance of 2012 and for 2013. The hedges are effectively neutral beyond that point. We're pretty methodical in the way that we hedge our oil. We have certain targets that we'd like to hit on a quarterly basis. So we'll be rolling in some minor hedges. We're not trying to speculate with fuel prices, we're really trying to just protect ourselves. Interestingly, the good news this year is, we tend to have the exposure generally in the 50% range of fuel prices, and we're pleased to see that this year, that the inverse correlation between the dollar and fuel has returned. And as you can see on our bridge slide, bunker prices in FX were somewhat neutral to our latest guidance. So we have that natural hedge. We don't really do any hedging on FX on an operating basis. We have traditionally had a higher portion of our newbuild cost hedged. We've been a little bit more bearish on the euro, so we've not had quite as much exposure there. Then we tend to have a little natural hedge on our P&L for that. So I think we've been less aggressive  hedging our newbuilds. And as a consequence, if we were to hedge those today, we'd have a benefit from when we originally entered the contract, specifically for Sunshine.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then thinking back, I can't recall another time where there has been this many years in a row of weak consumer spending. Is there -- has there ever been a time like this in the past where you really thought about capital deployment and changing it because maybe there's something more structural rather than cyclical happening? Or has the way that you are thinking about capital spending going forward changed at all recently?","Brian J. Rice","Well, I think, obviously, the biggest portion of our CapEx is newbuilds. And as Richard alluded to, if you go back to the 1990s, you were looking at 10% growth. If you look at the early 2000, you had high single-digit growth. And we're now targeting more load to the top end, mid single-digit growth within a given year. We have been investing in CapEx in our existing fleet rather than a whole lot of new capacity. As Richard mentioned in his comments, we don't have a newbuild in 2013, and we have only 1 in '14 and '15. But we are taking the best practices of both, say, the Oasis-class and Solstice-class vessels that have been extremely successful for us. And we're taking the best practices and retrofitting those. And it's a way of keeping the product fresh and keeping our customers excited about our brands, the product that we offer without adding a tremendous amount of capacity to the market to help our pricing performance. The only other area I'd mentioned that we are investing in right now is within the information technology area. But again, we think that the returns on those investments are going to be tremendous.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","One question that's more focused on North American source passenger. The Caribbean has been strong for at least 4 quarters now. How would you characterize North American demand? Are we -- we're probably not close to 2008 levels, but where do you see it relative to the history?","Adam M. Goldstein","Well, we're, of course, Assia, bigger than we were in 2008. And so the number of guests that we're attracting on these cruises is higher, and the yields are also commensurate with the 2008 levels at this point. So we're not going to sit here and celebrate where we are in terms of our Caribbean yields. We have referred to the business, I think, on a couple of occasions today as being solid. It is up year-over-year, it's commensurate with the best year that we had in 2008. And so it gives us a good foundation on which to think forward about the region and how we operate in it. And with the resurgence of Asia following what happened in Japan last year and the solid positioning in the Caribbean, it allows us to sort of really focus on what we need to be doing in Europe to maximize the opportunity that we have there and deal with the challenges. Hopefully, all of that adds up to a proper foundation for the next few years.","Assia Georgieva","And my second question is a much more of a closer in issue, I guess. You mentioned that European volumes, closed-in volumes, are up at rates down year-on-year. Could we see some further upside over the next couple of months? You did specifically mention July, August volumes for September, October voyages.","Adam M. Goldstein","Well, the volumes essentially will be, need to be higher on a year-over-year basis to closed-in volume because we have a larger capacity hold to fill in Europe because of the way that the market developed this year. So what I have suggested earlier in my comments is that there was a natural question about whether we could, in fact, find that volume for the August, September, October sailings. And at this point, I can say that we are finding that. So the comparatives to last year are really going to be a function of how much capacity there was at this point last year, how much there is at this point this year. But our focus is on making sure that we put the right discounting programs into the market to realize the remaining volume that we need.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","I guess, first, I was hoping you could talk at least some, to the degree that you have any decent data on this, that the market share developments in Europe -- it seems to me you guys have 2 benefits in Europe. The first is that your brands are not really the focus of a lot of the ire stemming from the Concordia disaster. Second is the fact that you have the flexibility to adjust the deployment out of Europe. So -- and obviously, Europe has been historically maybe a little bit of a tough nut to crack from a market share perspective. Obviously, the entire region is challenged. But it would seem that maybe you guys are a potential beneficiary from a market share perspective, maybe realize a little bit of a price premium. So just this year, can you talk about sort of what you're seeing from a market share perspective? And certainly given the 10% capacity reduction there, how do you think about strategically going after market share in Europe next year?","Adam M. Goldstein","James, it's Adam again. I should note first that in the U.K. market, which is, I believe, still the second largest market in cruising today, we have had a significant market share and have been a major player in that market for over 10 years, and we'll continue to be a major player there. It's really been on the continent of Europe and especially in Southern Europe where we have ratcheted up our presence and our sales and marketing efforts. It doesn't influence market share that much in the short to medium term, to be honest, because our competitors are also investing in Europe and growing and putting ships there. But we have seen the opportunities that emanate from a very large vacation market that's catching on to cruising, and we expect to be a long-term player there. I did mention before when I was talking about the fact that the company will be down 10% in capacity next year over this year in Europe that we've made certain adjustments at the margins, some of which have to do with increasing our presence in Asia. And what we can see is that the industry overall is making some changes, which will probably result in Europe having a slightly less share of the overall cruise industry in 2013 than it had in 2012. But just to be clear, I'm talking about something like about 33% this year to maybe somewhere between 31% and 32% next year. So again, it's not a seismic change, but it does reflect the fact that the industry and our company's assets are mobile. And over a 2- to 3-year period, especially when we do our deployment cycles, we're able to make changes that are reflective of the market opportunities and challenges that we see. And so some of that is going on with us next year in Europe. So we will continue to be a significant player there.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Very helpful. And then second question, sort of moving our attention to -- beyond Europe. I'd like to echo the comments on the really helpful increased disclosure here. I was hoping you could just bottom line some of the trends, x Europe. It looks like pricing came down a little bit in the Caribbean and Alaska, but you're obviously helped in Asia. Was the net result of those 3 items essentially in line with how you felt the year would play out as of April? And I think you gave us ticket yields, ticket yield expectations for the year, up 5% to 6%, x Europe. What did that look like 3 months ago or even heading into the year when you thought about excluding Europe trends for 2012?","Brian J. Rice","Jim, this is Brian. I would say that, particularly over the last 3 months, excluding Europe, we're pretty much exactly where we thought we would be. I would say Caribbean is spot on. I would say Asia is probably a little bit better than we expected, and Alaska, we would just be an eyelash lower than we would have anticipated. When you ask about the beginning of the year, I think that the 5% to 6% on the balance of the non-Europe would have been a little bit higher, and I say that mainly because of the impacts that we saw on Concordia. We have been able to recover a lot of the gap that we saw in Q2 and Q3 on the non-European products, but clearly, there's been much more pronounced impact on Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Egger with Topeka Capital Markets.","Brian D. Egger - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You may have already asked this question. I was off the line for a second. But I wanted to know if you could parse a little bit between a level of impact of the Eurozone-related demand weakness in terms of Northern Europe versus Southern Europe. And to the degree that there's been discounting that you can identify with the Eurozone crisis, could you maybe give us a little better sense of -- as in past disturbances related to the Concordia accident, whether or not this seems to be more Mediterranean market-centric and less related to your Northern European source customers?","Adam M. Goldstein","Brian, this is Adam. First, I think it's worth reinforcing that the Mediterranean market is just a bigger market. Because there's more volume, there's more happening there than Northern Europe. So they're not equal size. So bearing that in mind, we've also indicated during the course of the call that we -- in relation to our original expectations, we've faced more pricing pressure and have had to do a higher level of discounting and I guess you could say, work harder for the business in the Mediterranean than we have had to do in Northern Europe. All of it is a challenge, but since you asked about the relative degree of challenge, it's been greater in the Med than in the North.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kass with BlueMountain Capital.","Michael Kass","I was wondering if you could provide a little bit of color with regard to the deployment-related endeavors, the impact on net cruise costs kind of going into 2013. Should some of that constitute a tailwind? Will some of that be onetime costs versus what you expect to be kind of ongoing, whether it's distribution, spending-related, et cetera? How should we think about the -- as you referred to the full year impact this year of that, how that will translate into next year?","Adam M. Goldstein","Well, every year, Michael, there are a series of deployment changes which take place throughout the brands and, therefore, the fleet. Some of them drive higher net cruise costs, some of them lower. I don't see anything particularly special about 2013 as it relates to deployment-driven cost changes at the margins of the business. I would say, in that respect, it's a fairly stable outlook. But there, of course, will be many different variables that affect the overall cost development. I just don't see that one as being particularly notable.","Michael Kass","Sorry, I meant the lapping of the deployment initiatives that you've announced and are putting in place this year, which you've broken out the costs and the revenue impact of those. On the cost side, will you, on a comparable year-over-year basis, benefit next year? Are these onetime costs or are these costs that will reoccur in 2013?","Adam M. Goldstein","We see next year -- and as a respect to what you're talking about, we see next year as being more or less neutral in comparison to this year on those factors.","Michael Kass","Okay. And then just lastly, I was wondering, could you provide any breakdown of what your capacity is going to be by region for the remainder of the year and for 2013? In other words, just to refreshen, I'm just trying to get a sense for what the overall capacity increase is likely to be, for example, in Asian next year, year-over-year.","Brian J. Rice","We're looking for that, if you can just give me one second. Let's see, I don't have it for the balance of the year, I have it for the full year.","Michael Kass","Oh, sure.","Brian J. Rice","We -- for 2012, the Caribbean is about 42%, 43%. Europe is about 30%. Asia is about -- if we take Asia and the South Pacific, we're looking at about 8% there. Alaska is about 4%, and then I would just put the others in an All Other category. I'm sorry, Michael, we don't seem to have '13 at that level. If you could give Ian Bailey a call, he can provide that to you.","Michael Kass","Okay. And then just -- if I could just tie it in with the European waiting. Are you -- you mentioned the 10%-or-so decline in Europe overall. Is there a sizable shift next year in terms of Southern versus Northern?","Adam M. Goldstein","There is a slight shift in market sourcing towards the U.K. but not a big shift in the deployment of ships. That was between North and Med.","Brian J. Rice","We just want to thank everyone for joining us today. We realize today's a very busy earnings call day, so we do appreciate you dialing in. If you have any further questions, Ian will be available throughout the day. Have a good one.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now hand today's call over to Mr. Jason Liberty. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason Liberty","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Laura Hodges, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides which have been posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com. Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide.","During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.","Richard will begin by providing an overview of the business. I will follow with the recap of our second quarter results, provide an update on the business environment, and then provide an update on our full year and third quarter guidance for 2015. We will then open the call for your questions. Richard?","Richard Fain","Thank you, Jason, and thanks to all of you in the investment community for joining us this morning. There's a lot of good stuff to talk about. Overall the year continues to turn out as of expected. Revenues are a little better, costs are up slightly and our earnings are back to within a nickel of our January guidance. To put this in perspective, foreign exchange and fuel have bounced around during the year and today have cost us a net of a negative $0.21 versus our original guidance.","It was on this call a year ago that we first publicly announced our Double-Double program. And that anniversary seems like a great time to update you on our progress. The program is solidly on track to meet our twin goals of doubling our 2014 profit and reaching double-digit ROIC by 2017. The three pillars of the program were main, modest capacity growth, strong cost controls and rising revenue yields. These three pillars have not changed and they remain at the core of everything that we do.","Today I would like to focus on the last two of these pillars as moderate capacity growth is firmly enhanced. Beginning on the cost side, we remain steadfast in our commitment to maintaining a cost-conscious culture. While our cost guidance is up slightly from April, it's still lower than our initial guidance of up 1% or better. This is due to the diligence of our teams and finding efficiencies and building synergies throughout our business.","Most recently, we merged our single branded marine department into one world-class marine organization. The intent of this consolidation was to facilitate the sharing of best practices and to drive further efficiencies throughout our fleet. I look forward to updating you as this develops. We do believe that our cost culture as well in place and remains on course. But we really are not expecting this to be the main driver of our earnings trajectory. Rather, we expect our focus here will be to continue the hold costs to a realistic level. But the final and the most important pillar in the Double-Double is growing revenue.","And one of the key drivers of growing revenue is stimulating quality demand in the marketplace for our products. That's why we're increasing our marketing investment modestly for the back half of the year. As we shared in prior calls, we remain in the best book position in our company's history. And investing in additional marketing now will help us to further seed this healthy position into 2016.","Another key driver of revenue growth is our new builds. And Quantum of the Seas and the Anthem of the Seas have definitely not disappointed. They both received a warm reception in their respective markets of China and the United Kingdom and their performance is nothing short of terrific.","With the addition of these new builds to our fleet, as well is Ovation of the Seas and Harmony of the Seas joining us in the quarter two of next year, the growth of our Asia-Pacific region, you will begin to notice, somewhat less seasonality in our business and more of an alignment in the supply and demand environments.","Speaking of seasonality, it's worth commenting on the timing of our profits. We continually emphasize that we manage our business on an annual basis not a quarterly one. Traditionally, we have referred to the seasonality of our products and that is often correlated with the quarters. But that phenomenon is now starting to shift.","We are lengthening the European season that's historically solely been in the summer months and we added capacity in the Asia-Pacific region to take advantage of the warm weather in Australia, New Zealand, for the winter, all winter and we purposeful ships for cold-weather cruising in China and growth in the Southeast Asia region. The outcome of all that is that what was historically low season for demand in North America has become a lower season for supply as well. By placing supply in higher-yielding growth markets in other parts of the world, we get a better balance of the supply demand equation. And over time that helps mitigate what was traditionally particularly strong pricing pressure in the quote - \"off-season\" - unquote.","I want to emphasize, we are not eliminating seasonality but we are taking steps to moderate it. You will notice that I refer to seasons and not to quarters. But we've always thought of our business in those terms. There used to be a cool breakdown of when high season started and ended. As our global footprint continues to expand and our product stretch over elongated seasons, it makes it harder to get a full picture of our business in just one quarter. However, doing this provides better yearly results as well as a more balanced cadence to our earnings. We believe that that represents a true benefit to our shareholders even if it makes quarterly shifts harder to quantify.","I would also like to comment, as I have in the past, on the level of accuracy you and we should expect in our revenue forecasts. Frankly, we've all gotten a little bit spoiled by the historical track record from our revenue growers. This year, for example, we focused on deviations of 10th of a percent. We try and interpret these trends from these deviations when the truth is, that the deviations are way within our normal margin of error. We will continue to provide our best thinking about the future but we would also caution that in a business as large and as complex as ours variances, especially between quarters will be the norm.","Now before I turn the call back to Jason, I wanted to update everyone on the early signs that we're seeing from my price integrity policy. As a reminder, we adopted this policy to address the kind of deep last-minute discounts that are so frustrating to our guests and our travel partners and ultimately so damaging to our brands. Depending on the sourcing of the type of cruise, the last-minute might be 10, 20, or 30 days out but from that point on our policy is to hold our price at the prior level.","We believe that such a policy has to be clear and explicit. Only by setting firm measurable and non-big U.S. terms can we create the kind of credibility that's so important to the program success. Vague efforts don't provide the kind of consistency that is so important to our guests and our travel partners. We began this new policy in March and we're sticking to it. It's still early days but the impact we have seen from a load factor perspective is relatively small and it's in line with our expectations.","Our intent with the policy is to achieve happier guests, travel agents, and better branding. It does seem we're on the right track in fact, during the last period we extended the program. We went for a policy coverage of 10, 20, 30 days before the cruise to covering 10, 20, 30 or 40 days prior to sailing. We recognize that this policy is costing us some money in the short term. But we believe that in the long term it will pay handsome dividends.","With that, I'll turn the phone back over to Jason. Jason?","Jason Liberty","Think you, Richard. I will begin by taking you through our results for the second quarter. Unless I state differently, all metrics will be on a constant currency basis. We have summarized our second quarter results on slide two.","For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $0.84 per share which was approximately $0.14 above our guidance. Foreign exchange and fuel rates benefited earnings by $0.07 per share. The balance of the beat was driven by the timing of cost and better than expected close-in pricing in the Caribbean and China.","Revenue yields were up 4.2% for the quarter, approximately 70 basis points better than guidance. Strength in the Caribbean and China drove the majority of the upside. Shipboard revenue came in as expected for the second quarter and was up 3.3% year-over-year, driven by improvement in beverage, short excursion and internet.","As we discussed in our April earnings call, the volatility in the currency market led to a modest pullback in onboard spending for our non-U.S. guests in the first quarter. To help mitigate further deterioration in spending, we took additional commercial actions that included bundling onboard amenities in the ticket price, as well as encouraging pre-cruise sales of average, short excursion, and specialty restaurant packages in local currency. While still early, these tactics are being received favorably and are helping us reduced further risk.","Net cruise costs excluding fuel were up 3.4% for the quarter, which was 110 basis points better than guidance. This was mainly due to the timing of shipboard project that will be carried out in the second half of the year.","Now I would like to update you on what we are seeing in booking environment. Overall, while there are always puts and takes at the product level, the back half of the year is shaping up about as we had expected when we provided guidance three months ago. We are seeing a nice year-over-year improvement in the Caribbean pricing, record deals in Europe and an extremely favorable reaction to Quantum's arrival in China. Our book load factors in APDs are meaningfully higher than same time last year for the back half of the year.","Despite our overall capacity increase, we have significantly fewer staterooms left to sell than at this point last year. This will translate into better pricing on future business. The Caribbean is our largest single product group representing 44% of 2015 capacity. As you will remember, the Caribbean was extremely promotional for most of last year and into Q1 of this year. We're now in a very different pricing environment from these itineraries, in fact, trends have been a little bit better that we were experiencing even a few months ago. And we have slightly increased our overall Caribbean revenue expectation.","Prices on new Caribbean bookings have been well above last year for some time and have been exceeding 2013 levels for the past six weeks. This trend is clearly benefiting close-in sales but will be particularly beneficial to the fourth quarter where load factors are up significantly versus same time last year and rates on book business also worked nicely.","European itineraries represent about 22% of our overall 2015 capacity. Our Western Mediterranean itineraries continue to attract strong demand and prices exceeding last year's levels. Prices and demand for lower the Seas in Barcelona and Rome have more than substantiated our decision to put in Oasis class ship in Europe for the full summer season. And we look forward to welcoming her sister ship Harmony of the Seas to Europe when she debuts next summer.","Expectations for the Eastern Mediterranean product on the other hand are softer than our previous forecast as booking levels were further affected during recent events in the region. Although demand is now back to typical levels, pricing is a bit lower than we were previously expecting for this high-yielding product. Our most significant capacity growth in 2015 is in the Asia-Pacific region. Employment in Asia and Australia is increasing by about 33% year-over-year with the most significant growth occurring in China which is now more than 95% booked.","Quantum of the Seas has been in China for just over a month and is commanding yields that are far superior to other vessels. Validating our decision to send Quantum this year and her sister ship Ovation of the Seas, Tianjin next summer. Most of our other itineraries including Alaskan Bermuda are trending in line with our expectations. Our Latin America business operated by our Pullmantur brand has been significantly softer than we had expected.","As you know the economies of Latin America have struggled recently and their economies have significantly weakened. Thus, all these itineraries only account for a small portion of our capacity; they have struggled to attract quality demand. For the back half of the year, we expect yields to be up more in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. While there are a number of factors contributing to the strong fourth quarter growth, the key drivers are the additions of the high-yielding Quantum and Anthem of the Seas robust year yield growth in the Caribbean, and shifts in capacity from lower to higher yielding itinerary.","We also have medium capacity growth in the Asia-Pacific region in the fourth quarter, with Quantum of the Seas delivering our first winter China product. Also, we have a full quarter of Asia-based Voyager of the Seas which was an extended 35 day dry-dock in Q4 of last year. All of these shifts, when taken together, provide strong tailwinds to Q4 yields.","It is still relatively early in the sailing cycle for 2016, but we are encouraged by our progress. Our APDs and load factors for Q1 are well ahead of last year with the Caribbean showing particular strength. While it's still too early to provide specific guidance, we do expect nice yield growth next year.","In summary, our booking environment and the cadence by quarter is as expected for the back half of the year. Taking into account all we just told you, I would now like to summarize our updated guidance for the full year in third quarter.","If you turn to slide three, you will see our updated guidance for the full year 2015. Net revenue yields are expected to increase in the range of 2.9% to 3.9% versus previous guidance of up to 2.5% to 4%. Our strong revenue performance in Q2 as well as our solid book position of over 94% has helped us mitigate the lower end of the previous range and raise our midpoint accordingly.","Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be better than flat. We made a slight adjustment to previous guidance driven by further expected investments and marketing initiatives to drive additional first-time cruisers and see 2015 business. Since our April earnings call, the dollar has weakened 1.9% versus our basket of currencies and fuel costs have also declined creating a tailwind to earning. As a result, our earnings for the year are being increased by approximately $0.15 due to currency and fuel, while our revenue strength in Q2 is being reinvested in marketing to help further strengthen our book position in 2016, which looks favorable at this early stage.","Our fuel costs for the year have decreased slightly to $818 million, driven mainly by rate and we're 53% hedged for the remainder of 2015 at a price of $630 per metric ton. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency change rates, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to be between $4.65 and $4.75 for the year.","Now I would like to walk you through our third-quarter guidance on slide four. Our deployment mix shift substantially in Q3, we have 42% of our capacity in Europe, 25% in the Caribbean, 11% in China, and 9% in Alaska. The quarter is booked nicely ahead at same time last year both in APD and load factor. And we expect a net yield increase in the range of 3.5% to 4%. Net cruise excluding fuel are expected to be down in the range of 1% to 1.5%. And we have included $210 million of fuel expense for the quarter.","Taking all of this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $2.70 for the quarter.","With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel.","Steven Wieczynski","So the Caribbean clearly is firming up. And I don't think you can quantify this but maybe more from a quantitative perspective. I was wondering how much of that closing pricing the strength in closing pricing you can tie to your better frontloading practices which has started to implement last year? And then I guess also how do you plan to attack the frontloading again this year in the upfront discounting as we move into the back part of this year for 2016? Thanks","Richard Fain","Hi, Steve thanks for the questions. In terms of the Caribbean itself, clearly us having a better book position going into the quarter helped us improve pricing because you went through the quarter. I just think that overall by worsening better demand especially on the short product. For the Caribbean which is leading us to those better results.","Adam Goldstein","Yeah and Steve, I think your question on the philosophy, I think in general we think that it's helpful to have more enhance. It takes pressure off of the last-minute bookings, if it's in with our objective of trying to be more consistent on our pricing. And I think that there's probably one thing that frustrates the travel agents that we work with as much as anything else is those late last-minute discounts. And we can't afford to frustrate them. And so, by getting more on the books early, we're in a better position to adjust our pricing on the later bookings and get a more level kind of pricing policy. So I think philosophically, you've seen it this year, you'll see it again next year, where we are trying to get more in hands earlier on.","Steven Wieczynski","Okay, great. And then second question around 2016, you gave some pretty good early color there. And I know this is a year - there were clearly some moving items that folks didn't properly account for when they were modeling out their respective quarters. And as we look into 2016, are there any big picture items that you would point out today that you want folks to be thinking of as a start to get more focused on next year?","Adam Goldstein","Well, Steve, I think the cadence of the quarters will generally be the same. I think that the things that I would point out specifically is that we do take delivery in the second quarter next year for Harmony and for Ovation. Ovation will take a similar journey that Quantum took over to Tianjin. So that will have a similar impact, but I think there's also the need to account for Harmony who will come in the second quarter and then will be sailing out of the Mediterranean.","A - Michael Bayley","And, Steve, just - this is Michael. Just to add that Harmony will be operating out of Barcelona in the Mediterranean, but also Allure will be returning to the Caribbean. So we'll have some fantastic product in the Caribbean.","Steven Wieczynski","Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.","A - Michael Bayley","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ian Rennardson from Jefferies.","Ian Rennardson","Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. Just on this extra marketing, could you quantify the amount and what specifically you are aiming to do with that please?","Richard Fain","Hi, Ian. It's really a modest incremental amount on marketing. And, again, we are in a good book position for the future. And I think we're just looking for opportunity to expand that base and we think we can do that through spending a little bit additional money on marketing. But it's not in any specific market, it's more general, and again, it's modest.","Ian Rennardson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning. Richard and Jason, you either can choose who want to take this. But I'm just having a tough time reconciling the comments that the back half is expected with the comments that the Caribbean looks like it's coming in a bit better than expected . And because of what you're seeing you are expanding your discounting policy now out 40 days. It just seems to me that with your business improving - with the business that might've improved incrementally, you might have been talking about the second half in a little bit of a different way. So while I'm always in favor of conservatism I was just hoping if you could help me reconcile that.","Richard Fain","Well, it's always good to know that your favor of conservatism, Felicia. I think the way I would put it into perspective and I try to address it in my commentary that we're definitely seeing strong demand coming from the Caribbean and as I commented, we would actually - the back half of the year is better for the Caribbean in our current thinking. But that is helping really offset some weakening in the Eastern Mediterranean and Pullmantur which is been struggling in Latin America mainly in Mexico and somewhat also in Brazil.","So again, we always see these puts and takes within our environment which is why we kind of manage this portfolio of products and brands and that in itself balances out the back half of the year.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. That's helpful, thank you. And then just maybe I'm splitting here but if you look at your occupancy in the quarter it was about 20 basis points lower year-over-year, so I was just wondering if that was a function of some of the new policies that you have implemented and you're on board continue to grow nicely with perhaps lower people onboard, less people on board perhaps so if you could just talk about how you drove your on-boards as well? Thanks.","Richard Fain","Yeah, actually it really is very much on the margins. The price integrity piece is a small piece of it. Also in the quarter we feel we had one cancelled sailing which was higher occupancy sailing that also affected a little bit but it really is on the margins in terms of what affected the load factor for the period.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And but just getting through the bookings, I mean, can you just elaborate a little bit more about the programs that you've implemented or perhaps stimulate some demand despite the FX headwinds?","A - Michael Bayley","Hi, Felicia its Michael. Yes, I think we kind of caught on to this quite quickly in the first quarter so we implemented some commercial actions fairly quickly that included the bundling of value adds, not only in the ticket price in terms of the promotional activity that we put into the marketplace such as beverage included et cetera, as well as encouraging the pre-purchase of various onboard products and services, specifically beverage, short excursion specialty restaurant in local currency and we put more energy behind the promotion and the marketing of that into the international markets, because that was our area of more concern.","And, obviously, while it's still early, our tactics have been received well and helping us mitigate any further risk, so we feel quite good about the actions that we've taken. It's important to note that we still anticipate yield increases in onboard revenue this year and it will be the fourth year in a row where we see those increases.","And we've also seen some stars such as Voom, the fastest internet at sea that we have with Royal Caribbean International. We put a lot of energy behind the promotion of Voom, the fastest internet at sea, and we've seen a considerable uptake in how many people are participating and purchasing Voom.","Felicia Hendrix","Great. That was helpful.","Richard Fain","Felicia, its Richard here. And it's just might worth - might be worth adding, Michael referred into the bundling. And I think, again, philosophically speaking, that is a growing trend. We're seeing more - we're doing more of that and that does sometimes tend to cause a little confusion on the numbers, because things can shift between ticket revenue and onboard revenue.","But we're releasing a desire on the part of our guests and very much on the parts of the travel agents who find it is a much better way to present something, much better way to sell it if it's all included in the package. And we started that last year. You saw the 123 go at Celebrity. This year a big shift probably one of the more dramatic shifts on Celebrity with our Go Big Better Best program. And these are in fact moving us to an even more inclusive packaging and we think that gets us more net revenue and happier guests, happier travel agents. So I think we will probably see more of that as we go forward.","Felicia Hendrix","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Scholes from SunTrust.","Patrick Scholes","Hi, good morning. Have you seen any of your competitors following suit on the holding the line on last minute discounting?","Michael Bayley","Hi. Patrick, it's Michael. We are really focused on what we're doing and we're paying a lot of attention to the feedback that we get from travel partners, distribution and of course, our customers. So we feel really positive about the actions that we took back in March and we are feeling good about the direction that it is heading for us.","Patrick Scholes","Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Hardiman from Wedbush Securities.","James Hardiman","Hi. Good morning. Couple of clarifications here, Richard, as you talk about the bundling of certain traditionally onboard items into the ticket price, can you help us figure out how exactly you guys are accounting for those? Is the entirety of that still going to be counted in onboard? It seems like there from the consumer's perspective there might be some blurring of the lines but how should we think about what has traditionally been on board being put in the ticket prices and how we should expect that the show up in your numbers?","Jason Liberty","Hi, James its Jason. In terms of the bundling it really kind of depends on the program itself. And as we've commented in the past which is why we really guide on a net revenue yield side depending on the offer, it could be recorded into onboard revenue or ticket revenue. So it's - all I would say is that there's probably we'll create more variability between those two lines but again I think that's why you're consistently see us guide on the overall revenue picture.","James Hardiman","Got it. And then just another clarification here, you talked about the price integrity policy being a negative in the short-term. Just to clarify, is that a comment on the occupancy being negative by itself or is that the net impact of pricing in occupancy that's currently negative and if so, when do you think that goes from being a negative to hopefully being a positive? Thanks.","Jason Liberty","Yes, the main impact is on occupancy because what happens is if you can do these last-minute discounts, these big last-minute discounts you end up with a few empty cabins and so you offer these extraordinary discounts that allows you to fill up at the end. And if you take away that tool, which is essentially what we've done, then you will lose some of those people, obviously.","The reason we believe there is an offset, which is that we get a more consistent than higher-priced during the period. At this stage, those numbers are really quite small. So we're not suggesting that's a major driver of this. But it is there and it is hurting us in the short-term. And I think that we will feel that for some time well into 2016. And - but we think the long-term benefit, and I really do want to emphasize, the benefit isn't just that we will illuminate these people who say let's wait to book at the low price.","It's really very important to the branding. It's hard to set yourself out as we are a brand that is high-quality and high respect in the industry. And you can have us for half-price. So the ability to maintain your image as a higher quality product, which really has to permeate everything you do, is probably a big driver, as big a driver of our thinking is anything else.","James Hardiman","That's really helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up on that last point. I don't know if you've been able to do any consumer research on - for the psychology of this pricing program. Is there any evidence that tells you that the customer that hasn't bought because prices didn't come down at the last minute, that they are just waiting for those prices to come down and when they don't will ultimately buy a cruise or is there a chance that you've lost that customer longer term?","Jason Liberty","Well, there's no question that some people do wait to the end. Again, I really want to emphasize, in terms of quantitative analysis, we're just starting on this policy we have three or four months under our belt. And I think it's something we will continue to look at closely, but we're pretty confident, we have been in the business for a long time, our revenue people understand the dynamics of that, and I think we feel pretty confident that the direction we are going will be well received and will help both in the long run on the revenue side but also on the branding side.","James Hardiman","Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim Conder","Thank you. First of all, just taking the approach of during the period of strength to implement this policy is key, so kudos on that part. A couple clarifications, one, the marketing, how much of that is skewed towards building earlier your North American source passenger base? And then, secondly, in Asia, if you can maybe - I don't know if you can just put it into those two buckets. Second question comes from Celebrity versus the Royal Caribbean International brand performance, how that's looking year-to-date and for the year especially in Europe. And then Pullmantur, you call that out specifically, how much of the drag there has been demand versus euro being the functional currency and then Jason just remind us of the pending accounting change later on this year with Pullmantur?","Richard Fain","On the marketing side, Tim, I think first, again, just to point out, it's a very small amount of money and we said we are really trying to apply it to further expand a very good book of business we have today for the future and specifically for 2016. So the spread of it is not necessarily key western Asia. It's more to further accelerate our position and get at the very small amount of money. I will just take a real quick on in terms of the pending accounting change as we said it's something that is and will continue to be under consideration in terms of the timing of when we make that change. For us we need to make sure the processes and the systems are in place before we close at two-month lag with Pullmantur. But we will certainly advise the timing when we implement that.","Tim Conder","Okay.","Richard Fain","I just answered the - in the Pullmantur your question on the demand versus the impact of the euro. It's both. The demand has been a real problem, but so has the currency. And in this case, the currency that's hurting us isn't so much the euro it's more the Latin American currencies. So the euro has deteriorated versus the dollar but in Latin America, in Brazil, in Argentina, in Ecuador and Colombia etcetera we are looking at closer to 25% kind of drops. So it is both the economy and the currency which is not what we were hoping to see at this point.","And then Tim just to comment on Celebrity versus Royals performance in Europe. I mean, I think as you know, we basically kind of comment on the market and product as a whole but they are both doing well in Europe. The strength of having a lower there and having Anthem is definitely a nice tailwind for Royal and the European season for us.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then finally gentlemen, on the bundling for the international market that you've been doing and appears to be helping out there, is that bundle fully commissionable to travel agents or is it only the ticket component of that bundle?","Michael Bayley","Hi, Tim, it's Michael. There's really two types of bundling, there's the bundling that goes through in a promotion through the distribution channel which becomes commissionable unless it's obviously a direct booking. And then, there's the bundling that we've been doing in - and the selling of pre-cruise direct to our customers, which of course is - in that case is not commissionable.","Tim Conder","Okay. Thanks for the clarification there.","Michael Bayley","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS.","Robin Farley","Great. Thanks. To questions. One is, one of the nice things here in the release was that China drove some of the close-in and bookings and I guess you really kind of think of that as being sold through charters so far in advance that may be you wouldn't benefit from close out strength. It would just be the agent that had chartered it. So I wonder if you could kind of just give a little color around how you're getting the benefit of that close in.","Michael Bayley","Hi, Robin, it's Michael. It's - that's correct. A lot of our distribution and sales goes through the larger retailers, but we've also started to move a little bit further into FIT and individual sales and bookings as a brand, so we're seeing some benefit because those changes that we implemented about a year or so ago.","Robin Farley","Great. And then, just a housekeeping thing, looking at your capacity guidance. It looks like it's just that - you actually go out a couple of years, it looks like your capacity growth in 2017 is a little bit lower and in 2018 is a little higher, is that just - and you don't have anything getting delivered that would be late so is it a dock or something that you didn't expect in 2017 that's shifting out a little bit?","Michael Bayley","Well, 2017, there are no new ships being delivered in that year so the capacity increase is really related to fall over of Harmony and Ovation which comes in 2016. That's really what drives the lower capacity amount, and in 2018, we do have always Oasis 4 coming in.","Robin Farley","And just to clarify, I understand you don't have delivery in 2017 and I know the increase is from the carryover but it's actually versus your guidance a quarter ago, it's not a full percentage point but it's a lower rate of increase not just lower versus 2015 but lower versus your previous for 2017, so I'm just wondering what had changed?","Michael Bayley","Well, I think one thing that I can think of that has changed, which is Splendour of the Seas was sold to Thomson Cruises and that ship leaves our fleet in 2016.","Robin Farley","Okay. Great. That's probably it. And then just the last thing is, especially given Richard's opening comments about variances and guidance and things shifting, I'm just curious why take the 10 basis points off the top of your full year range given that it's a range and that's not a huge difference at the top end of the range. I'm just wondering if there's something in particular that made you want to just take those 10 basis points off the top?","Michael Bayley","Yes, it's more, Robin, that typically at this point of the year obviously we have, as we talked about in the call, we have over 94% of our revenue on the books. We typically have 100 basis point range around the midpoint of our guidance and so that's really what set the 2.9% to 3.9%.","Robin Farley","This really is - it's more that you just have at this point. Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Michael Bayley","You got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs.","Laura Conigliaro","Good morning. This is Laura stepping in for Steve this morning. So I was just wondering it seems that the pricing integrity program negatively impact your 2Q 2015 earnings are looking consumers getting retrained. But the closing demand was still very strong in the Caribbean. Could you just parse out that dynamic for us so with the closing demand would have been stronger if you didn't have that pricing integrity program?","And then my second question was just on China as we try to understand that mix shift what sort of pricing premium does that market get and are you seeing any kind of cannibalization there? Thank you.","Richard Fain","On the price integrity side, first off as we the price integrity program really addresses certain products that are 10, 20, 30 days out and where we saw strength in the second quarter was really the short Caribbean product which typically the late booking product anyways and that's kind of what drove the strength in the second quarter. So it's not necessarily, as we talked about the price integrity program in itself with the balance for the year was a very small negative impact to our revenue that we had communicated on our last call.","And so if we do see strong closing demand especially in the short product that will drive it and then obviously we get guests who will pay the price out there that will also benefit our revenue relative to our expectations.","Richard Fain","Hi. On the question with regards to China premiums, I think we don't really go into details on premiums but we're obviously very happy with the performance of our China products this year in 2015 in the market and I think bringing Quantum into Shanghai has proven to be very successful.","It's been exceptionally well-received and I guests are having a phenomenal time and our trade partners are really happy with the quality of that product in the market. So we're seeing the kind of premiums that you would expect to get when you put a brand-new asset of that quality into the marketplace","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. Thanks. Just pointing to your opening earmarks where you mentioned you expect nice yield growth next year. And that does seem to be the general consensus from other cruise lines based on public comments that are out there.","What do you think is that really the key driver for those short bookings and even pricing for 2016? And then, as we progress throughout 2015 into early 2016 is there any dynamic that you would - that you can see that would reverse that? Has everyone pulled forward demand? It doesn't seem like that's the case, but is there anything that we should think about as we get into 2016?","Richard Fain","Hi, Greg. First off, it's very early in the bookings cycle for 2016 and I think what you're seeing is us just continuing to build on a quality book of business. Clearly, the strength in the Caribbean which has a further out booking window is quite helpful. But, again, it is very early and what we know is the patterns that we are seeing is, it's good on the load factor basis and good on a rate basis and that's encouraging for next year. There is a lot of things that could happen that could reverse that position, right, because this is a global business but at this point in time those are the trends that we are seeing and that basically kind of what supports the commentary that we provided.","Greg Badishkanian","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Richard Fain","Thanks Greg.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura.","Harry Curtis","Good morning, everyone. My first question is on your outlook for capacity growth in the traditional markets, Europe and the Caribbean for next year?","Richard Fain","Is it just more of what we are expecting or?","Harry Curtis","I'm sorry, what kind of supply growth do you expect in each of those two markets next year versus this year?","Richard Fain","Well, I think in terms of the Caribbean and Europe you will see very small increases in our capacity for next year. You will see most of the capacity going into the Asia Pacific market with Ovation and the full year of Quantum of the Seas. But you will see marginal growth for the Caribbean in Europe in 2016 based off of our current deployment that has been published.","Harry Curtis","And then overall what are your expectations industry-wide?","Richard Fain","I think on the industry side I would - I expect it to be higher than we're putting in there, there are some competitors that are having some additional capacity in there. Europe I think will be up slightly and Asia will certainly be up with the entry of some of our competitor ships in there going into 2016.","Harry Curtis","And have you got any additional thoughts on the Caribbean?","Richard Fain","I'm sorry, sir one more time?","Harry Curtis","Have you gotten any original - do you have any incremental thoughts on the Caribbean for next year?","Richard Fain","I'm sorry. I do expect the Caribbean to be up probably low to mid-single digits next year which is quite a bit higher than what we're going to have in the Caribbean for next year.","Harry Curtis","Okay. My second question is, if you could discuss the visibility that you have from your travel partners in China next year particularly as you bring the Ovation and are you feeling optimistic that you will have similar kind of demand trends and occupancies?","Michael Bayley","Hi, Harry its Michael. Yes, we are optimistic. And I think Quantum has really done a great job for Royal Caribbean in terms of how people have perceived that product and Royal Caribbean in general. So the reception that we have from Quantum has really added impetus for Ovation. And we're seeing that in terms of the kind of bookings that we are already seeing in 2016 for Ovation. So we feel quite optimistic about performance in China in 2016.","Harry Curtis","Can you give us how well booked you are for 2016 thus far?","Richard Fain","No.","Harry Curtis","Thank you.","Richard Fain","Thanks for trying, Gary.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joel Simkins from Credit Suisse.","Joel Simkins","Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to start with Cuba here. I just wanted to get your sense on how you think this is ultimately going to shape out over the next couple of years. Some of your peers are starting to make some early efforts in that market and I guess - as it fully opens up how quickly could you be down there and could you see direct meaningful capacity in, let's say, 2017 to that opportunity?","Adam Goldstein","Hi, it's Adam. Well, clearly we're excited about the potential opportunity that Cuba presents. Anything that we do and hopefully anything that anyone else does has to be within the confines of the law. As you can imagine, we're actively planning and preparing to incorporate Cuba into our cruise program to the extent that were permitted.","We think we have a lot of things going for us as a company at RCL in terms of our track record of delivering quality destination experiences, the way we've demonstrated the ability to create win-win relationships all around the world, our history of operating above and beyond compliance, all of that we think will bode well for us there.","We have many brands and a large fleet, and therefore quite a number of different operate opportunities to participate in the Cuba opportunity when it opens up. As you can imagine, our normal course of action would be to announce any plans when they're firmed out before. But we are very enthusiastic about the prospects we've all been waiting a long time and we feel like things are beginning to develop in an exciting manner.","Joel Simkins","And one quick follow up in China. I know, obviously, we're still very much early days there, but as you continue to develop these relationships with consumers in that market, and get them signed up in your databases et cetera. Are you starting to see any signs of, let's say, outbound enquiry or demand as these consumers looks to perhaps maybe stay with you in Europe for instance?","Michael Bayley","Hi. Joe, it's Michael. Yes, I mean, we are seeing that. We think that's one of the opportunities. It's not of particular focus at the moment but we certainly recognize it's a significant opportunity over time. That outbound market is significant and we do see an increase in our plan to products certainly into Europe and to the West Coast. So, yes, we think that's a good opportunity.","Joel Simkins","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Assia Georgieva from Infinity Capital.","Assia Georgieva","Good morning. This is Assia. Congratulations on great Q2 results.","Richard Fain","Thank you.","Assia Georgieva","And just one quick question, close-in your pricing seems to be doing quite a bit better despite [indiscernible] and all the other concerns that we've had over the macro economy. I don't know Richard, Michael, anyone would you like to comment on what you're seeing?","Michael Bayley","Hi, it's Michael. You know we've seen this in the past. Europe can be a fickle market at times and there is all of these different variables that come into play in the different European market depending upon what's occurring at the time. We think that Greek situation we did see a slight dip during the whole Greek events and I think that caused the slowdown a little bit. Generally, in terms of the Europeans, and then it all started to come back again. So I think it's just ebb in the flow of the psychology of the marketplace.","Richard Fain","Just to add to that, Assia, also we've commented in the past, we entered the - the European seasons are very strong book of business. And that really has left less inventory on the table for the European consumer which we also believe is also a nice tailwind to the closing pricing that we are seeing within that environment.","Assia Georgieva","Thank you, Jason and thank you Michael. It seems that things have actually turning out pretty well as opposed to what expectations would have been.","Richard Fain","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research.","Dan McKenzie","Hi, good morning, thanks guys. I believe Royal has been trailing a premium cabin space on the Core Royal brands on enhanced cruise experience and enhanced service levels for a price. I'm wondering if you can share any of the early findings? And then secondly how would you characterize the revenue opportunities looking ahead, is this a smaller in size or could it perhaps be material?","Michael Bayley","Hi, Dan its Michael. I think you may be referring to the Royal suite class program that we have - we are about to introduce. We haven't introduced it yet. We're going to roll that out literally in the coming six to seven weeks and its focus very much on inventory in 2016 from spring forward. And that's really part of our focus on segmenting the market segmenting our distribution and making sure that we can provide the kind of product that we think people are willing and able to pay a premium for. So we do have plans on generating an increase in yield in our premium accommodations through the introduction of Royal suite class.","That's the program that we are introducing. Celebrity has had the suite-class in place now I guess for about a year and a quarter, a year and an half. And I think they found out to be quite successful in terms of offering the kind of premium space with a premium on it. The people are certainly willing and able to pay for it. As long as you can bundle the right products and services into that category. We are looking at other categories within the Royal fleet and we think there are further opportunities there.","Dan McKenzie","Okay. Thank you that's helpful. And then, I appreciate oil has collapsed relative to a year ago, but looking further into the future, has Royal make any investments in the biofuel area and from an engineering standpoint is that just simply too complicated or expensive? And I guess, I am beginning to see the airline industry go that direction. But then, related to that how has hedge book changed looking ahead through 2018?","Adam Goldstein","Hi. It's Adam. I'll answer the first part. You may not remember, but once upon a time about 8 to 10 years ago we believe the Royal Caribbean was his angle largest user of biodiesel in the world at that time in any industry. We really were robust and our thinking about the potential than, but as it happened over time for a whole series of different reasons, the attractiveness of using the products and services trended away.","One of which was that the tax benefit that went to the producer of biodiesel was not passed on at all to the end user such as ourselves and we couldn't sustain any economic benefit of the use there. Also we're - it was a little bit rough on the ships at that time, because it was such an immature industry and I could go on, but I won't.","So we don't see at the moment the opportunity to resume that kind of usage. We have been tremendously successful with finding ways of consuming less fuel to get from point A to point B with a whole host of programs. We've got more successful at purchasing fuel and of course our hedging program over time, it's been a great benefit to the company as well. And there's still a lot of opportunities in those areas before we would consider a significant use of bio-fuel on our ship.","And just a comment on our hedge portfolio, which is also outlined in our release. We have increased our position going out. Next year we are 65% hedged and 60% hedged and then 40% and then 10% over the coming years. So we're looking to try to take advantage of this low fuel price environment to help walk in the future.","Dan McKenzie","Thanks for the times, guys.","Adam Goldstein","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from Laura Starr from Nuveen Asset Management.","Laura Starr","Hi, guys. How are you? So as more and more people pay upfront for all these packages whether it's beverages or the dining, are you thinking about what you sell them when they come onboard when they a lot more money, are you thinking about changing what you sell in the stores, adding spa options or classes or different entertainment? I mean I know this is something that would work out over the next couple of years, but are you thinking about that now?","Michael Bayley","Yes, hi, Laura. It's Michael. It's a good point and yes, it's absolutely what we see. So once they pre-purchase the package or whatever the service are that they pre-purchase everybody seems to forget the pre-purchased and then when they come onboard, they bring more dollars or euros or what have you to spend and it does provide more opportunity. I mean in many cases they simply consume and purchase many of the products that we have onboard. But if you think about really all of our brands particularly Royal and celebrity over the past few years, we've been through quite an extensive process of revitalization. We have added multiple retail units, we've enhanced many of the different services, and we've transformed a lot of the products that we sell on board and in many cases to higher-margin products. So that evolution I think is in place and we're quite cognizant of it.","Laura Starr","Okay. But there's nothing else new on the horizon that you can talk about now that would be maybe bigger incremental giving them to spend?","Michael Bayley","Well, one of the things that we're immensely proud of in which only Royal Caribbean has of course is Boom which is the fastest Internet of Sea and that is something that we think we have a significant advantage over and certainly for families with kids. If you've got kids and they come on board and they want to connect and they want to do streaming, they want to play video games we're the only cruise line that they can do that with because of the significant advantage of Boom and that's something that we're seeing certainly in the revenues is generating today as a further opportunity.","Laura Starr","And can you prepay for that Internet right now too?","Michael Bayley","Yes, you can.","Laura Starr","Okay, thanks. Thank you.","Michael Bayley","Thank you.","Jason Liberty","Thank you for your assistance, Kaila, with the call today. And we thank you all for your participation and interest in the company. Laura will be available for any follow-up questions you might have and I wish you all a very great day.","Operator","This is the end of today's call.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Jason Liberty, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason Liberty","Good morning. I would like to thank you for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Rice, our Vice Chairman; Adam Goldstein, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Celebrity Cruises; and Ian Bailey, Vice President of Investor Relations. During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which we have posted on our Investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I'd like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and our other disclosures. Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.","Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview of the business. I will follow with a recap of our third quarter results and will provide an update of the business environment. Adam and Michael will provide a more detailed update on our key markets and products, and then I will walk you through our outlook for the remainder of the year. We will then open the call up for your questions. Richard?","Richard D. Fain","Thank you, Jason. And good morning, everybody. Obviously, it's a pleasure to be announcing better-than-expected earnings, while increasing our guidance for the full year and providing some early indicators for 2014. More importantly, today's results represent another important milestone on our continued journey towards higher returns on our investments and to our shareholders. For years, we've been saying that achieving our financial objectives entails both improving revenue as well as reducing costs. Over this period, we've been investing in our brands, and it's nice to see the results beginning to come through. I'd like to take a moment and review where we are with respect to both our revenue and our cost objectives.","Starting with revenue, the third quarter marked the 14th quarter in a row that we have achieved yield improvements, and we're confident that the fourth quarter will make it 15 in a row. Furthermore, although it is early in the booking cycle, our current projections point to 2014 being the fifth consecutive year that we will post further yield improvements. Of course, you all know that these yield increases have been less than we would have liked due to factors beyond our control. But the fact that we continue to consistently post yield improvements in the face of the recent black swan events provides clear evidence that our strategy is working.","We've invested heavily in revitalizing our ships, expanding our marketing globally and transforming our IT systems. Our guest surveys show that satisfaction levels with our product are at an all-time high, and our employee engagement surveys continue to impress. All of this drives higher yields, and these improving yields show that our investments are paying off. It's taken longer than we would have liked to get here because we've had to deal with more and bigger exogenous events than we would have wished. But now, we're beginning to see the payoff. Now the results of all these efforts are beginning to come through. We've shown our resilience in the face of the various events, and we're beginning to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the power of our brands as the industry recovers from these headwinds. It's reassuring to note that, as we've talked earlier, the external pressures on yield has limited our upside more than it has caused actually yield declines. We have acknowledged that external pressure on yields has limited our upside. We have acknowledged that the Caribbean is a particular concern. Despite this, our more premium Caribbean products, including the Oasis-Class ships and the Solstice-Class ships, continue to enjoy superior pricing and are delivering good returns. As a result, based on our early bookings, we expect our core Caribbean yields to be roughly flat to down slightly in 2014.","We look forward to the Caribbean returning to better pricing, particularly as we lap last year's negative publicity, we expect to see improvement. However, just as we were previously able to offset weakness in Europe and still deliver yield improvements, we expect to be able to more than offset any softness in the entry-level Caribbean itineraries by strength from our other products. That's why we invested in the global footprint, and that's why it shows how well it's paying off.","Now turning to the expense side of our programs, we're also seeing our efforts bear fruit here, too. As you know, establishing a global footprint over the last 5 years hasn't come cheap. In addition, we've invested heavily in improving the guest experience onboard our ships and increased our spending on sales and marketing to drive higher revenues. It's a testimony to our focus on cost that we've been able to make all these incremental investments and still reduce our net cruise costs, even without higher capacity growth to help absorb the costs. Remarkably, our net cruise costs excluding fuel this year should actually be lower per berth than they were in 2008. This effort has not been easy, but it is essential. We're searching every corner for opportunities to improve our situation without undermining the product. And I'm very pleased to see how well that effort is coming together. The bulk of the savings is not coming from changing the product, but from reducing our overhead. Unfortunately, there's no silver bullet. We've referred to some of the big items before, but mostly, it's simply a highly-focused attention to detail.","As we have said, we ramped up our international efforts aggressively, which is not the most efficient way to do it. Now we have the opportunity to focus on making it more efficient, as well as more effective.","Fuel costs are also doing better. While the average price of crude is approximately 8% higher this year than it was in 2008, our average fuel bill is actually lower. That's because we've lowered our consumption per berth by over 14% during this period, and we've mitigated volatile prices through our consistent hedging program. Again, there are no silver bullets in energy savings, just a myriad of small advances. I would like to thank again our operating management and our new building teams for their maniacal focus on this important area.","I am confident that our core business model is solid, and we will continue to deliver higher revenues and better costs. But that doesn't mean we don't need to make some changes to do even better. One area we've struggled with is our Pullmantur brand, which is simultaneously our biggest challenge and one of our biggest opportunities.","Pullmantur has faced the toughest operating environment of any of our brands, and they've worked hard to overcome the huge obstacles that they have faced. Despite the extraordinary efforts of our very strong management team there, the abysmal Spanish economy continues to be a material drag on our financial results, both in Spain and as a corporation. There are only so many things one can do in the face of such weird headwinds. But our quiver is not empty. As we mentioned last quarter, Pullmantur will be opening a new head office later this year in Latin America. This will place the operating management closer to what is now Pullmantur's largest and fastest-growing market and also help reduce costs. Additionally, we are actively seeking to divest some of Pullmantur's non-cruise business units, which should facilitate Pullmantur's ability to focus on its core businesses.","I'm pleased that our people continue to focus on ways to improve our profitability. I am grateful for their commitment and their effort to make us more successful. Ironically, their very success adds to the challenge each year. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that we will be able to maintain our objective of higher revenues and lower cost in 2014. Overall, we believe that we are rapidly emerging from under the shadow of the black swan events.","Finally, the strength of our business model is coming into its own. As we have a said before, we believe that we must have double-digit returns on our investments, and we have a ways to go to get there. But our performance trajectory shows that we are well poised to make a rapid ascent against these targets.","One tangible side of our confidence is the increase in our dividend level that we announced a month or so ago. I would also point to our efforts to enhance our corporate governance procedures that we announced at the same time. I believe that we are well positioned to achieve our long-term objectives and to realize the value we have been working towards.","Before turning the microphone back to Jason, I'd like to thank the men and women of Royal Caribbean who have worked so hard everyday to provide the finest vacations in the world. This has been a difficult period for them, as they have had to overcome the commercial headwinds and as we go through so many changes to implement these profitability initiatives. Throughout it all, they have consistently demonstrated professionalism and passion for success. To them, I say a heartfelt thank you.","With that, it's a pleasure to turn it back to Jason for his commentary.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Richard. Before we get into our operating results, I would like to mention that, as expected, we have incurred some restructuring and related charges related to our various profitability initiatives. These total $12.2 million in the third quarter and $13.9 million year-to-date. These charges relate mainly to restructuring and consolidation of parts of our global operation. Accounting rules dictate that the timing of when we take these charges, so we will be incurring some additional charges in future quarters. For example, severance charges are recorded when an employee is notified, while lease termination gets recorded when we no longer are utilizing the facility. This is all detailed in our 10-Q that will be filed later today.","Our profitability improvement initiatives will continue so it is possible we will incur some onetime costs in the future in our efforts to drive improved performance. When assessing our performance on a comparative basis, we believe these charges are not as meaningful and are not indicative of future operating performance. Accordingly, we have introduced adjusted earnings measures that exclude such exceptional charges.","Now let's look at our third quarter results, which will have -- which we have summarized on Slide 2. Unless I state differently, all metrics will be on a constant-currency basis and will exclude restructuring and related charges. For the quarter, we generated net income of $1.71 per share, which exceeded the range we provided on our July call, despite a $0.09 per share impact from the unexpected canceled sailings of Celebrity Millennium. Net revenue yield increased 2.6% for the quarter, which was better than our guidance of an increase of 1% to 2%. If you exclude the canceled Millennium sailings in Alaska, yields would have been 40 basis points higher, or up 3% for the quarter. Ticket pricing on close-in business for European sailings was much better than expected, with overall European ticket yields up 8% year-over-year.","Going into the quarter, China was one of our biggest areas of uncertainty because of the ongoing territorial island dispute with Japan and resultant itinerary modification. Our China team responded extremely well, driving close-in demand and delivering better-than-expected pricing and volume. The Caribbean, which represented about a quarter of our Q3 capacity, was generally in line with our expectations.","Onboard revenue increased an impressive 7% for the quarter. We benefited from new onboard venues introduced as a result of our revitalizations, and we saw further strength in spending from our U.S. customers, which helped generate improvement in gaming, beverage, specialty dining and shore excursions.","Net cruise costs excluding fuel were up 3.9% for the quarter, which was in line with our previous guidance. If you exclude the canceled Millennium sailings, costs would have been up 2.8% for the quarter. In the third quarter, we completed our refinancing activities through the bank market at favorable rates below our weighted average cost of debt. At quarter end, we had $2.6 billion in liquidity.","Now I would like to update you on what we are seeing in the booking environment, starting with what we are seeing with fourth quarter sailings. While competitive pressures are having impacts on Caribbean pricing in the fourth quarter, we have a solid order book and strength in our European, Australia and Asian products, which are more than offsetting these pressures. Our APDs and book load factors are above same time last year for all key itineraries, including the Caribbean. Overall, the fourth quarter is shaping up a bit better than we had expected a few months ago. And as we stated in the press release, we expect yields in the fourth quarter to increase by 2% to 3%.","Before I go into 2014, I thought it would be valuable to take a minute and show you how the WAVE Period plays a critical role in our performance. If you look at Slide 3, we have put together a graph that we believe helps illustrate the importance of WAVE. It also helps illustrate how bookings in one year impact yields in the next.","Generally speaking, we start seeing bookings come in for a given year in the preceding January and continue to build throughout a 2-year cycle. The line on this chart represents the average number of bookings we have taken each week over the cycle over the last 5 years of sailings. The blue dot on the right represents where we are in the selling cycle for 2013 sailings. As you would expect, the number of bookings we are taking for 2013 sailings is relatively low at this point and trailing off rather quickly as we approach year-end. On the other hand, the blue dot on the left represents where we are in the selling cycle for 2014 sailings. We are clearly on the upswing. But as you can see, the number of bookings we typically take at this point in time pales in comparison to the WAVE Period.","Over the past several years, the industry has experienced a number of significant events that have unfortunately cropped up at or around the WAVE Period and had a lingering effect on the pricing environment. Last year, the industry suffered from significant negative publicity starting in early February and, as you can see, the timing could not have been worse. The publicity extended into subsequent quarters and has had lasted longer and has hurt more than we had originally expected, but it is waning.","Overall, we believe we are emerging from under the shadows of these unfortunate events, and we are encouraged that for 2014 sailings, we are currently booked ahead of same time last year in both APD and load factor. This looks even better when you consider that at this point last year, we hadn't yet experienced the negative effects of the bad press. In other words, our comparables become a little bit easier going forward. We expect 2014 will be our fifth consecutive year of yield improvement. Because of the timing of last year's adverse publicity, the comparables for the first quarter will be a little bit more difficult. I am sure you can appreciate from the graph that until we get into the WAVE season and see how bookings are shaping up, we won't be ready to provide specific yield guidance. However, at this point, we feel it is reasonable to expect yields to grow in the low-single digits for the year.","The booking environment for 2014 has been relatively stable for the past few months. New booking volume since our last call have averaged about 5% higher than during the same period last year and our average booking window has extended slightly. Based on what we are seeing in the booking environment today, here's what we are expecting at the product level in 2014. Caribbean yields are expected to be flat to slightly down year-over-year. Europe is expected to have a second year of strong yield improvement. Healthy yield growth is expected in Asia, and we expect moderate growth from the already high-yielding Alaska program.","I would now like to ask Adam to give you more color on the Caribbean and Asia, and ask Michael to do the same with Europe and Alaska. Adam?","Adam M. Goldstein","Thank you, Jason. Richard and Jason have summarized the outlook for our Caribbean product range. While visibility is limited, at this point, we expect our Caribbean yields to be approximately flat to slightly down on a year-over-year basis in 2014. We are currently booked ahead of last year for first quarter Caribbean sailings and behind for the remaining quarters of 2014. Our long history and market leadership position in the Caribbean will serve us well as we put additional sales and marketing focus towards our 2014 Caribbean revenue target. The fact that the remainder of our product portfolio is booking at an encouraging pace and at encouraging rates, will also serve to enable such focus. Furthermore, our global footprint for customer sourcing provides a variety of strategic and tactical avenues for promoting our Caribbean offerings across and within countries.","2013 has been a challenging year for our industry, featuring significant adverse publicity, much of which has featured Caribbean cruising in a negative light. Given the reality of extraordinary customer satisfaction and assuming no further negative event, we anticipate a more positive consumer attitude towards cruising by the end of the first quarter as the industry laps the beginning of the onslaught of negative media coverage. We acknowledge there is heightened interest in the fact that our capacity growth in the Caribbean and that of the overall industry will be approximately 13% in 2014 versus approximately 2% growth in 2013 over 2012.","Interestingly, our Caribbean yield change this year over last year and our preliminary Caribbean yield change outlook for 2014 are roughly equal. This supports our view that while the capacity growth percentage is a relevant factor in the overall equation, it's just one of many factors that will determine sector performance. For example, next year, most of the industry's Caribbean growth will occur in South Florida. However, most of our company's Caribbean growth will occur elsewhere, especially in Galveston where Navigator of the Seas will begin year-round service. While we expect to maintain a high level of focus on driving revenue on all of our Caribbean products, in general, we see more competitive pressure in the near-term in South Florida than in other Caribbean home ports.","Moving to Asia, we have been hoping to declare on one of these calls that our 2 ships offering cruises from China will resume calls in Japan. While we are ready to reincorporate Japanese ports of call into our itineraries at short notice, for 2014 we have opened up our sailings for booking once again based on itineraries offering exclusively Korean destinations. This is, of course, frustrating particularly since we do not see any signs of positive geopolitical change in the dynamic between China and Japan. We continue to build our brand, our distribution and our management team in China with a view to making the best of the itinerary options that are available to us. We believe our greater experience in the market played a role in the stronger-than-expected late season bookings we recently realized. Our capacity increase in Asia in 2014 will be just over 20%, which primarily reflects the full year capacity upgrade from Legend of the Seas to Mariner of the Seas that occurred in May of this year.","Before I turn this over to Michael who will comment on Europe and Alaska, I would like to mention that in just a few months, we will begin our revitalization program of our 5 Voyager-class ships. These ships, which represent about 25% of Royal Caribbean International's capacity, have played a vital role in our fleet since 1999. Although we once thought that they would only ever sail from South Florida to the Caribbean, in fact, Voyager class has pioneered the brand's expansion into Europe and more recently, Asia. In addition to the culinary, entertainment and technology features we have now added to 9 of our 10 Vision and Radiance class ships, we plan to add over 75 staterooms to each of our Voyager-class ships over the next several years.","Michael?","Michael W. Bayley","Thank you, Adam. And good morning, everyone. We spent the last several years developing a very well-diversified portfolio from a sourcing and deployment standpoint. And a large portion of our deployment is performing very well. We are very pleased that Alaska and Europe look to provide us with continued pricing improvements in 2014. Our investments in key European and global source markets is generating strong performance for our European product, enabling us to achieve solid gains in our pricing. Demand for European itineraries has been very strong from all of our core markets, including the United States and the United Kingdom and Ireland, and we are well positioned for another year of yield growth.","Over the past 12 weeks, our European bookings have outpaced last year by over 25%, while pricing is higher than same time last year. We've added a collection of 7-night round trip and open-dual Mediterranean itineraries, which are combinable into 14, 21 and 28-day sailings on the Celebrity Cruises brand, which are being well-received by the market and advance bookings have surpassed our expectations. We are also very pleased with the performance of Oasis of the Seas, which will have a mini-European season in 2014. Key to our strength in Europe is our recognition of the importance of simplifying the European cruise proposition particularly for our American guests. This year, Celebrity Cruises and Royal Caribbean International relaunched our ChoiceAir program, which includes Low Airfare Guarantees, Assured Arrival, Your Choice Flights and 24\/7 Support. This program has been particularly well received, with significantly more air bookings for the European sailings than the same time last year. The key value, of course, of our ChoiceAir program is that it increases the stick rates of our cruise booking, providing a higher level of confidence in our projections as we look forward.","Early bookings for the overall Europe portfolio have been very encouraging, with our load factors trending ahead of last year in the mid-single-digit range and higher ticket per diem for every month of the season. Overall, Europe will represent about 22% of our global offering in 2014 and will drive more in terms of revenue share.","Alaska, which represents a smaller part of our overall deployment, is very meaningful in the third quarter where it accounts for 10% of our overall capacity and even more on a revenue basis. Alaska has been a solid performer for us over the past couple of years, and we've been maintaining similar yields to those achieved during our record 2011 season. In 2013, we introduced Celebrity Solstice into Alaska, which performed extremely well. Bookings and pricing for 2014 Alaska sailings have been trending ahead of last year and we are anticipating further yield growth for the season. Both Alaska and Europe products operate during our crucial Q2 and Q3 peak season. And early indications for 2014 is their performance is shaping up very nicely.","Jason, back to you.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Michael. Taking into account all we have just told you about the various markets and products, I would now like to take you through our updated guidance.","Slide 4 reconciled our current 2013 EPS guidance with the guidance we provided in July. As you can see, strong revenue performance is improving our outlook for the year and has more than offset the impact from the canceled Millennium sailings.","Slide 5 summarizes our full year guidance. As you can see, we expect our net revenue yields to finish on top -- on the top end of our previous guidance for an increase of approximately 3%. Our cost outlook remains unchanged from July with an increase in net cruise costs excluding fuel of 1% to 2%. We have included $920 million of fuel expense for the year, a reduction of $3 million versus our July calculations. The modest reduction since July is primarily the result of further consumption reduction efforts, but it also reflects a minor reduction in fuel due to the Millennium outage. Our at-the-pump price calculations are in line with July. So as a result of all this, we have increased our adjusted earnings per share expectations to be between $2.30 and $2.35 for the year despite these challenges.","On Slide 6, we have recapped our guidance for the fourth quarter. Net yields are expected to be up 2% to 3%, and net cruise costs excluding fuel is expected to increase 1% to 2%. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per share. Based on the current booking environment and the benefits derived from our profitability improvement program, we currently expect 2014 to be consistent with Street consensus of $3.06 per share. As Richard mentioned, despite inflationary pressures, rising reinsurance costs and continued investments in the product, marketing and technology, we still remain committed to our net cruise costs excluding fuel of being better than flat in 2014.","With that, I will ask our operator, Kathy, to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess, first, this question would be for Adam. I mean, you guys talked about the Caribbean and what you're seeing so far for 2014, and that's pretty surprising how healthy that is. Adam, you talked about how a lot of your capacity next year is going to be sourced from other markets outside of that core Florida product. But if you look at that Florida product and for example Oasis or Allure, can you talk about how those types of ships are booking right now?","Adam M. Goldstein","Well, thanks, Steve. It will -- they continue to be leaders in the cruise industry. They continue to command highly competitive rates. They are really the flagships of the industry, especially in terms of their family product offering. Obviously, our goal with those ships, like every other ship that we have, is to maximize the profitability at the margin. And we take the Caribbean outlook, as I mentioned in my commentary, quite seriously, and we'll be working very hard to promote all of our ships, including those 2 ships, to make the most of 2014. But I think in the big picture they remain, despite the fact that a number of other new ships have come into the market since Allure arrived in 2010, the leaders in the industry.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Second question, final question would be, I guess, it's for Jason. Your outlook for next year, you're basically talking about at this point, you're seeing yield growth in the low-single digit. Can you talk about, maybe, just kind of an early outlook in terms of your cost outlook for next year as well?","Jason Liberty","Yes, just to -- Steve, just to reiterate on the cost side, our expectations on costs are for them to be better than flat in 2014, which is consistent with what we said in July.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just looking at the Caribbean a little bit. I wonder if you can talk about anything incremental in the last few weeks? I mean, are you seeing competitive prices being held a little bit more and maybe occupancy being sacrificed at some competing capacity that is, maybe, taking off a little bit of price pressure? I mean, I don't know if you can comment on anything sort of incremental in the last few weeks.","Adam M. Goldstein","Robin, I don't think that we've seen anything so greatly noteworthy in the last few weeks. I think we commented already that in general, the booking outlook in recent many weeks, not just the last few weeks, has been pretty stable, generally since the last call. So we knew and we talked about it in July that we were in a promotionally-oriented environment for the Caribbean sector. That continues to be the case, but not because of any notable change in trend that's occurred in the last few weeks.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess I'm trying to get a sense of whether -- you mentioned it's been stable since the last call. So would you say the level of promotion in the environment has bottomed? And I understand it won't really sort of anniversary until after February, March, but it sounds it's at least kind of bottomed in terms of the level of promotional activity?","Adam M. Goldstein","I really don't think we're in a position to comment on that because, of course, the whole industry is involved in promotional activity. From our standpoint, what I've said is that we will be -- we take the Caribbean environment very seriously, and we are increasing our focus in general on promoting our Caribbean products over the course of the upcoming months into the WAVE. And we would expect through that focus and effort to galvanize demand. But there really hasn't been anything that has happened that's of exceptional noteworthiness in the last few weeks, and it's actually impossible to say when anything has bottomed out or peaked except in hindsight. So we're too close to recent weeks to make a comment like that.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right, I appreciate that. Just lastly, you mentioned some of your capacity, South Florida versus other markets. Can you quantify what percent of capacity in the Caribbean is not South Florida?","Adam M. Goldstein","We will look into that number for you and Ian will make that available to you after. I don't think we have that right off the top.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Greg Badishkanian. First, just in terms of your expectation for low-single-digit net yields for next year, what are you assuming in terms of the pricing environment over the next few months, especially kind of the Caribbean and what needs to happen to maybe see some upside to your initial outlook.","Brian J. Rice","Steve, this is Brian. I think -- I'm sorry, Greg. I think we were pretty much assuming that the environment stays pretty consistent with what we've been seeing. While there's a lot of promotional activity in the marketplace, particularly in the Caribbean, it is pretty predictable at this point. It's not inconsistent with general patterns that we've seen. I think we were feeling more confident, as Michael alluded do, with where Europe is right now. But if you look at the chart that Jason showed in terms of kind of how the booking cycle works, you can see we have a lot at stake with the WAVE Period.","I think the most positive news we have in terms of what can happen with the pricing environment is when we get to mid-February, we will have lapped when all the negative press began. In the nearer term, I think our comparables have become slightly easier as well because at this time a year ago, we were seeing the consequences of Superstorm Sandy and that took a little bit of a hit on booking activity. And you had to see more promotion. So I think we feel as though we have a pretty good grip on it, but there's still a lot of business to be booked.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. And you mentioned Europe. Just over the last several weeks, maybe kind of just walk us through what we've been seeing there. And also is it sort of the benefits from the contained capacity, you've got easy compares, maybe some pent-up demand. What's going to lead into the improvement in Europe in your opinion?","Michael W. Bayley","Greg, it's Michael. I'll answer that. I think, I commented earlier on that one of the things that we're particularly proud of is that we have invested over the past several years in really extending the reach of the brands into the global marketplace, and we're certainly seeing good demand out of all of the different regions and markets around the world. So that's been quite positive, and I think that's certainly a factor in terms of the global reach that our brands have.","And the second thing is that we've seen surprisingly positive demand from the U.S. market, and we think that, that's partly as the result of some of the things that we'd be doing tactically in terms of making air and the proposition itself much easier for the customer to purchase. So I think those are certainly factors. Capacity constraints, I think that probably plays a role, but it's very difficult to try to quantify that in any real way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You guys have us some color on onboards in the prepared remarks, but Richard, I just want to know what you're selling on those ships to have net onboards up 7% in the quarter. So how should we think about that going forward? I mean should we be as excited as a 7% number should indicate? Or would you like to temper our outlook there a bit?","Richard D. Fain","Well, Felicia, first of all, I think you're right. I'd like to buy some of whatever it is we must be selling there. I don't know what the relevant laws are. So I'll put that aside. I think I'll ask Adam to comment specifically on some of the -- because there's quite a few different initiatives going on and how we expect them to play out.","Adam M. Goldstein","Felicia. Well, first, of course, the progress that we've made in 2013 becomes the comparable for '14. So the progress in and of itself presents a certain challenge for ongoing year-over-year improvement. With that as background, I will say that you don't get an improvement of that sort without seeing progress in the main onboard revenue stream. So as I believe we mentioned earlier, gaming, beverage, shore excursions, retail and also some of the smaller revenue streams, internet has been doing well for us, which we wanted to see because we made a significant investment in, I think, 7 or 8x more bandwidth to the ships this year, and that seems to be paying off. So a number of the investments that we have already made, we would expect to continue to pay dividends and revenue growth into 2014 and beyond. And we continue to look under every stone for onboard revenue opportunities that don't conflict with the satisfaction of the product offering. And very similar I would say to how we feel about fuel consumption, where we continue to look for efficiency opportunities under every stone, we continue to find opportunities. So we are optimistic, looking into 2014 against the backdrop of a comparable that will be tough.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So to follow on with that, when you talk about looking to overall yield improvement in the low-single digits for 2014, as I'm quoting from the release, is that comment just on ticket revenue, or is that on overall? And if it's on overall, how should we think about the ticket revenue for next year in light of the strength of onboard?","Jason Liberty","Felicia, it's Jason. In devising that guidance, ticket is expected to also be up on the year-over-year and going into 2014. Onboard is obviously expected to go up but tempered relative to 2014, as Adam commented. But overall, we expect both lines to improve year-over-year.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just last thing, as you guys think about your cost next year, and you said it could be better or at least flat. Where are some areas where we think we might get some upside from?","Jason Liberty","Well, I think in terms of upside on the cost side, we're doing constant profitability improvement efforts to be able to meet those targets and goals. I mean, I think there are obviously items on the overall cost side on fuel and some other elements depending on pricing. But I think overall, us getting to flat -- better than flat is going to be an aggressive target that we plan to achieve.","Richard D. Fain","And Felicia, it's Richard. If I could just add a little color to that. I think a number of us had made the comment that we actually had some pleasant surprises this year. A lot of the initiatives that we have been talking about for a very long period of time came in earlier than we expected. So one of the things that happened was in the third quarter, we had the Millennium outage, which was really a body blow to us and certainly unexpected. And so I think you had alluded to in one of your reports, unusually, we didn't say, \"Oh, we had this unexpected event, and it's costing us $20-odd million and so you should adjust your impact.\" We didn't say anything, and we've now made clear that we have more than compensated by some of the savings and some of the other things that have happened. So I think part of the reason you're hearing a little bit of hesitancy about why we did so well this year or we're going to do even -- we're going to do more next year is because we've -- by doing well, we've made the comparables more difficult. So we are determined, and I'll be precise as to say we are determined that it will be less than flat, better than flat. I always get confused with less than, but it will be better than flat. And we are determined to make that. But as I think everybody has indicated, that really is a challenge.","And also on the onboard revenue side, remember we've had quite a few of the revitalizations. They've been very successful for us. And one of the areas that they've helped us is in the onboard revenue because we really have focused on adding new and better onboard revenue facilities. But that -- those revitalizations, we're nearing the end of that process, too. So I think the comparables simply become more difficult.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","I had one question, which maybe, Brian, you can help me answer. Caribbean pricing has seemed to be down for several quarters now. And in the past, other markets have gone through these cycles, which have not necessarily correlated to a significant increase in capacity. Bermuda comes to mind, without any reasonable explanation a few years back. Do you think we're seeing some of that? Maybe the repeat passenger base is getting a little bit tired of the same itineraries? Or do you think it's more of a capacity issue?","Brian J. Rice","Actually, Assia, I think it's the repeaters that are giving us the strength that we're seeing right now. If you look at the Caribbean is, in our terminology, is comprised of a lot of different product offerings. You have everything from short 3- and 4-night cruises out of South Florida. You have the core 7-night Caribbean cruises out of South Florida. You have cruises out of the Northeast and the Gulf Coast and then you also have longer Caribbean itineraries. And what we're seeing, if you drill into it, is the more, what Richard referred to as entry-level products, which would be the shorter cruises for the most part, that tends to be where you get more first-time cruisers and it's where we're probably seeing some of the most aggressive pricing.","Adam talked about Oasis and Allure, those are premium-priced products and accordingly, tend to be holding their own better than what we're seeing promotionally in the marketplace overall. And I'd also point out that the long Caribbean, which is not an insignificant part of our portfolio, is actually doing better this year than a year ago when we more recently, actually, have been able to take some price increases there.","So when you package it all together, it's about flat to slightly down in our projections next year. But it is made up of a lot of different components. And again, I would say, probably the press that we've experienced over the last year, that will be lapping in February, clearly had more of an impact on the first-time cruiser.","Assia Georgieva","So when we parse it by type of destination and product, it is really the negative press from February that is having the most impact?","Brian J. Rice","Yes, I think as we've looked at this, and Adam had this in his comments, we recognize there is a low-double-digit capacity increase next year. But our feeling is that we're absorbing that quite well, and it's dispersed into the markets that we'd like to see it, at least from our standpoint. And I think when you consider everything that's been out there in terms of the press, and we've been able to put a low-double-digit increase of capacity in there and be reasonably close to flat next year, I think that's a testimony of the core strength.","Assia Georgieva","Sure. And Jason, maybe one question for you. In terms of the restructuring charges, you mentioned that you would provide us with more detail in the 10-Q to be filed later on today. Could you give us some color in terms of the length of time, number of quarters that we should continue to expect those? And whether the magnitude would be similar to what we saw in Q3, which was somewhat significant?","Jason Liberty","Assia, in terms of forward-looking periods, it's tough to commit to how long at all the profit-improvement initiatives come to bear. But the costs that specifically that we took the charge for, in Q3, in the 10-Q, what you'll see is about $10 million in Q4 and about $16 million into 2014, which will be laid out in the 10-Q. And that is specific to our global restructuring efforts that we have taken action to.","Assia Georgieva","So the $10 million in Q4 and the $16 million, those $26 million, that should take care of the majority of it?","Jason Liberty","That should take care of the cost associated with our global restructuring. Yes.","Richard D. Fain","Assia, I just want to make sure it was clear. That's the one initiative and, as Jason pointed out earlier, there may be some others that may have an impact. And we're really only dealing with what we knew about it today, and that's the one that's -- that he was describing.","Assia Georgieva","Okay, Richard, so as we go along, there might be other incremental expenses?","Richard D. Fain","Yes. Relating to other initiatives.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the onboard spending because I agree, it's been tremendous kind of all year. And I guess on the 3% net yield for the full year of the guidance, what part of that is ticket at this point versus onboard? And then when you do the revitalizations, I'm assuming there is a big kind of gain on the ships, but there are other programs you've implemented, like the beverage program on Royal this year, and that seems like that's something that could continue to grow quite nicely as you increase penetration and awareness of that. So I guess, long way of saying, what's the kind of longer-term right run rate for onboard spending, given where you are in the different revitalizations as well as the program rollouts?","Jason Liberty","Sharon, just to take a quick breakdown in terms of for the makeup of the 3% for the year. We're expecting ticket to be up around 2% for the year, approximately 2%; and on board to be up about 7% for the year. And that, combined, averages out to about 3% for the full year.","Richard D. Fain","If I can give some flavor for the onboard revenue. First of all, as it relates to revitalizations, one of the big advantages of that program is we can put in new venues, such as specialty restaurants that are revenue generating. And we can also put in new technological capabilities, like pervasive Wi-Fi, more bandwidth and what have you. So there are opportunities that come with revitalizations that are special and that have ratcheted us forward in our efforts, and they've applied to both Royal Caribbean and Celebrity. And as I mentioned in the case of Royal Caribbean International with the 5 Voyager-class ships coming up in the next few years, we'll again have those opportunities.","But as you alluded in your question, we have other programmatic opportunities that don't have anything to do with revitalization that we've been very focused on that pretty much span the major revenue centers. So in various ways, we've been investing in a renewal and improvement of our casino offerings, we have reorganized our approach to the land operation, which has brought more focus to our shore excursion revenue capacity. You mentioned, I think, a couple of the beverage programs, which have resonated very well across the Royal Caribbean and Celebrity brands, and we continue to find new variations on those packaging themes that help us. We've even been able to take good advantage of those in our overall promotional offerings for the ticket plus the onboard, which is quite interesting and different from what we've done in the past. So if you look area by area, we have, in fact, pursued and implemented programmatic changes, and we continue to look for more as we go forward.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And maybe asking a different way, as you look into 2014, is there any one category where you think there is still tremendous low-hanging fruit? And then, just a follow-on. The spa hasn't been mentioned in a while. Is there anything kind of systematically happening in the spa? It used to lead onboard revenue for quite while.","Michael W. Bayley","Sharon, it's Michael. Let me just jump in. I think one of the areas that's been good for us this year, and I think we're quite optimistic about looking into '14, is the destination experience, the land packages and shore excursions. We're certainly seeing that there seems to be a greater appetite from our customers and guests with regards to purchasing these packages. So we think there's more opportunity for us looking forward in that area.","And with regards to the spa, I think that's always been a very healthy revenue for us. And I think we're in a relatively good position. We're constantly looking at pricing, the ability to push the pricing. And I think that we saw in '13 that there was some opportunity there and, certainly, in '14, we're looking at where we can take advantage of some pricing opportunities. And that's also beyond the spa, especially in areas like beverage and specialty dining. I think we found that there seems to be reasonable appetite when we do push the pricing up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of items here. A little bit more color, if you would, I think color on the European from the Celebrity side. But in general, any commentary, specifically on your continental sourcing? What you're seeing in the different geographic areas, Southern Europe, Germany in particular? And then, looking at your air\/sea mix that you commented on earlier also, how do you see that shaping up for '13 versus '12? And then maybe, what's your thoughts as to where that could go in '14?","Michael W. Bayley","Okay, Tim. For Celebrity, in terms of how we're looking at Europe. We're feeling relatively optimistic. We have our Solstice Class in Europe in Q2 and Q3 and we've made no changes there. So we're seeing -- we're feeling good about the demand that we're seeing. We're certainly feeling good about the pricing that we're currently seeing. I think I commented earlier that, over the past 12 weeks, demand has been really good, up over 25% over the past 12 weeks. So the company and, certainly, Celebrity to a good share of that.","So Europe, as a destination for Celebrity Cruises, is part of our key strategic thinking, and we haven't changed that in any way, and I think we're enjoying some of the fruits of that strategy and as we look into '14.","As it relates to the various markets, I think Adam may be able to comment in more depth about what Royal's seeing from a Southern European, German perspective. But we're seeing a little bit of a comeback in Southern Europe and Germany. I think the brand, our brand strategy, though, is somewhat very targeted and focused. We believe that there is a rich vein of affluent customers, both certainly in Southern Europe and certainly in Germany. So we're beginning to see that coming through in our bookings.","As it relates to air\/sea mix, that is another part of the Celebrity strategy. We've been quite focused on building this proposition of cruise plus air and packaging putting it into the marketplace. And when you look at the air\/sea mix, I don't have the percentage numbers in front of me, but if you compare '12 with '13 and '14, air\/sea mix bookings, probably up in the mid- to high-double digits year-over-year. So we feel like it's a positive proposition that we got into the marketplace on air\/sea.","Adam M. Goldstein","Let's just take a couple of things from a Royal Caribbean International perspective. One, which is probably true for Celebrity as well, is the appetite for European cruises from the U.S. market has been pretty strong for the last month, and has contributed to the percentage of increase year-over-year that Michael has cited a couple of times this morning. We discussed in past calls whether air was an issue for U.S. guests trying to go on European cruises, and right now, what we're able -- we're very pleased with what we're seeing from the U.S. market.","Coming back to Europe, we try to simplify the product offerings for our European source market in '14 as compared to the last few years. We're not doing as much inter-porting, which is finding an intermediate -- what are normally ports of call, but also having people coming on and off the ships at those ports of call. And we have, I think, rationalized our capacity so that the products and services that we have on offer in '14 are generally more attractive for our European source markets than they have been in the last couple of years, while there's been a lot of ferment in the market. So we're seeing good demand from across the various markets.","Royal Caribbean will be having its first German homeported product for a number of weeks next August [indiscernible] out of Hamburg, which we're looking forward to as an experiment. And so it's a little early still. But obviously, we'll have more color for you as we go through the quarters.","Richard D. Fain","Tim, it's Richard, and I'll just add, obviously, we tend to focus on the 5 brands that are 100% owned. But we, as you know, we're involved with a joint venture TUI Cruises in Germany, and it has been extremely successful. We think it's found a good niche in the -- a good position in the German market, and we have the new ship coming next spring, which we think will be -- will do very well. So that brand is also thriving.","Jason Liberty","Kathy, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And your last question comes the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just a quick question going back to the Caribbean. In the first quarter, how booked are you this year versus last year for the first quarter?","Adam M. Goldstein","Harry, it's Adam. I believe I mentioned before in my comments that for the first quarter for the Caribbean, we are booked -- our occupancy is in a better position now than it was a year ago.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, I was just wondering, are you 25% booked, 35%? Can you give that level of detail?","Jason Liberty","It would -- we would be about 2\/3 booked at this point. And that's across the whole portfolio of the spectrum of shorter cruises and the longer ones as well.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","The reason I'm asking is that in the Caribbean, I'm just wondering if your expectations for pricing being flat to flattish could be somewhat conservative. If the first quarter is looking fairly well-booked, I'm just thinking that the yield management for the balance of the year, when some of that capacity actually leaves the Caribbean, might suggest that your pricing could be up for the year. I'm just wondering how conservative a statement that you being flat to down a little bit in the Caribbean might turn out to be.","Jason Liberty","Harry, this is Jason. And thanks for being so optimistic. But when we came up with our guidance or our outlook for next year, it really was our best thinking. It wasn't us trying to sandbag in any way. It was a culmination of all the different things you've kind of heard on the call to come up with that level of guidance, specifically around the Caribbean.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then last question is just going back to China for a second. On an absolute basis, how much does pricing need to lift versus the pricing that you're getting, either in Europe or the Caribbean, to justify additional capacity there?","Adam M. Goldstein","Well, there's a lot that goes into the economics of being in any sector besides just the revenue levels. We are pleased with the revenue development that we are experiencing in Asia, understanding that in 2011, we had to work through the shock of what happened at Fukushima. And in 2013, we've had to work through the unfortunate situation of not being able to call in Japan. But from an overall revenue standpoint, and by overall, I mean not only ticket but also the onboard revenue component of Asia cruising, which is attractive for us, we're pleased with where we are. And yet we have a market situation that is clearly in its infancy in terms of branding, distribution, et cetera, et cetera. And we also still have a lot of work to do on the cost side of being things out there and also on infrastructure improvement. So the Asian situation is in a very different state of development than Europe or North America, and we're looking at all the factors and projecting forward what we might be able to do.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just as a follow-up there, do you think that there's a reasonable chance in the next year that you might see additional equipment move to Asia that might take some of the supply pressure off the Caribbean?","Adam M. Goldstein","Well, we're not in a position to comment on or to project forward possible deployment initiatives. We've identified that Asia is of strategic significance to the company. We're extremely pleased with the reaction in that region to our brand, Royal Carribean International in China and throughout the region, Celebrity Cruises in Australia. And so we're very interested to remain in a leading position in the industry. We'll have to see where that takes us in terms of deployment.","Jason Liberty","Thank you for your assistance, Kathy, with the call today. And we thank all of you for your participation and interest in the company. I will be available for any follow-ups you might have. And with that, I wish you, all, a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Jason Liberty, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, our President and Chief operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carol Cabezas, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our Investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filing and other disclosures.","Also, before we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website. Unless we state otherwise all metrics are in a constant currency adjusted basis.","Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview of the business. I will follow with a recap of our first quarter results, provide an update on the booking environment and then provide an update on our full year and second quarter guidance for 2017. We will then open the call up for your questions. Richard?","Richard Fain","Thank you, Jason, and good morning everybody. It's been another exciting quarter here at Royal Caribbean, and I am pleased to be able to talk to you all about it.","Actually the best news today is no news. We set aggressive goals for ourselves and we're executing nicely against them. I'll start with the Double-Double Program which has proven so successful in routing a massive organization across both land and sea. We have used it to inculcate a focus on effectuating step change in our profitability and it's done just that.","This quarter, again, illustrates our team's focused on maximizing revenue opportunities while maintaining cost discipline. Growing yields by 6% this quarter which follows a 7% growth rate last year, it's remarkable and it supports the increase in our guidance for the year. Our first quarter results were up 74% from last year which also shows that our focus on improving specifically the winter season is working.","Looking ahead to the year, we see the business progressing pretty much as we expected. We keep emphasizing that we manage our year on an annual basis and the variations between quarters on the norm rather than the exception. I know some of our investors attempt to draw inferences from fluctuations within the year, but we just haven\u2019t found these quarterly variations to be terribly helpful indicators of the year as a whole. That\u2019s not because we can foresee all the events that invariably takes place rather it's because during the year we often have opportunities to adjust our business in ways that allow us to manage the variations throughout the year.","Now, these actions call to my mind the image of a duck gliding calmly through the water. As we look at the scene from the shore, all we see is an elegant duck gliding serenely across the pond. But under the surface, there is a lot of fierce activity with a lot of energetic paddling. I am really very proud of the fierce activity that our team brings to the work day in and day out. Obviously, they can't handle every contingency no matter how hard they paddle, but our track record to date is pretty reassuring.","As you know, we've raised our guidance for the year by about a dime. However, the real impact of our message is that little has changed since our call three months ago. At that time, we said that bookings were outstanding and accordingly, we predicted a strong revenue growth for 2017. That prediction is proving accurate. In fact, we continue to revel in strong daily booking reports. The main negative has been the situation in Korea with the Chinese government is in a dispute with the Korean government. We re-juggled our itineraries to suit, but it is hurting. It is reminiscent of the China-Japan dispute from several years ago. But fortunately, bookings in Europe and elsewhere have compensated.","Shifting now to another event during the quarter, the prestige is good news for the future. A couple of weeks ago, we introduced the new design, the Celebrity Edge. Edge of Celebrities newest ship is being introduced late next year. While I've been lucky enough over the years have been involved with a number of transformational ship designs and most recently with the Oasis of the Seas. Based on all that experience, I believe that Celebrity Edge will be yet another transformational ship, which will influence of the design of ships for years to come. Everything about the Edge-Class is new and exciting.","The decor is highly unique and the new spaces are totally inspired. Actually, speaking of inspired, we've just announced a partnership with the Malala foundation and we're re honored that she will be the godmother of Celebrity Edge. She's an amazing inspiration to young women everywhere, and she inspires all of us here as well. But I'm a numbers person and there are several statistics about the ship, which is striking. One number that speaks volumes to me is double, as in double the percentage of suites. On Edge-Class, our mix of suite staterooms is 12%, which is a little more than double the amount for most of our existing ships.","Since our guest pay more for a suite, doubling the suite count is not a bad thing to do. Another great number is 23, as in Edge is standard veranda cabin is 23% larger than the corporate ones. This is due to the innovation in the way the cabins are designed and built. It involves changing the very structure of our rooms so that all the veranda space can be converted into air-conditioned living area at the push of a button. For all of you who've travelled on a ship before, you understand well that the space comes at a huge premium at sea and this 23% increase in space will translate into yield premiums for this class of ships.","At the same time that we revealed the magic of Celebrity Edge, we also revealed some of the design techniques that enabled us to create such a product. In particular, we publicly revealed our new innovation lab. It allows us to design a ship fully in three dimensions, which also allows us to involve more creativity and more of our people's expertise in the process. We take great pride in creating the most innovative ships that attract the most premium yields. Now with this new lab, we can design and build these ships in an ever more efficient and effective way by bringing these spaces to life in 3D right here in our offices.","We also shared some of the vision, which I referred to as Project Excalibur during our last call. Starting over 2 years ago, we have found intuitive digital applications to make the guest experience simpler and more comfortable. We'll be able to open the door to your room without pulling out a card or key, request a beverage real time from the comfort of your lounge chair and get recommendations for your traveling companion based on their preferences. We take our guest vacation time seriously and technology is a great enabler to improve the use of that.","Based on the experience we have gained over the last 2 years of our Smart Ship programs, we are now embarking on a new generation of technology to increase our competitive advantage in this area. As you can see, we have a lot to be motivated about. Our performance continues on a steady upward trajectory. We have reached investment grade. We're embarking on another share repurchase program and our current efforts are setting us up for even greater long-term success. Clearly, the future for cruise has never been brighter, which should make Jason Schaub very easy.","So with that, I get to hand the call back over to Jason, who has come, may I note, such an easy job. Jason?","Jason Liberty","Well, thank you, Richard. And as always, thank you for trying to make my job easier. I will begin by talking about our result of the first quarter. Unless, I state differently, all metrics are on a constant currency basis.","Our first quarter results are summarized on Slide 2. For the quarter, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.99, which is approximately $0.09 higher than our guidance and 74% higher than the same time last year. Net revenue yields are up 6% for the quarter, which is noteworthy considering this followed a 7% improvement last year. This past quarter results were driven by continued strength in both ticket and onboard revenue.","On the ticket side, we received stronger closing bookings for the Caribbean, which resulted in better than expected occupancy and pricing for the quarter. Onboard revenue yield was up 8.9% for the quarter. The strong year-over-year growth was driven by a combination of our new hardware, shore excursions and utilization of VOOM and Xcelerate, our high-speed Internet offerings.","As I mentioned over the past couple of quarters, guest spend has been continuing to shift towards areas that involve experiences over buying things. Our costs for the quarter were in line with guidance, ending down 4.4%.","Now I'd like to update you on what we're seeing in the demand of environment. On our last earnings call, we noted that WAVE was off to a very strong start. These WAVE trends continued in both sides of the Atlantic with bookings exceeding last use levels on both the volume and rate basis. As a result, we are booked ahead of same time last year in both occupancy and pricing in each remaining quarter and have approximately 15% fewer guests left to book that at this point last year.","Demand for European sailings has been particularly strong from North America and as a result, these itineraries our book at significantly higher APD and load factor than same time last year. The APD strength is particularly impressive when you consider that Harmony of the Seas spent our inaugural summer season in the Mediterranean last year, making year-over-year comparisons more difficult.","We are also seeing strong booking trends from European sourced markets, but since we have a lot less inventory left to sell, we will end up sailing with a greater mix of North American guests than in a typical season. These sourcing ships are going to an even stronger rate position as North Americans usually spend more than the average on European cruises and take more shore excursions.","Trends for North American products continue to please. Our summer Alaska sailing benefited from a strong WAVE period and remained on track to outperform last year's record season. The Caribbean accounts were close to half of our capacity for the year and overall is performing as expected. Over the past three months, both bookings and pricing have been above last year's level and Harmony of the Seas is commanding premium prices for her first summer Caribbean season.","Now, I'll turn to the Asia-Pacific region, which represents approximately 20% of our capacity this year. Our China, Australia and Southeast Asia itineraries are each booked nicely higher than last year in load factor. The Australian market welcomed Ovation of the Seas to Sydney this winter and yields did not disappoint. In addition, Australia itineraries for next winter are in a strong book position despite industry capacity growth. We did experience a decrease in demand for our China sailings as we work through itinerary changes related to Korea, but the product remained ahead and demand is returning to expected levels.","Before we discuss full-year guidance, I would like to elaborate on our progress towards our financial objectives of improving shareholder returns, being an investment grade company and modestly growing our business. As you saw in the release this morning, our Board authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. We entered this program with a view of buying shares opportunistically over the next year.","This program in combination with improving earnings by close to 17% per annum over the past 5 years, growing our dividend fivefold and repurchasing approximately $750 million in shares during the same period, demonstrates our continued commitment to improving shareholder value. Additionally, last week, we achieved our investment grade objective when we were upgraded to Baa3 by Moody's.","If you turn to Slide 3, you will see our updated guidance for the full year 2017. Net revenue yields are expected to grow 4.5% to 6%, an increase relative to previous expectations. This higher guidance incorporates the outperformance in the first quarter, strong demand for North American and European cruises and the expected negative impact from Korean deployment changes.","From a cost perspective, we are anticipating net cruise costs including fuel to be flat to slightly up and marginal increase relative to previous expectations. We expect fuel expense of $770 million for the year and we are 60% hedged. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per shares are expected to be of the range of $7 to $7.20, $0.10 higher than previous guidance. This range represents our fifth consecutive year of double digit earnings growth.","Before moving onto the second quarter, I wanted to reiterate the guidance we gave on our last call regarding our yield and cost cadence for the year. Our yield improvement is expected to be higher and our costs are expected to be lower in the first half of the year as we benefit from new capacity and rapid deconsolidation of Pullmantur.","Now we can turn onto our guidance for the second quarter which is on Slide 4. We expect net revenue yields to be up 10% to 10.5% for the second quarter. The main drivers of this year-over-year improvement are strong demand for our European and North American itineraries, new hardware and the deconsolidation of Pullmantur.","Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be down approximately 2%. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.65.","With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Wieczynski with Stifel.","Steven Wieczynski","So first the two part question around you updated guidance. First, I would assume that are updated guidance does not include any incremental buybacks from today's announcement?","Richard Fain","Steve, obviously, we said in the release also in my remarks that we're going to be doing this opportunistically. But we're not going to specifically parse out the guidance, but if we did, it's not going to be a material change to our earnings for the year or EPS ratings for the year.","Steven Wieczynski","Okay and then second part around that, the updated guidance, I guess. When we look at your updated earnings range now with the midpoint of $7.10, I guess the right way to say this and I know you'll probably cringe when I say this, but can we put some closure now to the Double-Double? I mean that was supposed to be originally about 6.70 I think and now you're low on your guidance is $7, which again doesn\u2019t include any material buyback support. So, what am I not thinking about right there?","Richard Fain","Well, I'd say that you're not thinking about it correct, but I think in terms of Double-Double, it's -- everyday we're in the trenches making sure that we achieve those targets. So, I wouldn't say we're at a point yet where we're running a victory lap here or very focused on achieving that and making those targets.","Jason Liberty","Yes, Steve. I think I would also add besides, yes, as Jason said it something that we really have to keep focusing on every day. The program was really more than just those two numbers. The two numbers are an important part of it, but what's really an approach in trying to galvanize everybody working towards it. So in an ideal world, we would do as much better as we can and of course you know it's not our intention to stop with 2017 anyhow.","Steven Wieczynski","And then one more quick question just around China, if I could. Can you just give a little more color around the net of consumers, the Chinese consumers' behavior after you've started changing around those Korean itineraries? That might be pretty helpful.","Michael Bayley","Steve, it's Michael. Yes, I think when this initially happened which was towards the middle of March. Obviously, there was a slowdown and there was a little bit of confusion in the market because everything had to be adjusted and itineraries have to be changed and whatnot. The fortunate thing is of course the Japan is very popular with the Chinese consumers. So, we actually started to see some demand coming in because of the changes that have been made with many of the itineraries. So, initially, it was a little bit -- there was a bit of turmoil and uncertainty. And as Jason had already commented, we started to see the demand return back to its previous levels.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo.","Timothy Conder","A couple things or just to stay on Steve's question on China and South Korea here. You talked a little bit about the consumer there, Michael, can you talk about how your distribution partners have reacted? And then also, Jason just to reconfirm, china as a whole is still tracking above on a year-over-year. I thought that's what you said in your preamble, but just wanted to reconfirm that?","Jason Liberty","Before the Korean situation, we were in a pretty good position so we had a lot of inventory already add and we're in a good place. I think the same thing happened with our distribution has happened with the customers. Initially obviously there's just confusion in the marketplace as to what exactly is going to happen and it took a couple of weeks, I think, for everything to get sorted out and straightened out.","So, I think obviously with the change, the drop of the Korean itineraries, it changes the dynamics in terms of the distribution and the product that have gone into the market. And then to a certain extent, with the new itineraries that were put into place by ourselves and competing brands, then it's is just a different product offering in the market and that's a different kind of relationship with the distribution. So, I think we've kind of been through the period where we've had that initial turmoil and things are starting to settle down more now.","Jason Liberty","Tim, and in terms of kind of what I commented in my remarks, yes, we don't guide by market. What I did say is that, as we said on our last call, we were in a very strong book position. We continue to be in a very good book position for China.","Richard Fain","Okay. And then Jason also just another clarification, I think when you're talking about the last three months of booking and pricing above last year's levels and Harmony. That was all in context with the Caribbean, correct?","Jason Liberty","For Harmony, yes. But overall, the booking levels we've seen I think I commented it was on both sides of the Atlantic that we've seen strong demand from European consumers as well as North American consumers. And obviously, those core products for them would be North American products with the Caribbean, Alaska, Bermuda, and also would be Europe.","Timothy Conder","Okay, and you've given some of the -- you've talked about the cadence of the quarter and now the first half, you've got higher yields, lower costs, and I think in the prior call, you commented that that reverses somewhat in the back half of the year here with the yields having more difficult comparison. The hardware doesn't benefit as much, the deconsolidation of Pullmantur does not, yet the underlying core fundamentals seem to be good -- any color or just update on the cadence between Q3, Q4 here?","Jason Liberty","First, allow me to say that it's pretty remarkable that, how our forecast has been for the quarters is actually very much in line with how we expected the year to play out when we gave guidance in late January. So the high yield improvement in the second quarter, which is really mainly driven by strong demand for our North American products and European products, was very much in line with what we thought it was going to be for the second quarter. And as you pointed out, Tim, as you begin to lap the new hardware and lap the Pullmantur deconsolidation, you really kind of move into a more kind of normalized second half of the year without those structural changes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein Research.","David Beckel","I was wondering if you could help us better understand the extent to which of the Korean restrictions is reflected in the adjustment to your guidance, which was of course offset by Europe. Can you help us towards dimensionalize the overall impact? And also how long do you expect this disruption to last?","Jason Liberty","Yes, well, I can -- I've been talking how long do we thing the disruption is going to last, that requires a crystal ball that we don't own. But there's obviously been times in the past, I think it was in '14 when there was a dispute over a set of rocks between Japan and China and that was resolved in a reasonable period of time. In terms of the impact, I'm not going to give you a specific number, but I will tell you that it's not a very -- it's not a very material change to our forecast. And as we said, strength in other products, which is why we benefit from this kind of global portfolio of products and markets are offsetting what we expect the impact will be in China due to the change in the Korean sailings.","David Beckel","Got it. And the second question, yesterday, you've announced your public deployment plans for Asia, 2018, 2019. A few things stuck out to us. First thing that the new Quantum ship will be sent out by region, but it seemed like there's no specific mention of China rather just Asia Pacific and you also announced that Mariner was moving to the U.S. Is there anything we should be reading into these moves about tempering of expectations as it relates to the Chinese market?","Jason Liberty","No, I mean I think I believe that we had stated that Quantum Ultra would be going out to Asia Pacific and it would be going to China along with Singapore and Australia, which is quite normal for us to do that. So, we're quite excited about that in 2019. And then with Mariner moving back into the states, that was really about timing. Mariner was coming out anyway when Quantum Plus came into the market. And we had an opportunity because we've got some revitalization and dry dock work that's quite extensive that we're planning for Mariner.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","So, I have a big picture question that I wanted to start with and on some of the conversations that we have with investors. They're kind of concern that this is as good as it gets. So, I was just wondering, how you would respond to that and what are you seeing today that makes you confident that these trends can continue?","Richard Fain","Hi, Felicia, it's Richard. Not quite sure how to answer that. I understand the question and I guess I've heard it in different ways before. It is a good time and I think one of the points we try to make is, it's an overall tone that we've seen in the number of markets. And frankly, we've been a little bit surprised at just how strong this year has developed. I think we're also feeling pretty good about the execution our teams have done. When you look at the introduction, as you know, of the Celebrity Edge, Harmony is blowing it out of the ballpark. The new ships, the upgrades to the ships that are different brands have done.","Symphony of the Seas which comes out in April next year, the forward bookings are terrific. I think we both also know that nothing lasts forever and things do go up and down and, coming back to an earlier question, that's something you always have to worry about is we do see volatility in things like foreign-exchange rates, we do see things happening in the world. But overall, I think I would just say more and more people are understanding the wonderful value of cruising and so as that message gets out, we're really seeing people learning and moving forward.","And I think the other thing from my perspective which is very good is just to see how well our teams are doing in terms of the product delivery, in terms of the marketing of that, in terms of using social media. I know I'm going on in a number of things, but there's so many things happening. To answer questions, I think I have to, Felicia. The other thing coming back to something Jason mentioned. A few years ago, if you talk to somebody, what is it you want? I want a flatscreen TV. I want a big TV. I want a better car.","And now people really are seeming to say, this is the time I can spend with my family, this is the time I can develop memories that will last me. And I do think that somewhat of a cultural shift and I think we're benefiting from that. And we're working to supply the ships and the people and everything else that makes that happen. So, I don't think we're seeing a sudden spike that makes this as good as it gets and we certainly will continue to do our best to take advantage of that what appears to be a cultural shift for us.","Felicia Hendrix","And I would assume -- and I know you talked last quarter about how the booking curve -- you're not trying to keep elongating that for various reasons. But I'm assuming the length of the booking curve and the visibility that you have today also gives you some comfort in what you're seeing in the future, more so than you were able to in the past.","Richard Fain","Yes, it's a good point. So it's given us a little more comfort. Again, many of these things do change, but it's pretty far out there and so it does -- I think you're exactly right, it does give us some comfort. Particularly, it gives us more visibility.","Felicia Hendrix","Great. And then Jason, just a question. So on the second quarter net yield guidance, the 10% to 10.5%, I was just wondering how much of that is in a same-store basis? So before Pullmantur, the Easter shift, the addition of Harmony, Ovation, so before all of those things, what's the underlying apples-to-apples net yields change? And then also on your full-year guidance, okay, so we know it benefited from the past through of the quarter, and you didn't really change our second half net yield outlook, but it does seem that your cost outlook increased a bit. So, I'm just wondering, it seems to me like there might be something incrementally a bit better in the second half? Can you also address that?","Jason Liberty","Okay, so in terms of the second quarter, on the same-store sales side, a little over 1\/2 of the yield improvement just comes from like-for-like improvement in the fleet, while the other half, it's a combination of new hardware and the Pullmantur deconsolidation. On the cost side, we very marginally increased our cost for the year. There's not one specific thing, but it's a very immaterial change.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, so it's so immaterial that you're upside is just -- it's simply the past-through of the quarter?","Jason Liberty","Yes, that's right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley","I'm wondering, if you can talk about 2018. It seems like you opened up sailings for next year earlier than you would have at the same time last year. So, I don't know if you have any initial -- is it fair to assume that your fair pricing volume for 2018 as well?","Jason Liberty","I would say good try, Robin, for us to begin to comment on 2018. It's a little bit early for us to start the kind of give stats around it. There are some additional sailings that have been opened up for '18, but it's really has more to do around the launch of new ships like Edge and Symphony that come out next year and that's really kind of what's driving some more recent announcements in terms of deployments for our 2018.","Robin Farley","Okay, that's fair enough. And also just to circle back to the topic. I know you've made a couple of comments on it already, but just some about the impact of Korea on China itineraries. Can you give us just kind of a rough sense as how you expect China yields to be with the impact of the disruption in Korea now? Does that leave you for the year with yields maybe flattish in the market or maybe slightly down given the Korea situation or actually some positives?","Jason Liberty","Well, again, I'm not going to give specific guidance on the yield side, but obviously, making a decision to put Quantum Plus and a brand-new shipment talks about our confidence in China.","Richard Fain","Robin, as you well know, China will have its ups and downs. Something like this is very frustrating. You probably recall how the emotion in our voice when we complained about the problem a few years ago between China and Japan. It's very frustrating. But it's such an upward-trending market. It's such a large and growing market. And when you see just the thing I'd like to quote, which is that there will be more middleclass Chinese than the population Asian of either the United States or all of Europe. You simply say, yes, we will have bumps in the road and sometimes those bumps will be big bumps, but it's still part of on an onward and upward trajectory. So that's the way I think we're looking at this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Cutis with Nomura.","Harry Curtis","Two quick questions. How much capacity have you got left to sell for the balance of this year in Europe? I'm trying to get a sense of how much leverage you've got to -- or incremental leverage from here that you have to -- the strength in Europe whether it's U.S. to Europe or Europe to Europe passengers?","Jason Liberty","Hi, Harry, just to kind of give you kind of more of a framing, we certainly have a lot less capacity to sell for Europe than we did same time last year. And as I commented on my remarks, there's also greater mix shift of North American versus European this year, which would also help you understand that most North Americans book much further out than Europeans do for their summer holidays. So we have a lot less inventory we have to sell for Europe for the balance of this year.","Harry Curtis","For the balance of this year, can we assume it's 20%, 25% left to sell?","Jason Liberty","Well, I said that -- in my remarks that overall, we have 15% less inventory to sell than we did the same time last year and you combine that with the strength of what we have said about demand for European sailings from North Americans, that would tell you that would probably be above that one.","Harry Curtis","Okay, that's a good effort anyway.","Richard Fain","Points for trying on there.","Harry Curtis","Capacity growth, I'm trying to get a sense of what European -- your biggest markets, European and the Caribbean, your net capacity growth outlooks for 2018 and '19. Some of the folks that we talked to just looking at the bulge and capacity growth and just overall in the cruise industry, a little bit lowered about capacity getting a bit ahead of itself in Europe and the Caribbean over that timeframe and I wonder if you can comment on that?","Jason Liberty","I think the only thing that I would -- it is really talking about '18 capacity because things are still in flux. The thing I'd keep in mind is, for example when Symphony comes out, Symphony will be spending the summer in Europe and the other new capacity that we have, which is in the very latter part of the year Edge, that will have a very mild effect on our Caribbean capacity for 2018. So, there's some shifts, but I don't think there's any materials swings within the products.","Harry Curtis","And then do you have -- I guess, my last question is, from a global perspective inclusive your competitors. Are you getting a sense of how much incremental capacity there's likely to be in '18 and '19 overall?","Jason Liberty","Well, I think on the '18 side, I think we explain -- I'll at least talk to that I think we expect capacity to grow in mid single digits. It can be more elevated in '19 on the gross basis.","Harry Curtis","And is that both in Europe and the Caribbean or is it lower in Europe than in the Caribbean?","Jason Liberty","Well, I don't know exactly where they're going to deploy those ships. I know that obviously, in '19, when we deliver Quantum Plus, that ship will be heading to Asia as Michael referred.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","Just on the buyback, so you're know within your range of 3 to 3.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. If I just run higher EBITDA through, then at year end you'll be close to 3 times. So I guess, what I'm getting at is the 500 million buyback seems a little bit light. So can you just give us a sense for how quickly plan to execute that and is it possible that you can announce another buyback before year end?","Jason Liberty","Hi, Jared, I don't think I would ever use the word 500 million and light in the same sentence. But one, I think what we said is that we're going to be looking to purchase $500 million of shares opportunistically, and we'll see how we evolve on that program. There is always the opportunity to lever or use additional free cash flow, but that's a Board decision that will be taken at the time as we start to migrate towards those metrics.","Jared Shojaian","Right, okay. I mean, I'm just looking at my model and I've got over 1 billion in free cash for the balance of the year. So light relative to that perspective, obviously not light relative to your historical standards, but I guess, just as a follow-up on a separate topic, can help instead the joint venture income was down quite a bit in the quarter? Why was that? And how should we think about that growing as the year goes forward?","Jason Liberty","Well, we don't really guide on the borderline, but the driver of that is as we deconsolidated Pullmantur, 49% of their earnings gets recorded into our below the line, where before, obviously, there were above the line. And Pullmantur is a business that has a peak to it with the summer months and has a deeper valleys in the winter period of time and that's really what you're seeing affecting that equity pickup line.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research.","Vince Ciepiel","My first question was related on onboard spend that looked especially strong. Just kind of curious, your expectations for onboard for the year? And also if you can comment on what you're seeing with VOOM? I think completed the rollout around this time last year?","Adam Goldstein","Yes, we've been very pleased with the onboard revenue. If you look back at the past quarters we've seen good growth overtime and it continues. One of that Jason has pointed out, what we are saying is a switch to more experience-related revenue streams and obviously we're trying to leverage that. So things like shore excursions obviously beverage, beverage packages, that kind of thing. VOOM is doing well. We've spent a lot of time with pricing model and also with our pre-cruise sales of VOOM and Xcelerate for Celebrity. And in with both cases, we've seen a good pickup, so using the words penetration, how many people we're actually selling the product to we've managed to increase the volume of sales, and we've managed to use different pricing models to reach out and get the revenue up, and that's been quite successful.","Vince Ciepiel","Great. Separate topic, I want to focus more on Europe. It's is like a lot of happenings within North American source demand right now. But also keeping in mind that I think capacity is down year-over-year there. So, how much of the strength that we're seeing in Europe is related to demand versus the capacity set up? And how do you think that evolves over the next 12 months to 18 months in Europe?","Jason Liberty","Well, I think in terms of what we're seeing in terms of demand is we're seeing demand actually quite healthy, not just from North Americans but also the European consumers. But the North American consumers, because they book further out, have got what up more of the inventory over the past four or five months, which of course puts us in a leverage position with the consumer to be able to charge more, not only to North America, but also locally on the Europe side.","Now, how much of that is driven by less capacity? That's obviously very difficult question to answer, but I think it also shows -- I think one of the things as I commented on my remarks, it's also a difficult comparable for us in Europe because Harmony spent the summer there last year and is not spending the summer there this year. And so I think that really encourages in terms of the yield improvements we're seeing in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling","Just have a few follow-ups. I guess, one clarification on the comment about mid single digit capacity growth in the industry. Is that gross or net? And do you see a tipping point anywhere on the future where retirements should start to accelerate?","Jason Liberty","Well the comment I made was is on the gross basis. I'm not sure if there's a tipping point, but certainly, you start to see acceleration of ships at the age of 30 years as you get more 5 years to 10 years out and you can kind of pick your point in time where you think there'd be a higher velocity of netting that will take place.","Stephen Grambling","Okay. And then onboard very-very strong numbers, I think it was probably the best since 2013 on your preoccupied birth date. Can you just talk about any unique drivers in that line of M&A item or any categories and regions that led to that acceleration?","Adam Goldstein","Steven, I think really what we're seeing is we're seeing a really good pickup other pre-cruise sales, that's driving a lot of these revenue. There's really a theories on how impactful pre-cruise sales are and one of the theories is if you sell $1 pre-cruise, you'll probably see anywhere from 20% to 50% uptick in the onboard spend by the very same guest. So pre-cruise sales has been a focus for us and we've seen that for the increase quite nicely, I mean, literally over the past couple of years but it's really accelerated over the past quarter.","Jason Liberty","And just add to it, Stephen, also keep in mind, in terms of how we go to market, there's been more packaging, there's a mix shift that happens between ticketing onboard depending on how were selling that specific raise. And so for packaging, as an example, beverage, we break out that beverage revenue. We put that onto onboard. So there's a little bit of a mix because we're doing more packaging it's showing onboard yields higher than our ticket yields.","Stephen Grambling","That's helpful. And one last very quick one. I don't know if I caught this, but can you talk new to cruise trends and as we look at the strength recently, what has new to cruise look like?","Michael Bayley","Obviously speaking about Royal, we've been quite focused about a new to cruise, particularly in the American market and we're quite pleased with the progress that we've been making last year, it was a really positive your for us in terms of the overall increase in new to cruise, and this year, looks like it's on track to be last year's performance in terms new to cruise. And the way we've got the market and how we go to market has changed quite a lot over the past couple of years and where we're seeing that resonate with the new to cruise potential, so we're feeling quite good about that directionally what we're going with that, even when we do brand awareness research in terms of new to cruise, we feel like we're hitting us but in terms of our marketing and move to digital.","Stephen Grambling","Any qualification there on the growth on new to cruise passengers?","Michael Bayley","No. It's -- we feel pretty good about it at the moment. There is no quantification.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory Badishkanian","Yes, two quick ones on China. You mentioned that it was similar about Japan-China dispute. But what about the 2015 merge issue? And also you mentioned that demand was coming back to normalized levels? How do you expect demand to play out in the high season were demand obviously increases in the summer and we also have a little bit more supply coming into the market to take advantage of that as well?","Michael Bayley","As Jason had pointed out, I think, we're already were in a good position for every quarter in China. And obviously, that's got a relationship to the capacity that's in the market. We don't know for sure how the Q3 is going to play out in terms of the China demand in it is peak season. There's also a possibility of course that things will turn around with the situation in Korea and China. I mean, there's some theories that will occur, but of course, as Jason pointed out, we don't have a crystal ball. The elections in South Korea occur in May, some believe that in June, the situation will resolve itself and that of course great news, if that happened. But we don't know for sure how that will play out in the peak summer.","Gregory Badishkanian","Just comparing it to 2015 issues, how does it compare?","Michael Bayley","You know, it's difficult. I think as Richard had pointed out, this market is a huge opportunity. It's a very much a long-term play, it's developmental. We've been in the market for 10 years. We've been over that decade, we've been through some ups and downs, and I think every year or every other year, we've had something thrown at us whether it's murderous, typhoons, Japan, Korea, tsunamis. And thus, I think we just have to adapt and I believe that we're kind of getting used to these curveballs when they come at us and we're quite flexible and rapid in terms of how we respond to them. But I think it's something that we just have to get used to that is the story of his developing market for us, and we're become a quite adept at dealing with this. So, the comparisons between year-over-year, is very difficult to say but they follow very similar pattern, obviously. Event occurs and we go to a little bit of a minor turmoil and then there's some uncertainty and then these things start to sort themselves out, we typically see the demand coming back.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities.","James Hardiman","I did want to ask Felicia's question from earlier in the call in a slightly different way about this being as good as it gets. Obviously, yields are difficult, if not impossible, to predict. I wanted to ask about cost though. The cost performance has been really exceptional, probably unprecedented versus historical standards. You've been able to keep costs at pretty flattish for -- assuming your guidance holds 4 years here. And I think every year, we model whatever you guide us to for the year, but we assume in the out year, the cost is going to go up because historically that's what costs do. I guess, any thoughts about your ability to continue to find things to cut and offset whatever inflation that you have?","Jason Liberty","First off, it is incredibly difficult to kind of manage all these new cost inflation's that have been around the world and make an impact our business. What I would tell you is that there is a -- we would just effort to make sure that we are effectively managing our costs. And as we're progressing inflationary type of items, we do keep in mind that as we grow and as our capacity gross, there's opportunity or further opportunity to realize economies to scale in the business. And that's kind of where we're kind of focused. I don't think or I don't think we believe that there are areas where there are large cost opportunities but there's always opportunities on the margin for us to be more cost-effective.","Richard Fain","James, let me just add to that, because I think the question does put its finger on a couple of things that are important. First of all, I really am impressed. The team has just terrific in focusing on this and then in executing against that. But you're also right, you can't do this forever. I do want to emphasize though, our real future continues to be on the revenue side and performing on that and maintaining and expanding the preference for our brands. So one of the things you said was you can keep finding things to cut. And I don't mean to nitpick words I don't think it's so much a question of finding things to cut.","It's finding ways to do things better and that may or may not mean a continuation of this -- the flattish trajectory that we've been on because you can't fight inflation forever. But it really is impressive. They keep looking for ways to do things better and still, I would emphasize that our guest satisfaction is higher today than it was last year and last year was a record. Our employee engagement is higher than it was last year and last year was a record. And so I think our objective is to continue to build to maintain our product, our brand preferences and to hold the costs, but I think we will not -- we can't do it forever, but I certainly like to take the opportunity to say thanks to the team for doing as well as they have to get here.","James Hardiman","Agreed. My second question, the bear case coming into the year, with respect to the Caribbean was just a notion that capacity was going to be accelerating thereafter flat to down years. The last couple of -- obviously the first quarter would seem to find the phase of that, but it occurs to be that the majority of the growth in the Caribbean is sort of yet to come. I guess, as you look out to your future bookings, is that capacity wretches up, are you seeing any impact on Caribbean pricing as a result of the increased capacity?","Jason Liberty","Yes, I would say overall, I mean the demand for the Caribbean on both the volume and rate perspective has been very pleasing to us and while there is a bit amount of capacity coming in Q2, Q3 and Q4, what we're seeing in terms of your volume as a general demand has been quite positive and it's not just all for Harmony, it's really for the broader portfolio of product and equipment.","James Hardiman","Great. And then last quick question for me. For the Caribbean versus Europe, obviously you don't guide or give results by region, but so much of last year, probably going back even further was this notion that in quarters where he had more Caribbean since the Caribbean was outperforming your yield was going to benefit from that. It doesn't seem like that's necessarily the case as we look to 2Q. Are we finally at the point where Europe -- European bookings are a drag on your overall yield numbers as they sort of catch up with the Caribbean?","Jason Liberty","I think we're experiencing in Europe, first of all, there's a little more stability, there's been less activities that have disrupted the environment and obviously, this year, we've made a lot of deployment changes that have created kind of a more stable environment in Europe. And so first, I mean, Europe has always been a contributor to our yields. Last year, the Eastern Mediterranean kind of weighted on European yields, but I mean, overall, the demand we're seeing, the pricing we're seeing has been a very good place this year and very similar to what it was in the '14 timeframe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia","I should probably warn you that my parents are getting on one of your ships today, so you might want to watch out for the Zackfias. But in terms of question --","Jason Liberty","I hope they bought their wallet, Sharon.","Sharon Zackfia","You might want to cut off the alcohol for them.","Richard Fain","We'll notify security.","Sharon Zackfia","Most of my questions were answered, but I guess, I'm just curious in terms of passengers under 35. How do you feel the appetite is for cruising in that generation and kind of what you're learning might be different or similar to prior cruisers at that kind of same age group?","Michael Bayley","Sharon, which ship are your parents sailing on?","Sharon Zackfia","They're on Navigator. They're going across the Atlantic.","Michael Bayley","That's good. We'll make sure we take good care of them. Under 35, I mean one of -- in the millennial market, one of the things that we believe in is when a millennial has a child, they really come into our sweet spot for Royal Caribbean certainly and as soon as those millennials get kids then they really want to have a great time with their family and we work very well for them. The one obvious thing that's quite meaningful is digital technology and access through whom the world around them.","So of course, that's something that we put into place a couple of years ago and I think that's really proven to be successful. The other kind of component is the whole idea of multigenerational vacations and that's something that we really do focus on, this idea that we can offer a multigenerational experience to our customers and of course the Oasis-class ships really are the great expression of that. So, we see some differences, but then we also see a great deal of similarities.","Our customers are looking for great quality, great vacation, attentive service, innovation and creating great memories, and I think we really put a lot of energy into creating these a very special moments. So, with the new ones of digital technology and then dining is becoming something that's slightly different with the millennial market and that something that we're obviously focused on both for our current fleet and also as we look at our new builds coming online.","Jason Liberty","We have time for one more question.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Jamie Katz from MorningStar.","Jaime Katz","I have just one quick question on pricing integrity. You guys haven't really specifically discussed it in recent quarters, but I'm curious whether you've thought about maybe expanding it to new source markets or if you have thought about changing the duration of it at all?","Richard Fain","Not really. It's been very successful for us. We think it was well designed for the markets it's in. Actually, I was a little taken aback by the question because we really haven't talked about it. We think it's working, but we haven't for a while talked about extending it in any which way. We gradually put it in a little bit of time. I suspect now that you raised the question, we'll take another look at it. But it covers the bulk of our markets anyhow and we haven't talked about it, but I suspect we will.","Jason Liberty","Okay. Well, thank you all for your interest and thank you, Victoria for assistance on the call today. Carol will be available for any follow-up questions you might have and we wish you all a great day.","Operator","Again, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect."],"19047":["Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

And welcome to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Limited Third Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Jason Liberty, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.","Jason Liberty","Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carol Cabezas, our Vice President of Investor Relations. During this call, we will be referring to a few slides which have been posted on our Investor Web site, www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our Web site.","Richard will begin by providing an overview of the business. I will follow with a recap of our third quarter results, provide an update on the current booking environment and provide our early thoughts on 2017. I will close with guidance for the full year and fourth quarter. We will then open the call up for your questions. Richard?","Richard Fain","Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everybody. It's a pleasure to have the opportunity to share more about our business and our progress to the Double-Double, so let me get right there. We are quickly coming to the end of 2016 and will shortly be starting the final year of our Double-Double program. Reaching the Double-Double will be a significant accomplishment to the 65,000 women and men who collectively make Royal Caribbean Cruises successful.","However, I do want to emphasize that Double-Double is not an end in an of itself. Rather it represents the completion of another step in our continuous journey of improving shareholder returns. The success of the Double-Double press on three pillars strengthening revenue yields, controlling costs and moderate growth.","Our progress on this journey has been steady. Not only has the slope of the curve been very steep but it's been remarkably strong and predictable. As you can see on Slide 2 both earnings and yields have consistently ended up right around the midpoint of the range that we stated at the beginning of each year. This track record comes despite some unexpected impact from things like foreign exchange and fuel.","For example, our biggest non-dollar market has been the U.K. but Sterling has fallen 30% over the last two years and that got a significant push from the recent Brexit vote. This year is shaping up to deliver in a similar fashion. Our yield guidance today at 4% or better is about the same as it was at the beginning of the year when we adjusted the deconsolidation of Pullmantur.","Earnings per share expectations of $6 to $6.10 are a little better than our original range despite a number of challenges that came our way this year. So the fact that our year is ending above our original guidance in spite of the challenges is a testament to the focus discipline and will of the team. To that I express my appreciation.","I'd also like to take a moment and step back to discuss some of the developments to our core financial objectives including achieving investment-grade metrics, improving shareholder returns and moderate capacity growth. I know that many of you model our performance outlook diligently and you can see that we're now reaching the key financial metrics that are the threshold for investment-grade.","Getting to this point hasn't been easy but it is important and we are committed to achieving and maintaining a BBB credit status. In this regard, it was basically satisfying when Moody's issued its upgrade of our improved outlook. It is rewarding to see progress on all our goals and this is another big one.","I also know that many of you are up-to-date on our announcements and have noticed our recent increase in dividends. Our dividend level is an all-time high and is now four times what it was just over three years ago. In the same period we also executed significant buyback program.","As our earnings continue to grow and as conditions warrant, and by that I include earnings and free cash flow, we will continue to engage in a mix of moderate dividend growth and share buyback programs. These steps are clear evidence of our commitment to improving shareholder returns.","Now turning to the third pillar moderate capacity growth has been a focal point of a lot of conversation. We said before that the pipeline of supply is known and it's very much constrained by limited shipyard capacity. We set our target is 3% to 5% growth rate and that's just what we've been doing.","Through 2005 our five-year actual capacity growth rate was just under 4% a year and for the coming five years it's also just under 4%. Now on the demand side, we've seen some markets contract such as the Eastern Mediterranean but we've also seen new markets expand such as China and Australia. It's important to note that cruising is still under penetrated in all of our markets including our core markets.","We open up new markets like China because they're growing at extraordinary rates not because of inadequate demand elsewhere. For example we're aware that some people have been arguing for years that the U.S. market is saturated but we've been growing here strongly and consistently in both rate and volume and we expect to continue to do so for years to come.","Our task is to continue to make people especially non-cruisers aware of all the cruising offers. That takes continued effort but it is working. This year alone we've added more than 1.6 million new recruits. That demonstrates our continued strength in this market and positions us for what we believe to be a bright future.","Now before I hand the call back over to Jason, I want to touch on one more point related to environmental stewardship protecting the environment is responsibility we take seriously Royal Caribbean both because of the impact on our environment and because it just makes good business sense. We focus heavily on reducing our carbon footprint and we're proud to publish our energy consumption figures.","They consistently show that our burning of fossil fuels shows the lowest figures reported by anyone in our industry. This success comes from a deep focus on finding new and better ways to doing things. For example, our bubble technology, which is more properly called lubrication system reduces drag thereby reducing the need for burning fuel.","But in keeping with our mantra of continuous improvement, we've gone one step further. Recently we partnered with the world wildlife fun to take our sustainability performance to the next level. Together with WWF we have announced publicly goals related to greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable food supply and destination stewardship. This partnership falls exciting progress on a number of other fronts including our advanced wastewater purification systems and our zero landfill policy already implemented on 17 ships.","We are also very pleased to be working with the EPA and have their support as we install advanced emissions purification or AEP systems on our ships. This is a massive and expensive task but a very impactful one. These AEP systems scrub more than 98% of the sulfur from our ships exhaust.","Lastly we have recently announced a new class of ships dubbed icon-class. The ships will be powered by LNG and will also utilize the latest fuel cell technology. Fuel cells are the ultimate in smoke-free exhaust. The only omission from fuel cells is pure water. In conclusion, it's been a good quarter and the future looks very bright. Brexit and other factors have been unexpected blows but we have more than compensated in other ways.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jason. Jason?","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Richard.","I will begin by taking you through our results for the third quarter. Unless I state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency basis. We have summarized our third quarter results on Slide 3.","For the quarter we generated adjusted net income of $3.20 per share, $0.10 better than the previous guidance. About half of the outperformance was driven by better revenue but the other half of the beat driven by weaker dollar and lower fuel prices.","Third quarter net revenue yield was better than expected up 2.9% year-over-year. Strength in close in demand for North American products was a primary driver of the outperformance. Onboard revenue deals for the quarter did not disappoint with yields up 4.8% for the quarter. The growth was mainly driven by beverage packages, an increasing demand for VOOM and Xcelerate, our high-speed Internet offerings for Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises respectively. Costs were as expected for the quarter with Net Cruise cost excluding fuel down 1.6%.","Before I get into discussing booking trends, I would like to discuss deviations between the quarters. Our yield came in slightly better than expected in the third quarter and are expected to be slightly lower than our previous expectations in the fourth quarter. As a result, our yields for the full year are essentially unchanged.","We often get asked whether these small aberrations between quarters signify a trend. The answer is no. And I would like to explain why. The reality is that we manage a large and diversified portfolio, brands, markets and products. These complex portfolio obviously has minor deviations especially in a period as short quarter. This year is a good example. Something as simple and insignificant as the delay in the deployment of the Empress of the Seas will drive yields to be lower for the fourth quarter than we originally expected. This delay has no long-term significance but it does affect quarterly figures.","As Richard mentioned our track record is pretty good and Slide 2 shows that over the past several years we've been able to deliver annual yield and earning results in line with the original guidance we set for the year. We don't see this immaterial aberration between Q3 and Q4 to be a trend just a reflection of managing a global and diversified portfolio. This is further supported by the 2017 booking trend commentary I will be providing shortly.","Now I will share trend in the demand environment for the balance of 2016 and provide early insight into 2017. Let me start off by discussing the fourth quarter where our mix of deployment shifts versus the summer. We have more capacity in the Caribbean and Australia and less in the Mediterranean.","Our year-over-year growth in fourth quarter Caribbean deployment is driven by the additions of both Harmony of the Seas and Empress of the Seas in South Florida. As a result, Caribbean itineraries will count for half of our Q4 capacity. We expect Caribbean yields to be up mid-single digits for the quarter which as I previously mentioned is softer than our previous expectations due to the delay in opening Empress of the Seas for sale. Expectations for the rest of the Caribbean products remain relatively unchanged.","Asia-Pacific and Europe itineraries are generally performing in line with our previous outlook. So in summary we are 94% booked for the fourth quarter and with the exception of Empress, yields are shaping up as expected.","Moving on to 2017, I want to start by providing you an overview of some of the structural factors and deployment changes that play a part in the upcoming year. I will then discuss the early trends we're seeing in the business. We will see a benefit in the first half of the year from the addition of both Harmony of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas. We will have a tailwind to our yield related to the deconsolidation of Pullmantur which is worth a little over 250 basis points for the first half of next year.","As a reminder our portion of Pullmantur's results will be reported as an equity pickup and since we continue to own the vessels you will continue to incur depreciation for the ship. Lastly our joint venture TUI Cruises will receive another new ship during the second quarter.","As we announced earlier this year, Legend of the Seas will exit the fleet at the end of the first quarter. This sale is very much in line with our fleet strategy of opportunistically selling order capacity. We are making several changes to our itinerary mix in 2017 that will reduce exposure to the Eastern Mediterranean while bringing new hardware to the Caribbean and moderately growing the Asia Pacific region.","Our Caribbean deployment will increase in 2017 and will represent just under half of our total capacity. This increase is largely due to the expanded season for both Harmony of the Seas and Celebrity Equinox. Both of these ships will remain in the Caribbean year-around versus sailing in Europe as they did during the summer of 2016.","The change in deployment for these ships combined with the deconsolidation of Pullmantur is driving a reduction in Mediterranean capacity. As a result, Europe will represent 15% of our overall capacity in 2017 versus 20% in 2016.","Asia-Pacific itineraries will account for approximately 20% of our capacity which is relatively consistent with 2016. Our capacity in China will decrease slightly as a longer season of Ovation of the Seas is only offsetting a portion of the reduction due to the sale of Legend of the Seas.","While it's still too early to provide guidance for next year, I will share some preliminary insights. Our booked position is stronger than last year as we are up in both pricing and load factors across all major markets for like deployment. This is particularly noteworthy when you consider that our booked load factor has improved each year for the past several years culminating in a record high for next year.","Our Caribbean and Alaska products are trending well despite very difficult comparisons in 2016 and bookings for European sailings are up nicely year-over-year driven by strong demand from North American. We're also pleased with how the Winter Asia-Pacific season is shaping up with both Australia and China sailings booked ahead of prior-year load factors in the first quarter.","Although it's still early in the booking window, these insights provide added confidence in our path toward the Double-Double and we expect that 2017 will be our eighth consecutive year of yield improvement.","If you turn to Slide 4, you will see our guidance for the full year 2016. Net revenue yields are expected to be up 4% or better essentially unchanged from last quarter's guidance. Our cost guidance is also unchanged with Net Cruise cost excluding fuel are expected to be up approximately 1%.","Our fuel cost for the year have decreased since our last call to $720 million driven by rate and we are 68% hedged for the remainder of 2016 at a price of $535 per metric ton. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is expected to be in the range of $6 to $6.10 per share unchanged from previous guidance.","To summarize the changes we've made since the last call we exceeded the third quarter by $0.10 per share approximately half of which was driven by the outperformance of our North American products. This beat is helping to offset the previously mentioned impact from the delay in the deployment of Empress of the Seas.","A weaker U.S. dollar and lower fuel prices contributed the other half of the third quarter beat. However this trend reverses itself in the fourth quarter.","Now I would like to walk you through our fourth quarter guidance on Slide 5. Net yields are expected to be up approximately 6%.The year-over-year increase is being driven by the deconsolidation of Pullmantur and strong trends on our Caribbean and Australia itineraries. Harmony of the Seas in the Caribbean and Ovation of the Seas in Australia are doing particularly well.","Net Cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be down approximately 1.5% and we have included $189 million of fuel expense for the quarter. Taking all of this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately a $1.20 for the quarter which represents nearly 30% growth year-over-year.","With that I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you quantify the EPS and yield impact from the delay in deployment for Empress in the fourth-quarter and was that the only reason why your fourth-quarter yields are a little bit lower than your prior forecast","Richard Fain","Sure, Jared. So the impact from the delay in deployment was about $0.06 or $0.07 for the fourth quarter. Outside of that there's small little puts and takes that make up the balance but it's very immaterial.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. Great, thanks. There has been a lot of concerns about the promotional environment, particularly in the Caribbean, can you expand on that and what you're seeing right now? And if you feel the need to be more a little bit more promotional right now because of some of the incremental capacity or how you are thinking about that?","Michael Bayley","Jared, it's Michael. Yes we're feeling pretty good about Caribbean, some things looking good both on volume and rate with the capacity increase and '16 shaping up pretty well. It looks very typical in terms of what we\u2019re seeing with booking patents and Q4 as we've seen in previous years, so everything is looking quite normal.","Obviously promotional activity ebbs and flows. We had Hurricane Mitch blowing through the week before last so we had about a week of a drop in bookings which is inevitable as it moved its way up the East Coast. And I think we did and other certainly try to stimulate the demand by putting in some promotional activity which then the responses was very good.","We had a promotion last week which was the second best performing promotion in the brands history.","Jared Shojaian","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein Research.","David Beckel ","Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could, maybe a little early, but I was wondering if you could talk about net-cruise costs growth for next year. Reminding us of what some of the key puts and takes are when considering modeling cost growth? And as a follow-up to that, what are some of the more significant levers on costs you can pull if yields do come in lighter than expected? Thanks.","Michael Bayley","Thanks David. We're still going to our planning process for next year but as we've said in the past we need to continue to control our cost like we have over the past several years. I know early on in our Double-Double program we talked more about some of the chunkier thing that we've been doing on the cost side and really over the past year or so, a lot of this is down a little thing that we do to become a more efficient across our business. There are always small levers to pull to try to write yourself, if there is yield or challenges, but there is nothing specific that I would call out?","Jason Liberty","But I think I would leave at this point with saying that I think we've shown over the past several years\u2019 management's commitment to cost control, and try to become more efficient year-over-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jason, thanks for the color that you gave for next year. I wanted to see if we could get a little bit more granular to clarify things because there is three -- from our perspective there is three overarching concerns for the next year right? So the yields -- the risk of continue to yield pressures in China, supply growth in the Caribbean, and then also FXd fuel headwinds for next year.","Regarding Asia-Pacific, I think you said that and China -- your booked position in China is ahead in load, so I was wondering for a moment if you could touch upon if you think where yields could come out next year, if you think you could see yield pressure again in China? And then also your confidence level of growing yields in the Caribbean? And then if there's any way, I mean I think a lot of people are doing the math based on where FX and fuel is today to calculate where that might impact next year, so if you could touch upon that as well.","Jason Liberty ","Sure. Well, first half when we kind of think about next year, it\u2019s obviously too early to provide any guidance and any guidance by products. But we do have as we have where we are currently booked, a commentary on Asia-Pac, which really at this point in the year. We have pretty good visibility into the first quarter, it's been encouraging.","And hopefully those trends continue on as that product \u2013 on books further out here over time. And then when we talk about the Caribbean and but I also include Europe in there, at this point in time in the year a lot of that is driven by the North American consumers, and as I commented in my remarks that we have seen very positive trends in both rate and volume basis for the Caribbean as well as for our European products.","And then to answer your question, on the currency side certainly the strength in the dollar relative to the pound has been challenging. If you want to say what is it's kind of been since the last call it's probably you heard us by about $0.12 to $0.15. And so there are always headwinds in our business that we have to focus on and overcome. But that's kind of been the impact since the last time we spoke here in early August.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then a follow-up on some puts and takes for next year, because you mentioned that there will be a tailwind from Pullmantur of 250 basis points from yields in the first half. There's also -- do you also get a benefit from the management fee, as well? Could help us understand how the full picture, the full mathematical picture works for Pullmantur?","Jason Liberty ","Yes, I mean there is obviously deconsolidation. There is the benefit and that's respectively kind of included in that estimate of the 250 basis points in the first half of the year. The balance of that for the year is a material as it relates to the management fee. So it's a small contributor, but not something I'll specifically call out in the build-up of the yield.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley","Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the Empress because our impression has been that you are maybe not opening up Empress for new sailings because you were hoping for a new Caribbean itinerary to open up before the end of the year. I wanted to ask what your expectation -- is it still that that potentially that could open up before the end of the year or is the idea to keep Empress into Q1 without opening it up for new sailings yet?","Jason Liberty","So obviously, as we were considering the deployment for Empress because typically as Robin, we deploy a ship or open up the deployment for ship about 12 months to 18 months ahead of time. I think we have seen or we've obviously been in conversations about what the future deployment of that ship could be and that did not resolve itself in the back half of this year and that's really what caused the impact on Empress, because we effectively opened up for deployment in August. I think we continue to look for that ship to potentially have some other deployment, but I don't think we will be holding back our sailings in the future and we'll deal with it as maybe some of that new deployment comes available.","Robin Farley","And then just for my follow-up question, there is\u2026?","Jason Liberty","I just comment Robin and it's already opened for next year at Empress.","Robin Farley","So it just ready for existing Caribbean itineraries, right?","Jason Liberty","Yes, in Q1.","Robin Farley","And then for my follow-up question, there have some reports and the current media that China is limiting some tour package travel to Korea for a political reasons and just wondering if you are seeing any kind of impact at all since cruises from China calling Korean ports. Any impact at all of getting this sense that there is going to be some kind of limit or any you have seen so far for Mainland Chinese visitors going to Korea by cruise?","Michael Bayley","Hi, Robin, it's Michael. No, we have seen no impact whatsoever. We think it's very much related to the type of package that's offered that really is all about encouraging Chinese customers to go to Korea, specifically for shopping trips. And we think it's related to that. So the packages put into the markets that are incredibly low cost and of course they bring the customers over and make the revenue from the retail. So we feel as if that's something is very specifically focused. So we don't \u2013 we have not seen anything and we don't believe there'll be any impact to us.","Robin Farley","That's very helpful. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo.","Tim Conder ","Good morning and congrats to the whole team for an onpoint execution. Just a couple of things, I wanted to revisit the mix shift with the Harmony and the Equinox, Jason, that you called out. Is that going to be yield accretive, given Europe traditionally has higher yields than the Caribbean? Just on that shift for the similar comparisons year-over-year, a little color on that please?","And the fuel, you have been fairly aggressive towards the high-end or above the higher end of your 40% to 60% range in hedging, especially you appeared to put on quite a bit when the oil was in the 30s. A little bit more color on where your weighted average hedges are looking into 2017 and 2018? And then if you continue to view as glaring on more aggressively or back off a little bit on that as you lay her out 12, 24, 36 months? Thank you.","Jason Liberty","So Tim, on the first question as relates to Harmony and Equinox, your first deal \u2013 trends or demand for Harmony has been exceptional, and we do expect with Harmony being here next year for to be yield accretive and certainly helps us a lot in the first half of the year. In Equinox mainly was in the Eastern Mediterranean and really kind of in the center of lot of movements we had to make with some of the geopolitical events that were happening. So we do expect the Equinox to be a yield accretive to the corporation next year.","On the fuel side on 2017 we\u2019re hedged about 60%. The average hedge rate there is about $508 and in 2018 we're 45% hedged and we're about $452 as the average hedge. And we continue to feel your focus and on having hedge program to minimize the volatility within our P&L. And we also respect that there is typically an inverse relationship between fuel and currency.","We also take into consideration the fuel curve and it has flattened out. And so this earlier last year, we did take advantage and put a little bit more hedging on in 2016 and in the outer years, but you should kind of expect us to continue to be pretty consistent to the past of that kind of 40% to 60% side of things and again with the goal of a minimizing volatility within the P&L.","Tim Conder","Okay. Great. And what my follow-up would be related to Europe. You said you seen very good bookings so far out of North America, given specifically how it books early for Europe. Any color by region? Is it tilted more towards Northern Europe or the Western Med where everything is consolidated to in the Med? Any additional color or how the Brits are also booking?","Michael Bayley ","Hi, Tim it\u2019s Michael. Europe is looking quite good for 2017. When we look at our forward bookings obvious Eastern Med capacity is down versus last year and the year before. We\u2019ve been aware of that. So it\u2019s pretty all over Europe. So Northern Europe obvious is doing quite well and also Western Med. European market typically a later booking than the American market. It\u2019s the American market that seems to be doing quite well at the momentum for Europe. And the British market surprisingly is quite robust. We were thinking that we\u2019d see more of an impact. There is a little bit of an impact in onboard spend, but nothing really material.","Tim Conder","We\u2019ll see in a few weeks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Wieczynski with Stifel.","Steven Wieczynski","Hi good morning guys. I want to ask the Double-Double question a little bit differently. One of the questions we get a lot from investors is how are you going to achieve the Double-Double next year without buying back a significant amount of your stock or getting some massive benefit from Pullmantur? Can you help us think about the bridge to get around or get close to the Double-Double range? Meaning if you do a midpoint this year of called $6.05, from a very high level, how do you get up close to that $6.78 or $6.80 number that would be pretty helpful?","Jason Liberty","Thanks Steve. Obviously, we won\u2019t kind of talk about any guidance for next year. But really you need us to continue to through strong cost control and have modest yield improvement and that gets your most of the way. And then obviously there is some benefit we get from the deconsolidation of Pullmantur, but that\u2019s really a small amount of that pie.","Richard Fain","Steve it\u2019s Richard here. And one of the things that we\u2019ve tried to emphasize for the last three or four years is we put in place the Double-Double program with an idea that we want to motivate our team and focus our team on a particular target. But it wasn\u2019t something and we\u2019ve said this before that required heroic efforts. So we do need good cost control. We think we have been showing that. We do need moderate yield improvements. We think we\u2019ve been showing that.","And I think as you look to the Double-Double year obviously, it\u2019s a complicated set of all the things that happened in our business, but as we simply look at where we are today with a moderate kind of yield improvements that we\u2019re looking for we don\u2019t think we need to do anything heroic to make the Double-Double and we continue to believe we\u2019ll do it.","Jason Liberty","And just one more comment, Steve, I think just always appreciating the sensitivities because every 1% change in yield is about $70 million and so by just keeping your cost managed most of that drops to the bottom line and that in itself drives that difference in earnings.","Steven Wieczynski","Okay. Great. Second question, and you might kill me for asking this, but, I know we are not even remotely close with 2017 or done with 2017, but have you given any thought to what's beyond 2017 and what is beyond the Double-Double? Looking back, is this something that you -- you have fully embraced it, but is there something that potentially could come once this is over? Meaning another type of program like the Double-Double?","Richard Fain","So the beauty of having Steve, I think we\u2019re not looking any further, it\u2019s a reasonable question. It\u2019s in fact something that we ask ourselves all the time and I did actually. I think I included in my comments something that the Double-Double is a step on the journey. We in terms of what comes after Double-Double, I don\u2019t know whether there will be another program of that type or some other type. The Double-Double was really the focus on a particular phase in our history and I think it served that role very well.","As we look at 2018, we do have a couple of things that are quite exciting. We do have the force of the Oasis Class ships. But I\u2019d say even more so 2018 will show Edge Class and the Edge Class is a new class of ships, which I think in its own way will be as innovative and as transformation as Oasis has been. We\u2019re very excited about it. We\u2019ll probably be talking more about that early next year.","But Celebrity really has been on the roll and I think we\u2019ll see the benefits of that if it continues going away its going we\u2019ll see the benefits of that in 2017 and 2018 and when Edge comes I think people are really going to be blown away. So I\u2019m very excited 2018, but the importance of a program like Double-Double is to focus on a particular goal. And one of the things that\u2019s been successful for us is everybody is focused on achieving the Double-Double in 2017 and so that\u2019s our first one and I will be careful not to delve too much on what comes after.","Steven Wieczynski","Okay, great. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry Curtis","Good morning. The first question is, historically when you've headed into wave season and a stronger than normal booked position, do you think you're borrowing from wave, or does that usually lead to stronger incremental pricing because you've just got less inventory to sell?","Jason Liberty","Hi, Harry. Traditionally as we\u2019d had a stronger book position obviously the need is less. But if you were to do it kind of do it on a capacity adjusted basis, I would say that typically that gives us good tailwinds coming into WAVE as we\u2019re in a stronger position as we need less. So I don\u2019t think necessarily it\u2019s an indicator, but certainly being a stronger position allows you to take advantage of the demand as it comes in.","Harry Curtis","Thank you. And I just wanted to move quickly to China, because it's been one of the key pillars of the bear thesis and the consensus for next year is that pricing in China is going to be down 10% to 15%. Can you give us your perspective on what demand is going to look like -- demand growth is going to look like in China next year? Do you think that the supply growth is going to be as big as some would have you believe, given that much of the capacity is coming in the back half of next year?","Michael Bayley","Hi, Harry, it\u2019s Michael. China is very much a developmental market. It\u2019s we believe significant opportunity. We\u2019ve been in the market for several years now. It represents about 9% of our overall capacity in 2017. Interestingly in 2017 for Royal our overall capacity in the China market is flat to slightly down because of the sale of Legend which takes it out of the secondary cities.","And also for industry capacity in 2017, it\u2019s actually relatively low growth year in relation to the past years, which is probably a good thing. And certainly in Shanghai which is 60% of the China market approximately the growth in 2017 in Shanghai is less than 10%, which is one of the lowest rates we\u2019ve seen for quite some time. Overall China is accretive to yield and we\u2019ll continue that way. And as Jason commented earlier, our current forward book position if Q1 China is looking good.","Harry Curtis","That's great. And just a quick follow-up Jason in China. What efficiency measures can you take even if pricing is flat there to improve your profitability?","Jason Liberty","Hi, Harry. I'm just going to jump in and give some comments on this. I mean we are very much engaged in developing the market. So at the moment we\u2019re investing in China. We\u2019re investing in developing distribution and developing the channel. So at the moment, our focus is developing the market and investing in the market. We believe the opportunity is significant into the future. And we\u2019re not actively pursuing efficiencies from that perspective. We\u2019re looking at investing and developing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory Badishkanian","Just a follow-up on the comment that Q1 China is looking good, which is encouraging. How are your negotiations right now with the larger charter companies going for 2017? Any color and when you think those will be completed?","Jason Liberty","The negotiations are in process. We're feeling quite good about where we are in terms of the major charter is in the wholesalers in the market. Obviously we\u2019ve a long-term relationship with the key charters and we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing for '17 in terms of the dialogue and negotiations that we have with them and we feel quite optimistic about that.","Gregory Badishkanian","Good. I won't ask you to quantify optimistic, but\u2026","Jason Liberty","You could ask Greg. We just wanted to\u2026","Gregory Badishkanian","How about what's driving the strength in the North American passengers going to Europe? Is it just easier comparisons things, maybe people are less concerned about going to Europe, is it less capacity, what do you think is driving that improvement?","Jason Liberty","Well, I think it's tough to a pinpoint one thing, obviously I think when there is less events that certainly helps bring confidence and confidence of people's travel. But I mean I think as we\u2019ve been saying for some time, we continue to see strength from the North American consumer, and not only do we see that in terms of their current bookings in Q4 and for next year, but also we see it and how they spend each and every day on our shifts. So I don\u2019t know there\u2019s a specific game, but obviously Europe is a incredible destination and there is a lot of demand for it and obviously there were some events last year that that maybe caused on individuals to pause and looks like they\u2019re revisiting that for next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions on the pound specifically. The more recent devaluation, I'm curious if you're doing anything to help bolster onboard spending? I know you said earlier it has remained pretty resilient, but I didn't know if that took into account the more recent step down? Then separately Jason, can you remind us how much you have left on your share repurchase plan at this point?","Jason Liberty","Sharon, I\u2019ll just talk a little bit about the pound and how are approaching that within - from the perspective on both spend. We\u2019ve ratcheted to that up or pre-cruise marketing, we\u2019re bundling packages more aggressively than we\u2019ve done in the past and we see a better response pick up rate from the British consumer in terms of the packaging that we put into the market.","So I think we see it a little bit, but it\u2019s \u2013 I think less than we originally thought we would see in terms of devaluation. And then Sharon on your question on the share repurchase, we did not complete the $500 million share repurchase in the third quarter.","Sharon Zackfia","Is there any timing on when the board would discuss another share repurchase program?","Jason Liberty","The Board is always evaluating things such as share repurchase for capital returned to shareholders and obviously recently the 28% increase in the dividend was one of those actions they thought was good idea to do.","Michael Bayley","And I would also a pay attention to our free cash flow figures, since obviously that is a key factor in the Board's thought process.","Operator","Your next question comes from Assia Georgieva with Infiniti Research.","Assia Georgieva","Good morning. This is Assia. I had a couple of related questions, first of all Jason, you mentioned Empress was about $0.06 to $0.07 to Q4. Is that about a 1% yield detriment in the quarter?","Jason Liberty","It's fairly over 100 basis points for the quarter, so with that that would be at about 7%. And then also the other some rounding as well in terms of what the implied deal for the fourth quarter.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. Thank you. And given that even for Q1 2017 the ship was opened up relatively late compared to what you have traditionally done. Should we expect a similar detriment for Q1?","Michael Bayley","Assia, it\u2019s Michael. No I think we opened up earlier we\u2019ve got marketing behind it. So I think we really were holding it late in '16 and hoping for some - for the itinerary change but we\u2019re in a better position for 2017.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. That make sense. Thank you, Michael. And lastly without having to quantify anything on Q1 because I know you'd rather not do that, we are facing pretty tough comps and I think the industry in general had done very well. Do expect that on a sequential basis Q1 might be little bit more of a challenged than Q4? Just very qualitatively?","Michael Bayley","I think that there are several factors obviously Q1 on the yield side will have a positive impact from just a deconsolidation of Pullmantur. But also the strength that we\u2019ve seen for Harmony and Ovation have been quite strong and Harmony will obviously be in the Caribbean and Ovation will be in Australia, and demand from both of those markets and for those products have been exceptional. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that it is obviously a tough comp because Q1 was strong. But there were some good tailwinds going into the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities.","James Hardiman","Good morning and thank you for taking my call. The commentary on 2017 load factors was pretty consistent with what you said coming out of the second quarter. I want to focus on the last few months in both the Caribbean and Europe. I think in the Caribbean a lot of investors have been spooked as of late, as we look at some of them pricing analysis that is out there. Obviously in the past it's always difficult to know how many rooms are being booked at a given price. But maybe you have seen some of that in houses or at least some of those advertised prices.","Maybe help us connect the dots there? Is it the same as normal that it's not a whole lot of rooms being booked at those rates? What are your thoughts there? Then on Europe, it sounds like over the past few months, bookings and pricing has strengthened as we get further and further away from the terrorist activity, but just distill the last three months here rapidly?","Jason Liberty","Well, I think as you\u2019re going from early August to today, people began to transition and focus on their vacations for 2017. I think some of - as Michael commented, there were some tactical activity that you probably saw on the market and that was driven around Hurricane Matthew and you know probably the best example where you would have seen that.","But we\u2019ve actually seen very good booking trends, forward looking for the Caribbean and for Europe, a lot of that at this point in the year is driven by the North American consumer because they book further out and - but as Michael said, we\u2019re also seeing positive trends happening for Europe.","James Hardiman","That's very helpful. And then I guess just once and for all with respect to this Double-Double, the EPS target is technically $6.78 but I think you mentioned maybe off-line that you're going to need to get to $7 for the ROIC target to still be in play. Which number - as we get closer to 2017 that $0.22 difference becomes pretty material. How should we think about earnings power for next year implied in the Double-Double?","Jason Liberty","At this point we\u2019re not going to get into providing guidance for next year and I think for us, we\u2019re focused on hitting both targets, the earnings target as well as the ROIC target and we\u2019ll address specifically what we think that earnings range will be in late January, early February when we provide guidance for next year, but a good try.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Daniel McKenzie","Good morning. Thanks guys. On the 1.6 million new to cruise, how does that compare to last year? I am trying to get a sense of the implied growth rate here and also how that rate might be trending, that's first. Second, I'm curious what's driving that and what percent of the North American revenue we're talking about here?","Michael Bayley","Hi Dan, it\u2019s Michael. $1.6 million new to cruise, that\u2019s for globally and that's hallmark is obviously is disproportionate in terms of new emerging markets, for example China. In the United States, which of course is significant percentage of our overall business, approximately 50% and we\u2019ve had a very productive year, this year we need to cruise and in fact over time it\u2019s being slightly on the decline.","This year, we've turned that around and we\u2019ve seen a really positive increase in new to cruise and of course that\u2019s a very much part of our focus is. New to cruise not only in merging new and developing markets, but also in established markets like the U.S. so we quite encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing.","And part of that the campaign that we launched at the beginning of the year and also Celebrity's campaign, both of those campaigns have components that are very much attractive to new to cruise and when you do the research on how our positioning and how we\u2019re communicating, resonates with new to cruise, it\u2019s very positive. So we\u2019re beginning to see that coming through in our bookings.","Richard Fain","Dan, this is Richard, and I\u2019ll just add a comment because we often get questions about trends of things that have changed, and it\u2019s clear the questions are gear to is the world changing, is this the trend in the exogenous variables affecting us.","But as Michael pointed out, we actually worked to change trends. So there are periods of time, where we for example as both Royal - as Michael said, both Royal and Celebrity made a conscious decision this year that there was a stronger opportunity, a good opportunity with first time cruisers. And so they actually focus more of their marketing, focus more on their message and they actually worked to build that.","So when you look at a trend, it\u2019s not just is the world changing, but to some extend it's also what we are doing to shift our customer base and then that some time messes up nice trend lines when you trying to extrapolate from external behavior.","Daniel McKenzie","Very good. That's very helpful. Thank you. A second question here, wondering how big the impact to net yield is from the new revenue management technology implemented a while back. And I'm wondering what inning we are in with respect to its implementation. And for some perspective when airlines put in new revenue management they tend to go slow. And I'm curious how you would characterize where we are with respect to that to Royal?","Jason Liberty","Thanks for the question Dan. I think it's one of those things that's impossible to quantify and we putting new yield management systems several years ago and everyday that goes by the yield management systems get stronger because the information from the past and how we read information of what\u2019s happening in local markets and so forth gets better and better.","So it\u2019s truly a tailwind to quantify is next to impossible to do but it really I think one of the greatest benefit that gives is the ability to manage demand globally and that allows us to seek the highest yield for every cabin that's available from anyone of the world and that's obviously great on a revenue management standpoint, it\u2019s also great to be able to taking advance of that diversification.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stuart Gordon with Berenberg.","Stuart Gordon","Good afternoon. Couple of questions. The first one is on the return of invested capital, does the Pullmantur change make any difference to the returns you make? And secondly in China, could you talk about how next year the changing proportion of capacity? Is it moving from pure charter to a more direct distribution? Thanks.","Jason Liberty","So, on the ROIC side, on the invested capital side there really is no difference, because as I said in my remarks, we still own those assets. But surely as we've been talking about for years Pullmantur was a turnaround opportunity and this allows us to some of those turnaround issues as well as get paid for the ships and services. So it's definitely accretive to ROIC. But it\u2019s on the earnings side, not necessarily on the invested capital side. I\u2019ll let Michael to take the China question.","Michael Bayley","Yes, on the evolution of distribution that something obviously that we\u2019ve been focused on for a quite some time and journey that we\u2019re taking. I think what we\u2019re seeing is the beginnings of the development of distribution in terms of starting to narrow and look very much like the North American distribution model in terms of our focus very much is engaged in opening all channels to market and optimizing each channel that includes our wholesalers charter model, which we believe has done exceptionally well up to this point, and we\u2019ll going to continue working with our charters, but we\u2019re also developing direct, we\u2019re also developing retail next cruise and that\u2019s very much what we\u2019ve been engaged in ever some time.","So I think that\u2019s the journey that we\u2019re taking and over time we\u2019ll see the mix balance out in a very similar way to the - of the markets, more developed markets.","Jason Liberty","Thank you. I apologize for final alarm here.","Michael Bayley","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Your final question comes from the line of Ben Chaiken with Credit Suisse.","Benjamin Chaiken","Hello. Following up on Europe and the North American consumer, what are you doing this year to encourage those customers to return? Is there any education process or promotions? If so, when did that start and is that with the travel agents or the customers directly?","Michael Bayley","Yes, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a necessary education, I just think it\u2019s - there\u2019s been less events that turned off to consumers last year and as I said before is allowing them to revisit the opportunity to go to beautiful and great destination in Europe. I think that\u2019s probably more what it is versus anything specifically we\u2019re doing in terms of education.","Benjamin Chaiken","Got it. Can you remind us what the overall net yield decline was in Europe for 2016 and where you're going to lap next year?","Michael Bayley","We haven't given that number, but it is down year-over-year.","Benjamin Chaiken","Okay. Are you going to quantify some of this positive trends that you're referring to with the American consumer coming into Europe?","Michael Bayley","Well, I mean the only I could quantify is that we\u2019re having both rate and volumes next year relative to same time last year.","Michael Bayley","Thank you for assistance Victoria with the call today. And we thank you all for your participation and interest in the company. Carol will be available for any follow-up questions you might have and we all wish you a great day.

My name is Nicole, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Limited Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brian Rice to begin. Please go ahead, sir.","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, Nicole, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter earnings call. With me here today are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; Dan Hanrahan, President and CEO of Celebrity Cruises; and Ian Bailey, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which we have posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I would like refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements on the first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Additionally, we will be discussing certain financial measures, which are non-GAAP as defined, and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.","Richard will start with his comments. I will follow with a recap of our results, give an update on our booking environment and provide our initial thoughts about 2012. Adam and Dan will then talk more about our brands and provide you with insight from some recent consumer research we've done, after which we'll open the call for your questions.","Richard?","Richard D. Fain","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. We actually have so many good things happening in our company and in our industry that I wish that those things could be the focus of this call. However, given the magnitude of the tragic incident in Italy and the fact that it's so recent, we feel obliged to comment on how this may affect us going forward.","All of us, personally, as employees and as an industry, all of us are saddened by the tragedy. This was an unheard-of event for our industry and all of us were heartsick to learn of it. But it's important to note that it's the very rarity of such an event that makes it so noteworthy. As a company and as an industry, we will take whatever lessons can be learned from this and we will continue to dedicate ourselves to providing the best and the safest vacations for our guests.","Fortunately, most people understand all this, and I am absolutely confident that this event will not have any significant long-term impact on our business. But while I'm convinced about the long term, we also need to be realistic about the short term. Not surprisingly, while our industry has been in the glare of the media spotlight for almost 3 weeks, we have seen an impact.","Booking volumes dropped significantly immediately following the event and they've remained down in the mid to low teens. As you would expect, there are some notable trends emerging. Cancellations, as a result of the incident, have simply not been a factor. It's not surprising to us, but it is reassuring. In Europe, the media coverage has been more extensive as the event was closer to home, and bookings have declined more than in the United States. Similarly, the recovery, for the same reason, is happening faster in the U.S. than in Europe. And as to be expected, closer-in bookings have declined more than further-out bookings. Lastly, knowledgeable customers are much more comfortable than people who have never taken a cruise. Looking at the seasonality of the impact, we've noted that quarter 1 was already quite well booked prior to the event so that quarter has been somewhat isolated from the impact. But for our second and third quarters, the level of uncertainty is high, although there have been some encouraging data points recently.","As we have resumed our advertising and as the headlines have subsided, booking volumes have shown improvement. I caution that a few days does not make a trend, but it is encouraging. Ultimately, we believe that while this is a tragedy and a fresh and a painful one at that, most customers recognize that the industry's safety record speak for itself, and our long-term business model is very much intact. Against this background, we would prefer not to be making any public projections. In fact, we -- I wish we didn't have to make any comments at all about bookings so soon after the event. We're in uncharted territory and our traditional models simply don't cover events like this. However, after much debate and much soul-searching, we eventually concluded that giving you our best perspective and explaining all the uncertainties was the best approach and the fairest one. We have worked hard to follow that approach and I hope that you will accept it with which, in the spirit with which it is given.","With that in mind, despite the impact of this year's earnings, we are continuing to look to the future and to build the profitability of our business. I would therefore like to shift from this unfortunate event, which has monopolized our thoughts, and focus on our core business. Now that business is thriving despite the challenges.","Prior to the tragedy in Italy, we would've said that our business was facing some of the most significant near-term economic and geopolitical headwinds in our history, and we were winning. The U.S. market has shown surprising strength in proving how robust a market for cruising it is. Europe has been more difficult, but even there, we were anticipating higher yields in 2012 partially because of lower comps. Australia is doing well, as is the rest of the Pacific Rim. The effects of Japan's earthquake are behind us, and that gives China a huge boost. And there, we were adding Voyager of the Seas in China this spring. She will be the largest and, I would modestly say, I think the best ship serving that area and she's making a big splash. As a new market, the China opportunity does cost us a great deal to address and it will take some time to pay off. Nevertheless, we think this is an important strategic move for us and we have accepted the short-term cost that it entails.","Costs are indeed actually a constant focus. More than 1\/2 of the expected increase for 2012 relates to structural changes, which have direct revenue offsets, and we've tried to explain that. The other 1% to 2% relates to investments which will drive yield improvements going forward, such as ship revitalizations, international expansion and technology investments. As our press release indicated, we had great pricing momentum coming into this year, much better in fact than I believe folks were expecting driven in part by these ongoing investments.","Now this year marks an important milestone for Royal Caribbean. For the first time in our history, the majority of our business is now coming from customers outside the U.S. This is the culmination of a strategic shift we started about 5 years ago and is in recognition of the fact that while the U.S. market continues to be strong and to flourish, the demand for our cruises and the demand for our ships is growing in an even more dramatic rate abroad. We have had to make a significant investment to make this happen and it certainly feels good to have reached such an important milestone.","As I've said before, diversification is a good strategy even when it seems that the market to which you are diversifying is the one having issues in the short term. It's a two-edged sword, and in this case, European cruising happens to be the one impacted by economic challenges, geopolitical turmoil and the fallout from this -- from the tragedy. At the same time, China is experiencing the labor pains associated with any new market. But all of these challenges are transitory. Our long-term trajectory is unchanged. Even with the difficult economy and other factors, we were heading into a powerful 2012. The tragic events in Italy are a blow but only to the short term. Our record for safety, our record for outstanding vacations and our ability to develop new and exciting markets gives us confidence about the path going forward. And that confidence is undimmed.","We are committed to staying the course in doing the best by our guests, our employees, our shareholders and our communities going forward.","With that, I'd like to turn this back over to Brian to take us through a little more detail. Brian?","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, Richard.","On the second slide, we have summarized our performance in the fourth quarter. We generated net income of $36.6 million or $0.17 per share. Net Yields improved 3.5% on a constant currency basis and 3.2% on an as-reported basis. We saw strong performance in the Caribbean where ticket yields improved by double digits, and Asia continued solid recovery in the aftermath of the Japan tragedy. Europe yields were down overall driven by Holy Land and other Eastern Mediterranean itineraries.","On the cost side, excluding fuel, our net cruise costs were up 3.7% on a constant currency basis and up 3.6% on an as-reported basis. As you know, we manage our costs on an annual basis and the impact from things like dry dock schedules, marketing and repair and maintenance expenses always cause timing issues among quarters. The fourth quarter was consistent with our guidance and part of another solid year of cost controls.","On Slide 3, we have summarized our full year results. Net income was $607 million or $2.77 a share. As you may recall, at this time last year, we provided initial earnings guidance for 2011 of between $3.25 and $3.45 per share. Fuel price increases decreased our earnings by $0.20 per share, and the impact of the Japan earthquake and the Arab Spring cost us an additional $0.65 per share. All other factors, including solid revenue and cost performance, exceeded the upper end of our initial guidance.","Net yields improved 2.4% on a constant currency basis and 4.1% on an as-reported basis. Ticket yields were very strong in the Caribbean, Baltic and Alaska, while pricing in the Eastern Med and Asia were down due to the geopolitical events. Pricing improved slightly more from the United States and Europe, but this appears to have been more driven by itinerary mix than the economy.","On the cost side, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, were up 1.3% on a constant currency basis and up 2.3% on an as-reported basis.","Finally, for the fixed-income folks on the call, I would like to mention that we generated $1.6 billion in operating cash flow and reduced our overall debt by over $650 million during the year. We continue our focus on returning to investment grade in the near term.","Now I'm sure most of you are interested in hearing about the current booking environment. We tried hard to be as transparent as possible in the press release, but I must caution that it has been less than 3 weeks since the Costa Concordia incident. The demand environment is still in a state of fluctuation. And with very limited data, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions.","That said, here is what we know. Immediately prior to the incident, our bookings were running about 5% ahead of a year ago and at higher prices. All 4 quarters of the year were booked at higher load factors and higher per diems than the same time last year. The incident occurred on January 13, and since that time, cancellation activity has been within normal levels. In the first 2 weeks after the accident when the media attention was greatest and practically all marketing activity was suspended, new reservations, combined for all of our brands and itineraries, were down approximately 20%. This week, the media coverage has begun to subside and advertising is beginning to come back. Over the last 5 days, new reservations are down in the low to mid teens, with each day showing slightly better performance.","We have seen a pronounced difference between consumer behavior in North America and Europe. North American demand appears to be recovering steadily, and recently has been down high-single digits. European demand, on the other hand, remains more depressed, but even there, we are seeing the beginning of a recovery. We believe this is driven by a number of factors, including greater media coverage, closer proximity to the accident, less familiarity with cruising and to some degree the compounding effect of a relatively weaker economy.","Our other international source markets, including Latin America and Asia Pacific are showing less impact from the incident. From a seasonal point of view, demand for spring and summer cruises has slowed the most, followed by close-in bookings. For the first quarter, we anticipate only a modest impact to yields because of the strength of our order book before the incident and the low cancellation activity.","Our brands for the most part have maintained pre-incident pricing levels for the spring and summer as they continue to evaluate the demand patterns and determine the best revenue management strategy. This is one of the reasons for the increase in uncertainty and our extra caution in providing forward guidance.","Interestingly, although the volume is relatively small, to date our new bookings for the fourth quarter and 2013 have not been affected. Again, the base is relatively small but we believe this is an indication that the incident will not have a long-term impact on our business.","Now I would like to talk to you about our forward guidance. We actually debated quite a bit about whether to even provide guidance given the high level of uncertainty, but in the end, we felt it was important to be as transparent as possible.","You will notice our guidance ranges are wider than usual but not as wide as all the possible outcomes. On Slide 4, you will see the guidance for the first quarter.","We expect yields to be up 5% to 7% on a constant currency basis and between 4% to 6% on an as-reported basis. As we noted in our press release, we have made some changes related to our international distribution system and shifted some deployment for strategic purposes that will have a positive impact on yields but a negative effect on costs. The impact of these changes is greater in the first quarter. In the case of net yields, the impact of these changes for the first quarter is approximately 300 basis points, so on a constant currency basis, we are looking for a like-for-like increase of 2% to 4%.","Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to increase 6% to 7% on a constant currency basis of which approximately 450 basis points is due to the changes I mentioned. Also driving the increase is a disproportionate amount of dry dock costs related to refurbishments in the quarter. Based on current prices, we have included $224 million of fuel expense for the quarter and we are 53% hedged.","Turning to Slide 5. We have laid out our preliminary thoughts for the full year. It was just a few weeks ago we were building our forecasts around net yield increases in the mid-single digits. With less than 3 weeks of new data to digest, providing a revenue forecast is clearly more art than science.","Some of the negative factors weighing in our consideration include the 20% decline in new bookings during the peak of WAVE season, tremendous awareness globally of the incident, apprehension among new cruisers and only meager signs of recovery so far for European source customers.","Some of the positive considerations include improving trends from North American source guests. Most consumers view this as an isolated incident. We've resumed our marketing activity, and there is still some time to recover booking volumes prior to the summer season.","Based on all this, we have set an initial target for net yields to increase between 1% and 5% on a constant currency basis and between flat to up 4% on an as-reported basis. Included in these figures is approximately 200 basis points from the changes in our international distribution and deployment initiatives.","As we mentioned in our press release, these distribution changes, along with deployment initiatives, will increase our net cruise costs by approximately 300 basis points. Absent these changes, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to increase between 1% and 2% on a constant currency basis and flat to up 3% on an as-reported basis. The 1% to 2% constant currency increase is driven by modest inflationary pressures and strategic investments such as information technology.","Based on today's fuel prices, we have included $889 million in fuel expense for the year and we are 55% hedged. Over the last 5 years, our brands have reduced fuel consumption by approximately 18% per APCD. And while our efficiency initiatives continue, our guidance for 2012 includes a slight increase due to deployment shifts. Our initial estimate for earnings per share for the year falls between $1.90 and $2.30.","To help you with your reconciliations, I will mention that at today's prices fuel expense is $0.57 per share higher than 2011 and current FX rates cause a negative impact of approximately $0.20 per share versus last year.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Adam for his comments. Adam?","Adam M. Goldstein","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone.","Although it seems like a long time ago now, we are nevertheless pleased to have finished 2011 with solid fourth quarter results. The Caribbean cruise market ended the year in good health, and a number of our programs around the world began their northern winter or southern summer seasons with momentum.","Consequently, bookings for the fourth quarter remained strong through December and our outlook for 2012 was promising entering the WAVE. Our enthusiasm was bolstered by the launch of our very well-received new marketing approach on January 9 featuring the line, \"The Sea is Calling. Answer it Royally.\"","As the others have noted, the situation today is considerably more uncertain than at the time of the year -- turn of the year, excuse me. While a few of our products are relatively unscathed by the downturn in bookings over the last 3 weeks, we have experienced softness in our main portfolio of Caribbean and European cruises. We believe that a recovery of booking momentum is highly likely. The question, of course, is the timing and strength of the prospective recovery.","As of Monday, January 30, we have resumed our full normal marketing effort in the United States inclusive of television advertising. In other countries, we are in the process of resumption. We continue to watch booking trend developments very closely. To this point, we have not taken any significant pricing actions. It is worth noting that relative to any other time of the year, we are currently taking a high volume of bookings and we are taking those bookings at higher prices than we were at the same time a year ago.","In the past, I have commented on the diversity of Royal Caribbean International's customer base. While it is too early to tell how much disruption there will be to our normal sourcing pattern, it is reassuring to know that we can draw in customers from around the world to fill many of our cruises.","For example, in recent years we have sourced about 75% of our guests on European cruises from outside of the United States. If North America should recover booking strength more rapidly than Europe, we have the possibility of marketing our European cruises more extensively in North America to raise the percentage of Americans and Canadians on European cruises. This is one benefit of being a global cruise vacation brand.","Dan?","Daniel J. Hanrahan","Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone.","The fourth quarter performed better than we had anticipated at the time of our last call due to strong close-in demand across the Caribbean product, which accounted for about 1\/3 of our capacity. Our Caribbean product sailing from South Florida performed particularly well, although we saw upside across nearly our entire portfolio.","We started out the year very strong and in fact had a record booking week for Celebrity during the first week of WAVE. We continued to see this close-in demand for our Caribbean product, which makes up the majority of our portfolio this winter. We have all 4 of our Solstice-class ships sailing in this market, along with our \u201cSolsticized\" Constellation and newly \"Solsticized\" Summit, which just came out of dry dock this past week. We're on pace to finish ahead of where we finished in Q1 2011 and '10. In addition, our non-Caribbean products, which represent about 20% of our capacity for this time period, are also performing well and ahead of prior years.","Further out, we are booked ahead of same time last year as well as 2010, although we are not immune to the slowdown that has already been referenced.  While we are still working in a period of uncertain demand, we have started to see improvement in bookings this week. It's still too early to say that we're out of the woods. However, the demand we have been experiencing, with the exception of some close-in tactical pricing that we would do normally, is coming in at the same prices that we were getting during the record week I mentioned.","We did commission research last week to look at how the consumer is reacting to the Concordia incident. Because of the coverage this has received, we looked more broadly than the last round of research I told you about: We looked at North America, the U.K., Europe, Australia and South America.","While it's clear that awareness is nearly universal, it's also clear that the consumer sees this as an isolated incident and generally feel confident that the cruise lines are taking the necessary steps to ensure the safety of their guests. Past cruisers, in particular, continue to rate cruising high on their list of vacation options. For past cruisers, there is little to no difference in their intent to cruise, from the research we did back in October. Potential first-time cruisers did show a decrease in interest. However, we have seen no increase in cruise rejectors. Our net takeaway of this research is that while bookings have slowed down, we do not think the slowdown will be long-lasting.","Before I close, I'd like to mention our solsticizing project continues. And as previously mentioned, we just completed the Summit revitalization last week. Summit, like the Infinity and Constellation before her, look magnificent and features many of the iconic venues and attributes that we showcase in all our Solstice-class ships.","Millennium will go into dry dock in April before she begins her Alaska season and is the last of the Millennium-class ships to be completed. Finally, the Reflection, our fifth and final Solstice-class ship, is under construction in Germany for an October delivery and, like her sister ships, will be truly spectacular.","In addition, I'm pleased to announce that we were recently named best cruise line at the annual Travel Weekly Globe Awards in London as well as the Best Luxury Cruise Company at the Travel Agents Association awards in Dublin, Ireland. These, along with all the other awards and accolades that we received during 2011, further cement our place as the leader in the premium cruise category not only in the U.S. but also in Europe.","Brian?","Brian J. Rice","Thanks, Dan. Nicole, We'd now like to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Nicole?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Felice (sic) [Felicia] Hendrix of Barclays Capital.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Thank you for all the color pre-incident and post-incident. It's very helpful to get a picture of what was going on then and now. So interestingly, you've, well, actually, Adam, you mentioned that you've resumed advertising. [indiscernible] Dan, has Celebrity resumed advertising?  Because I have a question related to that. And I guess, mainly, it is, the question is, do you have some kind of historical data points that could help us understand how much advertising typically will stimulate demand? Obviously, you've said that demand has started to improve. I would think that in correlation with resumed advertising, that would help. And I'm wondering if you would think that the WAVE season might now be extended, in other words, you might push that out a little bit farther since you've missed a few weeks.","Adam M. Goldstein","It's Adam. Effectively, what we've done is taken the advertising that we didn't do as scheduled in the second and third weeks of the WAVE and redistribute it along with the other planned advertising across about a 5-week period that began this week. So we would traditionally do, and we had planned this year to do the most volume of advertising in the first quarter because of the WAVE. And we will expend the anticipated amount of funds in the first quarter that we had originally planned to do, just distributed differently by week. So our historical experience, I guess you could say, under more normal circumstances is that, that level of marketing has clearly inspired WAVE bookings. And we are certainly hopeful that the recovery process on a week-by-week basis will allow us to create the -- recreate the momentum that we had before.","Daniel J. Hanrahan","Felicia, to answer your question: Yes, we are back fully in the market advertising. And I agree with what Adam said. I think that the advertising we're doing will definitely help stimulate demand, but I also think the fact that the incident is getting less coverage is also helping. In the research we did, we did see that people had not started to sway away from cruising in general but did see this as an isolated incident. So I think the improvement's a combination of things. Our marketing people would tell you it's the brilliance of their marketing, but I also think that it's, some of this is being driven by the incident starting to get into the past a little.","Richard D. Fain","Felicia, it's Richard, and your -- the second part of your question was interesting. I don't know that I've thought of it in precisely those terms before, but I think one of the things we've experienced in the past is when something causes an interruption in bookings, we never fully get those back. There's a onetime impact that I remember a number of years ago, when hurricane shut down our call centers, we really felt that the calls lost during that day were never fully recovered. So I think there'll be some of that, but I do think the idea that this could extend the WAVE season is a possibility as well.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then my second part of the question is actually for you, Richard and Brian. A lot of us are trying to figure out, and you probably are as well, what this incident could have on the industry as a whole in terms of costs, whether it's higher safety costs or higher insurance costs. Insurance premiums are going to go up in general or maybe for -- maybe not for you in particular, but how have you thought about your cost structure going forward, the costs that are beyond what's your, what's in your control?","Richard D. Fain","Yes, and you're right, we certainly have thought about it. I'm not sure that we have any great insight into the question. There's so much we don't know. And of course, we and everyone else will be looking at this closely.  Take them separately. With respect to actual new safety requirements et cetera, that's something I'm very much looking forward to. And I think you always learn something. You're well aware that our mantra is continuous improvement. But on the other hand, actually, I think, as an industry and as a company, our procedures and processes and safety expenses are done well. And I don't know that we're aware of anything that is, that we're aware of at this point, which would likely lead us in the direction that there's big costs coming there. We think, actually, it's more likely that you will see tweaking because our, I think our systems are pretty good, but that's the kind of thing we really need to keep an open mind about.  We don't know if there's other things to be learned. We'll certainly be looking for that. And a similar answer with respect to insurance, that's even involved in bigger part of what and [ph] I don't know how insurance companies work.  Obviously, I think many people say a significant incident like this affects every -- the whole insurance industry and that'll affect everybody not only in our industry but in other industries as well. But I think in the scheme of things we're still known and the insurance companies will look at us as a safe industry, so while I think there clearly will be something which, and by the way, we haven't made, we haven't tried to estimate it, I haven't tried to include it here, while there clearly will be something that we will learn from this and that we can do, we're not aware of anything at this point which would be dramatic.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I guess a couple of questions. Brian, I'm a little unclear about some of the changes that happened to the yields and the net cruise costs. And really, what changed in the distribution system? And why some of the deployments would affect that so much? So maybe some more clarity there and how that flows through the rest of the year. I know you saw the biggest impact from the first quarter. Could you give us an idea of the cadence of the impact to yields and net cruise costs in the remaining 3 quarters?","Brian J. Rice","Sharon, I'll give you an example. There were several changes that we've made in what we call distribution. Prior to this year, in one of our Latin American countries, the distribution was actually through a charter arrangement. And though we're staying partners with that distributor now, we'll actually not be chartering the ship and we'll be bringing all the revenues and all the costs into our structure. That also had a little bit of an impact on our fuel line, as well. It was a series of those sort of structures. It is more weighted toward the first quarter. I don't have the exact breakout in front of me, but I'm guessing more in the fourth quarter, probably the least amount in the third quarter, some in the second and some in the fourth is where that would be weighted. In terms of some of the other more structural things where we talked about deployment initiatives, Richard referenced the fact that the Voyager of the Seas is going to China. We also have a pretty significant increase in capacity in Australia this year. And those are really developmental markets for us, which is driving some of the higher fuel consumption. The cost of doing business in these markets is more expensive but -- and we've tried to break out the quantification on the yield side as well. We do get a benefit there.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then maybe a separate question. I, as well, appreciate the giving of guidance in such an uncertain time. I guess it's, I'm -- I guess I'm wondering how you're approaching the guidance as you look at this year. Are you taking kind of what you currently have on the books and creating some bandwidth around that? Are you taking the trends of the last 2 weeks and trend-lining that going forward? I just -- any kind of more granularity as we look at this guidance as to how you came up with it.","Brian J. Rice","Sharon, I don't think there's a single methodology that we overweighted on anything. We probably used everything you just mentioned and probably 20 other scenarios. I think our revenue management team, although we have only 3 weeks of data, we have a lot of experience with different elasticity scenarios and understanding when you have a certain amount of shortfall in demand, what sort of elasticity would be required to be able to make up for that. We did a lot of what-if scenarios going from slow recovery to more rapid recovery and tried to come up with -- as I mentioned in my opening comments, this is more of an art than a science. But I think we have the right folks giving us these projections. And we spent a lot of time over the last week or so -- one of the reasons for the call today was to try to get that extra knowledge. Again, we -- there is a lot of uncertainty but this is our best estimate from all the tea leaves we've been able to read.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Kevin Milato (sic) [Milota] of JPMorgan.","Kevin Milota - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The questions here. Just trying to get a sense for how deployments are changing for '12 given some of the distribution initiatives that you're going through, so if you'd give [ph] some clarity in terms of capacity in Europe versus what you're moving around and then also how that kind of plays through for North America, so for the Caribbean and Alaska cruises would be great.","Adam M. Goldstein","Kevin, it's Adam. Well, we've mentioned the major ones actually, I think, along the way. But certainly, the move of Voyager of the Seas to China and also Australia because of -- they have seasonal deployments in the 2 regions, which was on top of, already, a growth that we have as several brands, particularly Royal Caribbean and Celebrity in Australia, has moved more of our deployment portfolio to the other side of the world. And that's a bigger driver for us than anything that's going on this year in Europe, where actually we've reduced Eastern Mediterranean capacity, somewhat increased Northern European capacity. But Europe on the whole is not a meaningful change in our deployment, slightly down to be exact.","Kevin Milota - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then also, from kind of a revenue management standpoint and pricing standpoint, you made some comments that you haven't seen pricing fall meaningfully. Is it more that you're holding the line on price directly after the Concordia event? Or -- so you're holding out for potentially higher prices as you see booking activity improve?","Daniel J. Hanrahan","Kevin, it's Dan. Good question. If we were at any other time of the year, we would be really excited about the demand that we have. But because we're in the WAVE, it's down a little bit. So we have held out on the pricing. We have made some tactical pricing decisions in the first quarter that we would've made regardless of what had happened as we worked to fill in holes in our inventory, but at this point, we're getting good demand. We're just not getting WAVE demand. And this week, as you've heard everybody say, we're starting to see improvement, and the pricing has stayed the same.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Steve Wieczynski of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Brian, I was wondering if you could help us kind of think about how, for your guidance for '12, and I know this is a pretty tough question to answer, but how are you guys thinking about the booking window for the next couple of months just given that it sounds like Dan really hasn't -- Dan talked about not moving pricing too much. But how are you guys, just what I'm trying to figure out is how -- what are you guys thinking the booking window here, going forward?","Brian J. Rice","I think it's kind of a daily adjustment. I think it is important to recognize that, as needed, we are taking pricing action. Our initial read on this was that there was a contraction of the booking window. Clearly, for summer sailings, there's been less of an urgency to make the bookings. One of the reasons WAVE season is usually what it is, is you have a lot of people looking to escape the winter, you have people who are now looking at a new calendar and trying to plan their vacations for the year and getting ahead of their summer vacation planning. Plus, you have a lot of people who are already beginning to plan next holiday season. And the bookings that have held up the best are the further-out bookings, which is where we think we have evidence of the fact that this should be somewhat limited in its duration of impact. But we are, to some degree, betting on that more contracted window, but our revenue management team will be watching this depending on the particular market and product and brand that we're looking at and they are prepared to take the necessary actions in the near term to maximize the revenue within a given period.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then second question. You gave a lot of color around your outlook kind of pre the incident, but can you just kind of help us think about how you were thinking about the European market kind of going through '12 in terms of what you guys were expecting out of yields in that market?","Brian J. Rice","Yes. I -- the Baltic did exceptionally well last year and has been off to a very good start, going forward. I think in our projections we were probably looking roughly to get about half of the impact of the Arab Spring back in the Eastern Med. We do have, as Adam alluded to, I think the number is about 15%, 16% less capacity in the Eastern Med in '12 than we had in '11, and obviously, that's helping us. And the tensions are not quite as escalated as they were a year ago. So we -- I think our internal projections were to, at that time, to get about half of it back.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have a question. I think I probably know what the answer to this is, but it would be helpful to hear you talk about. Does the impact you're seeing on bookings from the Concordia, does that have any impact on your thinking about the option -- you have an option for a second Sunshine-class ship that expires later this month, and I wondered if you could just talk about how that affects your thinking.","Richard D. Fain","Thanks, Robin. Obviously, something like this affects all of our thinking on almost any topic, especially in the immediate aftermath. And as you know, we won't specifically comment on what we're about to do. But I think I'm actually glad you asked it in retrospect. At first, I dreaded it, but I think I'm glad you asked it because I think it really helps emphasize a point, which is we just don't think this is going to have a long-lasting impact. It's obviously having a near-term impact and that's obviously painful, and it obviously has an emotional impact and that's painful too. But I think, as a practical matter, we think that people understand that cruising is safe and so we don't think in the long term this will have any huge impact on cruising. And so I think it is unlikely to play a significant factor in the decision about exercising the option. The -- that decision is a long-term decision, and I think the long-term outlook is not materially different.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of pieces, Adam and Dan. Can you comment what you're seeing, given the positioning of your brands as far as booking volume between the brands?  Are you holding up better with the Royal Caribbean brand, the Celebrity brand? And then also with the recovery that you're seeing and I guess as a part of that question also, the on-board spending that you're seeing by brand post the event? So that's question number one, and then I'll circle back for number two in a second here.","Adam M. Goldstein","Tim, it's Adam. Obviously, we are normally not making distinctions between brand performance on these calls. Under the circumstances, I will say that, as Brian mentioned and possibly Richard, too, in their original comment, one of the trends that has emerged over last few weeks is, relatively speaking, the reticence of potential first-time cruisers to come into the category. And as you know, one of the responsibilities of Royal Caribbean International for the company and for the industry is to attract first-timers into the category. So of our brands, we would naturally feel the most impact in the aftermath of a tragedy like this. And I'll turn it over to Dan for his comments.","Daniel J. Hanrahan","Tim, my comments are similar to Adam's. We have a very strong Captain's Club program that we've shifted a lot of our marketing that direction and I think that's been helping us. And this is a little bit anecdotal, but I'll give you an interesting fact: We've worked hard on board our ships to sign up people for their next cruise. And in January, we saw no difference pre or post the incident. And in fact, January was a record month for us in terms of sign-ups. And I think it's important to note that Azamara is also doing well right now. We've seen good things there. And all our brands have strong loyalty programs, so I think that we have the ability to pull from a very loyal base and it's a big base.","Adam M. Goldstein","Tim, if I can come back for a minute to your question on shipboard revenue. I think I mentioned on the last call that our brands were engaged in a variety of activities and initiatives to boost on-board revenue going forward. And there's, of course, extremely little data that has occurred in 2012, but to the extent that we've seen it, it appears that these initiatives are beginning to bear fruit, and we have not seen any notable decline or even any decline in shipboard revenue in the last few weeks.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question would relate to the yield guidance contrasted to the EPS guidance. And Brian, I know there's a lot of other things you talked about, the spending initiatives and the higher fuel and the FX impact, but given the 400-basis-point range in net yields, and I know that you guys are -- it's really struggling to -- and that's a wide understandable range, but that, with the roughly 26% share impact per yield point, and yet that would imply almost, from that alone, about a $1 range in an EPS, can you kind of walk us from that to the range that you have of $0.40?","Brian J. Rice","Yes, Tim, I think we -- a $0.40 range for us on EPS is a very wide range. And I think it's safe. Again, we're not -- there is a lot more volatility here than we've seen in some time. And I think there are possibilities outside of both the yield range and the EPS range, but we try to give a range. I think it is unlikely that you would get the best of both worlds or the worst of both worlds. And so what we've tried to do is find a combination in which we felt we were in a reasonably comfortable range. We were focused more around the midpoints and the deviation from those midpoints when we're trying to give the EPS range.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Steve Kent of Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, when you think about how you'll go back on marketing and back on TV, would you consider keeping sort of your list price the same but maybe using more on-board promotions as an incentive to maybe getting people on? So sort of to induce some travel but maybe not have as much of an impact? And then secondarily, just as I think about the first quarter, my recollection is you were guiding 5% to 7% net yield growth. And how much of that is already locked in? And if I then do the math for the balance of the year, you're suggesting a much more dramatic slowdown for the rest of the year. Am I getting that right to get to that number that you're forecasting of 1% to 5%?","Brian J. Rice","Steve, just quickly, I'll take the second part of the question. I think you're right. We, ordinarily, I think we would have looked for more of the summer to be driving some of the improvements given the recovery within the Mediterranean and what we were seeing in our advance bookings. I think we are looking at the biggest haircut, as a result of the incident, coming in Q2 and Q3, at this point in time. And I'll let Adam talk about the advertising.","Adam M. Goldstein","Steve, well, one of the benefits of the sophistication of our revenue management approach is we have a whole arsenal of tools that we're using from time to time throughout the year for lots of purposes, not just in the aftermath of something very significant. And clearly, on-board credits is one of the main type of tools that we can engage when we need to be active promotionally. So we are looking across countries, products, varying cruise lengths, and we will try to apply the promotional techniques that make the most sense. If there is a market that has a higher percentage of air fee business, for example, then we can work around the flight in terms of promotional activity. If it's more of a cruise-only market, it might be on-board credits, as you mentioned. So we have a lot of opportunities and we're watching the trends emerge on a day-by-day basis, and then we'll start to apply whatever we need to apply to meet our expectations.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And how much is, Brian, how much is booked for the first quarter already? How much is essentially locked in?","Brian J. Rice","It's a very high percentage. Obviously, January is behind us at this point in time. I think most of the volatility at this point would be some of the March sailings. And then as, I believe, in Tim's question, it -- a lot would come down to the on-board revenue spending. But I think we're pretty comfortable within our range at this point in time. I think Dan wanted to follow up on Adam's comments, as well.","Daniel J. Hanrahan","Steve, I think your point's a good one. We are trying to make sure that we can keep our prices up. We launched a program this week where we did half deposits. And so instead of the full deposits, we did half deposits, and we think we've gotten some pretty good traction off that. We did an air promotion in the U.K. this week and we think we've gotten some real good traction off of that. So we're going to use the whole toolkit here and the objective is to keep that price where it -- where we think it should be. Good question.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian of Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","2 questions.  First one is, I know there's nothing exactly like this, but typically, what's the length of the impact to bookings and net yield from previous industry incidents that maybe have gotten negative media coverage? And then the second part of that is, would you expect a bounce-back the following year from maybe first-time cruisers that are holding off this year so maybe you'll have some pent-up demand into 2013?","Richard D. Fain","I think with respect to the first part of the question, we would have to say that this is just so unusual a situation that we really can't do much in terms of drawing comparisons. We think that the better job that we and our industry organizations and our travel agents do in communicating the facts about cruise ship safety will be an important element of reassuring the public. I -- our sense is, and we are already seeing it in the bookings, that, and as Dan pointed out, we saw it in some of the research that we've done, that the public really does get it. They really do understand that it is a safe and secure industry notwithstanding the very sensational headlines at the moment. But I think they separate the two. And even in a very safe environment, there's no, as we've said elsewhere, there's no such thing as perfect safety, just perfect dedication to safety. And I think our industry has that and will continue to emphasize that. So I think it's a question of how well we get that message out, and we're working to do that. I'm just not sure we can make comparisons to other industries. And with respect to the people and how this impacts next year, I think we will next year and in future periods, I think we -- I made the point earlier that some of this isn't so much convincing people. It's just, if people didn't take an action, they didn't book a cruise in this week, some of that just simply is never recovered, but it has no ongoing impact so I think there's sort of an automatic benefit next year. And we had an extraordinary loss of bookings for a few weeks in January, and just isolated on those bookings, that will give us a bump in the beginning of next year.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Assia Georgieva of Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","Just one question. Assuming that the booking volumes from the last, let's say, 3 to 5 days remain constant, how long would you be willing to hold price? And if we go back to the H1N1 outbreak in Mexico in, back in April of 2009, when I think both you and Carnival actually held price for about a month, is this something you would be willing to do given it's WAVE season?","Daniel J. Hanrahan","Assia, it's Dan. That's a good crystal ball question, I think. We have seen some improvement that's encouraging this week. And each week has gotten better. I think Brian, when Brian mentioned earlier and I had mentioned in my opening comments that we've done close-in tactical pricing to fill what we need to fill so to make sure that we don't just totally miss revenue, we'll continue to do that. We've had a lot of discussion around that topic. I mean, how long do we wait? I had a staff meeting yesterday. It was the #1 topic. At this point, we're holding fast. I think we've done some very good things with our marketing and with the promotions that we have in place and we've seen some traction. So for the time being, we're going to hold our ground. How long that'll last will depend upon what kind of results we get over time.","Assia Georgieva","And Dan, even though it's WAVE, given current booking volumes, you can hold price for quite a bit...","Daniel J. Hanrahan","Well, I think, if you look at our guidance, that would be -- that gives you an indication of what the volatility is and how wide the spread is. But yes, we'd like to hold price, but if we have to take pricing action to fill ships, we'll definitely do it.","Assia Georgieva","All right, well [ph] we'll wait, and hopefully, we won't have to see that again. This kind of relates to Tim Conder's question, that the spread in yields is a little bit wider than one would expect to drop down to the EPS line.","Brian J. Rice","Yes, Assia, it is. And we realize, if you take the high end of yields and the low end of cost and the low end of yield and the high end of cost, you're going to have a much greater spread. I think our range on costs are pretty tight that we've provided and is -- we've given you a lot of transparency as to what's driving that. This really is about the yields. But we've put forth our best effort here to try to give you a range that we think we can manage to, but again, there's still tremendous uncertainty out there.","Operator","The final question is from the line of Jamie Rollo of Morgan Stanley.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First on the yield guidance pre and post the incident. You've reduced your expectations by about 200 basis points at the midpoint. I'm just wondering, given your fairly confident comments about the recovery in bookings recently, plus the fact you've sold, I guess, over the half of the year, is that sort of -- it seems quite a large number, that's all, given what you've seen most recently. And also on the yield guidance, on that sort of change versus, before the incident, you haven't changed your pricing, as you say. You might let that happen, but would you consider letting occupancy sort of slip for a bit and maybe try and hold prices rather than sort of price to fill?","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, Jamie. I think you're right, the midpoint's around 200. I think the spread here is anywhere from a little impact to maybe as much as 300 or 400 basis points. Again, if we've conveyed a sense of confidence around the most, the last few days and extrapolating that to the fact that the damage is done and we're away from this, I want to be very clear: We believe there's still a tremendous amount of uncertainty here. We're giving you our best estimates based on 3 weeks of data. I think we are encouraged by the last several days, but I think, as Richard said, it's dangerous to extrapolate that. This is not a clear pattern at this point in time, but we've tried to be as transparent as possible. I think I want to be careful here, I think it's dangerous for us to be talking too much about our pricing strategy in a public forum. I think our revenue management team will be looking at this on an individual sailing basis, making judgment calls about how to best optimize our revenue on any given sailing and in total. Our strategies vary widely by brand and they vary by market. And based on the conditions, there will be occasions where we may sacrifice load factor for price and there will be other times where volume will be more important to us. And it is something that each brand has its own strategy. And we have a lot of product managers within the individual brands that -- they actually know their markets best, so it's not kind of a \"one size fits all\" revenue management practice.","Richard D. Fain","And Jamie, if I could just emphasize one point that Brian made. I think we've actually gotten rather spoiled in our industry that we are able to predict our yields as accurately as we have. We really -- this is a situation that we don't feel that we have -- that our experience necessarily gives us as good an indication as we would like. And it really doesn't prepare us for this, so I actually would have said, if anything, I think you should take it that there is more risk than usual that we'll go outside the ranges rather than less risk. We're really very uncertain, looking forward. We hope we haven't conveyed more knowledge than we have. We've tried to be open, we've tried to -- I thought Brian summarized it very well by saying, \"Here's all the pluses and here's all the minuses,\" but I don't think anybody yet knows how to balance those, and so we're trying to give the best information we can. But I think, in fairness to you, we need to say that the uncertainty is a big part of what we, that's ironic, that the uncertainty is a big part of what we know, and I would just emphasize that, looking forward.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, that's very clear. If I could have one quick follow-up. You mentioned the survey of potential cruisers and that the reduction in tension amongst the -- amongst those who are new to cruising. Could you just quantify what that change in tension was and also how important new cruisers are to you as a group?","Daniel J. Hanrahan","Jamie, it's Dan. New cruisers are important to us as a group, so it's a good part of our business. Without -- because -- yes, it's 1\/3 of our business. I'm being coached a little bit here. The survey, I want to point out, it's a point in time, so I want to be careful to not go overboard because what we did is we looked at country-by-country-by-country.  And we saw different things in country. We saw that people that have cruised before, their interest has remained high. We saw that there was an increase, when we asked the question, \"Are you more or less interested in going on a cruise?\" we saw that there was an increase in less interested people that hadn't ever cruised before. They weren't -- they were cruise considerers.  They weren't cruise rejectors, but they had an increase. And without getting into specifics on any individual market, it did increase for potential first-timers.","Brian J. Rice","Okay. All right, thanks, Jamie. And thank you for everyone for joining us today. As usual, Ian will be available throughout the day for any follow-ups you may have. And again, thank you for joining us, and we wish everyone a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's Royal Caribbean Cruises Limited Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

My name is James, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I'd now like to introduce Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jason Liberty. Mr. Liberty, the floor is yours.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carola Mengolini, our Vice President of Investor Relations. During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I'd like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Please note that we do not undertake to update the information in our filings as circumstances change. ","Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP historical items can be found on our website. Unless we state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency-adjusted basis.","Richard will begin with some color on last year and this year. Then I will go through a bit more detail on the figures followed by a Q&A session. Richard?","Richard Fain","Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to have the opportunity to share more about our 2018 results and our outlook for the coming year. By any measure, 2018 was an unusually busy and successful year. Our teams achieved record financial results, while introducing four new vessels, acquiring a controlling interest in Silversea's cruises, opening two stunning cruise terminals and implementing Excalibur on about half of our fleet. On the financial front, the simple point is that strong fundamentals are driving strong results.","In 2018, we achieved net income of $1.9 billion, with earnings per share growth of 18%. Moreover, our EPS growth would have approached 25% had foreign exchange and fuel rates remained neutral during the year. This outcome should encourage those who watch on the sidelines concerned about weather, politics, trade wars, supplies, whatever. These strong fundamentals should not be a surprise as we have been very vocal about 2 important and positive consumer trends. First, the trend in favor of experiences over material possessions; and second, the favorable demographic shifts. We've been talking for a long time about how people have shifted their focus from buying TVs, cars, et cetera to buying memories or experiences. And that shift has become so powerful that I think it's now obvious to everybody.","At the same time, the demographic makeup of our population keeps shifting in our direction. These two trends have become increasingly powerful, and our company and our brands are well positioned to benefit from these trends. Obviously, no trend is perfectly linear and no trajectory goes forever without interruption, but our direction and our overall progress appears inexorable.","Now, our strong position rests on several pillars. The first is our product, where we have stunning hardware that appeals to the market, overindexes on guest satisfaction and delivers superior profit. The second pillar is technology. As you all know, we are seriously invested in data analytics and in digitizing the guest and crew experience. We believe that the opportunity for growth is strong, but we also believe that the speed with which we need to adapt and evolve continues to accelerate.","Several years ago, as I believe all of you know, when we initiated our Double-Double Program, we emphasized that our objective was not just to improve 2017 profitability. We emphasized then that 2017 was a steppingstone. We wanted to build a base and to solidify a culture that would serve as a springboard going forward. I believe our 2018 results demonstrate unambiguously that our objective was realistic. As we now work to execute on our 20\/20 Vision program, I'm looking forward to achieving the same kind of positive momentum. These 2 programs also demonstrate the importance of planting seeds. Ours is a long-term business, and we deem to invest for the future, whether that is new ships, new digital systems or new private destinations. We are reaping the benefits of past investments today, and we will reap the benefits of current investments tomorrow.","Looking forward, we are starting 2019 with some very good cards. Among them is the first full year of operation from Symphony of the Seas, Azamara Pursuit, Celebrity Edge and New Mein Schiff 1 as well as the delivery in 2019 of Celebrity Flora and Spectrum of the Seas. All of these new vessels carry significant premiums and help position 2019 for success. Happily, the record-breaking start to WAVE validates our confidence. And with WAVE off to a wonderful start, our already good book position continues to strengthen. Bookings have been at higher levels than last year, and in fact, we received more bookings during the first week of WAVE than we have in any other week in our history, except for the second week in WAVE, which was even better.","So we are very happy about how the year is shaping up. Despite all the noise in the economy and the volatility of the stock market, we have been impressed with consistent strength in demand from our markets. Actually, in preparing for this morning's call, I looked at how good our guidance has been in the past. As you can see in Slide 2, during the past 5 years, we have consistently delivered or overdelivered on both yield and adjusted EPS guidance. I doubt that many other companies or industries have such a remarkable track record. I'm always impressed by how accurate our revenue management team has been. Of course, the future is always uncertain, but they have demonstrated an impressive ability in the past. And as you also well know, in past years, we have experienced all types of fears and challenges from the Zika virus and global tourism in 2015, to questions about China supply in 2016, weather threats and capacity in 2017, global macro concerns in 2018, et cetera.","Yet during all these periods, we were able to generate record revenue, record operating income and record earnings per share. Amongst the exciting things ahead of us this year, we are getting ready for the deliveries of Celebrity Flora and Spectrum of the Seas and Royal Caribbean International's Perfect Day project, which comes on stream in May. The island development will really shake up the short-term cruise market, and I am confident that our guests will love it. ","Now before I turn the call back to Jason, I would like to again express my admiration and my thanks for the amazing people at Royal Caribbean, whose passion and skills enable us to grow and prosper. With that, I turn it back to Jason.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Richard. I'll begin by taking you through our results for the fourth quarter of 2018. These results are summarized on Slide 3. For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $1.53 per share, beating the midpoint of our guidance by $0.06. Better-than-expected revenue and cost performance from our brands combined with better performance from our joint ventures more than offset a $0.04 headwind from currency and fuel.","Net revenue yields are up 6.8% for the quarter, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. On the cost side, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, per APCD were up 5.1%, better than guidance driven mainly by timing. I will now discuss our full year results, which we have summarized on Slide 4. By all accounts, 2018 was another year of very strong performance. We generated approximately $1.9 billion in adjusted net income, resulting in an earnings per share of $8.86. This was $0.06 higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance and was up 17.5% year-over-year. This result also beat the midpoint of the January guidance by $0.21, despite the unfavorable impact from currency and fuel, which negatively affected earnings by approximately $123 million or $0.58 per share.","Our leading brands supported this strong financial performance with net promoter scores at all-time highs and record employee engagement metrics. To summarize the revenue performance for the year, yields were up by 4.4%. Strong demand from our core products from our key markets, better onboard experiential spend and the addition of Silversea drove the year-over-year outperformance. On the cost side, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, were up 4.1%. The main drivers behind the year-over-year increase were more drydock days, the lapping of hardware changes, investments in technology and the consolidation of Silversea's operations.","Now I'll update you on what we are seeing in the demand environment. Over the past three months, bookings have been higher than same time last year, the positive variance growing further as we entered the all-important WAVE season. In fact, 2 out of the past 3 weeks have been record booking weeks for the company. These strong booking trends have further strengthened our overall book position, and 2019 is at a record high in both rate and volume. We've been particularly pleased with the trends we are seeing in North America. While the bookings from North American guests have been strong for sailings on both sides of the Atlantic, our Caribbean sailings are in particularly strong book position with rate and volume up in all 4 quarters. We have superior hardware in the Caribbean throughout the year, and the addition of Perfect Day to our portfolio has further improved our offering.","The summer Europe season is also shaping up well with Celebrity Edge garnering significant price premiums in the Mediterranean, and the rest of the fleet is also in a good book position. Uncertainty surrounding Brexit has created some inconsistencies in demand from the U.K., however, our global footprint means that booking strength from North America and other key markets is more than compensating.","Our Asia Pacific sailings have also been trending well. China continues to be an important market for us, and we saw significant yield growth for the product throughout 2018. 2019 China sailings are booked ahead of same time last year. Over 0.5 million Chinese guests sail with us each year, mostly on sailings from China. However, we are seeing a significant growth in outbound travel with 75% more Chinese guests on a non-China itinerary in 2019 when compared to just 3 years ago. Cruises in Europe and Alaska have seen the number of Chinese guests more than double.","Now I'll give you a brief overview of our capacity and deployment changes for 2019. Our overall capacity will increase 8.6% year-over-year with the addition of Silversea contributing just over 2% of the growth and the rest driven by our stunning new ships. The bulk of our capacity growth will occur in the Caribbean with Symphony of the Seas sailing year around from Miami and a full year of sailings on two modernized ships, Mariner of the Seas and Navigator of the Seas.","In total, just over half of our capacity will be in the Caribbean. While our European capacity will be similar to 2018, we have made a few changes to our deployment in the region. Most notable is the addition of Celebrity Edge, which will be sailing 7- to 11-night Mediterranean itineraries from both Barcelona and Rome. Europe will account for 16% of our capacity this year.","The Asia Pacific region will account for 15% of our 2019 capacity with sailings in China, Australia and Southeast Asia. China remains a core region for the Royal Caribbean brand with Spectrum of the Seas arriving to join her sister ship Quantum of the Seas in early June. Alaska only accounts for 5% of our full year capacity, but is a key high-yielding product for us in the summer. This year, we are improving our hardware in the region with larger, newer ships for Royal Caribbean, Celebrity and Silversea along with Azamara's first-ever Alaska season.","With 2018 now in the rearview mirror, we have entered what is arguably the busiest and most exciting year in our history. Firstly, 2019 will be our first full year with Silversea. Secondly, we will be welcoming Spectrum of the Seas in the spring and Celebrity Flora in the summer, while also enjoying the first full year of sailings for Celebrity Edge, Symphony of the Seas and Azamara Pursuit.","And finally, we have two exciting land-based initiatives coming to fruition. We are now welcoming guests at our own new terminal here at Port of Miami. And in May of 2019, we will launch Perfect Day at CocoCay, where our guests will experience stunning amenities like the tallest waterslide in North America. As I mentioned in October, the additions of Silversea, the terminal in Miami and Perfect Day each increased both our cost and yield metrics in 2019. To provide transparency, I'll share our year-over-year yield and cost guidance both including and excluding these items. These items combined with the timing of new ship deliveries mean that there are a lot of contributing factors to the cadence of our yield and capacity changes throughout the year.","In some years, we see a lot of variability in yield growth from one quarter to the next, whereas, in 2019, we expect more moderate differences. The majority of our capacity growth will occur in the first half of the year, which is the period where we have the greatest visibility. This position and the level of visibility we have further bolsters our confidence in our yield guidance.","Taking all this into account, if you turn to Slide 5, you will see our guidance for 2019. Our yield outlook for 2019 is quite encouraging. We expect net revenue yields to grow 6.5% to 8.5% for the full year, which makes 2019 our 10th consecutive year of yield growth. This metric includes approximately 350 basis points from the operation of Silversea, the cruise terminal in Miami and the Perfect Day development. When excluding these important elements, the underlying yield improvement is driven by strong demand for our core products, new hardware and continued growth from onboard revenue areas.","Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 8.5% to 9% for the full year. Cost control continues to be a strong focus of ours. However, this metric includes 650 basis points from the operation of Silversea, the cruise terminal in Miami and the Perfect Day development. As we have shared with you before, we strongly believe that these projects accelerate our competitive differentiation and advantage as well as deliver strong returns.","Our depreciation for the year is growing faster in 2019 than in previous periods. As a reminder, our investments in technology projects like Excalibur are becoming a larger mix of our capital program and generally have a shorter useful life than our typical capital investments.","Moreover, the addition of Silversea is also contributing to the elevated growth rate. As previously discussed, being in the luxury and expedition segment, Silversea's depreciation per berth is significantly higher than our corporate average. We have included $690 million of fuel expense for the year, and we are 58% hedged. Based on current fuel prices, currency exchange and interest rates, we expect another record-breaking year with earnings per share between $9.75 and $10 per share and therefore another year of double-digit EPS growth.","Now I'd like to walk you through our first quarter guidance on Slide 6. Net revenue yields are expected to be up in the range of 7.5% to 8%. This metric includes approximately 375 basis points from the operation of Silversea and the cruise terminal in Miami. As it relates to the core operation, first quarter yield will benefit from the addition of Celebrity Edge, Symphony of the Seas in the Caribbean and improvements in yields for core products.","Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up approximately 10% for the quarter. This metric includes approximately 800 basis points from the operations of Silversea, the cruise terminal in Miami and the start of operations of Perfect Day at CocoCay. As it relates to the core operation, the year-over-year increase is mainly driven by the timing and scope of drydocks, related to our ship modernization programs and some shifts in costs from the previous quarter. Taking all of this into account, we expect adjusted earnings to be approximately $1.10 per share. ","With that, I ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Robin Farley from UBS.","Robin Farley","Obviously, with these results, you're not giving us a lot to worry about, but maybe I could ask you two things in terms of your booking outlook. One is just, with the increase in supply in Alaska and the market in general, I mean, is it fair to say with the kind of yield guidance you're giving, I assume you're seeing increases in yield in all of your major markets? And then I was also going to ask you about other European sourcing. You mentioned that there's a little bit of inconsistent demand in the U.K. I wonder if you have comment on other Europe and even just sort of quantifying. I think U.K. is your biggest European market and don't actually have that much exposure to other Europe, but any comments there?","Michael Bayley","It's Michael. Alaska is and has always been a great market for us. It's a high-yielding market, and it performed exceptionally well last year, and it's looking good for this year as well. So we are quite pleased with how Alaska is shaping up. With European sourcing, I think Jason had mentioned earlier that we have the benefit of really a significant global international structure and that really does allow us to balance any geopolitical issues in any one particular market. So I think we're kind of aware that there would be some volatility in the U.K. market with Brexit, and we planned accordingly, and we are hoping we'll move through it quite quickly, but our sourcing has been good out of all of the other international markets. And including the North American market as well by the way, which has been particularly strong.","Robin Farley","So actually outside of the U.K., there is nothing you'd call out in terms of softness in demand?","Michael Bayley","No. I think it's a U.K. story. I was there last week and watched the news pretty much every night, and there is a huge debate raging. Nobody knows what's going to happen. There is quite a lot of sentiment, and I think that's almost inevitable. So I guess, when March passes, hopefully we'll all be in a better position and know what's going to happen.","Jason Liberty","And Robin, just to add, just one comment on the U.K. side. I'd mentioned that we've seen volatility. So we have seen volatility, but all in all, it's also been still a very good and strong market for us and the bookings have come in quite well. There's just been more volatility in that market around the new cycle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel.","Steven Wieczynski","I guess, the first question is around your guidance. And Jason, you've always kind of talked about that 2% to 4% core yield growth as being a pretty good barometer for the business. But obviously, if we strip out Silversea and all the other stuff you guys have this year going on, you're essentially guiding to us 3% to 5% kind of core yield. So I guess, the question is, what gives you so much confidence in that range? And as we move forward, is that 2% to 4% range still the right way to think about the business? And I guess, another way to ask this is, if we stripped out your new hardware, whether it's Edge or Spectrum, would your like-for-like hardware still be trending better than what you would have thought maybe six months ago, if that makes sense?","Jason Liberty","Sure. Well, firstly, thank you for the nice comment on the '18 results. We're obviously quite happy about it. So one, just talking a little bit about our guide -- first in terms of our philosophy on guidance, nothing has changed here. And again, I would really point to the chart that Richard was commenting on that we put up on the slide in terms of our consistency to forecast our yield and our earnings. But there's lots been going that bring us confidence into that number. So one, this hasn't happened overnight. We've been building this book of business for quite a long period of time. As I commented on, we are in a very strong book position on both a rate and volume basis, and that continues on for several quarters here into the future. The other thing which I'll comment on is that most of our capacity growth for the year is really in the first half of the year. And so that is where we have the greatest visibility in both how we're booking and the amount we have on our books, which further bolsters our confidence into our outlook for the year. That yield growth is not just coming from new hardware. A portion of it is coming from new hardware, but really what's balancing out that, as you commented, 3% to 5% or approximately 4% is really being driven by the improvement in the like-for-like business.","So I think when you kind of combine all that together, there is a lot that makes us feel very confident for the year based off of everything that we know today. As it relates to the 2% and 4%, I think really it's -- that's kind of how we've trended over the past several years, which is why that range has kind of been out there. The past couple of years, we've obviously been on the higher end of that range going forward. But we think that moderate yield growth, good cost control and being thoughtful in our investments improve our earnings per share at a very healthy rate and also improves our return on invested capital.","Steven Wieczynski","Okay. That's great color. And then second question would be on the cost side. And again, if we strip out Silversea, CocoCay, all that stuff, you guys are forecasting kind of that core cost to be up 2% to 3%, which is probably a little bit higher, I think, than what some folks might have expected. And I guess, some of that bump there is kind of more drydock related and probably some technology as well. But I guess, the question is, without that drydock impact and without the technology component, do you still see the business being able to keep that cost pressure relatively low?","Jason Liberty","Yes. So one, if you back out Silversea, the Port of Miami and CocoCay, our costs are approximately 2%. Certainly there are impacts from having more drydock days in 2019 than we have in 2018, but certainly investments in things like technology, data analytics, et cetera, are weighing more onto our costs, and that's because a lot of these investments or costs are not things that are being capitalized based off of how software providers are selling now into the market. But we do believe and we are very much committed to making sure that we are effectively managing our costs and trying to realize the scale that comes with the growth of our fleet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis from Instinet.","Harry Curtis","Jason, you referenced the revenue uplift from Excalibur on 50% of your fleet. Can you give us more detail on the extent of that revenue uplift? And can you share with us any -- are you -- do you have any data on kind of the return that you're getting on the investment that you have been making?","Jason Liberty","Well, I think I was talking about specifically on Excalibur, was just the additional cost that it brings. Certainly, as we're rolling Excalibur out, what we're definitely seeing that's very tangible is our net promoter scores, our guest satisfaction is rising quickly as we are very focused in delivering on, taking friction out of the guest experience. That, we believe, is what is leading to higher yields for us, and you'll also see coming online ways in which we think it will be much easier for the customer to be doing business with us, making it easier to buy things from us, especially when they are on the ship, pre-cruise as well as when they're on the ship, that we think is going to deliver a very solid return for Excalibur.","Harry Curtis","Just a follow up on that. Is there a noticeable difference in the revenue uplift from the vessels that had Excalibur versus those that don't in the fourth quarter?","Jason Liberty","We definitely -- well, it's not just the fourth quarter. We have been seeing -- there is a strong relationship to where guest satisfaction scores go up and people pay more both for their ticket as well as onboard. Certainly ships that we put Excalibur on, we are seeing those benefits.","Richard Fain","Harry, if I could just amplify on that. One of the things is, a lot of these initiatives, they're hard to single out. We are a brand, and all of these things add to the brand. Obviously, Excalibur is easier to put on the newer ships, for example, which would otherwise do better anyhow. And so I'm not sure that we are very good at isolating out this initiative on food or this initiative on entertainment or this initiative on technology has such an impact. We're looking at them all in a holistic way, and we think them taking together is what drives improved guest satisfaction, word of mouth, and essentially all of those things are part of a brand. But a brand is an amorphous construct, and it's a little difficult to isolate out on a specific one and say this drove X.","Harry Curtis","And while I've got you, I noticed that -- not noticed, but in the fourth quarter, you purchased more stock in Royal Caribbean. It would appear that the company didn't, and is that just a reflection of the impact of the Silversea acquisition on the balance sheet that you're more focused on your leverage ratio for the time being?","Richard Fain","Jason?","Jason Liberty","Yes. So I'll let Richard comment on his stock purchase, if he would like. But Harry, that's exactly right. I mean, as we had commented before on the last call that the acquisition of Silversea did stress our credit metrics. We are focused on being an investment-grade credit. We are an investment-grade credit, and there are certain metrics, especially debt to EBITDA, that we focus on looking to maintain, which when you make an investment like Silversea can weigh on that a little bit, but as we burn off on some of that debt and our EBITDA gets better here in the short run, there certainly is opportunity to maintain that leverage and provide opportunity in an opportunistic way to buy back shares.","Harry Curtis","Probably more in the second half?","Jason Liberty","There is definitely more headroom in the second half of the year than there is in the first half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","So can you just help me understand the 350 basis point impact that [Technical Difficulty] for 2019 in terms of Silversea, the terminal and the water park? How would you break that out between the 3 components? And I guess, I'm a little bit surprised that the contribution isn't higher for one because I think Silversea contributed about 350 basis points by itself to the fourth quarter with only 2 of the 3 months in the quarter. I know there is some seasonality to it, but can you just help me understand the thought there a little bit better?","Jason Liberty","So first, just on the seasonality side, what we brought into the fourth quarter were 2 of the probably 4 most highest yielding months for Silversea, especially with August being in that consideration. So that's why it's a little bit more elevated in terms of the impact on the fourth quarter versus the 350 for the full year. I won't sparse out exactly what each one of these things as it relates to our Port of Miami and Perfect Day and Silversea is. Obviously, the vast majority of it is Silversea. What I would say is that the Port of Miami has come online, is doing exceptionally well, the volumes there are building as we will be adding more and more ships to that terminal over time. And obviously, we talked about CocoCay coming online -- or Perfect Day CocoCay, I want to make sure we get the marketing right, coming online in May, and that will ramp up not just in terms of the amenities that we will be offering, but also the number of ships and the volumes of guests that we bring there will be ramping up over time as well.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. And Jason, I'm going to be really shortsighted here for a second, and I know everything sounds really positive, but I think just given some of the macro concerns, it's relevant. You talked about how 2 of the last 3 weeks were record booking weeks, which, I think, implies that the last most recent week may have decelerated some. Is that just normally a lighter week in WAVE? Or anything else that you'd call out or point to there?","Jason Liberty","Actually, all three weeks have been very well, have done exceptionally well. It just happens that 2 of the 3, and actually, I think it was the first and the third week were better than the second week. So it's -- I won't read into it that it was the first two. It was actually the first and it was the third. And even if we looked at the second one, it was very close to records that we have seen in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","I just wanted to kind of continue some of the thought that Steve had earlier in the call, just on costs and you explained why you're looking at 2% this year. I'm just trying to understand if we should think about in the kind of medium term if that's the new norm or so, like as we are thinking about our 20\/20 model, should we be starting at a base kind of cost of 2%? Or are your investments going to be tailing off by then?","Jason Liberty","Well, I wouldn't -- I'm not quite sure what to say would be the new normal, but this year they are approximately 2%. What I will tell you is that we are committed to managing effectively our costs. We're always highly focused on it, but of course, there are investments that we're making in some things that pressure some of the optics of our metrics like the Perfect Days of the world that have revenues and costs, but don't necessarily have APCDs associated with them that can elevate that metric a little bit. But I won't give you a specific number just to -- hopefully everybody knows that we continue to be very focused on it.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then I know you don't want to kind of break out these different buckets of your, kind of, the new aspects or the new drivers on your yield. But can you just -- we get this question a lot and I'm sure you do too. Can you just kind of help us think about Perfect Day. I know a lot of folks are trying to model it. So maybe kind of give us some parameters, number of passengers that might be coming a year, utilization, pricing, just anything that you can help us with our modeling there?","Michael Bayley","Felicia, it's Michael. Yes, I think when you look at the total portfolio for Royal Caribbean Cruises, I think over 50% of our total capacity is in the Caribbean. When you look at Royal Caribbean International, we have, I think, 13 ships operating in the Caribbean during the year. And then when you look at the deployment of those ships to Perfect Day in 2019, I believe that 10 of the 13 ships are calling into Perfect Day. Our projections are that by 2020, so next year, we will be taking just shy of 2 million guests a year to Perfect Day. So -- and certainly what we've seen in our bookings, not only in the Caribbean, but particularly for those ships that are scheduled to go to Perfect Day has been really quite positive, and we haven't officially opened it yet. So I hope that gives some context and paints a clearer picture for you. And then of course, the other element is the sales associated with the experience in Perfect Day, and we've seen our sales of activities and experiences really take off on our pre-cruise sales for the experience. So we're up by a factor of close to 9, I think, for our Perfect Day sales.","Richard Fain","Felicia, if I can -- it's Richard, and if I could just add something to try and address your question. When we identify the costs that we've said are associated with Perfect Day and the revenue and we've adjusted our cost, our yield and expense metrics to take that into account, we've only isolated out the actual costs in the -- on -- that are directly related to CocoCay and the revenues that occur on CocoCay. But one of the impacts of doing an initiative like that is that it improves the ticket revenue, and we can't and we don't isolate that out separately. And it's obviously very hard to measure. And that's actually part of what you see going on. We have a lot of things that we think are helping us on the revenue side that we aren't quantifying. We've really isolated these 3 things, Silversea's, Terminal A and Perfect Day, but there are actually others, and it's a little hard to isolate those out. But as Michael said, and he has said even more emphatically on previous calls, we really think Perfect Day is a game changer for us and quite exciting, but it's in more ways than just appear when you isolate it out as a separate expense and a separate revenue.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then Jason, on Silversea, I know most of the synergies are going to come next year when you can refinance the debt, but have you been able to generate any kind of or do you expect to generate any kind of cost synergies in '19? And then also on the earnings side, when we have time after the call, I'm sure we can sit down and calculate this, but maybe you can help, was there -- what was the impact to EPS? Was it neutral or dilutive?","Jason Liberty","Yes. Sure. So one, at the same time that we had announced the Silversea deal, we said it was going to take a few years. A lot of that is tied to the financing for it to be accretive to our overall business. So I won't be specific in terms of the amount because it's really immaterial to our bottom line. The cost synergy effort or just synergies in general are going exceptionally well. The Silversea team is very engaged and very focused on growing the business and making the business as efficient and profitable as it can be. We are, I would say, a little bit ahead of schedule on the cost synergy side, and we do have some of the cost synergies accounted for within our guidance for this year.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then just last question, just more housekeeping, but -- and maybe this is an impact of Silversea. We're just looking at your fuel consumption versus your capacity growth, and typically your fuel consumption is below your capacity growth, excluding some quarters where seasonality might reverse that. But now your guidance implies fuel consumption above capacity growth. So I'm just wondering if Silversea is driving that?","Jason Liberty","Yes. That's exactly right. Those ships are not as fuel-efficient or really not even close to being as fuel-efficient as our overall fleet. And obviously, they don't benefit from scale as those ships are sailing with passengers between 100 and 600 passengers on them. So that's what's driving the consumption differential.","Felicia Hendrix","Do we see going forward, is there a rule of thumb that we should use or we just use the pattern that we're seeing this year?","Jason Liberty","Yes. I think once we get through this year, and obviously we're also very focused as part of the synergies on trying to employ many of the energy-saving initiatives that we have done on our existing fleet, trying to get some of those opportunities onto the Silversea fleet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citi.","Gregory Badishkanian","Great. Just for my first question, just to do with the strength of WAVE, any specific regions that really stood out? Is it just North America sourced? And also, just color on the year-over-year growth from pricing during WAVE? Is -- was the booking surprisingly positive? Or was it the pricing side that was more of a positive for you?","Jason Liberty","Yes. So first, on the WAVE side, I mean, the only market which we did -- we talked about that had a little bit more volatility to it has been the U.K. Outside of that, we have seen a lot of strength and both volume and benefits on the pricing side as well. So it's -- again, I mean, we're still in the early days of WAVE, but at least what we have seen over the past 3 to 4 weeks is a good news story on both the volume and pricing.","Gregory Badishkanian","Good. And then just China, I think you mentioned that bookings were up year-over-year for 2019. How do you think that market performs for you relative to your overall fleet? Is it going to outperform, in line?","Michael Bayley","It's going to outperform. This is Michael, Greg. We're pleased with China. We've had many conversations over China over time. We've been in the market for 10 years, and we continue development. And as Jason mentioned, '18 performance was significantly improved from '17 and '19 is in a really good book position, and we are feeling quite good about the dynamics there at the moment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel from Bernstein Research.","David Beckel","I'll take another stab at the additions of Silversea, CocoCay and Terminal A, if I could. I believe based on your guidance, the math implies all 3 of those will contribute about $15 million of EBITDAR. So first off, is that right? And second, if so, how should we think about how those investments will contribute in 2020? And is there any chance for upside in 2019, I think, as you may have alluded to before?","Jason Liberty","Yes. So as it relates to the EBITDA, the profitability of it, we are not guiding specifically on these items, but we were comfortable giving how it impacts our yield as well as our cost metrics. I think when you think about, as it goes into 2020, first off, we're into all of these investments for them to be accretive to our business and be high returning and certainly we expect in 2020 there to be more contribution from all 3. The Port of Miami because we'll have more volumes, as Michael commented. On CocoCay, we will have almost 2 million guests going through CocoCay in 2020, and there will be more and more amenities available to those guests on the island. And a lot of our synergies will be implemented through 2020 on Silversea, and Silversea will also take on a new ship in 2020, which will even improve further their scale of their business.","David Beckel","Great. And as a second question, a bit higher level. Looks like you stand a reasonably good chance of hitting double-digit EPS this year, which would be a year ahead of schedule relative to 20\/20 Vision. So two quick questions, and please remind us, was the original guidance of double-digit EPS inclusive of a economic disturbance of a material sort? And the second, has the ROIC component of your Vision 20\/20 tracked according to your expectations thus far?","Jason Liberty","Yes. Sure. So first on the 20\/20, we did say that we would reach double-digit growth. We didn't say exactly what that double-digit number would be, but as you commented on, we -- the higher end of our guidance is $10 per share, and we'll certainly work as hard as we can to do as well as we possibly can to reach high EPS growth. The ROIC number in general is on track. Obviously, our investment in Silversea weighs on that a little bit, but our other investments have really outperformed, which is allowing us to see our ROIC continue to move north. So I think that's kind of how we see things to continue to evolve. The one comment I would make, just to put something into context, if you look at 2019 and the guide that we've given, if we had the same FX and fuel rates at this time last year, that number would actually be about $0.40 higher than what we're guiding today. And so that is one factor that has changed for us, but trying to project what economic changes there might be going forward, that's not something that we do in our forecasting for the future.","David Beckel","And was the original EPS target inclusive of economic disturbances?","Jason Liberty","No. It was basically -- it was based off of moderate yield growth, good cost control and being measured in our capital investments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Wedbush Securities.","James Hardiman","I wanted to circle back and maybe just get a little bit of a clarification on one of Steve's original questions. Obviously, the core yield guide to start the year is better than at least I can remember. Jason, you sounded pretty positive, and I think Richard has contributed to this as well on the like-for-like trend. I guess, my clarification is, is the like-for-like yield guidance once we, obviously, exclude Silversea and even the new hardware, is that better to start 2019 than it's been in previous years?","Jason Liberty","Sure. It is higher than what we have seen historically in the past on the like-for-like side. So if we look at just our -- the core, which we're calling out approximately 4%, more than half of that is coming from like-for-like growth and the balance of that is coming from the new hardware.","James Hardiman","Got it. That's really helpful and really encouraging. And then just a housekeeping question for me, maybe save Carola some phone calls here. Can you give us the quarterly capacity numbers? And is there any way to give us the nonorganic contribution stuff, the yield contributor, Silversea, CocoCay, Miami Port on a quarterly basis? Obviously, that's going to be a pretty big building block of how we build out our models. Is there any way to give us or at least directionally how to think about that over the course of the year?","Jason Liberty","Well, one, it is my job and life to make Carola's life easier. I want to make sure that she has a fruitful afternoon. So I'll leave her for more details, but certainly, as I said, most of our capacity growth for the year will take place in the first half of the year. And as I -- also as I commented, our yield or our cadence for our yield is pretty much the same within certain levels of moderation through the course of the year to consider.","James Hardiman","And that's on a total basis, it's a similar cadence, not on a organic or inorganic?","Jason Liberty","That's exactly right. On a total basis, it's the same. On a combined basis, on a gross basis, but also on the core, it's also has a similar cadence to it through the course of the year.","James Hardiman","Okay. And then just lastly, way too early question on 2020, but some of these nonorganic contributors, I would assume that Silversea is going to be a wash in terms of yields and costs. I'm guessing that the Miami terminal will as well, but should we also assume some sort of inflation from cost and also an addition to yields for Perfect Day, given the timing in 2019?","Jason Liberty","Well, I mean, it is -- as you said, it's early days to start thinking about 2020, but I would focus more on the port and CocoCay and even with Silversea. Silversea is going to grow next year. There is going to be more volume coming out of the terminal, and there is going to be more volume coming out of Perfect Day, all of which will have both yield and cost considerations to it in 2020.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Conder from Wells Fargo.","Timothy Conder","I did want to follow up, drilling a little bit more here, maybe James was alluding to on 2020 a little bit and your implications for the current state of bookings also out of Europe. So it appears that Germany is okay, you only called out a little volatility from the U.K., but how are -- it's early obviously, but how are the bookings with the TUI JV out of the Germany. And then considering 2020 and some changes with ships coming in and out the TUI JV fleet, how should we think about the TUI JV contribution in '19 and then '20, just to make sure, as that's become a pretty significant and very nice JV operation obviously?","Jason Liberty","Yes. Sure. So first just talking on the EU side, which also ties into your comment around Germany. First, on the U.K. piece, we really said that there's just been volatility, but that volatility has certainly stabilized and again the volatility typically happens around the new cycle in the U.K. Broader Europe has actually done quite well. Germany is doing well, typically TUI is also doing well. So we don't comment specifically on TUI's yield guidance or specifically to their profitability. The one thing I would say in '19 is that TUI does take on another ship, which is good for us as it relates to the income that we will get, the equity pickup we will get from TUI. So that will continue to expand our equity pickups. In 2020, they do not have a new ship and so some of that uplift that we've seen now for the past several years will be a little bit lighter. We're more driven off of the margins that they get off of their existing fleet for the next couple of years. And so that's how I would think about those two line items.","Timothy Conder","Okay. And then, Michael, China, Jason alluded to earlier that China was up in bookings, you responded to the previous question that it's positioned well. How is pricing at this point going year-over-year, if you can have any commentary on that? And then CocoCay, just maybe a little more Perfect Day, how are your bookings and maybe price uptake, so to speak, tracking at this point versus the expectations of what you guys have built into the budget?","Michael Bayley","So we're not going to go into specific details on price increases by products or market, but I can tell you that overall the China market, I think, I mentioned earlier, we've seen good improvement in '18 over '17, and we are seeing similar improvement now coming through into '19. Of course, we've got the addition of our newest ship, Spectrum of the Seas, that's going into the China market. So we're excited about that and the consumer seems to be excited about the introduction of that new product as well as our trade partners. So things are looking quite good in the China market. Of course, overall, there has been an industry capacity decrease of somewhere in the region of 15%, 20%. So China is in good shape, even though there is quite a lot of negativity in terms of the news that we hear with regards to the trade battle that's occurring, but the consumer seems to be quite confident, and things seem to be relatively good in China. In Perfect Day, I think we mentioned earlier that we've been very pleased with the demand that we've seen coming through on the products that have course into Perfect Day, and that's been a real positive driver of our Caribbean overall health in terms of bookings. And we've also seen really good uptake in terms of the pre-cruise sales of experiences and products on Perfect Day. So both of these really are quite positive.","Timothy Conder","And lastly, Jason, you had alluded to with Excalibur coming on and the trends that you're seeing there, if I remember right, at an Analyst Day, you talked about maybe an enhanced e-commerce engine being laid over top of that in the latter half of '19. Any additional color you can provide there?","Jason Liberty","Yes. So there is lots of elements and attributes that are being added onto the Excalibur platform. One of that will be for us to be able to be -- it will be easier for the customer as we are able to curate and have recommendation engines to allow our guests to more easily book things before they get onto the ship. And as we know in the past, if we can get the consumer to book ahead of the cruise, we also are able to get them to also spend when they're on the ship. So those capabilities will be coming online through the course of 2019, but I would expect more of a full year impact impacting us in 2020.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling","I guess, two follow ups. First, I guess, coming at the Perfect Day, terminal and Silversea cost questions from a different angle, what percentage of the costs are onetime versus ongoing expenses? And then as you think about the ultimate ROI on Perfect Day, are there other opportunities or regions you've identified to develop something similar, or is it still early, that could further differentiate and strengthen the brand?","Jason Liberty","Yes. So as it relates to onetime, I think the only thing that I would call out, because there is nothing really relating to CocoCay or Perfect Day, that is onetime. As we announced many, many months ago when we bought Silversea, we announced Project Invictus, which was really to help modernize their ships. And so they do have more -- they had more drydock activity in the fourth quarter of '18 and of course since it's on a quarter lag, that is inflating our cost metric a little bit in the first quarter, which is why that's -- the highest cost quarter for us on a gross level. I would say that on the Perfect Day side, just to quickly comment, we will -- it is obviously a major focus of ours. We want to get this thing launched, understand how the consumer takes to that and then consider whether or not there are future opportunities for us to consider.","Stephen Grambling","Nice, helpful. And one other follow-up on China. Can you just give us any update on the efforts to kind of alter the distribution model there and perhaps whether the incremental demand for non-China itineraries could potentially play into that?","Michael Bayley","Yes. Steve, it's Michael. We've been on the journey to develop distribution for the past few years, and we feel pretty pleased with the journey that we are on and the progress that we've been making. And I think that's been part of the success that we're having now in China, is the growth of the distribution system. So we're feeling pretty good about that. And sorry, the second part of your question was?","Stephen Grambling","It was just, I guess, it plays into it, but whether the non-China itineraries can potentially accelerate that, if you are seeing greater demand there and maybe earlier booking?","Michael Bayley","Yes. I mean, there was few elements to our strategy in China. One was the distribution, the other one was adding longer itineraries for the China market itself, ex China, which has proven to be quite successful. And then, of course, the third element that you pointed out is the focus on outbound. It is the world's largest outbound travel market, and things are changing with regard to visa restrictions and group travel and what have you, and we are starting to see an improvement in terms of the number of Chinese guests who are going through our products in Alaska and the Mediterranean and Europe, and we think that's an opportunity, particularly as the brand becomes more and more well known in the China market and as we establish wider, broader, deeper distribution, then it becomes a really good opportunity for us in terms of that outbound growth.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Brandt Montour from JPMorgan.","Brandt Montour","I was just hoping you could maybe unpack your fuel guidance a little bit more and help us understand what you're assuming in terms of at-the-pump pricing, if you're giving full credit for the backwardation of the curve or if your -- what are you assuming for the MGO spread, anything of that would be helpful.","Jason Liberty","Yes. Sure. So as it relates to our guidance on the fuel side, obviously, we are about 58% hedged for the year and then when you look it as it relates to fuel price, we forecast based off of what fuel prices are today. We don't speculate or pivot off of the forward curve.","Brandt Montour","And that includes -- sorry, and that includes MGO spreads as well that would be just today.","Jason Liberty","That's exactly right. That's right. Thank you for your assistance, James, with the call today. And we thank you all for your participation and interest in the company.

After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to introduce Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jason Liberty. Mr. Liberty, the floor is yours.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Carola Mengolini, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures.","Please note that we do not undertake to update the information in our filings as circumstances change.","Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP historical items can be found on our website. Unless we state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant-currency adjusted basis.","Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview of the business. I will follow up with a recap of our second quarter results, provide an update on the booking environment and then provide an update on our full year and third quarter guidance for 2018. We will then open up the call for your questions. Richard?","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. It's been another record-breaking quarter and a record-breaking year, and I'm happy to give some additional color on our business.","Simply put, we started the year feeling very optimistic that we could nicely improve over what was an amazingly successful 2017. Since then, we've grown only more positive about our direction and about the prospects for the rest of this year and next.","Now, while we tend to focus on the year as a whole, it is still interesting to look back on how our internal forecasts for the individual quarters have evolved over the last six months or so. Our current quarterly expectations for 2018 are higher in each of the four quarters than they were when we put our initial forecast together last January.","I tell you, that's a nice feeling. Of course, the drivers of that yield strength are always in flux, but the fact that we are seeing overall improvement in each quarter of the year over our original expectations is a real confidence builder.","Looking at the total picture, revenue continues to excel, cost remain firmly under control, and our below-the-line items are doing beautifully. The second quarter benefited from unexpected strength in last-minute bookings, and as usual, some markets performed better and some worse-than-expected.","The second quarter also benefited from some substantial timing differences relating to costs and other items. In fact, roughly half of the quarter's beat was simply due to timing differences, which will reverse in the second half.","Again, we manage our business more on an annual basis than a quarterly one, and these types of quarterly swings are irrelevant to our business.","This quarter's timing differences on expenses is more than usual, but still within simple operational parameters. From a business point-of-view the story is simply that business is good and we believe it will continue to be good for reasons we have previously discussed. Having to deal with the headwinds of foreign exchange and fuel rates is extremely frustrating, especially this year, when both have moved so strongly against us. As frustrating as it is, we feel very good about the fact that the strength of our business is more than compensating for such powerful negative forces.","Now, a year ago I described the image of a duck seeming to glide calmly through the water, while no one sees the fierce pedaling activities that goes underneath the surface. I find myself recalling that image once again since I know how hard our people have worked to deliver the results that we are talking about today. It's particularly gratifying to see how well our brands are performing in their respective marketplaces.","Royal Caribbean International continues to retain its outstanding market position and keeps setting new records for pleasing our guests. The latest example of this is the stellar debut of the Symphony of the Seas in the Mediterranean. Her performance would be spectacular for a first time shipped in a new market. For her to perform so amazingly well when she is the fourth of a series is a testament to the innovations the team has incorporated and the power of the Royal Caribbean International brand. The ship has remarkable new wows, new shows and new activities, but what truly sets her apart is the careful execution and high level of service, which have been pivotal in achieving these record-breaking ratings.","Celebrity Cruises is also on a roll. Her modern luxury platform is resonating very nicely with the cruising public and has helped propel the brand to record ratings and record prices. Of course, the amazing excitement around Celebrity Edge is not only helping with future bookings on that ship, but it's helping on the rest of the Celebrity fleet as well.","And Azamara Club Cruises is enjoying one of the strongest surges in the cruise industry. Her innovative focus on destinations perfectly addresses the growing interest and experiences and is propelling the brand to new heights. And more recently, the Azamara Pursuit is now on her first voyage and doing wonderfully.","TUI Cruises also continues to go from strength to strength. It's unique, high-quality, all-inclusive offering is ideally suited to our German clientele, and TUI Cruises' outstanding implementation gets it top marks from its guests and travel agents. The result is that this cruise line continues to surpass the very tough goals that we and TUI continually set for it.","It's rare for the stars to all align in such an auspicious manner. We often have one brand performing particularly well, but today they all are. We often have a strong global cruise market, but today that strength is particularly evident.","As I said before, it is essential when assessing supply and demand dynamics to focus on both sides of the equation, not only look at half the picture. In this case, we think the very strong picture for demand ought to be very encouraging against the supply side, which is constrained by yard capacity, and which is growing at moderate rates which look to be exceeded by normal demand growth.","One of the factors that continues to drive demand is increasing relevance of cruising as a mainstream vacation choice. In the past, cruising was seen by many as somewhat of a niche market. But today the industry has increasingly become a mainstream vacation alternative.","I attribute a lot of this change to the fact that people are more and more looking for experiences over material goods and we have been so effective in responding to these changing desires of our consumer base.","Nevertheless, we still have a long way to go before our industry reaches maturity. Penetration rates around the world are still amazingly low. Just to put this in perspective, last year about 72 million tourists visited the City of Orlando and 40 million went to Las Vegas. In the same period, the entire cruise industry carried 26 million tourists around the world. We really do have a ways to go.","The result of all this is that demand for cruising and especially for our brands continues to grow at an attractive rate. We are determined to continue to do our utmost to be responsive to that growing demand with the best products, features, and itineraries.","Looking forward, we have a higher percentage of 2019 booked than we did a year ago for 2018, and they're booked at higher prices. While this sounds very good and we're very happy about the position, I want to reemphasize that this one metric is far from as important as some people appear to believe.","There are two reasons for this. First, this metric is often the result of deliberate choices that we make. For example, I recall one year where the market was strong and we were convinced that it was going to get even better the following year. We deliberately reduced sales of our top category suites so that we would be able to take advantages of higher prices as the market improved. In that case, our book position looked worse-than-usual, but it actually reflects optimism on our part. I'm happy to say it's also \u2013 we were right about that.","Another example of possible sources of confusion is structural. For example, next year we have more of our inventory dedicated to markets that traditionally book later. Obviously, we expect these markets to do well, as well as other markets, but we know that they will simply make their reservations later and our revenue management systems operate accordingly. This example does reduce our forward booking stats relative to last year, but it is definitely not a sign of a problem.","Thus, while we're happy that our bookings are higher than prior years, our optimism about 2019 is really based on a combination of many factors. Forecasting revenue yields remains very much an art as well as a science. But it is an art where our track record has been very impressive.","I would now like to give you some further insights on the Silversea's partnership. On the commercial side, the reaction has been extremely strong. Travel agents see how Silversea can grow and become more efficient while also making us a more rounded company and, therefore, more relevant as a vacation option.","As we mentioned when we announced this partnership, we had a gap in our portfolio and to close it with a brand like Silversea that is at the top of its market segment was an answer to a prayer. We just closed on the deal the day before yesterday and we're eager to work on the integration. Exciting times ahead.","I also want to take this opportunity to update you on project Excalibur, our digital technology platform. The program is on track and the progress is impressive. We have taken a methodical, agile approach to this implementation, rolling out new upgrades on a monthly basis or even more frequently. We're finding that this softly, softly approach allows us to move more quickly, but also to correct errors early before they impact a lot of vacations.","We continually add features to the app and we remain on our trajectory of having half the fleet connected by the end of this year and most of the rest by the end of next year. The most complete version of the app today is on Symphony of the Seas and in December that distinction will be taken over by Celebrity Edge.","One interesting milestone is the introduction of frictionless arrival. We have been rolling this out on a limited basis and expect that it will be operational on a large scale basis on Symphony of the Seas and on Celebrity Edge later this fall. By the way, we recently trademarked the term frictionless, so don't expect to see that being used by any other cruise line.","I would also remind you of our belief that the public-facing aspects of our digital platform are important, but much of our emphasis has been on the behind-the-scenes work, i.e., making life easier and better for our employees and investing in digital data analytic tools, which are essential for our future success.","And lastly, before I turn the call back over to Jason, I want to mention the new IMO fuel regulations, which are coming into force in 2020. These regulations require that all ships, cruise or cargo, dramatically reduce the amount of sulfur that they emit into the air. We meet the regulations in two ways: by buying fuel that already has the sulfur removed at the refinery or by removing the sulfur ourselves using advanced emission purifications or AEP systems.","Today, about 30% of our fuel has had the sulfur removed before we buy it and given the success of our AEP systems, we believe that this 30% figure will not change materially even after the 2020 date. In fact, for various technical reasons, many observers believe that the new regulations could actually reduce our fuel costs once the regulations come into force. Of course, it's required a massive investment in these AEP systems, but that investment is paying off in both fuel costs and environmental benefits.","I shouldn't leave this topic of fuel without mentioning our energy conservation efforts because we are enormously proud of the work our teams have done and continue to do to find ways to reduce our energy consumption. We already have the lowest levels in our industry and have partnered with the World Wildlife Fund to improve it even further. While AEP systems and other such measures are good, the best way to reduce our environmental footprint is to use less energy in the first place.","We'll continue to work towards lower use of energy and lower emissions to generate our remaining energy needs.","And with that, I get to turn the microphone back to Jason. Jason?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thank you, Richard. I will begin by talking about our results for the second quarter of 2018. These results are summarized on slide two.","For the quarter, we generated adjusted earnings of $2.27 per share, which is approximately $0.39 higher than the midpoint of our guidance and 33% higher than same time last year. Our net revenue yields were up 2.8% for the quarter, which is approximately 105 basis points higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance. The beat was driven by stronger-than-anticipated close-in demand and better-than-expected onboard revenue spend. Onboard areas such as beverage, specialty dining and Internet helped deliver a 5.5% year-over-year increase in onboard revenue.","Net cruise costs excluding fuel were up 1.1% for the quarter, which is 390 basis points better than expected, driven mainly by timing. Roughly half of our earnings beat for the quarter was due to these timing differences in costs. This is an unusually large shift, but as we have often said, we manage our costs on an annual basis rather than a quarterly basis. It just so happens that this quarter had a surfeit of timing changes, but it has little relevance to our view for the full year.","So the positive cost variance that occurred in the second quarter will simply reappear as an increase in our costs in the back half of the year.","In addition to better revenue and costs within the quarter, we also experienced an outperformance below the line, which was driven mainly by our joint ventures. A stronger dollar and higher fuel prices negatively impacted the quarter by $0.04 a share.","On the shareholders front, we paid $128 million in dividends during the quarter, and since our last call we have repurchased $300 million in shares.","So in summary, strong close-in demand, better onboard spend, better-than-expected results relating to our joint ventures and the timing of spend drove the $0.39 beat in the quarter.","Now I'd like to update you on what we're seeing on the business outlook. The booking environment remains very strong with demand for each of our core products trending at or above expected levels. We've been particularly impressed with the demand we are seeing for 2019 where we are currently booked at record levels in both rate and volume for the year.","2018 is also very strongly booked with our load factors in line with last year at record rates. We don't expect to be booked ahead in volume at this point given our increased capacity in the closer-in short Caribbean market in the back half of the year. However, load factors for the balance of the year are up nicely when normalizing for these ships in deployment.","Now I'll provide you an update on each of our core markets starting with the Caribbean. Demand for the Caribbean sailings has been strong with bookings trending ahead of last year's very strong levels. Our Caribbean capacity is up in the back half of the year, due mainly to the addition of the reimagined Mariner of the Seas for the short Caribbean market.","As Richard mentioned in our last call, our strategy behind modernizing the Mariner of the Seas was to offer the best alternative for a short Caribbean getaway as a response to consumer trends. The younger generations are opting for shorter, more frequent vacations and the Mariner of the Seas is very well positioned for this segment with onboard activities, dining options and entertainment similar to those on Oasis class ships.","Mariner of the Seas is booked very well and we are particularly excited about 2019. While we generally don't expect to receive many bookings for short Caribbean sailings that are more than six months away, Mariner of the Seas' load factors in the first half of 2019 are closer to those of seven night products than they are to shorter products.","On the other side of the Atlantic, European itineraries account for 17% of our total capacity and more than 30% during the summer months. 2018 is turning into another record breaking season with strong global demand for European sailings and better pricing than last year from all source markets. Symphony of the Seas has definitely been the star of the show this year, but we've also achieved better pricing across the European fleet despite a difficult 2017 comparable.","Regarding our Asia-Pacific itineraries, they also account for 17% of our full-year 2018 capacity and we continue to be in a strong booked position for China, Southeast Asia and our winter Australia products.","China sailings performed very well in the second quarter, generating strong yield growth and exceeding our overall expectations. In addition, China is booked nicely ahead in both rate and volume for the back half of the year and into 2019. A contributing factor is the exceptional progress our teams have made in expanding the distribution network.","While it's way too early to provide any specific color on next year's performance, I thought I would make a few comments about 2019. As I mentioned earlier, we are in a particularly strong booked position for 2019. We are booked ahead in both rate and volume for each of our core Caribbean, European and Asia-Pacific products and we have no signs of these great demand trends dissipating. Now, as Richard mentioned, these metrics are as a result of deliberate choices and we have to always be mindful when citing them as indicators of performance.","While we are talking about 2019, I would also like to highlight that 2019 will be an atypical year as two very innovative and exciting new ventures will start to operate; our new cruise terminal in Miami and the stunning Perfect Day waterpark and resort on our private island of CocoCay in the Bahamas.","As Richard also mentioned in his remarks, innovation and the creation of new and better destinations to support the company's growth is in our DNA and these two projects are proof of this. As such, these ventures will provide a tailwind for yield and a headwind for our costs in 2019.","Now let's turn to slide 3 to talk about our updated guidance for the full-year 2018. Overall, we are reaffirming our April guidance of $8.70 to $8.90 per share. This updated guidance includes some puts and takes that I would like to highlight.","On the puts side we beat the second quarter by $0.39, approximately half of which relates to the timing of costs that are now planned to be spent in the back half of the year. Also, the strong booking trends, which I previously mentioned, are driving an increase in our earnings expectations for the back half of the year.","On the take side, the stronger dollar and higher fuel prices have impacted the back half of the year by approximately $0.31 since our April call. Additionally, we have increased our interest expense by approximately $0.06 to account for the purchase price for the Silversea investment.","So in summary, the accelerating strength in our business is helping offset further headwinds from FX and fuel.","As it relates to our key metrics, we expect our net revenue yield to increase in the range of 2.75% to 3.75% for the full year. This is approximately a 50 basis point improvement versus our previous expectations, which is being driven by the outperformance in Q2 and an increase in the revenue outlook for the back half of the year.","From a cost perspective, we expect Net Cruise Costs including fuel to be up approximately 2.5%, in line with our previous quarterly guidance.","In summary, based on the current business outlook along with current fuel prices, interest and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $8.70 to $8.90, in line with our previous guidance. This represents a 17% year-over-year increase in earnings. We expect fuel expense of $693 million for the year and we are 50% hedged.","Now we can turn to our guidance for the third quarter, which is on slide four.","We expect net revenue yields to be up approximately 2% for the third quarter, which is on top of a 5.3% yield increase in the third quarter of 2017. Net Cruise Costs excluding fuel for the third quarter are expected to be down approximately 1%.","Based on current fuel prices, interest and currency exchange rates and the outlook expressed above, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $3.95 per share. This guidance includes the negative impact of approximately $0.20 from currency and fuel when compared to rates effective on the last earnings call.","Now before I turn the call back to the operator, I would like to briefly talk about Silversea, which we closed on earlier this week. Silversea will be reported with a three month lag, which means we will begin consolidating their operations in the fourth quarter of 2018. So for this year, Silversea's August and September results will be presented as part of our fourth quarter results.","As I previously commented, our guidance includes $0.06 of financing costs that relate to the purchase price. However, the forecasted results for August and September for Silversea's operations and purchase accounting related items have not been considered in our guidance.","As we noted during the announcement of the Silversea transaction, we do not expect their results to materially impact the corporation's 2018 adjusted earnings per share. For comparative purposes, we plan to adjust one-time related transaction costs and the bulk of the non-cash related adjustments as a result of purchase accounting from our adjusted earnings and non-GAAP financial metrics.","One visible impact on this year will relate to our yield and cost metrics. Silversea is an ultra-luxury and expedition brand that demands higher yields and entails higher cost per berth relative to our other brands. While the bottom line impact in the near term is expected to be immaterial, the consolidation of Silversea will mean higher average yields for the company and higher cost per berth.","And with that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator",". The first question will come from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.","Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning and congrats on a great quarter. I guess the first question is around your guidance for the back half of the year and maybe you'll disagree with us here, but it seems like you might be being a little bit conservative around the third quarter yield guide, especially since you just beat the second quarter by 100 basis points at the midpoint. And maybe you're being a little bit more realistic around your fourth quarter implied guide.","I guess the question is, are you being a little cautious here around the Caribbean close-in activity given consumers could be more nervous around weather this fall or is there something else we need to be thinking about? But given how much capacity you have in Europe and Alaska in the third quarter, we would have thought that the yield guide for 3Q could have been slightly higher than what it is.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Well, I'll start off and thank you for the \u2013 thanks for the second quarter beat. I would say as it relates to our guidance, whether it's in the quarter or for the fourth quarter or for the balance of the year, this is kind of based off of where we see our book position, how bookings are coming in. I would not \u2013 and I would caution the word conservative, I would just say that we really do try to provide our guidance based off of the best information we have at the time.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Steve, I think I'd like to just add. Remember, last year we had a particularly exuberant third quarter and when we made our forecast for the quarter, we're ahead, actually, of \u2013 the guidance we're giving out now is actually ahead of where we thought we would be at the beginning of the year. So the year's actually progressed very nicely.","The second quarter beat was really a surprise to us. That can happen. You do have quarters where there's a sudden surge in last minute bookings and that did happen in this last quarter. And that's lovely. But it's absolutely unpredictable and, frankly, it's a little bit \u2013 it was a surprise to us.","Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks, guys. And then second question, I know you bought back $300 million worth of stock since your last call. But can you maybe help us understand how you guys are thinking about using that \u2013 the remaining authorization going forward? And Richard, I'm going to ask you a personal question, but can you help us understand why you unwound your 10b5-1? Appreciate it.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Okay. I'll start off with the $300 million. As we've said for some time, the way that we look at share repurchasing as opportunistically and I think you will continue to see us behave in that way. So there's not any type of specific timing. Obviously we are always conscious about our debt structure or our capital structure and our leverage ratios and kind of making sure that we maintain our discipline as being investment-grade credit. But that's kind of more \u2013 that combined with us as being opportunistic on the share price is how we will continue to proceed on the share repurchase side. And I'll let Richard answer his personal question.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thank you, Jason. Thank you, Steve. I don't usually like to comment on these things, but I think it's not a surprise to anybody that I would put in place some sort of regular program to sell as just from a \u2013 on a state point of view. And I put that in place quite a while ago. But when the share price went to levels that, frankly, I couldn't understand, I just couldn't continue to maintain that.","Frankly, this has happened in the past. We do see this. The market anticipates things differently than we do and we've seen the market in the past drop down and stuff like that, and frankly, a few times that's happened and I've gone in and bought. I can't now. I'm not allowed to because of the 10b something program, but I certainly didn't have to continue to sell and so I stopped that.","Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's great color. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","The next question will come from Harry Curtis with Instinet.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on the first question. In the Caribbean the rest of the year, just overall, do you have a lot left to sell in the third or fourth quarter? I mean how much variability could there be, for example, if there were storms in the fourth quarter? And I'm assuming that you've built some cushion in for that.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes, well, one area, I mean I think that's exactly right. When you look at on a quarter \u2013 especially at the time of a call, I mean we're certainly north of 95% booked for the third quarter and it's pretty linear going to the fourth quarter. And so I think obviously going into this our confidence is strong but, again, it's based off of the best information we have at this point in time. And that's why we did take up our yield guidance for the back half of the year by 25 basis points.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Very good. And the second question really looks into supply growth by your major markets next year. When you and I chatted a while back about the Caribbean, for example, you mentioned that the Caribbean supply growth next year is going to be relatively flat to down a little bit, but that Europe was going to be seeing the largest increase. So my question is, particularly in Europe, can you give us some early color on how Europe looks, especially from U.S. customers, given that level of capacity growth? Are you feeling pretty comfortable that that will be absorbed?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes, so first, as you \u2013 in our shoes, and you're talking about outward periods, especially like 2019 and saying that we're at record levels on a rate and volume basis, your further out products are certainly in that consideration. And Europe is certainly in that consideration and the consumer that books further out is really the North American consumer. I would say that if we could probably do 2018 over again, which probably would mean setting our deployment in 2016, we would certainly want to have more capacity in Europe than in other products because strength in North American consumers for Europe is exceptionally strong and we've even seen even further strength year-over-year from the European consumer for European products.","So while next year capacity is elevated in Europe relative to the other products, we certainly believe that demand is there to meet that supply or more exceed that. And that's right. That is in our book position very much in the consideration is the North Americans booking in advance. A lot of time they do that because of air fare. They book in advance for their European vacations for the following year.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Got it, okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So Jason, you raised the second half net yield guidance by 25 basis points. I'm just wondering are you seeing or was that driven more by upside you're seeing in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes, it's actually the balance of both. As Richard said, both quarters are higher than we had anticipated them being, and of course, some of the trends that we're seeing, especially around Europe, is underpinning our confidence in those increases in those quarters, this quarter and next quarter.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay and even though things are better and you just called out Europe, so I think people are still having kind of conceptual issues with the third quarter in Caribbean, given the double-digit increase there. So are you seeing anything that gives you any kind of concern in terms of promotional environment from competitors or is achieving pricing there being more challenging than you expected?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","I mean it's pretty \u2013 I think it's interesting when you look at the Caribbean really through the course of this year. I know there's been a lot of chatter about it or concerns about it. But the Caribbean is really booked as we expected for this year and I think you have things obviously as we add more shorter product that is something that can weigh on yields. But when you look at the like-for-like outside of what we talked about last time, which was Puerto Rico, it's continuing to book in line with our expectations, which we had from earlier this year.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes, you know Felicia, it's interesting because you talk about conceptual issues and we do understand that. So we have to relate back to our own forecasts and what our own expectations have been and we're really just seeing both for this year, which you asked on next year, which I know you're also interested in, we're just looking at really quite strong markets. And we're just not \u2013 our own forecast just are a little more bullish about how that's doing and as I say, we're coming in, you specifically mentioned the third quarter, we're coming in actually a little ahead of where we thought we would be at this time.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And then I just have some housekeeping, Jason. Just as we think about our modeling for 2019, is there a way you can give us some parameters for what D&A and interest might look like once Silversea is consolidated? And then also, we've just been getting a lot of questions about the other income line in your P&L. It was about $50 million higher than we expected. What was that?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes, sure. So on the interest and D&A side, the interest side, you can annualize the $0.06 and the $0.06 is based off of the purchase price date, which was July 31. So that you can annualize. On the D&A side, it's too early to comment on that because we need to go through the purchase accounting activities to build up the balance sheet for Silversea onto our books and that's something that will impact what the D&A will be. So we will come back to everybody, likely in the third quarter call, on some expectations as well as also what yields will look like and costs will look like for the balance of this year and some dialogue about that in the following year.","On the other income side, this really relates to a series of \u2013 or a few gains that relate to our joint ventures and that's really what's driving that year-over-year difference in the other income and expense line.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Is that a one-time thing or should we think about that going forward?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","I would look at that as mainly a one-time thing in the quarter.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","You got it.","Operator","The next question will come from David Beckel with Bernstein Research.","David James Beckel - Bernstein Research","Hey, thanks for the question. I was wondering if you could talk a little about just consumer sentiment. This is another Caribbean question, so sorry about that. But I think some of the concerns around the consumer were with respect to the perception of the quality of the destinations and then maybe not wanting to be in the Caribbean for fear of another bad hurricane season. Are you seeing a turnaround in terms of consumer sentiment at all about the region and the health of the region and have you seen any evidence of hesitance to be in the Caribbean during hurricane season?","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes, David, I think \u2013 and that also comes back to Harry's question about what we would be planning on looking forward.","Last year's hurricane season was unusual on several levels, both the amount of storms, but really particularly the exact places that they went, which were particularly impactful for us. So we had the worst year we've ever had with respect to hurricanes and obviously we're not expecting that to reoccur. But it did have an impact on the consumer sentiment.","It also had an impact, actually, on the forward bookings because we had a period of time last fall where bookings simply essentially dropped for that one \u2013 that period while we were in the midst of the storms and the midst of the immediate aftermath.","And it did begin to recover quite quickly, but then it really did seem to have the kind of impact you're talking about that was more than we anticipated. And so we do think that it has impacted us this year, both -- I think more of the concern would be the destinations be less attractive and also would there be more storms.","I think it took longer to recover, but I think we have now seen, we think, it largely recover, looking forward to lapping that period, which we'll do this fall. But I think you're right, it did take longer, it did have more of an impact, but we think that impact is very much not completely gone, but very much dissipated as of now.","David James Beckel - Bernstein Research","That's very helpful. Thank you. And my second question, I just want to dig in a little bit on your booking curve commentary from earlier. Given the strength that you see in the market today, which obviously investors \u2013 maybe obviously investors don't agree with, why not sort of pull in the curve a little bit and increase prices at this point?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Well, we are \u2013 and the way that our revenue management practices work and we are constantly measuring our booking activity relative to our curves. So I do think we believe that we are optimally harvesting that demand as it comes in. But it is something that we continue to debate, as Richard has said in his comments, that should we, especially around certain categories, push out when we're selling some of this inventory versus bringing more and more of it onto our books earlier, is something that is constantly debated internally.","But I do think that we feel that we are \u2013 it's not perfect, but optimally harvesting the demand that's coming in.","David James Beckel - Bernstein Research","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Hey, Jared.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","I want to ask about the fourth quarter yield guidance is implying about 3.5% growth, that seems like a pretty healthy exit rate of growth going into next year as the comps are easing from the hurricane hangover and as you've called out several times the demand environment still seems pretty strong.","So maybe you can help me just understand if there's any reason why as it stands today that 2019 yield growth can't resemble something similar to 2018, excluding Silversea obviously. And I know you're not prepared to give had any guidance, not necessarily looking for guidance, but I'm just trying to understand if there's sort of anything we should be aware of next year as it pertains to maybe some accelerating supply in the back half of the year or any other one-time things that we need to be aware of.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Well I would, first, I think the 3.4% implied that you're talking about is a little higher than I \u2013 at least my math tells me, but I mean it's somewhere in the ballpark. I think that obviously we're lapping a lot of noise on Q4. We have a little bit more Europe in Q4 and as I think we talked about, China is doing quite well. So I think that stuff that is underpinning our confidence in the fourth quarter.","I think going into the year there's a lot of great tailwinds especially as Edge comes in, which comes in the latter part of the fourth quarter. We have more Symphony in the year and then we have Spectrum and Pursuit coming into the picture. So I think there's a lot of things that are underpinning just on a hardware standpoint, yield growth and we're seeing that certainly in \u2013 in terms of confidence in the first half of the year where we obviously have more on the books than we do in the back half of the year of 2019.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And Jason, I guess just on CapEx, I know you took it up by $2.5 billion. I think $1 billion was for the Silversea purchase, which leaves another $1.5 billion. And I know Silversea has a couple of new builds. But it still doesn't really seem like that should bridge the gap and then obviously FX has weakened, which should help you I would think. So what else is driving that CapEx increase?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes, sure. Sure. Great question. Well, so as you said, there's the $1 billion investment that we made into Silversea. There are two new builds that are on order. And then the balance, which is around $600 million really relates to investments and modernization of our fleet. Technology related investments, investments into the destinations, especially things like Perfect Day that we're planning on investing a little bit more money into. That's really \u2013 and then there's just rounding. These numbers round. So if we trip over $50 million you're rounding up.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","You got it, Jared. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Jaime Katz with Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. The commentary on China sounded pretty positive and you had commented on progress in expanding the distribution network. So I'm curious where you guys are in that process and what are the key steps ahead that you guys are taking to sort of maintain the momentum have you in the market?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Absolutely. First, I mean we're very fortunate that we have a very strong brand, very strong assets and we even add more of that strength in assets when we add Spectrum next year and we have a team that has been there on the ground for a long period of time that's very experienced and what they've been able to do over the past year or two is really diversify the distribution more and more every day, which gives us more ability to manage that inventory and also sell additional products like shore excursions that we weren't able to before.","And then I think obviously we want to continue to evolve that and we want to continue to evolve the destinations that are in that area. And we've been very successful with getting Chinese consumers to sail for longer periods of time to more marquee ports, for example, like Tokyo. That has been quite helpful. And also that team and that market has also focused on being more fly crews.","So all those things kind of combined has put us in a very, I think, enviable position in China for a consumer that really appreciates the brand and appreciates the assets that they're going on and I think that's \u2013 has played out well for us so far this year and as I said, our outlook on 2019, again, while still early in terms of how we're seeing the bookings coming in has been quite positive.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And then on Silversea, I guess what we should be expecting is that at the end of the third quarter we'll have better fourth quarter guidance...","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","...with Silversea embedded in it, so higher yields, higher costs and higher capacity growth than what is currently implied in the press release today.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes, that's right. That's exactly right. We will. You got it.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks. On the Q4 sort of implied guidance, I was going to ask, it looks like the math could be anywhere from sort of a 2% to a 6% increase, but it sounded (48:06) that it would be just the last quarter always is left so wide by the full year range. And so it sounds like maybe you're thinking more kind of the midpoint of that, like the 3% to 4% range. Just wanted to clarify that.","And then also just wanted to clarify, you've mentioned the Silversea interest expense is now in your EPS guidance, but is anything from Silversea in this higher yield guidance or is the higher yield guidance entirely from your existing operations?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Okay, yes. So on the Q4 side, I mean we will obviously guide when it's time. I was just commenting that the 3.4% was a little bit off my math, though I would not in any way point to it being 6% in any way.","Now, as it relates to Silversea, there is \u2013 the only thing that is in our guidance as it relates to Silversea is the $0.06 in earnings impact from interest expense. So that's a \u2013 it's a negative impact to our earnings that's in our guide. There is nothing in our yield, there is nothing in our cost, there is nothing in our earnings, but as I said in my remarks, we do expect that it's going to improve our yields certainly in the fourth quarter and will also elevate our yields for the full year as this is a very high yielding product that will be incorporated into our metrics.","So that's how I would \u2013 there's nothing more to read into that and of course as we add those things, we will \u2013 we typically do provide transparency in terms of what those impacts are.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. So the increase today in second half yields is all from Royal Caribbean core standalone pre-Silversea?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","100%. There is zero Silversea contemplated in any of those numbers.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you for that clarification. Then also just looking at the performance because your EPS has gone up by more than just the midpoint of the yield guidance raise would suggest, and so you called out some of the things, the JV performance. Is there also some of that that's yield-driven with the TUI brand? You mentioned there were gains, but what's happening with the sort of European source demand as well?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah. So in our yield guidance or in our cost guidance, TUI is not consolidated into those numbers, so it's below the line. But what's driving the outperformance on the equity side or the equity pick-up side, TUI is doing \u2013 TUI and Pullmantur are doing very well. And of course those are total European and very nationalistic sourced products. So we're very happy with how they're performing and as I also commented on our broader business, the European consumer is also continuing to show strength for cruise and they're having to compete with the North American consumer mainly for that inventory.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. And then just a final clarification on that. I know there have been questions about European capacity next year, but some of what's going to Europe are kind of like new ships for the German market that are so specific in terms of their passenger sourcing that it seems like to even talk about them in the same breath as other Royal Caribbean product in Europe makes things look I think different than they are in terms of sourcing. Can you \u2013 I don't know if you have in front of you the difference in your European increasing capacity and then how much of that is driven by this very specific nationalist product versus...","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes, I don't have it broken out. We can certainly help do that in terms of nationalistic versus non-nationalistic. But I mean what you said was well-said. There are lots of cruise lines and markets that really do not impact how Royal Caribbean or Celebrity or Azamara trades on a day-to-day basis. We are obviously very happy with how well TUI Cruises is doing, but there is the reality that there is not a passenger on TUI Cruises that sails on Royal Caribbean or Celebrity or vice versa. It's a very focused, nationalistic product that has really found a great niche for itself. But that is \u2013 I think that's exactly right. There's a lot of the supply growth that's in the consideration for the industry that does not really impact us or many of the major players.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","And Robin, just to take the corollary of that, while Europe is growing a lot and some of that is, as you say, really not comparable, within that growth and within when we look at 2019, I think part of the reason that we are feeling so good about 2019 is because some of the unusual products that we now have. So Symphony of the Seas, which we will now have for the full year next year is just a homerun. Celebrity Edge is just performing brilliantly and it comes in at the end of this year but we get essentially 11 months of a new ship that's going in a very different category and everything else. And Azamara Pursuit, which actually just started working this week, is doing extremely well.","So I think there are two factors, even though the total is growing significantly, as you say, part of the growth is non-comparable from a negative side, that is the German or the Pullmantur kind of passenger, but also we have some unique positives that are driving us more than simple normal supply\/demand.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thanks, Robin.","Operator","The next question will come from James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So most of my questions have been answered. Maybe just a couple clarifications. On Silversea, I'm assuming we're not ready to talk about the magnitude of the yield mix benefit on next year, but maybe talk a little bit about the geographic mix impact, if that's meaningfully different than your existing fleet.","And then on the other income side, obviously you don't guide to that number, but you guide to pretty much everything else. So I get to basically a flat other income for the third quarter after a massive increase in 2Q. I guess I don't know if there was any timing, obviously there were big timing shifts in costs. I didn't know if there was any big timing shifts in other income. And I guess, ultimately, did you change the back half guidance for that other income line at all, what's embedded in your full year.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Sure. So one, as it relates to Silversea, I mean we're not \u2013 I mean we closed on this a few days ago and obviously there's Chinese walls that are up during the regulatory process so we will be prepared to talk about that more on the next call. They do have a similar mix in terms of where their guests come from and where our guests come from, even though obviously the Royal Caribbean and Celebrity and Azamara source from probably a few more markets today in which Silversea will certainly be able to take advantage of. So they have a similar mix. But of course on the deployment standpoint, we today go to about 550 different destinations and Silversea goes to over 1,000. So it is a very different product going to very different destinations, which we're very excited about having them part of the family now.","As it relates to other income and expense, we were expecting those in the quarter. They were a little bit better than we had expected them to be and they are not contemplated in the back half of the year. Really what's raising the guidance in the back half of the year is mainly the improvement expectations and revenue helping offset currency and fuel increases.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then I guess just lastly for me, maybe sort of a weird question, but did you learn anything during last year's hurricane season that might change how you would head into this year's hurricane season, whether it's operationally or some of the perception that it seems like you're fighting? Obviously every hurricane season is different, but typically when you overcome a major hurdle there's going to be some learnings that you factor into what you do going forward. I didn't know if we were to see similarly awful hurricanes this year, if the impact would be any less based on any incremental steps that you've taken.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","So, well, we always learn. That's one of the fun things about our business is we learn from every experience, whether it's good or bad.","I think actually we felt our response last year was really ended up being quite good and probably built up a fair amount of goodwill from the way we handled it, and I'm not sure that from a purely financial point of view, we learned much that would significantly change the outcome if you had, again, a hurricane that exactly tracked our ships' itinerary and exactly hit the ports of calls on the days that they would be the most impactful.","So we constantly try and learn and obviously there are always some lessons to be learned. But overall I think we felt that last year we did pretty well.","I do think, though, that people should be impressed with how well the destinations responded afterwards. These were horrific events for them, but now people are reporting back and the travel agents, which are always an important source of information as well as Internet chatter, shows how well they've recovered. And I think that may help us a little bit in terms of assuaging the concern that people had that if they went to some of these destinations afterwards, they would encounter a bad experience and that simply hasn't been the case. So I think if there is a silver lining, it's that people would understand better that the islands do recover more quickly.","On the other hand, if we have another really terrible season, probably that would have a negative simply because what we had last year was so extraordinary and so you wouldn't want to see anything other than that didn't repeat itself.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes and James, I just want to add that everything that Richard said, I mean certainly whether it's perception, whether there were some logistical issues and so forth, because of the storms and \u2013 it is remarkable how well it has recovered and the impact, every dollar to us is painful but we're really talking on the margins here and there really was kind of more the focus on Puerto Rico than on the broader Caribbean or the broader Eastern Caribbean and that was a lot of it because it's tough to get everybody in and out all in one day because a lot of the hotels were taken up by people who were using them as residence. Air fare was a little bit more challenging and that's been restored. With all that was going on and all the impact to the island, I think it is pretty remarkable how small the impact has been on the Caribbean.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","By the way, it actually gives me a chance to comment because the one thing that it did, which wasn't news to many of us, but it really reinforced and demonstrated just how amazing the response of our employees was. The crew, the shore-based people in terms of responding to that did an outstanding job. So your question gives me a chance to say a thank you to them.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes. Okay, we have time for one more question, operator.","Operator","Yes, so the final question will come from Greg Badishkanian with Citi.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great, thank you. So Richard, you gave some color on 2019, greater percent booked for 2019 at higher rate. There were two adjustment factors related to basically cabin and regional mix. The regional mix seemed to be \u2013 you would have to make a positive adjustment to that because you're booking in greater percentage of bookings in markets where you book later. I understand you make the adjustment to that I believe what you said. And then also in terms of a cabin mix, what type of adjustment would you need to make to that. It almost sounds like it's better than the color that you just gave, which was greater percent booked for 2019 at a higher rate. Seemed like it should be more positive in just that \u2013 those comments.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes, so, great, first of all, the two examples I gave were not intended to be specific to 2019. They were just examples why relying too much on this one metric can lead you down a wrong path. In fact, if you recall, in both of the last two Januaries I've said that I thought we may have just from a strategic point of view booked too much in advance and then I thought we were at record levels of bookings in coming year and I didn't expect it to rise and yet it did rise because our revenue management models told us in this environment that was the right thing.","In terms of our making the choice coming back to the first of those two, do we hold back inventory more or less because of what we expect, that's a constant give and take and that's a judgment that our revenue managers make on an ongoing basis. And I didn't mean to be talking about that as it related to 2019.","The other one though, and it's interesting you mentioned it, is a factor for 2019. For example, we do have more short-term bookings which would \u2013 one would expect to book later and, therefore, actually you're right, that would be an even more positive factor in terms of our outlook. So other things being equal, given more short-term capacity, you would expect your bookings to be less than last year because short-term books later.","And so the fact that we are booked more despite that factor could be read, I think, appropriately as even a more positive message there. But I do want to emphasize, I was trying to give examples of the kind of reasons why that single metric shouldn't be looked at by itself, but as one of the cornucopia of information that's available to us as we make our forecasts about the next year.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And if we look out to the first quarter of 2019, price volume, I'm about to use the metric that you say could lead you down the wrong direction, but how does that differ from full year and then maybe differentiate the Caribbean because that's \u2013 you maybe should have easier comparisons or arguably but I \u2013 maybe it could actually be worse if people haven't been booking for the winter at this point, a little nervous about it, so maybe you can give us a bit of color on how that's (65:09).","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes, I won't go into too much detail on the quarter, but I will say that our commentary on the full year very much relates to what we're seeing in the first quarter of 2019 as well.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right. Okay. Good.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Great. Okay. Thank you for your assistance today, Thea, and we thank all of you for your participation and interest in the company. Carola will be available for any follow-ups you might have and we wish you all a very great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Rice, you may begin your conference.","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, Pasha, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; Jason Liberty, our Senior Vice President of Strategy and Finance; and Ian Bailey, Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides which we have posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com. Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Additionally, we will be discussing certain financial measures, which are non-GAAP as defined, and the reconciliation of these items can be found on our website. Richard will begin with his comments. I will follow with a brief recap of our results and give an update on the booking environment in our forward guidance. Adam will talk more about our brands, and then we'll open the call for your questions. Richard?","Richard D. Fain","Thank you, Brian, and thank all of you for joining us today. As you can see from our release this morning, we've had a very gratifying first quarter. It's particularly encouraging that so much of the upside came from better revenue, both ticket and on board. Looking into the remainder of the year, and to the obvious questions, yes, the recent negative industry media coverage has been frustrating. And yes, it's probably impacted us a bit. But no, it's not been a game changer for our brands. And no, it can't be compared to other challenges the industry has faced in recent years.","One possible reason is the very strong support we have received from the travel agency community. They have been effective in communicating the industry's high safety standards, especially to inexperienced potential cruisers, who are apparently the most influenced.","Similarly, I can say that this time, the bad economic news from Europe has not overcome our positive momentum. As a result, despite the headlines and despite the European angst, we have been able to reaffirm our full '13 -- 2013 guidance for both yields and earnings per share. For a while now, we've been talking about the stabilizing platform, the relevant growth, global diversification and flexible sourcing provide. I think both our first quarter results and our outlook validate that this is working to a high degree. We are, of course, seeing gives and takes, as you do in any of the dynamic system, a little stronger Europe, a little weaker Asia, et cetera. But overall, our business is balanced globally, and I'm looking forward to achieving higher prices broadly across our products and source markets.","One area where, I have to admit, I'm not as balanced, in fact, where I'm closer to being euphoric, relates to the recent reveals about Quantum of the Seas. I don't want to steal too much of Adam's thunder, but Quantum is an important new class of vessels for Royal Caribbean International. Last week, we had an extraordinarily successful unveiling of some of the ship's features to the press and to our travel partners. I expected that people would be wowed if they got to see it in person. What I hadn't even hoped for was the overwhelmingly enthusiastic reaction, not only from the media, but from our travel agent partners as well. I would encourage you to log on to royalcaribbean.com and watch our Quantum of the Seas web reveal. I think you'll find it 8, short, well-spent minutes that demonstrate that innovation and exciting returns can coexist harmoniously. Not only will the vessel be unique and innovative, but also be more fuel-efficient. So combined with her compelling scale and rich balcony mix, we expect that Quantum of the Seas will quickly take her place in generating compelling returns for the company. I'll now turn things back over to Brian for a more detailed look at the numbers, and then Adam will take you through a more -- a little more detail on the regional demand patterns he's observing. Brian?","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, Richard. On the second slide, we have summarized our results for the first quarter. We generated net income of $0.35 a share, which was about $0.20 above the midpoint of our guidance. From a business perspective, revenues were about $0.08 a share better than our forecast, but we lost about $0.03 of this is due to foreign exchange. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, were favorable by $0.08, mainly due to timing of marketing expenses. We also saved about $0.02 a share from favorable impact of FX on our expenses. Finally, we were favorable below the line by $0.04, which includes equity pickups from our TUI Cruises joint venture.","Net yields improved 3.6% on a constant currency basis. And I think it is worth noting that our first quarter net yields were the highest we have experienced since 2000, the quarter in which we benefited significantly from the Millennium Cruises.","Both ticket and onboard revenues showed year-over-year improvement, and both came in better than our forecast. The higher ticket yields were driven by Caribbean, Brazil and Asia itineraries. We saw improvement in all categories for onboard revenue. Ship set had been recently revitalized in vessels sailing on new itineraries did particularly well. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, decreased 50 basis points on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned previously, we had some timing shifts, especially in marketing, as our brands slowed spending when there was so much negative publicity surrounding the industry. We believe marketing spend is key to driving higher revenues and expect to invest these savings throughout the balance of the year.","The overall demand environment has been pretty consistent with our overall projections. There have been the usual puts and takes, that Adam will take you through in a few minutes, but as of today, our total booked load factors and booked APDs are higher than at the same time last year. Cumulative bookings since the beginning of the year have been up about 5% over the same period last year. Throughout the WAVE period, booking trends were strong for North America, and European demand really began coming around in early February.","We did experience modest slowdown in Caribbean bookings from North America during the month of March. While some of this can be attributed to the timing of Easter in our WOW sales, we believe much of it was due to the negative publicity surrounding our industry around this time. Over the last few weeks though, we have seen an improvement in booking activity and we are still forecasting record yields for the Caribbean.","I know there has been a lot of commentary in the financial community recently about industry pricing. Our pricing has been more stable this year than last year, and our brands have done a nice job proactively designing promotions that convey the value we offer while controlling dilution to our revenue. Our average lead pricing is currently about 3% higher than the same time last year for sailings departing within the next 12 months. We are also seeing some positive developments with the booking window. On average, our guests are booking their cruise about 2 weeks earlier this year than they were in 2011 and 2012. In fact, the booking curve has looked strikingly similar to 2008 for the last several months.","If you will turn to Slide 3, you will see our updated guidance for the full year. Net yields are expected to increase 2% to 4% on an as-reported basis and constant currency basis. We have lowered our as-reported guidance about 100 basis points due to the stronger U.S. dollar. Our constant-currency yield guidance is consistent with our previous forecast. The negative effects resulting from adverse industry media coverage in March and itinerary changes in Asia, are expected to be offset by favorable performance in the first quarter and a slightly better outlook for European demand.","Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to increase between 2% and 3% on both in as-reported and constant-currency basis. We have included $928 million of fuel expense for the year. Favorable fuel prices and lower consumption are offsetting the negative effects of the stronger U.S. dollar.","Our earnings per share forecast is consistent with our prior guidance and is expected to be between $2.30 and $2.50.","On Slide 4, we have recapped our guidance for the second quarter. Net yields are expected to increase approximately 3% on a constant-currency basis and between 2% and 3% on an as-reported basis. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to increase approximately 3% on both the constant-currency and as-reported basis. And we have included $236 million of fuel expense for the quarter. We expect earnings per share to be between $0.10 and $0.15 for the quarter. I should also point out that we have recently put on some more fuel hedges. We are now 57% hedged for the balance of 2013 and 55%, 40%, 20% and 5% hedged for 2014, '15, '16 and '17, respectively. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Adam for his comments. Adam?","Adam M. Goldstein","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As you have heard, stronger-than-expected ticket revenue, onboard revenue and cost control produced the successful first quarter. Overall, the WAVE period unfolded in accordance with our expectations from a volume and rate standpoint.","We have commented in the past about the global footprint of our primary brands and our ability to move capacity over time towards market opportunities and away from market challenges. This diversification implies we will experience some impact from many causes around the world, but not excessive impact from any one particular cause. Although our capacity distribution will continue to evolve with the margins, our sense is that the current distribution of 44% Caribbean, 27% Europe and just under 30% elsewhere is a beneficial distribution for our business model.","The second positive aspect of our global footprint is of the ability to draw on worldwide sourcing for many for our products. We will have more Americans cruising with us on itineraries away from North America in 2013 than we had expected. Conversely, we will have more guests from outside North America cruising with us in the Caribbean in 2013 than we had expected. Management is now focusing considerably more than we were just a few years ago on how many customers' different source markets will contribute to each product in our portfolio.","Looking at the major cruise regions. The Caribbean got off to a healthy start in the WAVE booking period, ending Q1 performance. As Brian noted, we expect to achieve record yields in the Caribbean in 2013.","Turning to Europe, the company reduced its capacity by 10% in 2013, inclusive of a 24% decline for Royal Carribean International. Going into the WAVE, we considered our European summer revenue projections to have more risks attached to them in comparison to other spheres of deployment. Although there is still some somewhat limited visibility for all of our summer deployment, at this juncture, in Europe, we are sufficiently ahead of 2012 on both rate and occupancy, to be comfortable that our European deployment is of comparable risk to our own other programs.","Turning to China, a region that represents 5% of our capacity in 2013. The hostility between Japan and China surrounding the disputed islands in the East China sea continues to affect our itineraries and our demand generation. We have now removed the Japanese ports of call from nearly all of 2013's North Asia program. As a result, most itineraries from our China home ports of Shanghai and Tianjin are calling only on ports of call in South Korea.","While the market continues to grow in the face of this unfortunate political reality, our revenue yields will not be what they would have been, but for this issue. As I stated last quarter, I certainly hope a reduction of tension emerges in the near future.","Australia is also a region that represents 5% of our capacity in 2013. The Australia market has experienced rapid capacity growth that has resulted in flat to slightly lower yields in 2013 versus 2012. Nevertheless, the market remains a very attractive yielding market in comparison to other deployments regions during the northern winter. It is also a market where both Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises compete well.","Last week, as Richard noted, we introduced many of the primary features of Quantum of the Seas at in event in New York Europe, starring the ship's godmother, Kristen Chenoweth. The news that the ship will be based in New York harbor at Cape Liberty in Bayonne, New Jersey was, of course, received very well there. The most notable feature has also made an impact. These include the North Star, which will lift our guests in a jewel-like capsule to a height of 30 feet above the water, for expansive views of the ship, the ocean and the surroundings. Another feature element is RipCord by iFly, in which our guests will experience the thrill of skydiving. Two unprecedented venues inside the ship are Two70\u00b0, which will be the heart of the onboard experience during the day as a place to hang out. And in the evening, for state-of-the-art entertainment. And then the SeaPlex, which will take the key elements of our popular sports decks and bring them inside and combine them with activities, including bumper cars, rollerskating, a circus school with a flying trapeze and DJ-hosted parties at night. The public reaction to the launch and the media coverage of it exceeded our expectations, and we are looking forward to opening the winter 2014, '15 sailings for booking at the end of May. It was a very exciting for the Royal Caribbean brand, and I congratulate our marketing and public relations colleagues who made the event so special. Brian?","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, Adam. We'd now like to open the call for your questions. We do ask that you limit your questions no more than 2. If you have more, we'd be happy to take them after the call. Pasha?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Brian and\/or Adam, you guys talked about the strength of your bookings, your APCDs, your booking curves, all of that, what you're seeing now, which is impressive. I'm just wondering, how much of that is coming from disenfranchised Carnival customers, either rebooking on your ships because their cruises got canceled or they're just leaving the brand in general. And then also, if the strong metrics you discussed, are they better, equal to or worse than what you expected prior to the Triumph incident? And my second question is just on Europe and what's driving the better-expected European source business there?","Adam M. Goldstein","Felicia, it's Adam. One of the notable and consistent characteristics of our industry is that everybody ships go out full, at least in the -- amongst the major brands and the mainstream part of the industry. And as far as I know, that continues to be the case throughout the industry. We have -- there are many factors that go into choosing a Royal Caribbean Cruise. There is obviously, Carnival and other main brands compete with us everyday, but we have a lot of brand loyalty amongst our own customers, and it's really hard to say what any development related to any one other specific competitor cruise line means for our booking. Our sense is generally, we're doing the business that we do with the types of customers that we've had over time. And we would expect that to continue to be the case, as we go forward. As far as Europe goes, I think with everything that we've read in the news, as Richard was alluding to earlier, it has -- it makes all of us nervous. And when there's very limited visibility to an upcoming season in this year, and we felt the same thing last year, we feel like there's a higher degree of risk attached to our outlook. But as we have experienced the WAVE, and Brian noted particularly, in February, we began to see meaningful demand from our European source markets for the European cruises. And at this juncture, as I mentioned, we feel the risk looking forward to the rest of the summer or fall season is comparable to the risk that we have on other programs. Now Europeans taking European cruises are relatively a later booking -- a closer-in booking phenomenon. And so there's still a lot of activity that remains to be seen. But it looks like the main market, and certainly taking into consideration that we've reduced capacity, as we've mentioned, our booking at a pace that has somewhat de-risked our outlook for this coming season.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. But you didn't see anything in particular driving that. It just perhaps maybe you were concerned and maybe should have been less concerned?","Adam M. Goldstein","Yes, I would say our concern, which I hope you would agree is understandable given the world that we're living in, made us somewhat cautious in our outlook before, but we have somewhat more visibility now and we're somewhat more confident.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And I apologize just because I did speak quickly before, but just wondering of this strong metrics you discussed. Are they better, equal to or worse than what you would have expected before the Carnival Triumph incident?","Brian J. Rice","I think that before the bad press was out there, we were probably running a little bit better than we had expected. March, particularly out of North American demand for the Caribbean, we saw softness. And I think the metrics are now getting back toward where we would expect on a daily basis. I wouldn't say that we made fully made up the bookings that were lost during the month of March. But I think we are getting back in equilibrium now.","Operator","Your next question course of the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just first, what's your expectation for discounting and promoting from the Carnival brand over the next few months, maybe as you talk to travel agents and they have some gaps they have to fill. How do you see playing over the next few months?","Adam M. Goldstein","Greg, we really are not in a position to comment on any one competitor's possible actions or even actual actions. What we do and we -- and I don't know what else one would do because everyday, we feel the demand coming from the market and we take whatever pricing actions, promotions we believe are appropriate for the business that we feel, and that's true across all of our 6 brands, and I'm sure that will be true into the future. And whatever happens, we'll play out, as people try to book us by the phone and by the computer.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. Could I ask you maybe a different way, just industry-wide instead of any specific brand. I mean, do you expect it to be pretty stable or improve or get a little bit worse over the next few months?","Brian J. Rice","Greg, I think, in my comments, I specifically tried to call out where our pricing was because I know there's a lot of reaction in the analyst community whenever they see pricing. And I think it's important to recognize that we compete against different bands. Regionally, we compete with different brands and different itineraries. And I think it's important to look at the whole portfolio. There is -- I've been in the industry for over 25 years and there's always promotional activity out there. And it's very hard when you're looking mainly at North America and you're looking at certain promotions on itineraries to extrapolate that to the whole. And I think you're going to continue to see promotions by us. You're going to see them by our competitors. And I would caution you not to read too much into any one deal as you see it. And as Adam said, our revenue management team is reacting to the demand that we're seeing for our brands, not necessarily what others are doing.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And first-time cruisers versus experienced cruisers, any kind of changes in booking pattern? When would you expect some kind of the first-time cruisers to kind of return to basically normal here in North America, with all the media coverage kind of -- at some point, which I think is going to be pretty soon, just kind of being in the rearview mirror and people kind of moving on in terms of their thoughts and just, I think, kind of forgetting about it?","Adam M. Goldstein","Greg, it's Adam again. First of all, I would emphasize that there has not been a momentous shift in the divisions amongst who's been with us before, who's never been with us before, but have cruised with somebody else, who's on a cruise ship for the first time in their life. When we talk to our best travel agents, the best producers that we have and we were with them in connection with the Quantum event in New York, it is their sense, as it is ours, that negative publicity about the industry at any time, and Richard mentioned this in his opening comment, has a somewhat disproportionate effect on first-timers. Nobody has to cruise. Everybody has choices of what to do. And people who have cruised before, who have personally experienced the dedication to safety that is throughout the industry, and who have seen the procedures and protocols that the cruise industry, marine and hotel personnel go through on an everyday basis, are generally very comfortable with the environment. And if you've never experienced it before, you're more likely to wonder about that. So of course, our job as marketers is to get these people on board, so they're all experienced and they all know. But for now, it will probably have more an effect on potential first-timers. The problem is that people don't call us on the phone to tell us that they're not booking with us. We take the business that is coming to us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just a couple of questions. At one point, you mentioned that costs were well-controlled, but later said that marketing timing was favorable. So does this marketing expense come back later on? Or was it suspended during Triumph? And then -- why don't you answer that and then I'll come back with my follow-up.","Brian J. Rice","Sure, Steve. We had about $0.08 of favorability on costs in the first quarter, most of which was marketing and it was attributable to us. Our brand was going a little quieter during all the bad press, which is something we would traditionally do. We do expect to reinvest that money in subsequent quarters, including a portion of it in Q2. We did save another $0.02 due to FX, and I think that's money that will fall to the top line.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Then separately, given what you're now seeing in Europe that maybe the trends are coming in better, are you rethinking your reduction in deployment in 2014 into that market? I mean, obviously, you just announced it. I know you can't move these things around so quickly, but it does sound like maybe Europe should maybe get rebalanced, and how quickly can you do that? Or can you do that for 2015? Or how are you thinking about it?","Richard D. Fain","We keep watching it, Steve. I think I would emphasize that what we said was, \"It wasn't as bad as we thought.\" And actually, if you had been looking at the press, you would think, \"Oh, it's really actually gotten worse.\" And I think the point we were making was, probably, economically and from an external factors, it has gotten worse. And the point we we're making was that we've overcome those, not so much that it just turned around. So at this stage, we're not looking for a major shift in our strategy, but believe me, we're watching it very closely.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of from Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","My -- I have one question and it relates to Europe again. We have easing comparison is continuing to ease through the month of May. Given last year's Concordia tragedy, shouldn't that, by itself, be helpful if the macro environment is pretty similar to what we saw last year?","Brian J. Rice","Assia, we -- when we gave our original guidance in February, we were counting on some benefit giving the easier comparables. And that was baked into our guidance. And I think what we're saying right now is we feel a little bit more confident about Europe. I think it's -- we're -- a lot of these changes that we're talking about in terms of the performance in the Caribbean, the performance in Europe, is really around the margins. And what we're trying to do is be extremely transparent and tell you where the puts and takes are, but I would caution you not to overread too much into our comments that these are fundamental shifts in demand. We are benefiting from easier comps, and I think we've said that we expect to have yield improvement in Europe this summer.","Assia Georgieva","And that we're currently in a very active booking timeframe for European sailings, given that European passengers do book closer in so it would seem that, at this point versus 10 weeks ago, you would have even greater confidence. I guess, my question is, is your Q3 outlook largely unchanged despite these positive developments on the margin?","Brian J. Rice","Yes, I think we had said back in early February that we were a little less than 50% booked for Europe. And today, we're around 70% booked, to give you some sense of where we are. We're still counting on more business. But the fact that we have maintained our full year guidance, despite the fact that we had a good first quarter, certainly implies that we've taken a little bit of a haircut in Q2 through Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible] over the next 3 or 4 years basically has remained unchanged for the last, I guess, it's been about last 2 quarters. And I know there's been a lot of...","Richard D. Fain","Sorry -- Steve, I'm sorry. We didn't hear the beginning of what you said. You kind of cut in. Can you start over?","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So with your CapEx projections over the next couple of years, those have been pretty flattish over the last 1 to 2 quarters. And I know there's been a lot of concern out there that you guys potentially have to spend more very similar to what one of your competitors has had to done in terms of redundancy plans and things like that. Can you just address that? We have a feeling that your ships are a little bit younger, a little bit -- you've always spent a little bit more on your ships versus some of your competitors?","Richard D. Fain","Steve, like others in the industry, we've got a longstanding practice of investing in redundancy systems, et cetera. And that does include emergency generator capacity. We do, of course, constantly review and whenever there is an incident, we try and learn from it. And so, we have again reviewed our equipment and systems in light of things going on recently. And we think that the CapEx that we normally do already covers everything we will need to do at this point. As you know, we have long a longstanding culture of continuous improvement and that does mean that we're constantly looking for ways to do you a little better. But that has been incorporated into our projections consistently over the years. And so, we don't envision any need to change our CapEx projections at this point.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. Great. And then second question, a little bit bigger-term picture question here with, we've seen some of your competitors, albeit smaller competitors, start to launch their itineraries and launch their pricing a little bit further out than they have in the past with the hopes of getting people to book earlier under the assumption that every couple of months, you're going to see them raise pricing. Is that something that you guys have thought about or is it something you potentially could go towards over the next couple of years?","Adam M. Goldstein","Steve, it's Adam. We certainly have a lot of internal dialogue about the timing of deployment releases, trying to understand whether there's really solid evidence in our history for the -- whether releasing earlier or later is better or worse. And all I can tell about that, because I think this is really competitive in terms of what we actually choose to do, is that we have a lot of focus on this and we pay careful attention to what's happening in the market. And we will release our deployment at the times that we believe are optimal for each of our respective brands. Because our brands have quite different attitudes towards the marketplace, experience different booking curves, and therefore, would have different references as to when to release deployment even within our same company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. Europe, obviously, a nice surprise. I know the weather in Europe was unusually cold this winter, so just wondering if you saw any correlation with where you saw the improvement versus what you expected with the areas where the weather was unusually cold like Germany? And then secondarily, maybe attacking the Carnival question from on another angle, have you done research on how many of your passengers cross shop the Carnival brand, because the price points are very different on Carnival versus Royal Caribbean or Celebrity?","Brian J. Rice","Sharon, I'll take the first part on Europe. I think, generally speaking, Europe as a whole was doing better than we had expected. The markets that I would say we're seeing the most softness in would be, of course, Spain. And then probably secondarily the U.K. would be a little bit weaker than maybe we would have expected. Germany has actually held up quite well for us with -- particularly with our TUI Cruises brand. We're very pleased with it's performance. And then the other markets, in general, seem to be doing well. And I'll let Adam take the second part.","Adam M. Goldstein","I would say, Sharon, that if you lined up the deployment of any of the -- any one major cruise line in this industry against one other one and look at where the deployment tends to overlap, there will be some degree of competition and cross shopping. And that stands the reason because one of the valuable roles that travel agents play in this industry is to give objective advice about the different choices that people have and there are fortunately a lot of choices that the cruise industry presents to the customers. So if you look at where we and one other cruise line have ships in the same place at the same time, there's going to be cross shopping. And what we try to do as marketers is make sure that the travel agents and the customers know the features and the benefits that make us special, and that we believe cause great value on the proposition to the guest. And that will be true wherever we meet up against any particular cruise line in the world. And as you know, we're very confident in the ability of our respective brands to compete against their major competitors at wherever we may meet them.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Can I ask a follow-up?","Richard D. Fain","Sure, go ahead.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I understand your point on deployment, but have you looked at the hotel industry? I mean clearly, there are bandwidths. And people who look at a Four Seasons don't necessarily look at a Hyatt. So even if they're both in Chicago or New York, so, I mean, I respect the answer, but I'm just asking if you have any kind of insight or research on the actual passenger base that cross shops your brands versus Carnival?","Adam M. Goldstein","Well I don't have specific data. One of the things we've always claimed about the Royal Caribbean International brand in particular is that we believe it's the most versatile brand in the industry. It's also one of the 2 largest brands in the industry. So if we're in a popular market, where many of the other brands are, of the big brands, then the so-called other contemporary brands, we will have some degree of competition with, meaning that some percentage of the guests will be choosing between us and other contemporary brands. And at the same time, because Royal Caribbean is fully capable of competing against the so-called premium cruise lines, there will be some percentage of the potential customers weighing our features and benefits against those of the other premium cruise lines. So if you -- in the example that you gave, there are probably some customers who would consider Four Seasons versus Hyatt, but there would be others who would be very loyal to the Hyatt brand wouldn't think about Four Seasons and vice versa. So it really -- really you have to, in my opinion, look carefully at the particular region of deployment, who's there, and then understand what the likely competitive scenario will be, which is of course one of the inputs into how we choose our deployment.","Operator","Your next question comes of the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things, Brian, thank you for the color on Europe with -- that you just gave a couple of questions ago. A little bit more there, have you seen the booking curve further compress versus when you talked to us 3 months ago in Europe? And then, I apologize if you commented on this earlier, I missed the opening part of the call. The onboard spending, can you maybe give us some color? We think we know it's probably the strongest in North America but maybe color by region? And then lastly, any commentary on what you're seeing in the Australia, New Zealand market. I know it's not a huge piece for the industry, but there's been -- the economy has been softening there and there's been quite a bit of capacity growth and that market has grown quite a bit the last several years.","Brian J. Rice","Tim, in terms of the booking window, specifically the Europe, we've pretty much seen an across-the-board expansion of the booking curve. The last couple of months, we monitor this for every market and what is the average cruise that people are booking, how far out. And we've actually seen that expand pretty much across the board, including within Europe. The onboard revenue, it's pretty much across the board as I said, particularly the ships that have had the revitalizations, have done well. And even some of the new deployments have done quite well. It's been in all the different revenue centers. It was pretty much across the board in the first quarter. As it relates to by region, again, we saw an uplift on all ships. I wouldn't call it out as any one region did necessarily better than the other. I do think our brands are learning the new markets better and providing the sort of product offering that guests in some of the newer markets really value and are willing to pay for. And I'll let Adam talk about Australia.","Adam M. Goldstein","1 Tim, so the Australian market has been a very robust fast-growing market. The country, although as  mentioned, maybe at the moment isn't doing as economically well as it has been, the last many years have been exceptionally positive for Australia as a country. And the overall GDP per capita is very favorable compared to even very developed other countries around the world. So that country of 25 million people is clearly able to support a significant amount of cruise activity. And one of the results there's been a lot of capacity going there, both ours and others. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, the results in the near term is flat to slightly lower yield outlook for us for this year. But we feel very strongly and positive about the Australian market. There's a wonderful array of destinations to be visited from cruises originating in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane and Auckland. And we would expect that Australia, as a southern summer market, will continue to grow and be a mainstay of the cruise industry going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes of the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two questions also on Europe. First, it sounds like demand from Europe is positive and more positive than you originally expected. But then your deployments for 2014 it looks like your lowering significantly in Europe. So I just wonder if you could comment on that? And I have another European question as well.","Adam M. Goldstein","Robin, I think demand for Europe -- from Europe has been better than we expected. But I do want to reiterate that our expectations weren't very high. And it isn't -- that it's been such a strong market this year, it's just that we are a little bit pleasantly surprised that although actually the external news has been more negative than we expected, our results are actually slightly better than we expected. So it's more that we've overcome bad news by the momentum of our brands rather than we are suggesting that the market is as strong. So at this point, we're not contemplating changing our basic strategy towards Europe.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, just thinking about Europe and how the mix of your -- where you're sourcing from this year compares to last year, because you mentioned Spain is still weak, UK some softness, and Germany is still strong. So if you're -- if the mix of where you're sourcing from hadn't changed, would you still be expecting demand to be up year-over-year? Like, in other words, I'm trying to get a sense of how much of that is a mix change versus kind of a same-store demand change?","Richard D. Fain","That's an interesting question. You're asking, I guess, to some degree a what-if scenario. I mean, what we are experiencing is that we have, as I mentioned first of all, we have more business coming to our European cruises from other parts of the world. And that's pretty much all other parts of the world -- United States, Asia, South Pacific and Latin America. Within Europe, it's probably somewhat consistent with the macroeconomic picture that we see. There's somewhat more business coming from Northern Europe than from Southern. We've seriously reduced our expectations for the business that we would source out of Italy, France and Spain, I'm speaking for the Royal Carribean International brand. So it's hard to know what would happen if we had done it very differently, if we had deployment arranged differently or if we marketed very differently by country than what we're doing. Clearly, we could have changed the ratio but the ratio that we're pursuing is the one that we believe is optimal for this year's performance.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And so -- and I wasn't necessarily asking you to sort of think about if you're marketing or how that could have changed pricing. But literally, the pricing that you are seeing by -- from those source markets and just would your overall Europe had been up if your sourcing hadn't changed. So you're not actually having to sort of speculate about what might have been but literally, just looking at your pricing by source markets, and if you hadn't changed your mix by source market, would you still be positive year-over-year?","Adam M. Goldstein","Again, I don't have a precise answer to your question. Our pricing by the principal market is generally more similar than different. So changing mix amongst them, I don't think, would have produced a very different result than what we're seeing. And the price support would come from the fact that we have more demand generation from other parts of the world which bolster our ability to take whatever actions need to be taken in Europe itself.","Operator","The next question comes on the line of James Hardiman with Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","I'll continue to beat the dead horse with Europe. And I apologize if you feel like you've touched on this, I did hop on a bit late. But obviously, Carnival saying Europe's getting a little bit worse. You guys are saying it's getting a little bit better. I guess it seems like what you're saying is that maybe your expectations were just lower, is that the biggest delta here or is it maybe a function of geographic mix? Is it the difference in the reporting calendar, where the last month since those guys have reported, things have maybe ramped up in particular? Or do you just think from a market share perspective, you guys are actually gaining share with a maybe fewer brand-specific issues in Europe?","Brian J. Rice","James, I'll take a crack at this one since Adam and Richard haven't closed the door on it. I think it really, I want to emphasize, our view of Europe is really on the margin, and it is slightly better than our expectations were in early February. I think I would emphasize the fact that we are happy that we took 10% of our capacity out of Europe this year. We are dealing with an easy comparable, we think we are in a good place in terms of our capacity relative to what the market condition is right now. Our preliminary plans for next year is that we might have a slight reduction again in Europe, which we hope would give us pricing leverage, which is something we have been criticized a lot for, is putting overcapacity in markets, and I think what we're trying to do is really get the highest pricing we can in -- for our whole portfolio. We are excited about new markets, we're doing well in the Caribbean. We're going to have record yields this year. Asia, with the exception of the current tensions with Japan, seems a very promising market for us. So we may allocate a little more inventory to those markets at the expense of the capacity for Europe. But it really is trying to optimize the portfolio. And I think, again, we view Europe as slightly better than we did 3 months ago, but we're not read to declare victory there and say that, that is the new treasure chest of the industry.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. And then talk a little bit about the support that you're getting from your travel agents. I think in your prepared marks, you said that things could have gotten ugly had it not been for some of that support. Do you think that support has been disproportionately in your favor, particularly post the Triumph incident? Obviously, you guys are going to be extremely hesitant to use any other cruise line's misfortunes in your favor in terms of any communications that are coming from you. But anecdotally, do you think that's happening at the travel agent level? Are they sort of pushing more customers in your direction? And I guess just bigger picture, talk a little bit about commissions paid to travel agents, it's not entirely even depending on the geography, a lot of these guys are getting paid bigger commissions from you versus maybe some of the other -- some of your other competitors. Just talk about your strategy with commissions with regards to the travel agents?","Richard D. Fain","Okay. I'll try and take the first part of that and I'll ask Adam to respond on the question on the level of commissions. First of all, I certainly hope -- I mean, we put a great deal of effort into getting the travel agents to push people towards our brand all the time. And we've done that for years. We have a very strong program of trying to provide support to the travel agent community. We have always believed and continue to believe that travel agents are an important distribution system that helps differentiate products. And we believe that we have very powerful relationship with them and the awards, I think we've probably won the most awards from travel agents. And of course, we do everything we can to continue to differentiate ourselves. But one thing the industry doesn't do is compete on the basis of safety or environmental protection or other things. And that isn't terribly constructive, I think the entire industry is focused in the same direction. So I believe that we -- I do believe the industry agencies, travel agent industry, the community, is important in helping qualify potential cruisers, helping them understand the advantage and value of cruising, and I think the travel agent community is, and has been, particularly helpful in times when there is misunderstanding in the world. And right now, there's been a lot of misunderstanding in the world, and I think exaggerated media reports and others, which they have helped clarify, particularly for, as I mentioned earlier, the first-time cruiser, who I think may have the most misconceptions about cruising. And that's true of the misconceptions about cruising in terms of safety, but also inclusive of how enjoyable it is and what kind of value it is. So I think the travel agent can really explain that to people, who otherwise wouldn't know. And I think that has continued to be the case. I think we will continue to push hard to differentiate ourselves and to make sure that all travel agents know, as I believe, that in every single category of cruising, we would try and be a winner. But that's on the standard process and I think their support for the industry, as a whole, remains unchanged. And I think they've served a very powerful and helpful role in that regard not only for us but for everybody. And I'll ask Adam to address the commission level part of the question.","Adam M. Goldstein","Thank you. So the relationship that we have with the travel agency distribution system that Richard described is both a source of great pride to us and is consistently reflected in the feedback from the travel agents, including as I mentioned just the other day when we were we our top travel partners at the time of the Quantum of the Seas reveal. Having said that, clearly, that relationship is predicated on us giving competitive compensation to them for producing for us. They're all in this business for profits as well as we are. And if they don't feel that we're giving them a fair shake on compensation, they may love us and our products, but they're going somewhere else. So -- and also, they're always asking for more compensation, which you can't blame them for doing. The shareholders -- our shoulders, are typically wondering if there's some way that we can pay them less compensation, but you can't blame the shareholders for asking that either. But it's our responsibility to navigate the right balance, reflecting the value -- the great rate value that they contribute to the success of our business model, neither underpaying nor overpaying. And I would point out that the foundations of travel agency compensation over a good number of years now are much more stable than unstable. It's pretty clear what the building block elements of travel agency compensation are, and it's pretty clear that travels agents are willing to produce good business for us with the existing components of their compensation.","Operator","Your next question so the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I think it would be a good opportunity to discuss the design of your ships and some of the differences between yours that give you confidence that you won't run into the same issues that Carnival has, whether it's power loss, backup generators, fire suppression. If you could give us your sense of what the difference in design is?","Richard D. Fain","This is Richard, and I can't really make comparisons. I don't know enough about what others do. I can only refer to what we do, and safety and comfort of our guests has always been the sine qua non to us, and I believe, to the entire industry. And I don't think we're, at all, alone in that. I think we all try. One of the things that I would emphasize is there is no such thing as perfect safety. There is such a thing as perfect dedication to safety and we strive towards that every day. We have tried to build into our systems multiple redundancies, and that includes all the kinds of things you've talked about. But I guess I would also say that when people -- you talked about the cost of our ships, actually usually when we have conversations about the cost of our ship, they focus around the wow features that we have on board our vessels. And as both Adam and I talked about earlier, the Quantum of the Seas launch in New York is probably the most recent example of the amazing concepts that our building team has come up with. But at the same time, I don't think it's a coincidence that the man who oversees our new building projects, and has for many years, previously headed up our safety and security department. And that's Harri Kulovaara, and he's very focused on that. And while it's true that redundancies like the ones we're talking about do increase the cost of a vessel's design, we believe those investments are well worth making.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Well, maybe there's a follow-up that I can ask, which is there anything about your design specifically that reduces the probability that you would see one of your ships dead in the water and guest services reduced to a bare minimum?","Richard D. Fain","Well, I think all of us in the industry work very hard to that objective. And I think it's important to notice that the industry and ourselves have an amazing safety record, that what you have seen recently really is a historical anomaly. And that the industry performs thousands of cruises normally without a problem. And recently, we did have obviously a very well-publicized number of events. But I think it's fair to really emphasize that we're all working to minimize the chances of that and in an ideal world, it would be brought to 0, but there's no such thing as a 0 probability of anything. So I do think we do work at it and I think I'm proud of the devotion to safety that Harri and his team exemplifies and our Marine departments exemplify. And I expect that, that will continue as we move forward.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Let me then move on to my second question, which is related to your annual guidance. Very strong outperformance in the first quarter due to incremental cost in the second quarter. Probably some of that first quarter benefit goes away, but still net-net-net, you have the opportunity to take your guidance up for the year by $0.05 or $0.10, and I'm curious what's out there that would keep you from having taking your annual guidance up?","Brian J. Rice","Harry, I think it's a combination of, if you look at the first quarter, we had about $0.08 of favorability in revenue and we had about $0.08 in cost savings. We believe that, and we had $0.04 below the line. The combination of the $0.08 of revenue, the $0.04 below the line, we think, is being offset by some of the deterioration that we saw during the month of March. And that the cost is really just the timing shift of the marketing. We have a pretty wide range out there still with revenues of 2% to 4%. That's about $120 million spread and we have 100-basis-point spread on cost. And just when we summed it all up, we thought we should maintain our guidance. So it's a little bit softer in Q2 through Q4.","Hasha, I think we have time for just one more question, please?","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you guys talk about CDF and Pullmantur and maybe where those brands performed relative to the rest of the business in Europe?","Richard D. Fain","Sure. As I think we have made clear and over time, the Spanish economy is something less than robust, by coincidence, this morning, they just announced yet another increase in the unemployment rate to 27%, an almost unheard of rate. And so, of course, Pullmantur's performance is inevitably affected by that very strongly and that's been a big disappointment, and I don't see any quick turn away from massive improvement given the economic situation. However, Pullmantur has done a very good job, I think, in, a, dealing with an extraordinarily difficult economic operating environment and in diversifying itself away from Spain into other Latin countries, particularly in South America. You also asked about CDF, Croisieres de France, and that's actually a quite good success story. It started small and we've had a significant -- a very significant increase in our capacity this year. Jason, what's the capacity increase in France this year, in percentage terms?","Jason Liberty","It increased about double.","Richard D. Fain","Yes, so it almost doubled as we put in a much larger ship and yet, we're still getting higher yields there than last year having doubled the capacity. So the French, the CDF, Croisieres de France situation is actually doing quite well for us and we would expect to continue to expand that to take advantage of a good market position.","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, and we'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today as usual. Ian will be available throughout the day if you have any follow-ups. And we wish everyone a good day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"19045":["Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

And welcome to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Limited First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]","It now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Jason Liberty, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason Liberty","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call.","Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, our President and Chief operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carol Cabezas, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides which have been posted on our Investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filing and other disclosures.","Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.","Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview of the business. I will follow with a recap of our first quarter results, provide an update on the booking environment and then provide an update on our full-year and second quarter guidance for 2016. We will then open up the call for your questions. Richard?","Richard Fain","Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everybody. It is a pleasure to have the chance to provide more color on the quarter and to talk about our direction going forward. Internally, we start almost every meeting talking about the Double-Double and I'm going to follow that practice here as well. Obviously, it's gratifying to report results that are so much higher than we have ever enjoyed in any winter quarter in our history and that naturally strengthens our confidence in our ability to reach these targets.","As a reminder, our Double-Double program established targets to double our 2014 earnings per share and to reach double-digit ROIC by 2017. That means earnings per share next year in excess of $6.78 and ROIC of 10% or better. The results that we're reporting today not only bring us closer to those goals, but they also demonstrate how powerful our brands are and how well they are doing.","As gratifying as today's results are, I should also reiterate that we manage our business and we assess our performance on an annual basis not on a quarterly one. We always have pluses and minuses affecting different seasons and different itineraries. In today's case, we are in the happy position that just about everything in the quarter that could have gone right did. Ticket revenue was stellar, onboard revenue was terrific, cost were well controlled and even below the line items helped.","While it's impossible to isolate out some things, it is interesting to note that strong, last minute demand helped our bookings at the same time while we were simultaneously enforcing our price integrity program. It's very validating to me that we saw such strong close-in demand for products like the Caribbean, despite our program designed to eliminate last minute discounts.","A key driver of our future success continues to be the success of our executional efforts. Execution is everything and it is going very well indeed. Our brands are firing on all cylinders, costs are well controlled and our new ships are getting rave reviews. As a result, our guests are coming back in ever-increasing numbers and we're raising the demand from those who have never cruised before.","I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the men and women at Royal Caribbean, at sea and on land, who are working so hard and so well every single day. The key to the Double-Double and the key to our success beyond Double-Double is our ability to execute at the highest level. We are indebted to all of them for doing so.","Of course, as always is the case, some markets do better than others. This year we've seen particularly good results in the U.S. markets. We've seen some weakness in the Mediterranean sailings but strength in the Caribbean, Baltic and Alaska. China continues to be one of our great success stories and now represents 9% of our capacity. The market there has received the Royal Caribbean international brand exceptionally well and that market continues to grow at extraordinary rates. Brand image is particularly important in China and we have been very pleased with the exceptional position Royal Caribbean has earned there.","Total industry capacity in China over just the last two years has more than quadrupled. That's an extraordinary amount for any market to absorb. Against that background, the fact that our yields have held up there as well as they have is powerful evidence of the scale of the opportunity.","Now, in 2017 and 2018 industry capacity growth drops to only about 50% per year and that gives us further comfort about the future there. Most importantly, I believe our unique strategy in China is working very well. Firstly, we have brought to the market the best ships, the biggest, the baddest and the newest. The Chinese appreciate that we have acted so positively towards their country and that has enabled us to establish an unusually strong first mover advantage.","Secondly, we have worked hard to educate and assist the distribution system there. We haven't just taken advantage of existing channels, but we've actively worked to make them more successful. We have the largest team in China dedicated to training and supporting the distribution system. That helps the travel agents be successful, it helps them sell our product.","Lastly, we have aggressively invested in ways to link us more directly with the end consumer and help establish a deeper connection with our guests. All of this has enabled us to communicate successfully what makes Royal Caribbean better, different and special.","A few weeks ago, we took delivery of Ovation of the Seas and in two weeks, we will take delivery of Harmony of the Seas, extraordinary. Ovation is simply magnificent. The reaction has been overwhelming to her numerous innovation such as RipCord by iFLY; VOOM, the fastest Internet at sea; the amazing lounge, 270, and 18 restaurants which our guests can choose amongst.","The Chinese public appreciate the Royal Caribbean took the lead in bringing new hardware to China and Ovation will be the first cruise ship to be named thereby the very famous singer, actress, Fan Bingbing. Delivery of Harmony of the Seas in two weeks should be just as exciting, albeit on this side of the world. She builds on the incredible success of our Oasis series of ships and she's one of the most anticipated new ships of the year.","Lastly, in June, we are very excited to be taking delivery of TUI Cruises' newest ship, Mein Schiff 5. TUI Cruises continue to perform exceptionally well in the German market and this vessel will add to its success.","Before I turn the call back to Jason, there is one last item I wish to cover. For a company to be successful in today's world, it's important that we not only do it right but we also do the right thing. At Royal Caribbean, ethical leadership is an important part of our worldview. It is something that matters to our people but it is a different metric to measure.","Fortunately, there is an organization called the Ethisphere Institute and it was organized specifically for the purpose of encouraging good corporate stewardship. I am therefore extremely pleased that Ethisphere recognized Royal Caribbean in 2016 as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies. We value this honor and we intend to continue following our mantra of continuous improvement.","With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call back to Jason. Jason?","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Richard. I'll begin by talking about our results for the first quarter. Unless I state differently, all metrics will be on a Constant Currency basis. Our first quarter results are summarized on slide two. Adjusted earnings were $0.57 per share, nearly double our guidance of $0.30 and almost triple Q1 of 2015 results.","Net revenue yields are up 7% for the quarter approximately 300 basis points higher than our guidance. This past quarter results were exceptionally good driven by continued strength in both ticket and onboard revenue as well as a weaker dollar and better fuel prices.","On the ticket side, strength in North America resulted in significantly better-than-expected close-in demand and pricing for the Caribbean. Onboard revenue was up 8.7% for the quarter. While we saw a year-over-year improvements in most key onboard revenue areas, beverage and Internet led the majority of the outperformance.","Cost for the quarter were in line with guidance. As we discussed on our last earnings call, cost metrics for the first quarter were expected to be higher year-over-year driven by investments in China, timing of marketing and additional dry-dock days. Below the line, we saw continued outperformance from our equity investments. During the quarter, lower fuel prices and a weaker dollar contributed approximately $0.08 to the improvement.","As previously discussed, we eliminated Pullmantur's two-month accounting lag during the first quarter 2016. The negative impact to earnings of $0.10 per share was in line with the guidance provided on our last earnings call. This represents the results from November and December of 2015 and has been adjusted out of the company's key metrics.","Now, I will turn to the demand environment for the balance of 2016. During our last call, we shared that WAVE was off to a good start. This trend continued through the first quarter and certainly contributed to our strong yield performance in Q1. We are now approximately 80% booked for the year with both load factor and pricing at a similar level at the same time last year. When adjusting for China, which is a much closer-in booking environment, we are ahead in both volume and rate for the balance of 2016.","Additionally, our guests continue to plan their vacations further out. Over the past quarter, our booking window has extended even further and is at its highest levels yet. Our product mix in the back half of the year is weighted more towards the Caribbean and high yield in China itineraries than it was last year, and we also have less exposure to the weaker Latin America market.","Q3 and Q4 include the full benefit of two newbuilds entering the fleet. In May, Ovation of the Seas will begin her 53-day repositioning sailing to her new home in Tianjin, China. Harmony of the Seas will be in the Mediterranean this summer before repositioning to the Caribbean in early Q4.","The China market is highly anticipating the arrival of Ovation of the Seas in Tianjin at the end of June. Overall, trends for China are within our expected range, albeit at the lower end for sailings from Shanghai. That said, we've sold a higher percentage of China inventory over the past three months than we sold during the same period last year.","As a whole, the portfolio is still expected to deliver yields significantly above the average and continues to command a significant premium in the China market. Our winter 2016-2017 Australia sailings have seen strong early demand at rates that are similar to last year, despite continued capacity growth in the market.","Moving to Europe. Demand for Mediterranean sailings has been strong, particularly from European points of sale, and load factor is ahead of last year. However, recent geopolitical events did have an impact on booking volumes in the United States. While bookings have now returned to typical levels, we had to lower pricing and shift sourcing to recover the volume lost during the initial lull in demand.","Our global presence enabled us to quickly adjust our sourcing activities, but our rate has been impacted since North American consumers typically pay more for our European cruises than guest sourced more locally. As a result, we have lowered our yield expectations for these itineraries. Outside of the Mediterranean, European business is far more encouraging with volumes and rate both in a good position for the Baltics.","North American base products account for just over half of our 2016 capacity and are proving to be another bright spot this year.","As I mentioned, we did see a softening in demand for Europe cruises following the events in Brussels. However, overall demand for cruising from North American consumers remains extremely strong, and our Caribbean, Alaska and Bermuda itineraries are each poised to have a strong year and generate nice yield improvements.","The Caribbean performed extraordinary well in Q1, and the balance of the year is also in a strong book position. There is particularly strong interest in Harmony of the Seas, which begins her sailings in the Caribbean during the fourth quarter. Alaska and Bermuda are booked nicely ahead of same time last year in both occupancy and pricing. Anthem of the Seas will sail to Bermuda from Cape Liberty throughout the summer and is receiving strong demand at superior prices, and we are also trending towards a record-yielding Alaska season.","If you turn to slide three, you will see our updated guidance for full year 2016. Net revenue yields are expected to grow 2.5% to 4%, an increase relative to previous expectations. This guidance incorporates the robust Q1 performance, partially offset by a reduction in expectations for the Mediterranean.","As is always the case, performance will vary a bit across products and by quarter. But on the whole, the balance of the portfolio is relatively on par with previous expectations. From a cost perspective, we are anticipating net cruise cost excluding fuel to be up approximately 1% which is slightly higher than previous expectations driven mainly by the delay in the start date of Empress of the Seas.","We anticipate fuel expense of $734 million for the year and we are 65% hedged. Since our last earnings call, fuel prices have modestly increased while the dollar has weakened relative to our basket of currencies. The combination of these two factors is contributing approximately $0.15 to our full year earnings of which $0.08 was realized in Q1.","Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $6.15 to $6.35, $0.25 higher than the previous guidance. The $6.25 midpoint represents a 33% improvement in earnings per share, further strengthening our position to reach Double-Double next year.","Before we discuss second quarter guidance, I would like to give you an update on our $500 million share repurchase program. As of this call, we have repurchased $450 million in shares under the current authorization leaving $50 million which will be spent opportunistically this year. We remain focused on improving shareholder returns and we will remain balanced between those efforts on our target to obtain an investment-grade rating.","Now we can turn to our guidance for the second quarter, which is on slide four. We expect net revenue yields used to be up approximately 1% for the second quarter. There are several factors limiting yield growth for the quarter. While booking volumes for the Mediterranean have recovered since the attacks in Brussels, promotional activities were necessary to stimulate demand for closer-in sailings. These weaker trends of the Mediterranean are having a disproportionate impact especially in the second quarter.","From a structural standpoint, there is a drag on Q2 yields from the high-yielding Holy Week sailings which took place in March this year versus April last year. Also, we are introducing two new ships during the quarter which involve a ramp up of occupancy and a lower yielding long positioning sailing. As a result, we expect yield growth to be smaller in Q2 than in the back half of the year.","Net Cruise Costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up approximately 2%. Based on current fuel prices interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be approximately $1.","With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian of Citi.","Gregory Badishkanian","Great. Thank you. Just first question with respect to the strength in the North American itineraries, Caribbean and Alaska. How much of that do you think is \u2013 you said the close-in bookings were very strong but you didn't discount heavily like you've done maybe in the past. So how much of that is due to passengers who otherwise would have went to Europe are staying at home versus maybe improved marketing or they were just waiting for these discounts, they never came, so they decided to book anyway?","Michael Bayley","Hi, Greg, it's Michael. Good question. I think it's difficult to pinpoint one of these different elements. But I think it's a combination of several factors. Certainly, some of the softness that we see in Europe, I think, the Caribbean is the beneficiary of that. A lot of the Americans that previously were planning on going to Europe are now going to the Caribbean. So that's great. They're also going to Alaska.","We've got great hardware in the Caribbean and the American market this year. So we've moved some of our ships around with Anthem in New York and Harmony in Port Canaveral in the fourth quarter with Allure in Port Canaveral, Oasis in Port Canaveral, Liberty that we've just revitalized sailing out of Galveston. So I think the combination of the quality of the brands, the hardware, some of the softness in Europe has really buoyed up the demand from the American market for the products in the Caribbean.","Gregory Badishkanian","And just on China, if you look at kind of apples to apples or comparable sailings, how comfortable are you? I know you probably expect a bit of degradation due to all the capacity coming in, but how comfortable and how in line are those with what you've been kind of expecting, let's say, even if you go back to last year?","Michael Bayley","Yeah. I think \u2013 it's Michael, again. I think we had said that we had an expectation that China yields would be down in 2016 versus 2015. And we just finished the first quarter, and everything came in as we expected for this first quarter. So we're feeling quite comfortable that we will come in against our expectations.","Gregory Badishkanian","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And just one final on Cuba. What do you think the opportunity is for Royal to take advantage of that market and maybe potential timing of benefits?","Michael Bayley","Yeah. I think, obviously, we've been watching all of the news, and we've been doing our own planning. I think the opportunity will be good for Royal when everything opens up appropriately, and we're planning to do just that. But I think it's going to be an interesting opportunity for us. It will be great for our customers, our guests and travel partners. I don't think it's going to have a massive material impact on our overall business. It will just be very positive for us.","Jason Liberty","Just one quick overall. We're going to try to limit the questions to one or two questions. There is a lot of question or individuals in the queue to ask questions. So if we can try to manage it to one or two that would be great.","Gregory Badishkanian","Great. Thanks.","Jason Liberty","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Milota of JPMorgan.","Kevin Milota","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Two questions here for you. First, onboard, just give us some more color on \u2013 obviously, you called beverage and internet. But is the trend that you experienced here in the first quarter something that we can look to continue in the second, third and fourth quarters? That being first and then second, on Shanghai, you called that out in your China commentary. Maybe, give a little more color on what you're experiencing in China to take that down to the bottom end of the range? Many thanks.","Jason Liberty","So, on the onboard side, I think, this general trend is something that we do continue to expect to see. Obviously, an 8.7% growth is wonderful, and I don't think we expect that same level of rate going forward because there are some year-over-year comps that become more challenging. But I would say that the brands are adding a lot more to the offering. They're doing more on a pre-cruise sales perspective.","On the Internet side, there will be more and more Royal ships that will have VOOM, as we go into Q2 and beyond. And also in the first quarter, Celebrity introduced Xcelerate, that's with an \"X,\" which is not to the same level as VOOM but is far superior to the Internet capabilities relative to the competitive set. So I think overall the trends \u2013 and we've had several years now, positive trends should continue.","Michael Bayley","Hi, Kevin. On the question on Shanghai, I mean, obviously we look at China typically everybody looks at it as one market but really, of course, it's three markets it's the North and it's the South and it's Shanghai and we have presence in all three of those regional markets. Shanghai is the biggest market for us. I think it's about 50% to 60% of our total China business. Capacity is up in the Shanghai market in 2016, quite a lot. I think what we are seeing there and we've talked about that is we expect yields to be down moderately and that's certainly true and in Shanghai that's what we are seeing it's a little bit towards the lower end of the range that we expected.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski of Stifel.","Steven Wieczynski","Hey. Good morning, guys. So first question I guess, if you go back to \u2013 If I look at your commentary from the fourth quarter about your booked load position for non-China itineraries, it seems like based on your commentary today, those itineraries have gotten a good bit better, is that a pretty fair statement?","Jason Liberty","Yes, Steve. I think that's the booking environment \u2013 so first, just to kind of tee it up, is two-thirds of our capacity growth this year is going into China, which is a much closer-in booking environment. So the year-over-year comp is a little bit more challenging because you have more of a closer-in environment in your mix. When you take that out as you said, even going into the fourth quarter call, as well as what we have seen through WAVE, we have seen strength and we are in a very good booked position on both the load factor and APD basis.","Richard Fain","Stephen, it's Richard. If I could add one comment on that, I think it's important to understand that we have a fair amount of flexibility in terms of managing that to the level that we want it to be. And last year and this year, we really had record levels of capacity booked at this time and at the end of last year.","And as a practical matter, we probably don't want to have much more than that. And so that's a revenue management question. A lot depends on how we're managing our price integrity program, how we expect bookings to be in the later period. So it's not only an indicator of how strong demand is, it's also something that we manage to get to a level that we want.","So going forward I wouldn't really expect us to be looking for higher levels of capacity booked than we've been seeing over last year and this year.","Steven Wieczynski","Okay, thanks. And appreciate the commentary. Then second question, I don't know if you'll be able to answer this but in terms of the Easter shift and Holy Week, how much \u2013 I know there's a way to quantify how much that benefited 1Q and then how much is it taking out of 2Q in terms of yields?","Jason Liberty","Yeah, Steve, I would, it's approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points that would swap from one quarter to another. And also the strength that happened in the first quarter was really across the entire quarter. It wasn't necessarily isolated to one this Holy Week sailings. So I think that's just something else I wanted to point out that it was close-in strength for really all North American products during that quarter.","Steven Wieczynski","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Jason Liberty","You got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Thanks a lot. Jason, as we think about the second half, I know this isn't really necessarily a time when you give guidance for third quarter, but just given some of the misunderstandings about the second quarter, I was just wondering if you could help us understand the cadence of the quarters for third and fourth quarters, because I think if you look at consensus now it looks like it's kind of evenly split. And then \u2013 and for your yield guidance for the remainder of the year, how much of that is coming from your new ships and how much is coming from the core?","Jason Liberty","Okay. So, cadence-wise as it relates to Q3 and Q4 and I think taking into account some of our commentary around the Med, you guys should consider that Q4 should be higher than Q3 as it relates to the cadence.","And also take into account that we're going to have much more Caribbean product mix in the fourth quarter and we talked about the strength of North American market and the book position that's relative to that.","As it relates to the core, I would say the majority of the yields growth, well, I would say majority meaning greater than 50% of the yield growth is coming from the new hardware that's coming online in the back half of the year. And I do want to stress the back half of the year because though Ovation is now in our environment and Harmony will be in a couple of weeks, those ships do take some time to ramp up and also reposition.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. So the fourth quarter sounds like normally seasonally not stronger than the third, but just given what's going on now that is what we should see.","Jason Liberty","That's right.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then, my next question for Michael on China, and this is a bigger picture question, but I think almost every investor meeting I have I get asked this question so I think it's worth addressing. I was just wondering if for a moment you could talk about the company's commitment to region and the industry's commitment to the region because there is a lot of investor concern that if pricing doesn't remain its premiums or pricing comes down, we all know with the supply coming on, will the cruise lines back off on their commitment to the region and ultimately could it effect the supply\/demand balance that the industry is facing today elsewhere. So I was just wondering if you could talk about how you're thinking about the China investment and is there a realistic scenario where that commitment changes?","Michael Bayley","Yeah. I think it's a great question we've been in the China market now for nearly nine years we've been investing in the market, building distribution, building our sales presence, building our relationship, and more importantly, building the brand, and building a good customer base.","And I think, as we've said, previously, we've done very well in the market in terms of being the recipient of the best cruise line for eight years in a row, the recipient of the best premium cruise line. So we've done a lot of work in building the brand. I think there's this question about supply and demand then, of course, distribution. When you look at supply, obviously, we tend to get at times anxious because more capacity is coming into the market. But I think really the question is, is how much demand is in the marketplace. What we see, if you look at just the sheer size of the outbound market in China, it's the largest outbound market in the world that has been growing at an incredible rate.","Cruise as part of that outbound market is really quite tiny, it's relatively small. We believe that the opportunity for cruise is quite significant in terms of the long-term development and that's why we've been in the market for 9 years. So we are quite optimistic about the future of China as a marketplace and I think we have been quite careful and strategic about the decisions that we have made. I think when we introduced Quantum last year that was really proved to be a successful decision. Customers come into the travel agents and request Quantum, request Ovation and request Royal Caribbean. So our commitment is quite strong to the development of China in the future as a marketplace.","Felicia Hendrix","And as you think about your profitability there, which you have said before is on a per passenger cruise day basis higher than the rest of your regions, when you think about the profitability aligned with the premiums that you are seeing now, where would that breakeven level be?","Michael Bayley","Well, I don't think I could answer that question specifically. I think it's true that China continues to trade at the high end of the ticket yield range and deliver high onboard revenue yields and our Chinese sourcing delivers high profit and returns against all of the global markets. So we feel that that opportunity is very good.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Nomura.","Harry Curtis","Hi. Good morning. There has been some discussion about the positive impact that we are seeing from the net effect of FX and fuel, but to what degree are the results this year, particular the cost, somewhat more elevated than they are going to be next year. You are being penalized because of the 50-plus day shift of Ovation, also the delay of Empress. To what degree are there higher costs that you are just not going to see next year?","Jason Liberty","Hi, Harry, I think on the cost side, as we talked about over the long run here, we are managing these costs, I think in a very effective way and certainly a factor in our progress towards the Double-Double target. I don't think that there are specific one-off costs in this year that exist. I think that most of the cost growth that you are seeing relates to things, as an example, would be like the Internet. Putting VOOM or Xcelerate on our ships, there is a cost to that. Improving our footprint, which we will continue to do in China, there's a cost to that. So I don't think that there is something that is specific to this year. I think it's just more in general that this is the investment cost to grow our business.","If you look at over the past three years, our cost on average have been basically flat and I think that's been pretty strong result. But I think, going forward, they're going to be cost that we have to manage, for example, like improving marketing in order to improve yield.","Harry Curtis","Moving on to the second question, with no new ship deliveries next year, what's a reasonable level of cash that should be returned or could be returned to shareholders next year?","Jason Liberty","I think, obviously, capital return is something that will be a discussion with our board. We clearly want to be in a position to balance investing in our growth, which is pretty well planned, being an investment-grade credit and then you are providing capital returns to our shareholders. And I think for us we want to get through the authorization, the $500 million authorization that we still have $50 million left to do and I'm sure we will address that in the future as those decisions are taken.","Harry Curtis","So it's reasonable to think that you're not going to stop at the $50 million left?","Jason Liberty","I would say that it's reasonable to think that our management team and our board will be considering that dividends and share buybacks are mechanisms to return capital to shareholders.","Harry Curtis","Okay. Thanks, Jason.","Jason Liberty","You got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo.","Tim Conder","Thank you. First of all, congrats on managing through a lot of moving parts along the way. But I'm going circle back to China here, Adam, Jason or Richard, can you just sort of give us your color on what your net yield range is for China on year-over-year and maybe break that down into the like-for-like itineraries versus the impact of more year around capacity and clearly adding shoulder periods which pulls that average down?","Jason Liberty","Yeah. We don't give specific guidance on our Net Yields in the market but, as Michael commented, it is certainly a significant premium to our fleet average as well as a significant premium to the marketplace there today. We also commented on the fourth quarter call that we expected yields to be down in China and we still expect that.","And as Michael commented I think the only kind of pressure point has been Shanghai, where there has been a lot of capacity in place. But I think that people should look at China as well as Asia in total. It's a market that the average yield is higher than the average and as we add more capacity in, that improves our revenue and that improves our profitability and that's how you should see us continuing our strategy.","Tim Conder","And then net profitability, Jason, again to clarify from prior question is given that on the yield side, is it higher than the balance of the world, is that fair to assume?","Jason Liberty","On a return perspective?","Tim Conder","Yes.","Jason Liberty","Yeah. No, it's both on yield and on returns. It's certainly higher than the average.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then could you expand on your comments about connecting more directly with the Chinese consumer? And then, lastly, how should we think about the cadence of the new ships from Mein Schiff coming in and the impact there on the income from TUI in particular below the line?","Jason Liberty","Hi, Tim. I can talk about how we have been connecting with the customer in China. One of the things that we have been doing is investing more in the consumer marketing direct to customer. So, for example, this year we launched a television campaign in Tianjin and Shanghai with a dedicated Chinese TV commercials and what have we've been spending more time just talking directly to the consumer.","And, of course, over time we've literally built up a loyal database of customers who have sailed with this and they are great advocates for the brand. And, of course, they talk about Royal Caribbean in the marketplace. So it's a gradual process and it's a process we've been engaged in for some time and we will continue to invest in.","Tim Conder","And then TUI?","Jason Liberty","Sorry, Tim. What was the question on TUI?","Tim Conder","Just how should we think about the cadence of the Mein Schiff 5 and then Mein Schiff 6. As those come into the flow here, how should we think about that impacting net equity income line?","Jason Liberty","Well, I think that we do now breakout that profitability line or the equity pickup line in our filing and I think that \u2013 I think it's reasonable to consider that that trend change year-over-year will continue as the new ships come onboard.","Tim Conder","Great. Thank you.","Jason Liberty","You got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin Farley","Great, thanks. Just looking at your full year yield guidance, you know, it's not up by as much as the outperformance in Q1. Should we think about that more as just, it's within the range of being conservative surrounding or is it \u2013 do you have a slightly more conservative view over the rest of the year because of your comments about the Med? And I am just thinking about \u2013 it sounded like Q2 a little lower than consensus but I would think the Med would be more of a Q3 impact than Q2. So just maybe how to think about that? Thanks.","Jason Liberty","Yeah. So, Robin, to that point, the increase in our yield guidance for the year, which is \u2013 gives the midpoint of 3.25%. A lot of that is a read through from Q1 and then from Q2 to Q4 we're taking a \u2013 I wouldn't say it's a more conservative posture but a more realistic posture as it relates to the Mediterranean and it's our expectation our yields are going to be lower. It is disproportional in Q2 for a few reasons. One of which is the ships are now repositioning or have repositioned to Europe. So they do have May sailings and June sailings. And as I talked about the lull that we saw after the recent geopolitical events that there was a need to do some price stimulation on some of the more the closer-in bookings that related to the Med in which that lull really occurred with the North American consumer.","Robin Farley","But then you are comfortable with Q3 because after that, sort of, lull post Brussels, in other words you've seen the pickup since then for the med sailings later in Q3?","Jason Liberty","Yeah. It's picked up. Actually our load factors are higher. As I commented in my remarks but we're sourcing more guests from Europe and European consumers do spend a little bit less on ticket and certainly less on onboard and that does weigh in on both Q2 and Q3 yields.","Robin Farley","Okay. Great. And then lastly just a quick clarification, you mentioned sales in China higher in the last three months. Is that just volume higher or did you mean actually like load higher like capacity adjusted volumes higher?","Jason Liberty","It's volume, but the common hold for capacity adjusted.","Robin Farley","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs.","Steven Kent","Hi. Good morning. Two questions. What percentage of your European summer sailings are typically U.S. sourced and how has that changed this year? I am not sure, if you have addressed it yet but the Empress of the Seas delay, what is causing that?","Michael Bayley","Hi, Steven, I think Jason is looking at the numbers on the European sourcing, I can talk a little bit about Empress of the Seas. We brought Empress back from Pullmantur, it had been over with Pullmantur for approximately 9 years. We obviously had an expectation. We were going to do a certain amount of work with the ship and as we started the work we realized that we simply had more work to do. We wanted to make sure that we brought the ship up to the standard that our customers are used to with Royal Caribbean International, and a lot of that work required just more time to complete it. So, we had to extend the work time. And I think now we've got the ship scheduled to come back into operation at the end of May.","Steven Kent","So, this was customer-facing stuff rather than engineering?","Michael Bayley","No, it was related to customer experience.","Steven Kent","Okay.","Jason Liberty","Yeah. And Steve on the European sourcing side, the European, approximately about two-thirds of our guests for European sailings come from Europe, and this year it will be 3 or 4 percentage points higher as we've shifted that sourcing.","Steven Kent","Okay. Thank you.","Jason Liberty","You got it. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi, good morning. Jason, can you give us for the Mediterranean, what your capacity is over the spring and summer versus last year?","Michael Bayley","Sorry, Med capacity year-over-year is basically flat. It's up about 1% for us year-over-year.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay. And then just to clarify on Robin's question earlier, the lull that you saw from North American demand, that is recovered, I wasn't sure if you were saying you recovered it just with the European sourcing, or if you've seen the North American customer come back to a more normalized, kind of, booking cadence for the Med?","Jason Liberty","The lull is just overall recovery in terms of load factor. As Michael commented before the North American consumer, there was still very interested in Europe, but some of that interest has shifted to the North American products were we've seen a lot of strength.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay. Thank you.","Jason Liberty","You got it. Thanks, Sharon.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stuart Gordon of Berenberg.","Stuart Gordon","Yeah, good afternoon. And I have a couple of questions please. I'm interested on VOOM, I was just wondering how many ships you now have are connected and how will that change over this year and how has it been changing?","And also, could you just give us a flavor for how you think about your guidance? Clearly, the close-in bookings and the onboard spend was extremely strong in the quarter. But how do you think about that when you're putting together your guidance? Is the assumption based on what you are seeing in booking trend at the point in time, or do you try and be more dynamic about it? Thank you.","Michael Bayley","Hi, Stuart, It's Michael. I can answer the question with regards to VOOM. On May the 1st, literally every single ship in the Royal Caribbean International fleet will have VOOM onboard. So, we're literally now implementing it ship-by-ship. I can't recall how many ships have it currently but literally in a few days every single ship will have it.","Jason Liberty","Yeah.","Stuart Gordon","And so what pace was that? Sorry Michael, is it \u2013 how many \u2013 I mean, is that evenly spread over the last 12 to 18 months?","Michael Bayley","I can't recall, Stuart, how many ships we had about a couple of months ago. This has literally happened over about a 90 day to 120-day period that we've implemented the entire fleet. So it's literally gone from 5, 6, 7 ships to 23 ships, 24 ships over the past 90 days.","Stuart Gordon","Okay. Thanks.","Jason Liberty","And then, Stuart, as it relates to how we think about guidance, certainly our guidance is really a reflection of what we're seeing in the booking environment prior to the call and certainly we've seen patterns on close-in. We would certainly be taking that to account in our guidance.","There was particular strength in the first quarter from the North American consumer for the Caribbean. And on the onboard, as we continue to rollout VOOM, as Michael indicated, or Xcelerate on Celebrity, those are new things we are introducing that not all the time you create the results that we saw, as we introduced new things but clearly that worked well for us in the first quarter.","Stuart Gordon","Okay. That's great. Thanks very much.","Jason Liberty","Thanks, Stuart.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research.","Vince Ciepiel","Hi. I had a question on the new pricing policy. On a prior call, you mentioned there would be some residual impact in 2016, maybe some cabins going empty. Could you comment on how you've seen this trend year-to-date? And I think you also mentioned that by 2017 the impact would be positive. Do you think you're still tracking in line with that target?","Richard Fain","Yeah. I think it's still playing out pretty much as we expected. We do think that there is some impact on capacity or on occupancy in 2016. But as we said we don't think the effect has been huge, and we think that by 2017 it will be positive. So nothing has changed in our perspective as to how that would play out.","Vince Ciepiel","Great. Thank you. And then, secondly, on Net Cruise Costs, I know you guys have mentioned they tend to be a little lumpy on a quarterly basis. But I think there was the thought that the fourth quarter would be lower. And the guidance seems to imply the second half maybe turns negative year-over-year. So if you could just comment on the quarterly cadence 3Q versus 4Q in terms of Net Cruise Costs?","Jason Liberty","Yeah. So I think cost for the third quarter will be lower than they are in the fourth quarter should be the expectation. What drives that is, obviously, there is the new capacity coming online. But also we don't have any dry dock days in the third quarter, and last year we did. And so that makes that year-over-year comp more achievable. So that should be how you kind of think about the cadence for the back half of the year.","Vince Ciepiel","Thank you.","Jason Liberty","You got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz of Morningstar.","Jaime Katz","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm actually curious about some of the smaller brands. First, the performance of Pullmantur over the last few months in light of the Mediterranean environment. And then I think it's been some time since we've heard anything about the relationship with Ctrip. So I'm curious if we can learn more about any of the read-throughs that you've gotten from them about the Chinese consumer or anything that's changed with that relationship. Thanks.","Richard Fain","Sure. I'll comment on Pullmantur. As you know, we did take a change in strategy. We decided that it would be better to pull back a bit and focus on the Spanish and French markets. That actually seems to be doing well. And actually Pullmantur ironically has had some of the more positive variances in our company.","At the same time, as I know it's been said publicly, we periodically look at strategic opportunities and we would do that for any of our enterprises, but we'll see where that takes us. But, right now, ironically, Spain, in particular, is proving itself to be turning around quite strongly. Now, it's doing so from a very low base, but it does appear to be doing so. And so I think we're feeling better about that market than we have in a long time. I'll ask Adam to talk on the Ctrip.","Adam Goldstein","Hi, Jaime. So Ctrip is our partner in SkySea and we are very, very pleased to be in partnership with them. They are an excellent company, forward-looking, very much a fundamental part of the growing Chinese travel market and good partners we think for the long-term.","SkySea, the name of the cruise line that is our venture with Ctrip will be coming up on its first anniversary in about three weeks. And so, she is a very, very young cruise line with one ship and doesn't have the kind of presence yet in the Chinese market that would even compare to Royal Caribbean International, as Michael has been discussing.","So, we hope to build a different profile of client, the client that understands that this is a primarily Chinese-owned venture and we'll offer certain opportunities whether through technology or in the guest experience that will be differentiating in the marketplace. But it's very early days still. We'll have to see how the second season goes and we hope to be able to grow SkySea in the future.","Jaime Katz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva of Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","Good morning. Congratulations on a great Q1. I had a couple of quick questions. So, in terms of the European sourced passengers, they tend to book closer in than the North American passenger. Do think that there still may be an opportunity in May, in June, to where that lull post-Brussels kind of gets taken away from people's minds and we might see some close-in pick up?","Michael Bayley","Hi, Assia. The European markets have been quite good. So, the lull was more impact to the North American customer than it impacted the European customer. European sourcing has been pretty good. And there is this kind of transition point that occurs around May, June in terms of a natural shift between demand between the North American market and the European market. As you've pointed out, it's more of a late booking market for the European. So, it's going to pick up anyway out of the European markets, but the European markets are in pretty good condition.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. Thank you, Michael. And, Richard, quick question for you. I think in your opening remarks you mentioned $6.78 EPS target for 2017. I may have missed something, but somehow I had a $7 figure stuck in my mind.","Richard Fain","I didn't actually \u2013 maybe I should have been clear, that is the Double-Double number. So, our EPS in 2014 \u2013 our adjusted EPS was $3.39 and our Double-Double target is simply double that and if my math is right, and I sure hope it is, that's $6.78.","I think people may have sort of been rounding that to $7 and I know some people think that we're doing better than the Double-Double, but we set out the Double-Double. It was an aggressive target when we set it out. The objective was to mobilize the people in the company to that goal. It served that purpose very well. And, obviously, if we do better than the $6.78 that would be terrific too. So I don't think we've \u2013 we're not giving guidance for 2017 but that is literally the target that we set a year or two ago when we set those targets.","Assia Georgieva","Thank you, Richard, for the clarification, again. Great job on Q1.","Richard Fain","Thanks, Assia.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","Hi. Good morning. Just want to follow up on that yield and discounting commentary. I know last year you talked pretty regularly about how eliminating these last minute discounts was a headwind and just judging by the close-in strength you're seeing right now, it looks like it's a nice tailwind here in 2016.","So can you quantify how much of your yield guidance for the remainder of the year is attributable to any of these tailwinds? And I am specifically trying to think about this in the context of 2017. Is there any reason why the yields we're seeing this year can't be repeated again next year? Anything you can share on early 2017 booking yields will be helpful. Thanks, guys.","Richard Fain","Okay. So, Jared, as it relates to 2017 we'll be addressing that as we move into future quarters because it's really kind of too early to provide any kind of forecast on things going forward.","But I would say that, the impact we talk about as it relates to price improvement program, those are, to us, quantifiable things. For example, number of cabins that go empty.","What's not quantifiable is really us continuing to build a better book of business, at higher load factors, higher rates, and a window that keeps extending. And so, in that are more quality bookings and some of that is because of the reconditioning of the consumer knowing that we're not going to be discounting close in. Those benefits are very difficult to measure. But we do think on a volume perspective that that kind of turns itself around into next year. And as we've always done in the past, we'll give color on 2017 as we move more towards the back half of the year.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. Thanks. And then, as a follow-up, what are your expectations for timing on Cuba? Caribbean, obviously has been very strong this past fourth and first quarter. And I think some people are wondering how you can drive incremental yield off some of these comps. So do you think Cuba could be that source of incremental yield growth as we head into 1Q 2017 or is it too soon to be talking about it?","Adam Goldstein","Hi. Sorry. Jared, it's Adam. So, we have a keen desire, I think Michael might have expressed this before too, to take our guest to Cuba. Obviously, if you think about what we've been doing since 1970, our ships keep cruising on a giant circle around Cuba without going there.","And we're excited about it, but this is the dialogue that continues with the Cuban government and the timing of permission to go is unclear, although we're optimistic. And so it's hard to predict when any involvement in Cuba would have become part of our business.","And as we've tried to express on previous dialogues, the Cuba's infrastructure is very, very limited in terms of the overall amounts of capacity that it can take. If it develops well over the years coming, eventually it probably can become one of the mainstay marquee Caribbean regions but that's a long way off. So we hope to be there in the short term, but it would be on a fairly limited presence.","Richard Fain","Yeah. And I think we've made it pretty clear that we don't think even when it is operational it will be a major part of our business. So I wouldn't have thought that per se looked at in isolation would be a driver. However, I think two things. It actually will help generally yields in the area because I think it does raise interest. The publicity about Cuba, the discussions about Cuba raises interest in Caribbean cruising.","The other thing is I wanted to spell any notion that we think that the yield improvement that we are getting today is particularly high. We've got some terrific new vessels; we've got really very strong market position of our brands, of our operations. So we need the big driver and we think it will continue. It has been a driver and we think will be a driver is actually how powerful our brands are doing in the marketplace.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. Thank you.","Jason Liberty","Operator, we have time for one question.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman of Wedbush Securities.","James Hardiman","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So just \u2013 and you may have already answered this but I wanted to be 100% clear on sort of the China dynamic. Obviously, yields for China itself are down versus last year but Chinese yields are significantly higher than your average. Net-net, is China helping your yields this year and as I think about next year I know you're not going to get into 2017 guidance but should we expect a similar impact to overall yields next year?","I think there is some fear among investors that there is a delayed impact based on the way that the charter process works and that we still haven't felt all of the fallout from some of the charters losing money on some of the cruises last year?","Michael Bayley","Hi, James, this is Michael. Yeah, I think some of the charters lost money for a period of time in 2015 because of the South Korea MERS and the typhoons. But sometimes I think we should get that those very same charters made a lot of money over the past eight years and continue to make money and they are chartering spaces they previously had done. So I think it was a glitch that impacted some of the charters during that period and I think a lot of them now have recovered from that.","Certainly the China business is very positive for our overall business and as I think we've already commented, it's a high-yielding market and it contributes nicely to our overall yield. It's above average. So when we look into 2017, for example I think Richard had mentioned that growth for the industry in 2017 is closer to 50% versus close to 100% over the past few years.","So capacity is slightly \u2013 overall growth is slowing a little bit in 2017. For Royal Caribbean International, we've already announced our deployment for 2017 and overall I think we are up about 8% or 9% in the market in 2017.","James Hardiman","Great. And then just last question for me, on the other income line there's a lot of moving parts there. I think if you add back the Pullmantur accounting. It was about a $20 million positive. Any way you could give us guidance on that line for the full year and maybe how to think about the puts and the takes there?","Jason Liberty","Yeah. Well, I think that if you were to take our yield and cost, the differential is the other income line and the element of the other income line that really changes outside of ineffectiveness and those type of things is the improvement in our equity investments.","So, I think, if you look at the year-over-year growth especially in the back half of the year before we disclosed in our filing for TUI that is a good proxy to think about how other income and expense will grow for the back half of the year because if you take an account interest, you take into account TUI that should get you pretty close.","Jason Liberty","Great. Thank you for your assistance, Laurie, with the call today and we thank you all for your participation and interest in the company. Carol will be available for any follow-up you might have today and I wish you all a very great day.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Shaira, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Jason Liberty, you may begin.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Shaira. Good morning. I'd like to thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call.","Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Rice, our Vice Chairman.; Adam Goldstein, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Celebrity Cruises; and Ian Bailey, Vice President of Investor Relations. During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which we have posted on our Investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures.","Additionally, we will be discussing certain financial measures, which are non-GAAP as defined. And a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.","Richard will begin by providing a business overview and discussing the profitability initiatives that we announced this morning. I will follow up with a brief recap of our second quarter results. Bryan will provide an update on the business environment. I will then walk you through our earnings expectations for the remainder of the year. And Adam and Michael will provide an update on their respective brands. I will then open the call up for questions. Richard?","Richard D. Fain","Thanks, Jason, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. As always, it's a pleasure to have this opportunity to provide a bit more color on our results for the quarter and on our perspective going forward.","I also am ready to admit that it's more fun to do that today when I believe we're building positive momentum. And we're setting the stage for taking our returns to the next level.","As noted in our release, the second quarter exceeded our forecast on both revenues and expenses. And the full year also looks like it will be even marginally better than our most recent guidance.","The most significant feature of our recent guidance changes actually is probably something we don't mention as a cause. The only changes we refer to when we talk about changes in guidance are the fire and the foreign exchange changes.","But everybody knows that in the first half of 2013, the industry suffered under the unrelenting pressure of a deluge of negative publicity.","That pressure has clearly hurt our bookings and unfortunately, to a greater extent than we originally understood.","It's also true, as many of you reported, that in recent weeks, competitive pricing has gotten more intense. Thus, the fact that we don't even list these factors as driving lower yields means that in other respects, our yields are even stronger than we originally predicted.","I believe that this shows how strong our business model is. And it suggests that current yields are anomalously low.","Furthermore, as excruciating as that media coverage was, and has been, we can already see indications that, that factor is waning. And this is most encouraging as we look forward.","I think most of you understand that the recent incidents in our industry are an aberration from an otherwise exemplary safety record over many decades.","Going forward, the industry under the aegis of CLIA has undertaken a significant number of additional safety and comfort-related measure measures, which further reduced the risks of such events in the future. And we have all learned better how to deal with the press and with social media on such issues. I think all these factors are helping us overcome the misconceptions.","At the same time, it's very gratifying to see our cost control efforts come into fruition. We have previously talked about some of these initiatives. And you can already see the early results in both revenues and lower-than-expected costs. This is helping us this year, but the benefits will accelerate as we go into 2014.","Given our historical booking patterns, this is actually the time of the year when the vast majority of our current year's bookings are already in hand, that we begin to focus more on the coming year.","Looking forward, it feels good to see us coming to an inflection point, both on revenue and expenses.","On the revenue side, we take comfort watching the bookings as they recover from the negative publicity earlier this year.","Bookings for both 2013 and 2014 are ahead of where we were at the same time last year, both in terms of load factor and pricing.","And this year, during the middle of our WAVE period, we had to contend with the CNN effect.","We're also continuing aggressively on the cost side. And we think, that like any other long-term process, the benefits will accelerate over time. We do call out 2 of these initiatives in our press release.","The first is Pullmantur's new head office in Latin America to position it better for that growing market. The second item are the steps we are undertaking to reduce the cost of operating our international infrastructure.","We expect the majority of the cost initiatives to be on the overhead component rather than on the shipboard side.","At the same time, I take comfort from the fact that the initiatives we've already been working on have proven successful not only in cutting costs, but in maintaining and even improving our product delivery. All of this is evidenced by record high satisfaction levels from our guests.","Fortunately, throughout this difficult period, the delivery of our product has remained strong. And the strength of our individual brands has remained solid.","Our objective for next year is to at least achieve flat net cruise costs excluding fuel. And while we don't forecast what the price of oil will do, we do work aggressively to reduce our energy consumption.","The most recent example of this is a new bubble technology that was installed on Celebrity Reflection last year. The system generates tiny bubbles that isolate the hull from the friction of the water.","With this technology, the ship is now literally sailing on a cushion of air. And we are looking forward to expanding this technology to other ships in due course.","On the fleet development side, we continue our view that lower than historical growth rates is the appropriate strategy for us. Our current new building program keeps growth from 2012 to 2016 in the 4% range, assuming no dispositions. Getting the balance right is important. Lower growth helps our supply demand dynamic, but the profitability of the new ships is simply awesome.","For example, our ships built since 2006 generate about 25% more revenue per berth than the older vessels. And those older vessels cost roughly 20% more per berth to operate.","As a result, our newer ships generate about 3.5x the cash flow of our older vessels.","Now fuel efficiency is a big factor in this. Our new building team and our operating technical people are obsessive about reducing our energy consumption.","Oasis and Allure of the Seas are probably the most energy-efficient cruise ships in the world. And their fuel consumption is roughly 25% better than the rest of our fleet.","Yet Quantum, coming out next year, is actually even better. On a like-for-like basis, they have taken advantage of further advances in technology and by focusing on the details they have designed what should be a new standard in energy efficiency.","At the same time, we also look for opportunities to eliminate inefficient tonnage. Over the last few years, we have disposed of 4 inefficient vessels. And as the market recovers, we expect opportunities will arise to do more.","So in summary, while we're frustrated by the hurdles we've had to overcome in recent years, we feel very good about our condition as we emerge from these clouds. We are well-positioned to take advantage of even marginally calmer waters. And we think our profitability initiatives will be highly impactful to both revenues and expenses.","With that, it's a pleasure to turn this back to Jason, who will give some more color on our results. Jason?","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Richard. On the second slide, we have summarized our results from the second quarter. We generated net income of $0.11 per share, which was within the guidance range we provided on our April call, despite incurring $0.12 per share in unanticipated charges from the Grandeur of the Seas fire and a correction for the liability for reward redemptions related to our Affinity credit card. I will discuss both of these items in more detail in a moment, but at a high-level better-than-expected onboard spending and the early benefits from our profitability initiative helped to offset a significant portion of these unexpected charges. EPS adjusted for these 2 items was $0.23 per share.","As you know, over the Memorial Day weekend, we experienced a fire in an industrial area on the Grandeur of the Seas resulting in the cancellation of sailing [ph], 4 of which were in the second quarter.","As we previously disclosed, the impact is expected to be $0.10 per share, of which $0.05 is included in our second quarter results.","We also took an unexpected charge related to the redemption rate of rewards earned on our Affinity credit card, which decreased Q2 net income by $0.07 per share.","Like many organizations, we offer an Affinity credit card that allows the cardholders to earn points for every dollar spent, which can be redeemed through rewards such as bottles of wine, spa treatments, onboard credits and cruises, among other items.","Until those points are redeemed, we recognize the liability based on the estimated redemption rate. There was an error in the way we estimated the forecast redemptions, and this resulted in a onetime cumulative charge, which reduced our quarter's yield by about 1 percentage point.","Net revenue yield increased 2.8% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter with 3.9% excluding the impact from the credit card adjustment.","Figure revenues came in as expected, but onboard spending was much stronger. Onboard revenues increased 8.2% for APCD in the quarter and generated about $0.04 per share favorability to our April's expectation.","Overall, we are generally seeing better spending behaviors out of the North American guests, but we were also enjoying very favorable results from our revitalization project.","Gaming, beverage, specialty restaurants and shore excursions all outperformed.","Net cruise costs excluding fuel increased 2.3% on a constant-currency basis, about 1\/3 of which were one-off costs related to the Grandeur fire. Absent the fire, net cruise costs excluding fuel were up 1.5 percentage points, which was much better than previously expected.","As Richard mentioned, we have launched a series of profitability initiatives. And we were able to realize some of those cost benefits in the second quarter, which improved our earnings by $0.05 per share.","These benefits are broad in scope and are not intended to compromise the guest experience or marketing efforts.","Fuel and currency, while volatile over the quarter, were on average in line with expectation and did not have a significant influence on the quarter's results. Overall, it was a solid quarter from both a revenue and cost perspective.","I will now ask Brian to provide some color on what we are seeing from a demand standpoint. Once he is done, I will update you on our earnings expectations for Q3 for the remainder of the year. Brian?","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, Jason. As you saw in our press release, overall business trends are generally in line with our prior expectations. The midpoint of our net yield guidance is down about 50 basis points for the year. But on a $7 billion revenue base, this represents about $30 million. So these changes really are on the margin.","About half of the reduction relates to the Affinity card liability adjustment that Jason spoke about. Excluding this adjustment, we actually outperformed our forecast in the first half of the year.","For the second half of the year, we have lowered our revenue forecast by just under 1 percentage point due to lower expectations in China and some impact from the pricing environment in the Caribbean.","In aggregate, our booked load factors and pricing are both up slightly for the full year.","Since our last call, bookings have been slightly higher than last year after adjusting for capacity.","Europe is developing about as we anticipated. And we are expecting net yield increases in the mid-single-digits for the year.","Our Pullmantur brand is one exception here. And as Richard noticed, the brand will be putting much more emphasis on developing its business in Latin America.","We have seen stronger year-over-year demand out of North America for European sailings, and have increased our sourcing accordingly. You may recall that we reduced our European capacity by 10% this year. We believe this decision has served us well and enabled us to maintain pricing integrity. The territorial island dispute between China and Japan has forced us to drop Japanese ports of call from our itineraries. And in total, we have had to modify 30 sailings. These modifications have resulted in some churn in our book of business, as well as some volatility in the booking behaviors in the region. It is important to keep in mind that this is a relatively small part of our overall business. China is about 3% of our deployment for the year. But as I mentioned before, all of these guidance changes we're identifying really are on the margin.","The Caribbean, which represents about 1\/4 of our deployment in Q3 and almost half in Q4 is holding up pretty well. We are aware there have been -- there's been a lot of focus in the investment community on the overall health of the Caribbean in light of some of the competitive pressures. We would be na\u00efve to say that this has not affected us to some degree. But at the macro level, consumers seem to be recognizing the value of our brands. And our pricing in the region continues to show improvement for the year.","Asia is the only product in our portfolio that we are forecasting to have lower yields for the year. And while all of our other products look good, the largest yield improvements are coming from Europe, South America and some of our Caribbean itineraries.","Finally, while it is very early in the booking cycle, we are encouraged with the early patterns for the first quarter of 2014. Book load factors are up nicely with slightly higher per diems. Jason?","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Brian. I will now walk you through the outlook for the year, which takes into consideration the business environment update you just heard.","If you look at Slide 3, we have provided an EPS roll forward from our April guidance to today. As you can see, from a business perspective, we are about in line with our expectations from April. The Affinity card liability adjustment and reduced expectations in the Caribbean and China have been offset by stronger-than-anticipated onboard spending and cost program.","A significant driver of the change in our earnings range was clearly the strength of the U.S. dollar especially versus the Australian dollar and Brazilian real. Typically changes in exchange rates and fuel prices have provided an offsetting relationship, but the recent tension near the Suez Canal has recently disrupted this relationship.","If you will turn to Slide 4, you will see our updated guidance for the full year. Net yields are expected to increase 2% to 3% on a constant-currency basis, which is a 50 basis point reduction since our April guidance and less than 1 percentage point lower than our previously implied guidance for the second half of the year.","As Brian mentioned, while there are puts and takes on a business perspective, the key drivers of the change relate to the ongoing territorial dispute between China and Japan, pricing actions that have modestly weakened our Caribbean business, which I'm sure you have seen in your pricing surveys, and the impact relating to our Affinity card.","While the territorial dispute between China and Japan has impacted our performance, the China market continues to be profitable.","On a cost perspective, we expect our net cruise x fuel to be up 1% to 2% on a constant-currency basis, which is 100 basis points better than the midpoint of our previous guidance and approximately 170 basis points lower than our previously implied guidance for the second half of the year.","We have included $923 million of fuel expense for the year, a reduction of $5 million versus our April calculation.","Fuel expense is roughly in line with April as we've been able to offset the increase and at the pump prices by further reducing our consumption estimate by 17,000 metric tons for the year.","Our earnings per share are expected to be between $2.20 and $2.30 for the year. As previously mentioned, we are in the early stages of a very broad profitability program, aimed at improving the company's margins and return on invested capital.","We expect that we will need to incur some onetime costs in 2013 as these programs are implemented. These onetime costs are not known at this time, but we will provide clarity in future reporting.","On Slide 5, we have recapped our guidance for the third quarter. Net yields are expected to be up 1% to 2% on a constant-currency basis, driven mainly by improvement in onboard revenue.","Ticket yields are expected to be flat for the quarter, but up 1.5% if you adjusted for the affected China sailing.","Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to increase approximately 4% on a constant-currency base. The main drivers of this year-over-year increase relate to the concentration of the previously announced marketing activities and planned enhancements for the culinary experience.","for the full year, our fuel hedge position is pretty consistent with last quarter at 60% hedged for the balance of 2013, and 55%, 39%, 20% and 5% hedged for 2014, '15, '16, '17, respectively. We have and continue to be quite active from a treasury standpoint. The second quarter, we retired a $550 million bond and paid down $275 million in ship debt. We have recently launched several new financing actions. Then the combination of our current liquidity of $1.5 billion and future cash flows will be used to manage our upcoming maturity.","Current estimates indicate that we will reduce our year end net debt balance by about $270 million versus prior year, which in combination with improved operating cash flows will help improve our credit measures as we continue to strive for investment grade","metrics.","I would now ask Adam and Michael to provide you an update on the Royal Carribean International and Celebrity cruises, respectively. Adam?","Adam M. Goldstein","Thank you, Jason. As you have heard from my colleagues on balance, our corporate business outlook for the year is relatively unchanged. It is unfortunate that the territorial dispute between China and Japan has not yet reached an amicable resolution. And as a result, we are still running modified Chinese cruises for the season that do not include port calls in Japan as intended.","While demand in the region is still reasonable, and we are reaching our desired occupancy levels, we have reduced our ticket revenue expectations for the remainder of the summer season.","On the other hand, the modifications we have made to our China ships, especially those that improved the retail stores, have driven strong onboard revenue performance throughout the season to-date. Jason noted strong onboard revenue performance for the fleet in general in the second quarter across the primary onboard revenue streams. This has been a major initiative for our brands over the last year or 2. And it is gratifying to see it pay off. Some of this improvement, which Michael will elaborate on in a moment, emanates from our revitalization initiatives including pervasive Wi-Fi and significantly increased bandwidth. Some of it is from introducing products and services such as a wider array of beverage packages, the reintroduction of art auction and taking the wedding program in-house.","Finally, the onboard teams have heightened their focus on seizing opportunities to drive onboard revenue even as we have reached multi-year highs and get satisfaction.","Quantum of the Seas will enter the fleet just over 15 months from now. We are very pleased with her initial bookings since we opened for sale at the end of May. Quantum has already reached the projected load factor for her 2014, '15 winter season that we have set as a target for the end of this year. And the demand for her suite and new stateroom types, such as the studios, are particularly encouraging.","Grandeur of the Seas made a successful return to service on July 12 and resumed her sailings to Bermuda and the Bahamas from Baltimore. I would like to thank our employees for their outstanding efforts in every aspect of responding to and recovering from a challenging situation.","This month marks an important milestone as Royal Caribbean International welcomes our 50 millionth guest onboard our ships. For over 40 years, the men and women on our ships have delivered the WOW while providing incredible cruise vacations around the world for our guests. The WOW moments found only on our Caribbean inspire our guests to return to sail with us again and again. In fact, Royal Caribbean ranks second only to Disney in a leading customer satisfaction survey recently released.","This and other recent accolades across the globe, including awards from Travel and Leisure magazine, Travel Weekly magazine and World Travel Awards among others, there's testament to the exceptional guest experience as we provide to our new and loyal guests.","The 50 million milestone kicks off a year-long celebration recognizing our guests, travel agency partners, employees and crew, giving them the opportunity to share all their WOW moments with Royal Caribbean to friends and family around the world.","And with that, I will turn it over to Michael for his thoughts on the Celebrity brand, and also an update on our corporate revitalization initiative. Michael?","Michael W. Bayley","Thank you, Adam, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to be on the call with you today. Next month will mark my 1 year as the President and CEO of Celebrity Cruises.","The timing of this call is good because this is the time that our new strategy for improving Celebrity Cruises' profitability is beginning to show its impact.","I spent the first part of my year evaluating the brand, its positioning and the opportunity for improvement. We've developed a new profitability program plan, which we have been executing for most of this year, and which seems to be working.","But the core of this strategy is firming up a strong brand essence around our premium, modern luxury positioning. And targeting the right affluent consumer through more targeted marketing and greater utilization of data, analytics and segmentation, we have focused our efforts on attracting guests that will more highly value the Celebrity Cruises' proposition, thereby meaningfully increasing our pricing.","Over the past several months, we have significantly increased our sales and marketing activity in key North American markets with a focus on our target customer. This has proven to be successful.","Of course, raising pricing is a key part of the equation. Another fundamental we are acutely focused on is managing our cost. And I feel as though we are making very good progress in this area.","Our focus is on very strong cost management along with our strategy of improving ticket yield, resulting in superior financial performance for the Celebrity Cruises brand. Our ability to deliver also takes advantage of our outstanding hard work, our positioning and the delivery of exceptional customer experience.","I'm very pleased that over the past 12 months, Celebrity Cruises has been the recipient of multiple awards. One example we are particularly proud of is our recent travel and leisure world's best award, which recognized Celebrity Cruises as the #1 mega ship cruise line. We think this demonstrates the strength of our brand.","It's been a busy year, and I feel we are moving quickly. And while we are in the early stages of our strategy execution, I'm very pleased to report that the brand's financial performance is shaping up strongly.","Despite all of the challenges we are faced this year, we are on track to deliver in 2013 the best results in the brand's history.","One critical component of profitability improvement relevant to all of our brands is the revitalization of our older vessels. We've been pretty vocal about these assets in the past. And I thought I would provide you with some more color as to just how meaningful these projects have been.","As a corporation, we launched the program in 2010. And we have now revitalized 19 ships, 5 at Celebrity Cruises, 12 at sister brand, Royal Carribean International, and 2 at Azamara Club Cruises, leaving just 6 vessels to be revitalized.","So far, we have added 500 state rooms, 400 balconies, over 43 additional dining options, many of which are revenue-generating. We've added multiple entertainment venues and experiences throughout each of our ships. We've added retail spaces, upgraded retail spaces, particularly for our Asian vessels. And new retail product lines have been added. Spa areas have been refreshed, revenue-generating pervasive Wi-Fi has been installed throughout the fleet and we've invested in new slot machine technology and redesigned and expanded the casino footprint, specifically on the Asian products.","These efforts allow our brands to retain the freshness and innovation which has resulted in higher onward revenues, and of course, higher guest satisfaction, making our brands more attractive to sell and easier to purchase.","We are very focused as a corporation on being paid more for the outstanding brands and products we are offering.","With that, I will turn the call back to Jason.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Michael. With that, I will ask Shaira to open up the call for a question-and-answer session. Shaira?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Encouraging to see that the Caribbean and Europe are -- seem to be pretty healthy. And my question is just as we look to the back half of the year maybe just looking at the last few weeks as a guide here, has the level of industry discounting and promotions, has that accelerated or has that been pretty consistent?","Adam M. Goldstein","Greg, it's Adam. I would say it's been overall pretty consistent. I mean, clearly throughout recent months, there have been a lot of promotional -- there has been a lot of promotional activity. We've discussed in the past that -- and basically expect to see promotional activity throughout the revenue cycles. And I would not say that anything has dramatically accelerated in the last few weeks.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Good. And then just a follow-up question just on Europe, if I could. Pricing up mid-single-digit, that's pretty solid. What's the primary driver there? Is it the capacity reduction or you're actually seeing some increases in demand and maybe just the consumer was waiting to closer to the sailing date to book their cruise in Europe. And obviously, you have the North American component, sourcing component as well. Can you tell us like kind of what's maybe the biggest driver of that?","Adam M. Goldstein","Okay. Well, to sort of take your questions in reverse there, we understand the European booking behaviors. And as with pretty much every area of the world, people tend to book closer to the cruise if the cruise is nearer to where they live. So it isn't unusual this year that Europeans would be booking their Q3 cruises, for example, closer to the time than North Americans, for whom that booking decision will be a very significant decision that they would take further out. So I wouldn't say that, that is any kind of new driver of what's transpiring in Europe this summer. The 10% capacity decrease that we as a company have in Europe, I'm sure has had something to do because -- with this -- because for example, in the Southern European countries where their decrease was -- and capacity was even more pronounced, we've been able to handle the challenges of the marketplace better than we probably would have otherwise been able to do if we had our previous capacity there. So there's definitely an interrelationship between how we've managed our capacity down and our ability to generate positive yield for this year. And we look forward to in the future. Hopefully, Europe will progress back towards where it was a few years back.","Brian J. Rice","Greg, I would just add that the largest capacity decreases were in the Mediterranean. And that's where we're seeing the largest increases in the yields, both in the West and the Eastern Med. And I think, given the current situation, we are happy that we reduced that capacity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","To clarify, the $0.07 of charge here for the Affinity liability, the calculation error, can you just sort of address how many quarters prior does that cover? I guess, that $0.07 in theory was like yield over stated in previous quarter. So just trying to think about what quarters that might have been. And then in Richard's opening comments, he mentioned that competitive pricing has gotten more intense in the last few weeks. And I assume that's primarily Caribbean. Just thinking about whether your guidance is sort of looking at what's on your books today. And you talked about that being up versus -- does that include the impact of what business competitiveinclude the impact of what business competitive pressure that's gotten more intense in the last few weeks if that continues? Or is it just kind of where -- a snapshot of where you are today on the books?","Jason Liberty","Robin, it's Jason. As it relates to the Affinity card, it is accumulative catch-up. So it does relate to the past several years. And that's how it inched up on...","Richard D. Fain","And with respect to the competitive pressures, one of the comments we've made in the past is, this is a very complex business and we have swings and roundabouts in the areas all over the place. We -- no market is ever consistent over time. And you get rises and falls in periods of time. I think we have been actually remarkably accurate over time in terms of predicting what the numbers will be. But I also think that there's sometimes an overestimate of just how accurate one can be. I did mention that we have had more competitiveness in the last few weeks and -- But as Adam said, there's nothing particularly unusual about that. I think we would put that into the category in the normal swings and roundabouts. But with respect to your specific question as to whether our forward guidance is based on exactly what we're seeing now as opposed to just of the static of what our -- what's on the books today, our revenue management process is a very dynamic one. And we take into account every scrap of information we have from everywhere. And when we make our predictions for this, and an it's really intense effort that a lot of people are involved in, we take into account all the latest information that we can get from all the sources. So that would definitely include our commentary on the competitive activities. I think what you have to say is you're focusing a little bit on the negative side of what I said. And actually, there are negative things taking place in some of our markets. But the interesting thing is that overall, from a business point of view, we're actually seeing that this year has been and will be better than we thought in January or in January when we announced our earnings, in April when we give guidance and then most recently, at the end of May when we gave guidance. So I think we're trying to take into account all the factors when we give this guidance, not the static situation.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just to clarify that -- I can appreciate how in the guidance there a lot of moving parts. So I guess I just wanted to get a sense of whether that comment about the competitive pricing getting more intense in the last few weeks, is that limited to the Caribbean?","Richard D. Fain","I'll have to go back and check exactly what I said. But I think I was particularly focusing on that because we had noticed that in particular. And quite frankly, we've seen in a lot of your reports from calling around that you've seen some of that. And I think what we were trying to do was put that in the perspective of the total market. And yes, that has been more competitive in the last few weeks. And, well, the markets have reacted differently. And as you say, it's always a balance of some things going better and some things going worse. And we try and predict the best we can based on all of those factors.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Carter with Deutsche Bank.","Richard A. Carter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions from me. Can I just explore with you just the opportunity in Europe in terms of the yield environment going forward? Can you just remind me how much are yields down since '08 in Europe? And then could you also tell me, in terms of the mid-single digit increases you're seeing, how much of that is driven by onboard spend? And I think you made the point in this quarter, obviously the improving U.S. economy has helped onboard spend in your North American business. So I just want to get a flavor for obviously we're seeing -- starting to see a bit of improvement in the European economies. And could you give me some sort of gauge in terms of what you think the opportunity there is on the onboard spend outlook going forward? And then just on the cost reductions, we obviously took our costs up back in Q1 on technology investment and marketing investment. So can you just give an update on in terms of where we are there? And is it possible to give us some sort of guidance on how much exceptional costs you're going to take here to take care of this level of cost?","Adam M. Goldstein","Richard, it's Adam. I just wanted to start with your question with respect to shipboard revenue. There's nothing particularly notable going on with shipboard revenue as it relates to our European cruises. The improvement that we've seen is ticket price improvement.","Brian J. Rice","Richard, it's Brian. The mid-single digits that I alluded to was on a ticket perspective. The commentary I did was strictly around ticket. To answer your question about where we are in Europe versus '08, we are high-single digits off where we were in '08.","Richard A. Carter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","High-single digits?","Brian J. Rice","Yes.","Richard A. Carter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So would you -- if we saw an improving European economy? And actually would you expect that to be the catalyst on the onboard spend side in Europe?","Adam M. Goldstein","Well, Richard, other things being equal, higher ticket revenues are probably a positive for higher onboard revenues, but we will never know onboard revenues until the sailings happen. We really only talk about onboard revenues looking backwards because we're not able to book them forward.","Richard A. Carter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sure. And on the cost side?","Jason Liberty","On the cost side, Richard, this is Jason. On these profitability initiatives, we really are in the early stages of our operating planning process. So to come out with any specific impact as it relates to those costs would really be premature.","Richard A. Carter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Has there been any change then in terms of the guidance you talked about a couple of quarters ago in terms of the marketing and the sort of technology? Is that going to be lower than what you were thinking about then?","Jason Liberty","No. On the marketing and technology side, I think our guidance there is still very consistent. I think where the cost savings are coming from are really kind of broad-based. But like I said in my earlier discussion that it's really -- it's meant [ph] not touch marketing efforts, technology or the guest experience in terms of where the cost savings were coming through the year. It's more addressing the overall global footprint of the organization.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So Richard, your 2014 early outlook for loads and pricing, that all sounds pretty positive. Can you maybe just break down what you're seeing in terms of markets? Is that pretty much across the board? And I understand Europe, your visibility there is probably pretty low at this point, but any color there would be very helpful.","Brian J. Rice","Steve, it's Brian. As you said, it's extremely early in the process. I will tell you, we're feeling pretty good about the first quarter. We have very strong load factors. Our pricing is up slightly. As we look out beyond Q2, the numbers are really too small to extrapolate. But I will say that in all our quarters in 2014, our load factors and APDs are running ahead of where they were a year ago. But again, it's way too early to extrapolate from that, particularly Europe.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then, I guess, for Adam, I know you've spent the past, I guess, day or 2 up on Capitol Hill. Can you just give some -- your kind of high-level thoughts in terms of walking away from those hearings? And I know the concern out there again is that the government could potentially go after you guys from a tax perspective. And maybe just some thoughts around that as well would be helpful.","Adam M. Goldstein","Steve, yes, I meant to say before that if by any chance I address any of you as senator, I apologize for that. Well, clearly, we had a very interesting dialogue yesterday. The overwhelming majority of that dialogue was around consumer protection, the decision of the major cruise lines to begin voluntarily reporting of all allegations of crime wherever they may occur in the world on our ships beginning August 1. And that's what almost -- actually, that is what all of the questions were about that were asked of us. I think your note comes from the fact that at the very end, in fact, in Senator Rockefeller's closing remark, he mentioned that he would be producing or proposing a piece of legislation that would address what he terms something like the closing of a tax loophole that our industry enjoys. Obviously, we will take any proposed legislation that he comes forward with very seriously. We've been very, very transparent for many years about our tax postures since -- at least since we went public over 20 years ago. What Senator Rockefeller is apparently referring to as a loophole is something that's been fairly entrenched in U.S. tax law going back many decades, it's been carefully reviewed by Congress with very small changes made as recently as 2003. The U.S. is already anomalous, in taxing shipping [ph] income more heavily than in virtually every other developed country of the world. Our ships spend less than 10% of their time in U.S. waters. And the political environment makes any legislation difficult to achieve as we can all see every single day. So as I say, we'll take it very seriously. But I would say it's extraordinary preliminary at this point to even understand what he has in mind. So we'll see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","I have one question, maybe Richard, you can help address this first. You mentioned in your comments to Robin Farley that the fiscal 2013 outlook is better now than you anticipated in January or in April. But we do have China coming down. And it seems that in addition to the Caribbean discounting, which was quite significant over the past 12 weeks, we're seeing some pretty important price declines in Alaska. So is that reference then more to pricing in Europe? Is that how we should interpret that?","Richard D. Fain","Assia, it is a complex mosaic of markets that we operate in. And you're right, the China situation is impactful to us. It hurts not to be able to operate the way we had hoped to. But even with that knockdown, I have to point out that it's one of our highest per diem markets. And so -- but in terms of how it's changing our expectations, you've seen positives and negatives. And I'm not sure I would say Europe is actually -- didn't expect that much from Europe. It's performed reasonably well. South America is performing well. So I'm not sure it's any one thing. The total hasn't changed that much. And while China was a big hit, it's still a relatively small part of our total. So now balancing all of those things together, I'm not sure I would identify one thing as dramatically out of line versus the other. Brian, you want to give some color on that?","Brian J. Rice","Sure. Assia, we tried to be very transparent in our commentary. I said less than 1 percentage point in the back half the year. We actually lowered our ticket revenue by 90 basis points in the second half of the year. And that's a combination predominantly of China and a little bit of softness in the Caribbean. And again, I just want to emphasize, we're talking about 90 basis points. And Robin asked the question about how we do the forecast and Richard talked about a lot of the discussions and the analysis that goes into this. In some cases, where we have a better feel for a market, we will lean on more current pricing. And we'll also look at the trend analysis. And frankly, I think we anticipated that Alaska had a terrific beginning of the year. And it was unlikely to continue at that trajectory. So we projected out a little bit and handicapped that a little bit more when we gave you our April guidance. So there's a lot of work that goes into this. And I want to emphasize, we're really talking about rounding errors in terms of the sort of the change that we made. And I think the important thing is, while we took the second half revenues down 90 basis points, we've been able to more than offset that with cost savings.","Richard D. Fain","I do think maybe it's -- maybe we shouldn't do this so much, but we try and point out where is where we think we've been quite a bit off. And as you pointed out, Assia, in China, that was a single big hit. But we've also got a lot of successes in other areas. And so the net result of all that is that we're actually -- the markets have, in total, have been stronger than our guidance. I think the other thing that's probably reflected in our thought process is while we're ending up slightly better than we thought, we really hoped to do a lot better than we thought. And so it's -- and from that perspective, we here are still disappointed in the outcome even if it's marginally better than the guidance because we really felt that this was a year in which we should have -- we had much more upside potential than downside.","Assia Georgieva","This was great color. And my second question refers to the onboard forecast, which seems to be driving the Q3 yield guidances. And Brian, you gave me a great segue into this. So including China, you expect flat ticket and the 1% to 2% yield to come from onboard. But as we know, and as Adam just pointed out, we never know what onboard would do until the cruise is over. So is there more risk to the 1% to 2% yield guidance for Q3 than you've previously had in your guidance?","Jason Liberty","Assia, this is Jason. I think the guidance that we gave on Q3 does reflect our feelings around risk on whether it's on ticket or onboard. And I think that we -- the programs that we've implemented on the onboard perspective are not aspirational. A lot of it is structural in nature, whether it's new venues we've added onto the vessels or new contracts that we might have with our concessionaires and packages that we're offering. So it's not something that's aspirational in nature. It's actually -- there's pretty strong foundation for the improvement.","Assia Georgieva","So your confidence level is similar to what it has been in the past?","Jason Liberty","Yes.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. And Jason, can I ask you one technicality? In the reconciliation table between April guidance and today's guidance, there's a line item that's called net savings. Is that cost savings in the back half of the year less the yield reduction? Should I interpret that, that way?","Jason Liberty","That's right. It's basically all cost-saving efforts that we've put forward versus the revenue decline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I know you guys talked a little bit about what you thought debt levels would come down, how much they would come down at the end of the year. But you have a fair amount of debt coming due over the next 2 following years. Can you talk about how you're thinking about either refinancing or paying down some portion of that to kind of expedite getting back to that investment grade rating?","Jason Liberty","Sure. It's Jason again here. We are very active in multiple refinancing activities to address our upcoming maturities. And yesterday, we launched 2 facilities in the bank market. I mean, and there'll most likely be some additional activity there. So I think we're quite comfortable that in the short term, we will basically be resolving our upcoming maturities. And clearly, as we go through the forward-looking period, taking free cash flow to pay down debt will certainly be one of the alternatives that we evaluate.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you will partially refinance part of it and partially pay down part of it, it sounds like?","Jason Liberty","That'd be right.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I know you guys have talked a lot about China and Japan. And I think out of a lot of other companies, we've been hearing about some weakness in Australia. I know it's a pretty small market for you, but can you talk about anything that you've seen there, maybe in whether you're seeing some weakness in pricing there?","Adam M. Goldstein","Jaime, it's Adam. I think don't think of so much that we're seeing weakness. I believe we've mentioned in the previous quarters that as Australia has grown, and it's important in the industry, there's been fairly substantial industry-wide capacity increases there. We have put more ships there. And naturally, that has had some downward pressure on yields. But I would say the market this year has developed roughly in accordance with our expectations for how it would go. Australia is a very attractive southern summer market for us. We have a strong presence there with both for our Caribbean and Celebrity. We did expect pressure on yields this year from the capacity increases. And we're looking forward to be playing a prominent role on that market going forward in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple here, little more color on the Caribbean. Can you say is that more tilted to the weakness that you've seen and the increase to competitive pressure here of late? Is that more in the close-in bookings? Are we looking out just over the curve, number one? And then in relation to that, how is your current booking curve on a company-wide global basis? And then secondly, regarding the capacity growth, looking more importantly to '15 and '16, yourselves and others in the industry have talked about keeping that at 3% to 5%. You mentioned in your press release, you've mentioned before that '12 to '16, it's 4% on average. But obviously, '15 and '16, it's around 7%. So should we anticipate that either we'll see some sales of ships and bring that net number down? Or that, again, you haven't announced anything, but beyond '16, it'll come back down to bring that more in that trend line of the 3% to 5%?","Brian J. Rice","Tim, I'll take the first part of the question. Our booking window has been expanding, I think, pretty universally. I think, I just like the preference. I do think too much gets read into the booking window. But it is moving in a positive direction by most people's perceptions. And again, that's pretty much across the board. I think the Caribbean pricing pressure is, yes, I just -- I want to emphasize. I think way too much is being read into the fact that we've called out the Caribbean. We know that there's been a lot of discussion about this. Ian has been getting a lot of calls about what are we seeing in the Caribbean. So we wanted to specifically address it. We are seeing changes on the margin. And I think we will continue. As Adam alluded to, this is just part of the booking cycle. There are ups and downs and puts and takes that constantly occur. So I don't think when we've called this out, we're talking about anything structural in the Caribbean.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So is it -- again, Brian, is it more skewed close in or a little bit further out? Is it -- with that topping off close in or again looking out?","Brian J. Rice","Frankly, I think it's probably more centered around the fall, which is something we would normally see this time of year. The fourth quarter is traditionally the harder period to try to sell inventory because the kids are going back to school. But it's something you expect every year. It's a dynamic that occurs. And we're not -- we constantly monitor this, and we see new promotions everyday. But again, it's nothing out of the ordinary. And it's nothing structural. I'll ask Adam or Richard to take the second part.","Richard D. Fain","Yes. With respect to the second part of your question, I think it's an interesting dynamic in our business that when you do take delivery of a new ship, it's not -- it's all at once. Many industries, when you have growth, it's a thousand little pieces. And in our case, it's a very binary type of move. And so I think that does make the individual years look different. Our view is we should look at this over a period of time on a strategic basis. And our objective was to have more moderated growth going forward. And while I -- frankly, it would be nice to be able to have each year be the exact same number. That just isn't the way any opportunities come up, and it isn't the way it happens with big chunks of new ships coming. With respect to older capacity and potential dispositions, it's somewhat the same thing there. It's even more opportunistic. I think the direction we're going in, and you've seen we've been successful. Even in a very difficult market, this has been an extraordinarily difficult market in the secondhand market. And yet we've had some success there. And I think, again, that will be, because that market tends to be opportunistic, that will also be more binary and a little less predictable as to when the things happen. So we tend to look at these things strategically over a number of years. And I think that's the way we will continue to look at it.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Richard, so, yes, given the lumpiness of how the deliveries happen then, so it's still the broad intent, is you're saying -- is what you're saying, it's still the broad intent of the company? After you get past that, that things would average out in that 3% to 5% long-term goal?","Richard D. Fain","Yes. We haven't -- what we said is low to mid-single digits and we -- yes, I think lumpiness is a good way to put it there. That will tend to happen in our business. Also, we're conscious of the fact that there's a big difference from a marketing point of view of whether you get a ship frankly in time to enjoy the spring and summer seasonal markets or whether you get it later in the year without that benefit. But yes, I think over time, we want a more moderate growth. And that probably means that this thing -- that to -- sorry, low to mid-single digit.","Jason Liberty","Shaira, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I want to take a stab at a question from a different angle. When you discuss net yields next year, I know it's early, but you did put it out there in the release when you mentioned that your objective is to generate net yield improvement. Just wondering, as you contemplated that comment, are you thinking about or are you assuming that the discounting we're seeing in the Caribbean could continue and the China, Japan conflicts could continue?","Brian J. Rice","Felicia, we're basing that -- well, first, I do want to point out in my commentary, I did say despite the current pressures in the Caribbean, we are seeing year-over-year pricing improvement. And I think it's important to recognize that. In talking about 2014, again, I want to emphasize, it is still extremely early in the process. But based on the current order book that we're seeing in all quarters and the current booking trends that we're taking in for 2014 business, and as I think Richard alluded to, right now, we're taking the lion's share of our business coming in as -- for 2014. We're feeling good about making a statement and putting it out there that it should be a year-for-yield improvement. But we've not gotten any more specific than that.","Richard D. Fain","Felicia, I will just address at least from a personal point of view that one of the items that you mentioned, which is the China-Japan situation. And that is unpredictable, of course. And we have no greater insight than anybody else. But if you look what is happening regionally in the area, I don't think one would read into that a lot of reasons of thinking that, that is going to suddenly resolve itself between now and then. So I think we're trying to be quite realistic about that. And I frankly think that's something we will have to deal with for a while. And at least in my own thinking, that's behind it. And yet, overall, when we're looking forward, we're feeling awfully good about the year.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That makes sense. And then Richard, while we have you, can you just clarify when you said that the year is better than you thought. I'm just a little confused because your yield guidance has essentially gone down since the high end has come down, right? And I know it's only inventory on [indiscernible]. But it's come down. So that seems to me that at the beginning of the year, you thought you'd be more towards the low end of your guidance range. Is that what you're trying to say?","Richard D. Fain","No. Well, I guess what I was simply pointing out, if you look at where we said we would be for the year, the only change that we're sort of highlighting is the foreign exchange and the Grandeur. And if you then say -- we started the year not expecting the negative kind of publicity that we all, as an industry, received. In any other environment, you would look at that and say, \"Oh, well, it's been a bad year from a publicity point of view.\" That clearly has been driving yields down. And in fact, it has had a more negative impact on our sales than we originally expected it would. And so since we're ending the year from a business point of view, essentially on balance than where we originally said, that implies that other things in the market have actually performed better. And so that's what I was referring to. It's not the totality. But it's -- we effectively got to the same position in terms of profitability from the business despite an unexpected hit from that source.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. You're focused on profitability and I was thinking about yields. That's the difference. Okay. And then, Adam, just final question. I was just wondering, you've started booking the Quantum. It's been booking for a while right now. Just wondering, not looking for specific numbers, but maybe directionally, what kind of premiums you're seeing there? And has there been any impact on the Oasis and the Allure?","Adam M. Goldstein","There hasn't been any effect on Oasis or Allure, nor would we expect any with Quantum being operating out of a New York base. We're really looking to improve our presence in the northeast catchment market. Not that there's anything wrong with Explorer of the Seas, but we're incredibly excited about what Quantum of the Seas will bring to cruising in that area and to our brand. It's too early to comment anything about Quantum yield from a share booking standpoint. The initial reaction to her adjusted for capacity was even more exciting than the initial reaction to Oasis. Now that might have been because of the time we released Oasis, the market couldn't quite comprehend what it was all about. And because of the fantastic success of the Oasis class ships, it's built up people's enthusiasm for what we might do next to even higher levels. And I think when we revealed the features of Quantum of the Seas in April, the market felt that its expectations of us were more than justified. And they can't wait to be on board. So I can really only comment on the early booking numbers. Right now, it's very promising. And with 3 of these wonderful ships coming to us over the next few years, we expect them to be a very powerful element of our fleet.","Jason Liberty","Thank you for your assistance today, Shaira. And we thank all of you for your participation and interest in the company. Ian will be available for any follow-ups you might have.

Thank you.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jason Liberty, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. Joining me here in New York are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carola Mengolini, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide.

Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thank you, Jason, good morning, everyone. It's been an eventful quarter and certainly an eventful year and as always, I am pleased to give some commentary.","I'll start by commenting on the unusual set of hurricanes we experienced this summer. I know that most of the country has moved on to other things, but this was such an unusual and such an impactful set of storms that I need to comment on it.","Firstly, I would like to emphasize just how unique this series of storms was. It's highly unusual to be hit with five major hurricanes in a row under any circumstances, but these storms were unusual for another reason as well. Each of these storms followed a path that exactly matched our major trade routes. Somehow these storms seemed to know exactly when and exactly where to hit to cause the most destruction and the most misery. The devastation was heartrending. You can't look at all the damage without feeling the pain our friends had to bear and are still experiencing every day.","For us, we have estimated that the direct cost of the storms was in excess of $55 million. That makes it by far the most expensive hurricane season in our 45-year history, but we and they are resilient. You can see how hard our friends in the Caribbean and Texas and in Florida have worked to return to normalcy. They have worked tirelessly to rebuild the homes and the communities that were so devastated.","Communications in the Caribbeans are now greatly improved and water has largely been restored. We can attest to the living without electricity is a trial, but the situation is getting better every day and is now mainly a problem in the rural and residential areas. Fortunately, everyone seems to appreciate just how important tourism and especially cruise tourism is to the economic recovery that will be so critical going forward.","The government and the local people are highly focused on bringing the tourism infrastructure back up to snuff. They know that tourism continues to be the economic driver that will speed the recovery effort and they have pushed us to reinstate our calls as quickly as possible. The travel agent community has also been a very positive force in this effort. They can get the word out better than anyone else and they have done so yet again here.","I've had a chance to visit some of the hardest hit areas and I am very impressed with the progress they are making. We resumed operating cruises from San Juan almost a month ago and we returned to the destination as a port of call later this month. This Friday, we returned to St. Thomas, where our partnership to restore and enhance the iconic Magens Bay has already produced dramatic results. St. Maarten has been rapidly rebuilding and we will return there in just a few weeks.","Overall, I am happy and frankly very impressed to report that the tourist areas, where our guests go, are largely back to their original state. While many residential areas that were damaged are still under repair, the tourist areas that we visit suffered less damage and have mostly been cleaned up.","I am also proud of our industry's response in providing humanitarian assistance to this area. Their needs are so great that our impact is necessarily limited, but it's good to be able to give back a little to the region that has been our partner for so long.","I'd like to thank our employees, who worked so hard during this challenging period, in many cases, having to do so while dealing with their own exposures at home. The logistical issues were daunting. For example, we had to make more special working (06:14) arrangements in just the month of September than we would normally expect to do so in any normal three-year period. We had to reroute ships, make new provisioning arrangements and communicate with thousands of nervous travelers. Our team did it all smoothly and efficiency. Hats off to them.","As an aside, having spent time looking at the situation in the Caribbean, I am convinced that the Caribbean countries that were hit will emerge down the road stronger than they were before the storms. It's going to be a tough slog to get there, but get there they will. There is clearly a determination, not only fix what was destroyed, but to rebuild better than ever. Cruise tourism will undoubtedly be one of the drivers of that resurgence and we, at Royal Caribbean, intend to be a constructive force in that process.","I'd like to turn now to the impact of the storms on our bookings. Obviously, the hurricanes interfered with our normal bookings in the area. During the several weeks of the storms, Caribbean bookings dropped precipitously, both for the hurricane period and for the period beyond. None of that is surprising, but what is surprising is how quickly our bookings in the period recovered. The drop-off in bookings was very rapid, but the recovery was also rapid. Today, virtually all our bookings in the region are back to pre-storm levels. There are exceptions, but these remain outliers.","Now, this pattern of rapid recovery has implications well beyond just these storms. We believe that this unusually fast recovery may actually be a reflection of an important cultural change. We've noticed a significant change in the way people in general seem to respond to unusual events, whether those events are weather, geopolitical acts or something else.","Years ago, a bad incident would have a strong and a lasting impact. Whenever something happened, our bookings would fall and they would stay down for an extended period. People seem to call curl up in a ball and obsess about whatever the issue was. It could and it did impact bookings for a really long time. Even after the event left the front page, people would persist in focusing on it. Eventually, they would move on and bookings would recover, but that process seemed to take forever.","More recently, we have seen a much more sanguine response. Instead of the incident lingering for a long time, the recovery seems much quicker. People seem to be more apt today to see such events as ordinary with little impact. The events still aren't normal, but they are seen as less relevant to the broader audience. In effect, the public appears to become inured to such one-off events. They're still interested in the event and concerned about it, but people seem to continue living their lives with less change. They move on.","From a societal point of view, I have to say that it's discouraging that we've reached such a point. It's distressing that incidents are now so common that society seems to have formed a thicker skin towards them. On the other hand, as a response to the actual events, it's probably more constructive if society doesn't allow such things to interfere with our normal day-to-day existence.","From a purely commercial point of view, this cultural shift is very helpful. It's much better for us if the negative impact of such incidence is so much more fleeting than in the past.","Against this background, we are extremely pleased and frankly a little surprised that we are still able to stay within our EPS guidance for the year at a range of $7.35 to $7.40 a share. Indeed, a couple of months ago, when we upped the midpoint of our guidance to $7.40, we thought that we were being reasonably aggressive with our forecast and we certainly didn't expect that we would be raising it anytime soon.","The fact that we have been willing to able to withstand a $0.26 hit from the storms and still achieve this level of profitability reflects how strongly the market is performing this year. It's also nice that this performance has allowed us to reach an interesting milestone. Our Double-Double program continues to produce the forward momentum we were hoping for. Indeed, it is exciting and gratifying to note, as [Technical Difficulty] (11:06) press release that we've already achieved Double-Double for the 12 months ended September 30.","Specifically, for the last 12 months, our earnings have been more than twice our 2014 EPS and our ROIC exceeded 10%, all this three months ahead of schedule. As you know, the purpose of the program was to galvanize our 67,000 employees to all pull in the same direction. I am overwhelmed by how well our teams responded to the program and I'm extremely grateful for their efforts and initiatives to make the Double-Double so successful.","Now, we won't declare victory until 2017 is over, but the very strong energy created by the Double-Double program has been a home run for us. We want to see that energy, that passion, continue indefinitely. Since this is the final year of the Double-Double, we wanted to develop a program that leveraged the culture and the discipline instilled by that program while also including a broader set of goals.","As suggested in earlier calls, these goals are focused more on the drivers of success than only the outcomes. We're calling this new journey our 2020 Vision. The 2020 Vision program calls for further improving our brands' already-excellent guest ratings, calls for raising employee engagement scores and it calls for achieving the sustainability commitments made with the World Wildlife Fund. These drivers should help us achieve double-digit earnings per share by 2020, while further improving our double-digit return on invested capital. We see 2020 Vision as our guiding focus for the organization over the coming years.","Now, shifting back to the consumer environment and the current booking environment, I'd like to comment on another important consumer trend. The very strong year we're having is, of course, partially due to a strong economy and to the high level of confidence that appears to be prevalent among consumers. However, the trend also reflects a significant shift in the way cruises are viewed by the public, a shift which has been building for a long time.","On most of these calls in the past, we've discussed the supply\/demand curves for the cruise industry. Usually, the focus of that discussion has been very much weighted towards the supply side. Implicitly, the demand side of the equation was used almost as a given. As a result, we rarely talk much about demand and focus more on supply. I think that misses an important part of the equation. So, today, I want to comment more on the demand side of the equation, because we're experiencing some very real changes there and those changes on the demand side are important to our future.","The first point I want to make relates to a phenomenon that seems to be impacting consumers generally. You've all heard me comment in the past that people seem to be more interested today in buying experiences than buying things. 5 or 10 years ago, I probably would have cited Samsung or LG as a primary concern of ours, because people are so focused on buying new TV sets or new appliances or whatever.","More recently, the focus has decidedly shifted to people looking for experiences, in particular, experiences for the whole family. This shift in the way people vacation plays beautifully to our sweet spot. I believe that we're experiencing the benefits of that shift today and it's partially the reason that we're doing so well.","Another factor is that while societal norms have changed, we also have changed to accommodate. Over the years as people's habits and tastes have changed, we've shifted our product to take advantage of these new consumer buying practices. For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, there was a dramatic shift in the way ships were designed and built. Instead of ships being designed as a form of transportation, we shifted to ships that were designed specifically for cruising. Our aspirations at the time were for ships to be more yacht-like.","Now, that change really brought cruising into the modern era, but in the 1980s and 1990s, there was another change in people's expectations. The public's vacation desires changed and we needed to shift with them. We shifted our design focus from trying to be yacht-like to being more like hotels.","We started to design ships with more spacious public areas, better outfitting and more amenities onboard. We wanted the ships to feel more opened, to have more things to do and to have more luxurious feel of a modern hotel. Our design metaphor changed from trying to seem like a yacht to feeling more like a full-service hotel. Again, that fit in nicely with trends and consumer interests and it resulted in better sales.","Now, over the last decade or so, travel habits have further changed and our ship designs have shifted yet again. Consumers now want a more active vacation and more things to do and to experience. In response, we changed our design metaphor from trying to be like hotels to being more like cities.","Today, our ships have more of the features of cities with a cornucopia of activities, amenity and design. We don't simply check the box with bars and restaurants and discos; we talk about designing parks and gardens and neighborhoods and quiet spaces. We model our medical facilities on urgent-care facilities. Our specialty restaurants compare to anything you will find on land. We have every stripe of nightlife. You can sail with us for seven nights and never experiencing the same things twice.","And again, adjusting our products to suit the changing wishes of the consumer has paid off in a very nice way. Our guests really enjoy the broader choice in amenities that the new ships offer. And again, accommodating these wishes has resulted in improved demand for our product. At the same time, we have also focused on doing a better job of integrating the shipboard experience with the destinations and the cultural enrichment.","Ironically, as we continue to offer more and more options for the guest on the ship, their appetite for new experiences off the ship has grown as well. We are taking many steps to satisfy this area too. And again, we believe that accommodating such desires drives improvements to our bottom line.","The result of all this evolution has been that cruising and people's vacation habits have evolved together. Vacation habits have evolved over the years and we have evolved our offerings to suit. This has made cruising a more relevant and important vacation for more and more people, nirvana.","Now, all of this change in consumers' vacation preferences and in our products has driven a major change in the way we view our customers and in the way our customers view us. This may be one of the more profound changes in our industry for a long time. To understand this profound shift, we have to look at historical approaches. For many years, old and outdated misconceptions about cruising were common in the population. Many consumers thought of cruising through the lens of outdated stereotypes.","We, in the industry, often complained about the inaccuracy of such misconceptions and our marketing was geared to correct the image. This sense of not being properly understood pervaded our industry and profoundly influenced all of our communications. But then, a strange thing happened. The evolution of consumers' changing tastes and of our changing product converged. The prevalence of these old erroneous perceptions has waned. In effect, we have won the perception war.","We have crossed the tipping point and we are moving beyond it. Yes, there are still many people out there who suffer from these old misperceptions, but their numbers are dwindling every day. Today, while this issue remains an issue at the margin, cruising has now firmly established itself as a relevant and a desirable vacation option for consumers generally. This is especially true as we look at the younger generation, who have embraced cruising as never before.","For example, one independent study performed by the Harris organization asked people whether cruising is perfect for them or very good or whatever. In the last six years, the percentage of respondents who state that cruising is perfect or a very good fit has almost doubled. Even more exciting is the fact that the percent of millennials giving that answer has risen even more quickly. You can see that on slide 2 graphically.","Now, I'm not suggesting that these misconceptions don't still exist. We know that they do and we won't be happy until everyone understands what a great vacation cruising offers and why it is relevant to them. Nevertheless, we believe that cruising has moved into a new arena and that the increasing relevance of cruise in peoples' holiday plans is partially responsible for the improved environment that we are and have been experiencing. We are proud to have been a part of this transition and we intend to continue pressing the envelope so that this trend will continue to expand.","Looking forward, we believe this increased demand will play an important part of the supply\/demand equation as we enter a period with somewhat higher supply coming online. 2017 has been a particularly strong year with a good economy, good consumer confidence driving high demand. Our forward bookings for next year would indicate a continuation of yield growth. However, it would be na\u00efve of us to continue to assume that the unusually strong 2017 would continue indefinitely.","Now, before I turn the call back to Jason, I'd like to comment on some of the other changes happening in our business. This past August, we cut steel for our new Quantum Ultra Class ship and we confirmed the ship's name, Spectrum of the Seas. Like its sister ships, Quantum of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas, she is destined for the Chinese market, where she will make her debut in 2019.","This is our 10th year in the China market. While this market has recently experienced bumps in the road, we believe that the significant investments we have made, the management team we have developed and the assets that we have deployed put us in a strong leadership position. We remain committed to this strategic part of the world and we believe it will continue to pay good dividends.","Now, I also can't wait to show off our new arrivals next year, Symphony of the Seas, which is arriving in spring of 2018, and Celebrity Edge, which debuts in the fall of 2018. We also recently announced that Azamara Pursuit will join our Azamara Club Cruises brand, which increases our capacity there and upgrades our capabilities.","We are also introducing two major fleet renovation programs for our Royal and Celebrity brands, Royal Amplified and Celebrity Revolution. We believe that these major upgrading efforts will help further solidify our position as leader in hardware and in innovation. With so much going on, you can see why we are excited about the future.","Before I turn the microphone back to Jason, I want to express again my appreciation and my admiration to all of our employees who worked so hard and with such skill at delivering fantastic vacations to so many.","With their support, the future is indeed bright. Jason?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thank you, Richard. Before getting into the results, I want to discuss the impact of the unprecedented hurricanes on our key statistics. As we stated in the release this morning, the hurricane impacted our third quarter by $0.20 per share and approximately $0.06 per share for the fourth quarter for a total of $55 million for the full year.","The impact from the storms, especially related to the lost APCDs, are causing some noise in our key statistics. While I'll address these aberrations when I talk about the third quarter results and fourth-quarter and full-year guidance, I wanted to recap what is happening in the underlying business.","Overall, strong demand for our Europe, North America and China products, combined with strong onboard trends, are expected to offset virtually all the impact from the hurricanes. We had viewed our previous revenue guidance as reasonably aggressive, but we were pleasantly surprised by the additional strength and last-minute demand.","Looking at expenses, we are ending the year roughly where we had previously expected except for costs related to the storms, including our humanitarian efforts. However, the metrics may look different for two reasons. Firstly, the storms caused us to shift the timing of some expenses from the third quarter to the fourth and in addition, the storms caused cruise cancellations, which resulted in fewer APCDs. The absolute amount of costs remained as expected, but the cost per APCD went up.","I will now walk you through our results for the third quarter. We have summarized our third quarter results on slide 3. For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $3.49 per share, which was $0.04 better than previous guidance. These results include a $0.20 negative impact related to the hurricanes. Better-than-expected close-in demand from our core products, combined with the timing of costs, more than offset the impact from the hurricanes.","Our net revenue yields increased 5.3%, which was more than 1 point higher than the midpoint of our guidance. Strong close-in demand for China, Europe and North America products drove the outperformance.","Onboard revenue yields were up 5% for the quarter, driven mainly by better-than-expected shore excursions and Internet packaging. While the storm-related revenue losses negatively impacted our absolute revenue for the quarter, there were essentially neutral to overall yield as the yield of the impacted sailings were similar to the quarter average.","Turning to costs, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, were up 5.7%. Our cost metric came in higher than guidance, driven mainly by the reduction in APCDs. On an absolute basis, cost came in better than expected, driven by timing.","Now, I will share trends we are seeing in the demand environment for the balance of 2017. As you would expect, demand for Caribbean sailings softened as the hurricanes moved to the Caribbean and Gulf beginning in late August and while Caribbean bookings are virtually back to normal, we did experience five to six weeks of softer trends.","However, demand for all itineraries remained strong throughout and our total bookings have been above last year's levels since the last earnings call, both including and excluding the Caribbean. As such, we remain in a much better book position than at this point last year for the fourth quarter and are up nicely on both rate and volume.","Before getting in to our early thoughts for 2018, I will take you through our full-year guidance and fourth-quarter guidance.","I will now discuss our full-year guidance for 2017, which is on slide 4. Net revenue yields are expected to be up approximately 6%, an improvement versus prior guidance despite the negative impact of the hurricanes, which is affecting the year by approximately 20 basis points. The combination of the outperformance in Q3 and strength in our underlying Q4 business is driving the increase in our yield guidance for the full year.","Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up approximately 2% for the year. As I noted earlier, our actual costs, excluding the hurricane, are generally in line with our previous guidance, but the per-berth figures are distorted by the storms.","We anticipate fuel expense of $686 million, down slightly relative to prior guidance. We are 65% hedged for the remainder of the year at a price of $498 per metric ton. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $7.35 to $7.40.","In summary, we were able to stay within our EPS guidance for the year at a range of $7.35 to $7.40 despite a $0.26 negative impact from the hurricanes. We've been able to accomplish this through a strong book position, solid onboard revenue trends, better fuel prices and better-than-expected performance from our joint ventures. We remain on track to exceed our Double-Double goals, which we established more than three years ago.","As Richard mentioned, on a trailing 12-month basis, we have already reached these targets. The culture and disciplines established under the Double-Double program will provide the foundation for our new three-year financial targets that we are terming 2020 Vision.","The Double-Double formula for success, our modest yield growth, strong cost control and moderate capacity growth, combined with improving our customer advocacy and employee engagement, is expected to further improve on our double-digit return profile and deliver double-digit earnings per share by the end of 2020.","Before I walk you through our fourth-quarter guidance, I would like to elaborate on capital returns. Since our last earnings call, the company increased the quarterly dividend by $0.25 to $0.60 per share and repurchased $125 million in shares. These actions, combined with the upcoming completion of our Double-Double program and our new 2020 Vision, further reflect our commitment to continuously improve our returns for our shareholders.","Now, let's turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter, which is on slide 5. We anticipate net yield increase of 2% to 2.5%. While the hurricanes did not negatively impact per-berth figures in the third quarter, the extended period of soft bookings and impact of future crew certificate redemptions is reducing Q4 yield by approximately 50 basis points, mostly on our San Juan departures.","Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up approximately 8.5% for the quarter. We have planned significant cost increases in this quarter due to the planned investments and revenue-generating activities. This increase in our cost metric was exasperated by a shifting cost from the third quarter and lower-than-expected APCDs due to the hurricanes. Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be $1.15 to $1.20 per share for the fourth quarter.","Now, I will take you through some preliminary insights for 2018. While it's still too early to provide a lot of commentary on 2018 trends, I will share that our full-year APDs and load factors are currently higher than same time last year. This is particularly encouraging when you consider that we were in a record book position at this point last year and are seeing even better early booking trends for 2018. We will not be providing specific guidance for 2018 until our fourth quarter earnings call, but we do expect 2018 to be our ninth consecutive year of yield improvement.","Before moving into some cadence considerations for next year, I wanted to note that 2017 is expected to deliver a yield improvement of approximately 6%, which is not typical and will make for more difficult comparables next year. There are a few factors that will influence the cadence of our yield throughout 2018.","In 2018, three of our brands will welcome a new shipment to their fleets, increasing our overall capacity to approximately 4%. We will take delivery of Symphony of the Sea (sic) [Symphony of the Seas] (32:22) in the spring, introduce Azamara Pursuit in late summer and welcome Celebrity Edge in December.","In addition, we'll see a year-over-year yield benefit in the first quarter from the 2017 sale of Legend of the Seas. As such, we will see hardware benefits in all four quarters of 2018. We will have more drydock days in the first half of 2018 than we did in 2017, which will help yield in Q1 and hurt yields in Q2. Also, the earlier timing of Easter will boost yields in Q1 at the expense of Q2.","Now, I'd like to provide you an overview of our deployment for next year. Caribbean itineraries will count for about half of our total deployment next year and will include the introduction of Symphony of the Seas in the Caribbean in the fall and new summer programs in the Northeast.","Before heading to the Caribbean, Symphony of the Seas will sail her inaugural summer season in the Mediterranean, replacing Freedom of the Seas in Barcelona. As a result, Europe itineraries will account for 17% of our total capacity, up slightly versus 2017. Approximately 18% of our 2018 capacity will be in the Asia-Pacific region, which is slightly less than in 2017. Mariner of the Seas will transition back to the Caribbean market in the spring, resulting in a short-term capacity reduction in China prior to Spectrum of the Seas' arrival in 2019.","Now, I would like to ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for your questions. Your first question comes from Steve Wieczynski of Stifel.","Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. Hope you're all doing well. These are outstanding results. I guess the first question is going to be around the 2020 Vision. When you break it down, I know you're going to hate me saying this, but it does actually seem conservative at the first glance with only kind of 11% to 12% EPS growth through 2020. At this point, I think consensus is already kind of north of $10 a share for 2019. So, can you help us think either what analysts are getting too aggressive with or maybe help us think about some of the drivers you've embedded in your thought-process?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Hey, Steve. We won't hate you and also not surprised by the question. So, I think, as we look at the 2020 Vision, again, what we're seeing specifically is that we expect our earnings to be in the double-digits by 2020. We're not giving a specific target of a specific number, but I'll tell you, I would say that the foundation which is moderate yield growth, good cost control, moderate capacity growth, that is what we believe from what we've seen in the past is that kind of formula to success. So, I don't think we're trying to guide to a specific number. What we're trying to do is again pivot the organization to coordinates that are based on that formula that get you to double-digit earnings.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Steven, it's Richard, and if I could just add something to that, and yes, we won't hate you, but first of all, I think there aren't many companies that are giving three-year targets with \u2013 you said only 11% to 12% growth rates. I think that's pretty good in the first place. But I also think \u2013 I like to emphasize that these programs really aren't intended to be financial targets for the investment community. This is something that really that we use for our employees, for ourselves to drive how we manage the business. And it's really intended to focus on the drivers of success, on the good performance of our fleet, the satisfaction of our guests, the engagement of our crew, et cetera.","And so, the financial metrics come out of that, but internally, I think that was really the success of the Double- Double, was it got everybody pushing to the things that would make us successful. And so, I would just emphasize that. I understand it needs to have that financial metrics as well and those are important and that's also part of what we need to communicate to our people. But I would just like to say, I think we feel quite good about the 2020 program and think it will drive us to continue to excel.","Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Got you. And then, second question, I don't know if Rich or Jason wants to take this, but it seems right now there's this perceived notion out there from a bunch of investors that there could be first quarter Caribbean weakness for 2018 given the storm impact. Can you guys address that and maybe help us understand if that's something you're seeing at this point?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah, sure, Steve. Certainly, as we mentioned in our remarks, yeah, there were five to six weeks of softness in demand and obviously that would be specifically around the Caribbean. So, what I would lead you to that we've said that we expect to be up on both a rate and volume basis for 2018. I would add that we were actually up quite nicely on both rate and volume for the first quarter and the Caribbean is contributing to that.","Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Got you. And if I can sneak one more quick when in. Richard, you obviously have your pulse on Washington, D.C., and there's obviously been a lot of chatter out there around potential tax policy changes. Can you guys just give us an update in terms of how you're thinking about any potential changes coming down the pike?","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","I think Adam maybe would comment on that.","Adam M. Goldstein - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Hi, Steve. Well, obviously, we, like probably every other company and industry in America, is watching very carefully what's happening in Washington. Our industry association, CLIA, and our tax advisors are clearly spearheading that. We're not expecting any changes at this point, but this is a fluid situation. We have to watch every day.","The cruise industry, although we're growing and we're proud of our success and where we've come over the last 50 years is still a very small industry in the scope of the types of things that seem to be on the radar screen for the politicians in Washington. So, at this point, I would say the outlook is positive for us.","Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys. Great results.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. So, I was interested in the commentary that Q3 came in better because of the close-in strength in Europe and China and North America, but one question each on China and Europe. First in China, will you expect yields to actually be positive for the full year or just sort of better than what you had thought? And then, is the lack of capacity growth next year in China changing your conversations there about price with the charter sellers and where those commitments are going?","And then, on Europe, I was just curious about the close-in strength, because one would sort of expect that because airfare has to be \u2013 in other words, I guess I was going to ask to that (39:54) European strength is driven by European sourcing or North American sourcing, just I would think the airfare component would make it tough to do last minute and just thinking about the fact that you're going to have European supply growth next year to help us think about that. Thanks.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Hey, Robin. I'll just take the first point on China yields for this year and I'll let Michael talk about what he \u2013 or his point of view on China with there being lower capacity for next year. Obviously, we haven't and we don't guide specifically by market. So, the comment around strong close-in demand was relative to our expectations and it's a trend that we had been seeing creeping up, but it was even better than we had expected in the third quarter and also with that going into the fourth quarter.","And I'll let Michael talk about 2018.","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Hi, Robin. Yeah, we're kind of encouraged a little bit by the capacity reduction in the China market in 2018 and there's also the rumors with regards to South Korea opening up and we're all waiting to hear if there will be an announcement on that. So, when you combine those two factors together and you look at the work that we've been doing on building distribution and opening up all of the channels, we feel quite good about China in 2018. And we know we have good years and then some bumpy years, but we're feeling as if 2018 is looking quite promising.","On Europe, there's always that switchover time on the sourcing for European product. It sources typically very well out of the North American market and the closer you get into sailing, then we tend to source more out of the European markets. One of the things that we've got in 2018, of course, is Symphony of the Seas will be introduced into Europe and will be sailing out of Barcelona. We're very encouraged by the forward bookings for Symphony of the Seas and it's outperforming Harmony at the moment.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then, maybe just one final clarification on the double-digit earnings, I just want to make sure that it's really \u2013 you mentioned double-digit earnings, not double-digit earnings growth rate. So, I'm assuming that means at least $10 a share, which would actually be above that 10% earnings growth. I just want to clarify that, what you mean by that and I'm curious how much share repo you're including in that. Thanks.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes. So, Robin, as it relates to the target, the target is double-digit earnings per share between now and 2020. Now, to get to double-digit earnings, you need to have double-digit earnings growth rate as well, but the target is specifically around earnings. And then, as it relate to share repurchase, the goal is based off of how we see the underlying performance, a moderate yield growth, good cost control and moderate capacity growth.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Now, that's helpful. Thanks.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian of Citi.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Just two questions. The first, so when would you expect booking trends to fully normalize where passengers are maybe not a little bit concerned about going to the Caribbean? And then, sort of the second part to that is some of the other regions were a lot stronger and then \u2013 or we started (43:49) strong. Do you think that some of your North American passengers are, let's say, foregoing booking Caribbean cruises and deciding to go elsewhere like Europe or Alaska?","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Hi, Greg. We're already seeing booking trends return to normal on pre-hurricane levels. So, we've already seen that kind of correction take place. And then, with regards to this, the idea that maybe people are booking other destinations other than Caribbean, I mean that happens in the normal give and take of a year anyway, that people do switch out destinations, but we haven't seen anything noticeable in terms of a trend occurring with regards to that idea.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Right. And then, the level of also promotional activity, I'm assuming that's elevated to spur demand in the Caribbean for the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2018. How long would you expect that to last assuming that it is elevated? Is that just in the next few months and then, things should be very normalized?","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Yes. I mean, it's funny you bring that up. I don't feel like our promotional activity has been any greater or any lesser. After the hurricanes passed, we did have more promotional activity for a short period of time, but now, we've gone into our regular kind of promotional calendar cadence that is quite typical as we push into Q4 and as we look at how we're booking into 2018.","So, it's really return to its normal levels. And, of course, just as a reminder, we have our price integrity program that we're very pleased with and that's also helping us out.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jaime Katz of Morningstar.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everybody. I have a question surrounding capital expenditures actually, given that they have bumped up a bit and I know you guys mentioned that, that was going to be mostly surrounding this Royal Amplified and Celebrity Revolution program. And I assume a lot of those efforts tie into some of the evolving consumer behaviors that you discussed earlier. So, will you talk a little bit about what the majority of that delta and spend is going to and then, if maybe some of that is tied into some of the technology that you're planning to launch? Thanks.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","So, hi, Jamie. It's Richard. Most of that are the two ship modernization programs that you cited. It's been something and we found we've been very successful with that in some of the ones we've been doing over the last few years. So, this is a continuation of that. Some of the things that we've done on our newer ships are just really very impactful in terms of consumer trends and what they want. And so, that's very much a part of it. So, that's the bulk of it actually. There is also some of it that is related to our technological investments, in particular our digital investments, which we call Excalibur.","So, we've talked about that. We have an investment day, where we're going to be talking about that in today or tomorrow in a lot more detail, but we see those technological investments. We've frankly already been making a lot, but I think we see the need increasing. And so, that is part of the increase that you're referring to.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar, Inc.","Thanks. And then, just out of curiosity, for the high-end consumer, are you guys seeing some better spend there? Obviously, there's a new Azamara ship coming on and I'm wondering if there's any like bifurcation that you guys are seeing between sort of the middle-market consumers and the high-end consumers that are bolstering your confidence in that part of the market. Thanks.","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Hi, Jamie. It's Michael. I mean we're seeing really all over kind of a lift in onboard spend coming from all segments and we think that's reflected really in consumer confidence and how well the stock market is doing. So, whether it's the higher-end customer or mid-level, everybody is spending a little bit more at the moment.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","And, Jamie, just to add, I mean I think one trend in which we talked about in our remarks is one thing you see across the board is you're seeing people spend much more money on experiences than on things like retail as an example. So, my commentary around shore excursion or Internet or beverage more things that are experiential in nature than something out of the gift shop is where you see this change and that's not just in the higher-end, it's really kind of across all classes.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar, Inc.","Does that change how you think about allocating the square footage of the ships going forward with the retail space versus with space to do other things versus parks or activities like zip lines?","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Hi, Jamie. Yes, it does. Interestingly, when we talk about the two programs, Celebrity Revolution and Royal Amplified, really a lot of the thinking that's going into that is really thinking through how our guests spend is changing and you'll start to see that when we bring these ships out of the modernization, the program that we've really reallocated space to generate better revenues in areas that we see guests now naturally gravitating to.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar, Inc.","Excellent. Thank you so much. See you tomorrow.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Beckel of Bernstein Research.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks for the question. I have kind of a high-level question, maybe for Richard or whoever wants to jump in, but it sounds, Richard, like you're painting a very positive secular picture of the industry in general, spending trends, which would seemingly suggest that yields could continue to improve, maybe not at obviously the rates of this year, because of one-time events, but certainly very strongly.","And I'm just wondering, how do you square that strength with what appears to be a long-term internal goal of moderate yield growth? You said you're trying to pivot the organization to certain coordinates. Are you pivoting them to like a 2% to 4% range or you actually trying to get them to push a little bit more aggressively to the higher-end of that range?","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Well, David, thank you. I think you summarized my view accurately. I do think that the underlying strength of the industry is powerful and I think that will continue. I just think one needs to be a little bit realistic about how quickly you can move those things. And so, we think, obviously, we are not trying to direct the organization to a level of yield increase. We clearly want to maximize that. What we want to pivot the organization to is to provide the things that will drive consumer to our travel agents and to our website and basically to buy cruises. And hopefully that will result in continued strong yield improvement.","So, by saying moderate yield increase, I think we are really trying to telegraph that to get strong results, we don't need staggeringly large yield improvements. We are an industry where if we can get relatively moderate yield increases, that results in really very strong bottom line growth. But obviously if we can break out of the 2% to 4% range, as we did this year, we intend to exercise every effort we know how to accomplish that.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's helpful. I appreciate that. And just one quick follow-up on China. You mentioned or you touched on it briefly, but particularly as it relates to recent strength you've seen relative to your expectations, can you pinpoint that strength at all to certain efforts you've made in like widening the distribution channel or anything more directly influential by your activities in that market?","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Yeah, David. I think we've been actively developing the China market for many years and certainly the last couple of years we increased the intensity of the development of the various channels and we put a lot of focus on that development and we put a lot of resources into the market to do that.","We've been quite pleased with the results that we generated, particularly, for example, in the direct channel, it's done very well for us. And then expanding the base of sellers, of course, beyond the typical wholesalers, we've made progress there. So, I think, we've seen \u2013 we're beginning to see the results of the work that we've put into the market over the past several years beginning to come, pay back for us.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on Steve Wieczynski's question that he asked at the beginning of the call and maybe word it a different way. I'm just wondering if there's anything in the 2020 Vision that would preclude you from getting to double-digit earnings by 2019 or maybe said in another way, would it be a stretch for you to get there by then?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","So, we haven't even given guidance yet for 2018, let alone for 2019.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very demanding.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Very demanding, I know. I think we're going to stick to, as we look at our targets, that one of those being that we reach double-digit earnings per share and continuing to improve on our ROIC. Obviously, you can do the sensitivities on yield and on cost that would get you there before, but I think that, again, we'll kind of focus on moderate yield growth and good cost control during the period.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And sticking with the 2020 Vision, that obviously implies your optimism for the next three years. There's certainly a narrative in the investment community that states that supply increases over that time could limit the growth trajectory of your business. So, I was just wondering can you discuss to what extent supply played a role as a variable in your outlook and how you think it impacts your growth over the next several years?","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes. Hi, Felicia. It's Richard.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","So, obviously, I think that was a point I was trying to emphasize. You have to look at both sides of that. You have to look at the supply side of it and the demand side of it. And I absolutely agree with you, the increase in the supply is clearly a factor in that. I think the reason that I'm expressing confidence is that I believe that the increasing demand more than compensates for that, because the new ships are more attractive and they bring in more people and also they attract higher yields.","So, I think we've tried to look at this and we've tried to put the 2020 Vision together, taking into account all that we know about the next year \u2013 the next few years and that includes the supply side, which, as you say, is a little bit higher than it has been.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And then, my final is just housekeeping. And, Jason, thank you for giving us the color on the cadence of the quarters. I just wanted to clarify, do you expect yield to be up each quarter next year and then, just that second quarter could be up less because of the dry-docks and then also taking into account kind of a shifting Easter or do you expect the second quarter to be down?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","I would say that we expect yields to be up in all four quarters, but as you pointed out, we expect it in Q1 to be higher than it would be in Q2 because of the shift in Easter and the dry-dock impact.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","You got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking my question. If we think about the puts and takes to costs for next year, you called out more dry-dock days and you have the gain on Legend that you're comping against, but then you also have the hurricane tailwind as well. So, is it reasonable to think that next year, costs will look a lot like 2014, 2015 and 2016 as far as the growth rate in terms of NCC, ex-fuel? And then, any thoughts on how we should think about D&A for next year as well?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","All right, Jared, well, again, we're not going to give specific guidance for 2018. I think you did a good job of talking about some of the headwinds and some of the tailwinds. What I can tell you is that we will continue. It is very much ingrained in the DNA of the company for us to strongly manage our costs, but, of course, as you said, there are some headwinds that we're going to have to manage through next year like we do every year.","And on the D&A side, I think the key considerations are obviously there's new assets that are coming into play with Symphony, Edge, which is really not in effect because it comes in the latter part of the year and Azamara Pursuit, those are some of the elements that will impact D&A. So I would expect D&A to rise obviously more than 2017, because in 2017, we had no new capacity.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then, just one housekeeping question. You talked about the cruise credits and the impact that that's having in the fourth quarter. Can you just help me understand how you accounted for those and will we see an impact of future yields in 2018 as well from those credits or is it just an immaterial impact?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","I mean it's all immaterial relative certainly to our revenues. Effectively, if we had a passenger that had changed or had called up because of the impacted sailing and weren't able to take them, we would provide future cruise certificates. So, a lot of that negative impact would have been taken in the third quarter and then as those future \u2013 as those certificates get redeemed, they would be \u2013 that's when the revenue would be recognized in the future.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Morning, everyone. Two quick questions, most of my questions have been answered. Jason, you mentioned higher drydock days in the first half. Just from 30,000 feet in 2018, will most of the dry-dock days be, or the comparisons be higher in the first half? Will they trend to more normal levels in the second half? What I'm trying to get a sense of is overall in 2018, will drydock days be relatively close in 2018 versus 2017?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes, hi, Harry. No. So, I would say that in 2018, certainly the dry-dock days are \u2013 or most of them are in the first half of the year. But the dry-dock days are more typical to what we saw in 2016 versus 2017, but I mean, those are kind of accounted for in the capacity growth numbers that we provided.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","And then, my other question, we haven't touched on Cuba. Given the travel warnings, have there been any, I would doubt it, but any impact on the inquiries that you're getting for cruises to Cuba and to what degree are those cruises that are touching Cuba getting a pricing lift as a result of it?","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Hi, Harry. It's Michael. Initially when all of this hit the media, we obviously received a spike in calls and communication from guests and travel partners. Everybody was trying to seek clarity, but after literally a few days, things just returned to normal and the business is very good for our Cuba product.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","All right. Very good. That's it for me. Thanks.","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you and congratulations, gentlemen, and the whole organization. Just a couple follow-up here, whoever wants to take this. I mean, clearly, the domestic capacity, it's been talked about growing and so forth, but, Richard, you even mentioned that you think going forward here, the demand's more than going to compensate for that looking into 2019 and 2020. Can you give us an update, what's happened the last three years here with first-time cruisers? You've said before that that's has started to grow, and more in particular, the millennial mix? How much that has grown. Maybe we'll get it tomorrow, but I wanted ask the question here.","And then, also an update on the fleetwide rollout of the Wi-Fi in the Excalibur. Has that changed in any way or are you accelerating that here looking into 2018 and being into early 2019?","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Hi, Tim. I'll take the first part of the question with regards to new to cruise and millennial. Certainly for \u2013 well, all of the brands, but in particular for Royal, we've got an acute focus on developing the new to cruise and millennial market and we've been very pleased with the progress that we've made over the past three years.","And in fact, if you go back before that three-year period, we were actually in a situation where year-over-year, we saw a decline in new to cruise and millennial and over the past three years, we've seen a very good increase year-over-year. So, that's kind of very much part of our marketing and communications focus on new to cruise and millennial and we're seeing good progress and we continue that journey.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Any color you can \u2013 I apologize, any color you could give there related to millennials as a percent of the mix versus three years ago?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Hey, Tim, just to kind of give you a sense, over the past several years, we're carrying about 33% more millennials than we did several years ago.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Tim, on your question on the rollout of Excalibur, the new digital system, it's pretty much going along the path that we had previously said. The hurricanes did mess us up a bit, obviously, disrupted operations for a good six to seven weeks and that probably caused a corresponding delay in some of the detailed rollouts.","But overall, we are still expecting to be, and you'll see more of this tomorrow, of course, 12% or 13% by the end of 2017, half by the end of 2018 and almost everything by the end of 2019. So, by and large, as frustrating as the disruption was, that's pretty much going on track.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you, gentlemen.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Okay. Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. Your final question comes from Sharon Zackfia, William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, I'm glad to have snuck in.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Good morning.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Two quick questions. On the equity investment income, that was up a lot year-over-year. So, maybe if you could touch on what was driving that. And secondarily, I feel like you guys cite Internet every quarter now and I don't know if you've given this before, but I don't recall, what percent of passengers now are taking up your option to have the Internet available to them at sea? And have you taken any price on that or is that really a penetration metric that we are looking at?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Hi, Sharon. On the equity income side, it's really mainly the story around our joint ventures. TUI would obviously be the leader of that, but we also have a joint venture with Pullmantur now and it's really those are the kind of underlying drivers on below the line.","And then, on the Internet side, no, we don't give a percent in terms of how that number has grown over time, but it is a combination of both rate and penetration and that it is driving up our Internet as well as we keep introducing new things that attract people to use more bandwidth on the ships.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Great. Okay. So, thank you, Paul, for your assistance with the call today and we thank you all for your participation and interest in the company.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to introduce Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jason Liberty. Mr. Liberty, the floor is yours.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are; Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carola Mengolini, our Vice President of Investor Relations. During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our investor website www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures.","Please note that we do not undertake to update the information in our filings as circumstances change. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP historical items can be found on our website. Unless we state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency adjusted basis.","Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview of the business. I will follow with a recap of our second quarter results, provide an update on the booking environment, and then provide an update on our full year and third quarter guidance for 2019. We will then open-up the call for your questions. Richard?","Richard Fain","Thank you, Jason and good morning everybody, and thank you for joining us today. I'm going to take a slightly different tact than usual. Because there's so much happening at Royal Caribbean, I'm going to use my time this morning to philosophize a bit on our strategic focus and positioning. Jason will then come back and provide more color on the near-term results. But I do have a spoiler results. We are very pleased with these results.","Last month, I had the pleasure of participating in the inauguration of our newest ship in the Galapagos Celebrity Flora. She is the first ship ever built specifically for sailing in the Galapagos and she is doing extremely well. A beautiful ship with the latest advances in sustainability, magnificent features for our guests and even research capabilities.","I also observed one thing in the Galapagos, it's very relevant to how we manage our business. Ever since Darwin published his book, Origin of Species, the Galapagos have been a symbol of the concept of evolution. What you notice there is that the species that thrive are not the strongest, not the smartest, not the fastest. The species that survive there are those that are most able to adapt. That's true for animal species and we believe it's true for corporate species as well.","We believe that to succeed in today's world, you need to adapt to an ever-changing environment. The ability to adapt is often called innovation, but innovation is really adapting to and\/or leading change in a rapidly evolving world. I'm proud of the people at Royal Caribbean who continue to innovate and to adapt to that fast-changing world.","We continue to do well because we continue to adapt our product to the changing desires of our current and future guests and the changing environment which we operate. Innovation has been and is a central tenet of our ability to drive change and to respond to change.","Itineraries are just one example. They remain one of the most important considerations for our guests and it is both our duty and our opportunity to satisfy that demand in the best way possible. The most recent manifestation of that is Perfect Day at CocoCay. To describe Perfect Day as a home run wouldn't do it justice. It really resets the bar in the short cruise market.","But it's important to note that Perfect Day wasn't designed to steal customers from other cruise lines it was designed to attract customers who otherwise wouldn't be taking a cruise and it's doing that beautifully. I think this makes an important point about our industry and why the industry has grown and why it continues to grow so nicely.","I know that many of you on this call follow other industries and that many of them have a highly inelastic demand curve. If I have a property in Dallas, there's really very little I can do to attract more visitors to Dallas. And so my focus is on getting a bigger share of those who are already there. Since the demand facilities in Dallas is inelastic and in the short term the supply is inelastic, the only short-term strategy is trying to get a bigger piece of that pie.","In the cruise industry, the demand curve even in the short-term is highly elastic. We can and we do attract new visitors to travel to our ships from far-flung places. Furthermore, over the years the cruise industry has innovated i.e. adapted to better cater to what people want in their vacations.","Simply put the industry has created better mousetraps and the world is beating a path to our door. As a result, the demand for cruising is growing faster than might otherwise have been expected and as such as the cruise lines that are adapting and innovating.","Travel advisers are our dominant distribution channel. And while the industry has grown and adapted so too have our travel partners. The role of the advisor of today is as different from the travel agent of yesterday as the cruise industry of today is as different from the cruise of yesterday.","It is no accident that this year even with a significant industry supply growth and even with significant company supply, we are enjoying one of the largest levels of price increases. As our industry continues to adapt the industry, the entire industry will continue to grow.","Part of that adaptation is the changing desires of the vacationing public. I've long talked about how cruising has become more relevant to a public that now craves experiences over material goods. That message has now become so ubiquitous that the other day I heard a ball-bearing manufacturer talk about the experiential aspects of his product. I can only imagine. But in the cruise industry the phenomenon is very real and the focus on experiences plays beautifully to our sweet spot.","For as long as I can remember, people have worried about overcapacity in our industry. More correctly, I think, we should be talking about the balance between supply and demand. It's a balance not a question of one or the other and the distinction isn't mere semantics.","Talking about overcapacity implies that there is a fixed amount of demand, but a changing amount of capacity. In fact the situation is almost exactly the reverse with a relatively fixed amount of capacity and a highly variable amount of demand. Fortunately, our industry has been able to adapt to take advantage of this elastic demand curve. That is why it has continued to confound those who expect lower demand growth.","One other issue that is often raised, especially recently, is the R word, recession. Our results have unquestionably been buoyed by an amazingly robust and sustained economy and we hear lots of pundits predicting the imminent end of that strong economy. In fact, the only other time in my career when I can recall the predictions being more consistently negative was two years ago, and we all know how that turned out. But a downturn will certainly occur at some point and we are very conscious of that.","To my earlier point, when circumstances change, we are prepared to adapt. While no one is recession-proof, looking forward, I think the industry has features that make it recession-resistant. The growing appeal of our product, the relative price attractiveness, the fixed cost component, the portability of our assets, et cetera; all of these things make us better able to do well even in bad times.","A good example of that would be China, where Spectrum of the Seas started operating just a few weeks ago. Conventional wisdom suggests that bringing a new ship into a market whose economy is weakening ain't such a good idea. But Spectrum and our other ships there are doing very well, despite the softer economy.","The reason, again, is that we are building the market, not taking it as a given. Adaptability and innovation are helping us produce improved results, with more capacity in a poor economy. Again, a good supply\/demand balance by improving demand, rather than by trying to live with the supply.","So this year is proving to be a very good year on many fronts. However, this month has also seen important milestone in another related area that's important to us and that area is sustainability. As most of you know, in 2016, we launched the partnership with the World Wildlife Fund, to take our sustainability efforts to a new level.","At Royal Caribbean, we believe that what gets measured gets better and we established specific goals in three areas of sustainability. We did this in conjunction with WWF, not only to be able to benefit from their expertise, but also because making specific measurable targets provides an accountability that is important to the success of a program like this.","The three areas where we established these quantifiable goals were in the areas of carbon footprint, sustainable destinations and sustainable food production. Specifically, we undertook a 35% reduction in carbon footprint from our 2005 base, offering 1,000 tours certified to the GSTC sustainability standard and responsibly sourcing 90% wild caught seafood globally and the 75% of farm seafood in North America and Europe. We set a public goal to reach these objectives by the end of 2020.","I'm happy to report that we are on schedule. We achieved our carbon footprint goal earlier this year and just two weeks ago, we certified our 1,000th sustainable tour operation. We're not there yet on our sustainable food sourcing goal, but we're working diligently to do so and hope to reach that target soon.","Looking forward, we have progressed rapidly on numerous fronts in this area. Our new ships will use clean LNG as fuel. We have installed Advanced Emission Purification system on most of our fleet, our program to eliminate single-use plastics keeps advancing; more and more of our ships are zero landfill capable, our efforts to reduce food waste is ramping up, our experimentation with zero-emission fuel cells continues, et cetera, et cetera.","It's been a terrific year and it looks set to continue to do so. Each quarter, we have been able to announce not only that we're doing well, but that we're doing better than we thought at the end of the prior quarter. We are also looking at 2020 where the early bookings that are exceptionally strong and provide optimism for 2020 as well.","We continue to be highly focused on controlling our costs. Obviously, some of our aggressive strategic and innovative moves in areas such as technology and projects like Perfect Day, put pressure on these metrics. But so far, we think the return on these investments has been exceptional and we continue to focus on generating strong returns on our investments going forward.","In this update, I have focused more than usual on our strategic focus. As I used to say on the A Team, I love it when a plan comes together. We have a strong alignment throughout the organization on our strategic vision. We see adaptation\/innovation as a key driver of success.","We see positive momentum favoring a good supply\/demand picture for our company and for our industry. We see sustainability as a sine qua non. We see cost discipline as core. And we see a workforce that is passionate about delivering on all of the above. Adaptability\/innovation is a complex challenge and as Charles Darwin observed, it's a never-ending one. We are doing our very best and we'll continue to do so.","And with that, I'll ask Jason to provide an overview of the results. Jason?","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Richard. I will be talking about our results for the second quarter of 2019. These results are summarized on slide 2. For the quarter, we generated adjusted earnings of $2.54 per share, which is $0.07 higher than the midpoint of our May guidance and 12% higher than the same time last year.","Our net revenue yields were up 9.5% for the second quarter, which was in line with our May guidance, despite the negative impact from the Cuba travel ban. 400 basis points of this year-over-year improvement was driven by the additions of Silversea, Perfect Day and Terminal A, with the remaining 550 basis points being driven by our core business.","The abrupt removal of call to Cuba from June sailings on Majesty of the Seas and Empress of the Seas costs us 30 basis points in year-over-year yield for the quarter. While the Cuba policy change was financially and operationally painful, our underlying business remains very strong, as we both outperformed on onboard revenue and saw a further close-in demand for our core products.","Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, were up 8.9% for the quarter, which was 110 basis points better than the May guidance, driven by timing. As we often said, we manage our cost an annual basis rather than on a quarterly basis. Therefore, the positive cost variance that occurred in the second quarter will simply reappear as an increase in our cost in the back half of the year.","This quarter, we also outperformed below the line, driven mainly by lower interest cost and better performance from our joint ventures. As Richard mentioned this morning, our brands are executing beautifully and demand continues to accelerate, which is evident in our strong book position.","We remain nicely ahead in rate and our load factors are in line with the same time last year. At this point in the year, we don't expect to be booked ahead in the volume, given our increased mix of short Caribbean capacity and the impact from the abrupt Cuba itinerary changes.","This consistently strong demand isn't a function of one thing, but many. The general economy continues to be strong, consumer trends and demographics are very aligned with our business. Our global footprint allows us to be nimble in adapting to market level trends and we continue to innovate the overall guest experience.","Industry-leading hardware like Symphony of the Seas, Celebrity Edge and Celebrity Flora combined with new product innovations, like Perfect Day at CocoCay and Excalibur, as well as the modernization of our fleet is significantly contributing to our top line and earnings growth.","Demand trends from North American guests continue to be very strong and that strength is more than offsetting the modest volatility from our European consumers. As a result, all of our core itineraries are performing in line with or better than we expected when we gave guidance three months ago, with Caribbean and China sailings contributing the most to our improved non-Cuba revenue outlook.","The strong performing Caribbean accounts for a smaller percent of our capacity for the rest of the year than it did in the first half of the year, at just under 50% of our Q3 and Q4 inventory. We're always happy to see new bookings outpace our expectations, but what has been particularly impressive over the past few months is the pricing we are receiving for sailings, visiting Perfect Day at CocoCay.","Pricing on these sailings has consistently been outpacing our lofty expectations, and has been a major contributor to our improved non-Cuba revenue outlook. European itinerary accounts for 16% of our full year capacity about 20% of our capacity for the remainder of the year.","These sailings have continued to book in line with our expectations, with Celebrity Edge receiving significant pricing premiums and the overall fleet booked ahead of same time last year in pricing for both the Mediterranean and the Baltics. Demand and pricing for North American guests have remained strong, and as a result, significantly more and more North Americans are sailing with us in Europe this year.","On the last call, we discussed the volatility in demand we were seeing from the UK given the ongoing Brexit uncertainty. Since then, we have seen an improvement with bookings from the UK up double-digits over the past three months. Europe remains our second highest yielding summer product, and we are pleased with how this season is shaping up.","Our highest yielding summer products, is of course Alaska. Alaska sailings only account for 5% of our full year capacity, but are just over 10% in the third quarter. We've upped our game from a hardware standpoint in Alaska this year with Celebrity Eclipse, Ovation of the Seas and Silver Muse is replacing older hardware along with the first ever Alaska season for Azamara. These hardware changes combined with strong demand from North America, are contributing to our overall yield growth this year.","And finally, our Asia-Pacific itineraries account for about 15% of our full year capacity and 14% of the rest of the year. Spectrum of the Seas arrived in Shanghai last month, and is getting very strong demand for sailings from China, which will remain year-round. The addition of Spectrum of the Seas combined with further expansion of distribution channels in China, are driving yield growth for the products.","Our Australia and Southeast product account for 6% and 4% of our capacity respectively, and are performing in line with expectations. It's still a little too early in the booking window to comment too specifically on trends for 2020. However, I will note that we are very pleased with the performance thus far. Prior to the recent Cuba-related redeployments, our load factors were in line with last year's record high and rates were and still are up nicely in all four quarters.","Now let's turn to slide 3 to talk about our updated guidance for the full year 2019. Overall, we are updating our guidance to $9.55 to $9.65 per share, which includes a $0.15 improvement from our previous guidance due to better second quarter results and an improved revenue outlook for the second half of the year.","As it relates to our key metrics, we expect our net revenue yields to increase in the range of 7.75% to 8.25% for the year. This updated guidance includes the negative impact of approximately 70 basis points from compensation in itinerary changes related to the recent travel restrictions at Cuba.","Excluding this impact, the midpoint of the company's net yield guidance has improved by approximately 40 basis points versus our May guidance. The improvement in our underlying business is split pretty evenly between Q2, Q3 and Q4. Overall, our net yield guidance on a core basis, whereas when normalizing for Silversea, Perfect Day, the new terminal in Cuba is now more than 5%.","This performance is already one of the strongest in our history, and came during a period of more than 6% of capacity growth in the industry. This revenue performance is really a testament to the strength of the demand for our brands and for cruising.","From a cost perspective, we expect our net cruise costs excluding fuel to be up 10% to 10.5% in constant currency. This updated guidance reflects an increase in our costs, mainly related to the travel restrictions to Cuba. We expect fuel expense of $703 million for the year, and we are 59% hedged.","In summary, based on the current business outlook, along with current fuel prices interest in currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $9.55 to $9.65 per share.","Now we can turn to our guidance for the third quarter, which is on slide 4. We expect net revenue yields to be up approximately 6.5% for the third quarter, including a benefit of approximately 340 basis points from the combination of Silversea, Perfect Day and Terminal A. Yields are also included a negative impact of 110 basis points associated with Cuba.","The impact of Cuba and a lower mix of Caribbean deployment combined with the timing of the Silversea consolidation, the launch of Terminal A, and the delivery of new hardware are contributing to a smaller, although still significant yield increase in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Net cruise costs excluding fuel for the quarter are expected to increase approximately 11%.","So in summary, based on current fuel prices interest and currency exchange rates and the outlook expressed above, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be approximately $4.35 per share.","With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for question-and-answer.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.","Steve Wieczynski","Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning, guys, and Richard well done on getting an A team reference into your prepared remarks. I guess if we go back to January, and we look at your original earnings guidance, which had a midpoint of $9.87, look at your midpoint now which is $9.60. Is it fair to say if you didn't have some of these headwinds you guys have spaced, you would be on a pace for probably a mid-10s kind of year? And I guess what I'm getting in here is you've absorbed $0.30 from Cuba, $0.25 from Oasis. So if my math is right, I think about $0.25 in Q1 FX. Is that the right way we should be thinking about how 2019 could have shaped up?","Jason Liberty","Hey Steve, first, thanks for the question and thanks for the A-Team. Kudos for Richard.","Richard Fain","It's very important that we have cultural literacy as well.","Jason Liberty","That's right. That's right. But that's exactly right. There's definitely been some real hits this year as it relates to those three elements that you pointed out which are also relatively accurate to what the impact has been for this year. So, if we didn't have Cuba if we didn't have the Grand Bahama incident, and certainly FX in the fuel, we would be talking to a better number that would be at the low to mid-$10 ranges.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay. Got you. And then Jason you also back in January you laid out a 350 basis point positive impact from Silversea, CocoCay in the Miami Parking terminal. Has anything changed there in terms of those impacts to yields?","Jason Liberty","Those impacts are pretty consistent on the yield side as well as on the cost side. Now, of course, when we talk about Perfect Day, we're really specific about the on-island activities. And clearly the strength that we're seeing on the ticket yield side is well ahead of what we could have even imagined. It would be in terms of demand which is also bolstering either strong commentary that we have as it relates to the strength for our business in the Caribbean.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay. And the last one for me and I understand it's still early in terms of booking patterns and I don't think you're going to answer this question really. But when we look out to the 2020 and the Caribbean bookings, can we get any color in terms of how they have trended since the Cuba news came out?","And I understand you just opened up the booking window for some of those ships, but I think the fear that's out there today in the marketplace is that Caribbean yields will materially roll over in the first half of 2020 given the lack of Cuban premiums?","Michael Bayley","Steve its Michael, I'll jump in here. On the two ships that we had going to Cuba for 2020, we just opened them up and, of course, one of those ships is going to Perfect Day. So, the demand as Jason had mentioned for Perfect Day has been -- really it's exceeded our expectations and our expectations were pretty high. So, we're kind of pleased with what we're seeing for 2020 in the Perfect Day. It's a key driver for the Caribbean performance. And the ships that we dropped out of Cuba, we're feeling pretty good about how that's performing. I mean its early days, yes, that's we've said.","Jason Liberty","And Steve just to kind of add on to it, especially as it relates to Perfect Day; one we launched Perfect Day in the middle of the second quarter and of course, there's a ramp-up to that island. And so we also plan to take a lot more guests next year in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 to Perfect Day. And so I think just the general comments that we have around the back half of this year and also my comments on 2020 are generally saying that we continue to see very strong demand trends for the Caribbean.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay, great. Thanks guys. Appreciate all the color.","Michael Bayley","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, thank you so much. So, Jason you guys have raised your net yield by 40 basis points ex-Cuba when you talked about the strong demand that you've seen in the core brands in the second half and because of that how you raised your -- it basically essentially raised your second half guidance.","I think you've touched on some of this in your prepared remarks and in your answer to Steve's question. But just wondering if you could just kind of peel back the layers, give us some more granular cover -- color to what's driving that increase for your second half? You've talked about Perfect Day, but how much of it is priced? How much of it is onboard just general strength that sort of thing?","Jason Liberty","Yes. Sure. Just kind of focusing on the back half of the year thinking of the strength that we're seeing is coming from two elements; so, about half of it is being driven by better ticket; and half of it is being driven by better-than-expected onboard. And on the onboard side it's more of the experiential type of activities which would also include Perfect Day.","But on the ticket side, there's really -- all of our core products are seeing very strong demand. And so they're either in line with our expectations or they're doing better. And the two areas that are doing better which I had in my remarks has been the Caribbean and has been China. And those are two areas where we've seen an acceleration in demand.","Felicia Hendrix","Great. And that's a perfect segue to my follow-up which is Europe and you talked about the softness there and we all know that you sourced globally and you take the best customer for the best itinerary.","But just wondering for those who may have some concerns about Europe and kind of the European source demand if that could be an overhang going forward, can you just talk about your perceived optimism? Or maybe I should say cautious optimistic about Europe?","Jason Liberty","Yes. Sure. So also what I had commented on was that over the past several -- or really the past two months we've seen much better trends and consistent trends from Europe and also for the U.K. But, of course, because there was some volatility going through WAVE and then going into early second quarter, we recognized much better -- for stronger demand trends coming from North America for European sailings.","And as you've pointed out we've got this global very diverse footprint that is supported by yield management tools and systems and people that manages demand globally. And so when we see better demand trends form one market versus another, we shift our sourcing there. And so Europe is in a very good shape and as it relates to the products -- and as I said these demand trends from Europe have now been stabilized, but we've seen increases in their booking activity over the past couple of months.","Richard Fain","Felicia, it\u2019s Richard here. And then just to add on to that. You asked for some color on how it's looking going forward. And you recall very well in -- first of all, we never give real guidance for the coming year this early in the process. So, we're doing what we normally do.","But if you recall back to 2016, we thought the end of that year and the beginning of 2017, we're unusually good and we might never see such a strong forward picture again. In the year later, we were looking at an even stronger 2017 and then an even stronger 2018 and the same thing happened last year.","Now, when we're looking forward, we are -- from a color point of view, we are feeling the strength of the market. The Caribbean and the ability to not only handle the situation in Cuba but essentially the rest of the Caribbean absorbed that without a lot of difficulty.","It's really unusual that you continue to see such a positive forward perspective as we're seeing in the market just in terms of general tone and color.","Felicia Hendrix","Thank you so much.","Richard Fain","Thanks, Felicia.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley","Great. Thanks. And I think you addressed a lot of my questions which had to do with the fact that that Cuba impact you've called out that $0.30 was kind of for half a year. And then when we look into 2020. But I would think a significant part of that would have been sort of compensating people that have booked already, which you don't necessarily have to do for things that weren't sold yet in 2020. And discounting for things that are very close and often not an issue in 2020, maybe the ship going to CocoCay even does better than it was going to Cuba.","So is there -- if you had to think about EPS impact from Cuba in 2020, is it fair to say, it will be well less than half of the EPS impact that you had called out in 2019? Like in other word I think people might just feel comfortable that there's not any kind of serious drop from that in 2020?","Jason Liberty","Thanks, Robin. So on the Cuba front, as you pointed out, yes, there's a few things that come with an abrupt change in an itinerary. So one, as you mentioned was compensation. The second is that of course, you have guests that cancel and of course say an itinerary like Cuba, it's not like just a change in the Caribbean itinerary. This is a itinerary that people specifically had signed up to go and visit. So certainly, that had its financial and operational impacts for this year. As Michael commented, one of those ships is going to go to Perfect Day. And of course, demand for going to Perfect Day is exceptional.","And so I think we expect that ship to do well. And the other ship was also on a very good deployment for next year. So we certainly don't expect that $0.30 impact that we've experienced this year to kind of settle in at the long-term. And I don't know if the answer is going to be half of it or better than half of it. But I know Michael and his team and Larry on the Azamara team and the Silversea team that are having impacts from Cuba have put action plans in to try to recover as much of that as possible.","Robin Farley","Okay. Great. And then just kind of a housekeeping item, just looking at your CapEx schedule, it looks like it's gone up by about $100 million a year for the next couple of years. And that could just be rounding and not be anything, but I wondered if there was some particular initiative or something that changed that schedule a little bit? Thanks.","Jason Liberty","Yes. Sure. And I think it is mainly rounding there's a little bit as we ordered Icon 3 that plays into that number. And then of course, your announcement on Holistica and so forth in some of our planning in terms of investments in the coming years.","Robin Farley","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citi.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. Thank you. Yes. Just following up on Richard's comments about CocoCay, not primarily competing with other cruise line, but really trying to get from other passengers from other travel segments. What percentage of those passengers are maybe new-to-cruise? And then also from a benefit perspective, are you seeing that primarily help you from a deal perspective? Or is it just the overall demand for cruising and that helps up what you absorbed some of the path that you have said otherwise went to Cuba? So there's some other benefits from just increasing your load from that.","Michael Bayley","Hi, Greg, it's Michael. In total, in 2019 and through into 2020 11 of the Royal Caribbean ships will be going to Perfect Day at CocoCay. So you can imagine the amount of -- the volume that we're taking to Perfect Day has gone up by a factor of about four and we were already taking a lot of guests to CocoCay before we underwent all of this work and changed the whole experience. It's also a key component of our shore strategy that we introduced a couple of years ago.","If you may recall, we put Mariner Navigator Independence through Royal Amplified and we completely changed the product offering in the shorts market and literally put the biggest best ships in that short market, which is about 20-something percent of the entire American cruise market. So we already started to see demand increasing for those products, because they are truly great products.","When you combine that with Perfect Day, we've seen a real uptick. Since we opened Perfect Day and people have begun to experience it, I think to date we've taken maybe 350,000 people to Perfect Day since we opened. It's now rated the number one resort globally for Royal Caribbean. It's knocking it out of the park in terms of truly delivering a phenomenal day. The guest satisfaction is extremely high. And so the demand that we're seeing is coming from all segments. It competes very well with Orlando.","It's got a truly wonderful day both thrill and chill and it is also driving new-to-cruise, because approximately 40% of the short market is new-to-cruise. So it's really ticked the box across all of these different dimensions. And in terms of the demand that we're seeing since we've opened and people beginning to understand what kind of experience this is, we're seeing both significant increase in volume and of course that's driving rate.","Jason Liberty","And Greg, just to add. Really, over the past several years and you've heard us talk about this we've talked about this also in our Investor Day. But as the consumer trends and demographic trends point more towards experience in travel and multigenerational and really kind of spans the products that we offer, you combine that with the innovations that we talked about, whether it's Perfect Day at CocoCay or the modernization or the new ships. And then you have just perception of cruising has really accelerated. And all of these things are leading to a real change in mix where there is much more new-to-cruise as a percent of our mix than we have experienced really in decades. And that is because of all these different things in which we're doing and the industry is doing to attract new and fresh demand.","Michael Bayley","And just add to that Greg, I think Carola is trying to organize an investor trip in November to Perfect Day. Hopefully, you'll get an opportunity to come and see it, because when you've seen it and experienced it, you're going to truly understand what a game-changer this product and experience is.","Greg Badishkanian","Yeah. That\u2019s a good Investor Day. Thank you. Great color. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with MorningStar.","Jaime Katz","Hi, good morning. What you guys have talked about in the past is Excalibur quite a bit which wasn't really mentioned very much on this call. And I'm curious how the rollout has really helped facilitated the outperformance, any insight maybe that could help us quantify that or what you guys expect going forward would be helpful? Thanks.","Richard Fain","So it's Richard and the Excalibur rollout has been excellent. It's now -- our objective was to get at\/or close to across almost all of our fleet before the end of this year and that continues to be on track. The -- it's really worked out very well for doing two things: It improves the experience to our guests, it makes it easier to board, it makes it easier to do what you want; most importantly it really simplifies the process.","When we started this kind of technology process Lisa talked about giving people back the first day of their vacation, because they didn't have to spend that time to orchestrate themselves. And with the approximately, with the photo recognition, you're going from a lengthy process to essentially no process. That helps improve the experience and then that, of course, helps us with our ticket sales.","But it also helps our onboard revenue because it makes it easier for people to get to the experiences, to do the activities that they want to do. It makes it easier for them to do so in advance and people who book in advance tend to spend more onboard when they get there. So it's been a home run for us.","The Excalibur team has been exceptional and really put together something that people really like. And we're building on it. So what you see so far is really a platform that you can build on. And so we didn't talk about it, we have so much to talk about, so we always have to make choices.","Jaime Katz","Of course. And then regarding Spectrum, it sounds like the launch has been slightly more successful than some of the prior launches into the China market. Has onboard spend been trending any differently for passengers on the ship relative to ships in the past? Have you guys been able to generate more revenue maybe than previous?","Michael Bayley","Yeah. Hi, Jaime it's Michael. Yes Spectrum's launch was really good. It was a great event. We've got massive coverage. Demand for the product has been very strong. We've made great progress with the evolution of the distribution channels and we're feeling pretty good about where we currently are in the journey that we're on.","The product has been exceptionally well received. We've got a very -- I'd say a fairly significant price gap between competitors and the market. And we've seen a real uptick in the onboard revenue. I think we've got the right product and we're attracting the right demographics. And we're seeing that with the onboard spend. So I would say we're certainly seeing a recovery from a couple years ago. We're feeling good about Spectrum. We're feeling good about China.","Richard Fain","Operator, next caller.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So I want to drill down a little bit more in the 2020 booking commentary, which you referred to as exceptionally strong. But can you also provide us a little bit more of a quantitative context? Because I think you've said prior to the Cuba, the load factors were in line and rates were up in all four quarters.","So is the implication that since the Cuba travel ban here in the last 1.5 month call it that the load factors are now down in 2020? And I guess help me just to reconcile that with some of the positive tone you have here on the booking commentary? And then any differences in brands or regions that you would call out as well?","Jason Liberty","Yeah. Sure Jared. And I try to address it in my remarks probably I'll try to be a little more specific about it. So our load factors for next year are, I mean very slightly down year-over-year, which is really what you would expect and what we do expect because of two things, one of which is we have more short products on next year and that short product is closer in booking product, so that would be one thing; and second is we just redeployed the Cuba ships and so you're somewhat kind of starting over again on those ships. And so that had a little bit of an impact on our load factor.","But what I also said was that our pricing was nicely up. And that includes no longer having a high yielding Cuba as part of that mix. And so we are quite encouraged about the booking environment for 2020 whether it's the booking volumes, whether it's the pricing that we're seeing and the load factor change is what we very much expected it would be. And, of course, as we've talked about in the past if we would like to, we could have that load factor be higher. But we are always trying to optimize and maximize our revenue.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. Thank you. And then just two quick housekeeping questions for me, I mean you've absorbed a lot of CapEx in the last few quarters and obviously haven't repurchased stock. Are you still expecting to repurchase stock in the back half of this year when CapEx decelerates here a little bit?","And then separately for next year as you think about fuel expense, your hedged dollar value goes up from this year to next year. But I think some of that might just be you're now hedging the higher dollar MGO instead of IFO, so correct me if I'm wrong on that? And any color you can provide on how we should be thinking about fuel expense next year. Just with all the puts and takes on the hedges, I think make it a little bit difficult to try to forecast that for us.","Jason Liberty","Yeah sure. So I'll talk about the fuel first and then I'll talk about stock repo for a second. On the fuel side that's -- what you said was exactly right. If you look at our fuel mix as it relates to our hedging program, we are indexed higher to MGO relative to our historical mix. And now we've also talked about in the past that our expectations is generally the mix of fuel that we burn today.","IFO versus MGO should remain more or less the same because of our investments and great execution of implementing our AEP systems on the ships, which will allow us to continue to burn the higher sulfur IFO fuel. And so I would -- I think that's how we set our hedge portfolio for next year.","As it relates on the stock repo side, as we said we're going to do it opportunistically and also to kind of make sure that we're in line with our credit metrics of 3 to 3.5 times and we certainly get to that location here in the back half of the year. And so we will be looking at that as we always have opportunistically.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. Thank you.","Jason Liberty","You got it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim Conder","Thank you and congrats to the team on that continued strong execution. Just a couple gentlemen here, looking to 2020 just -- is it fair to say, you're not really seeing any change in the trends that have been exhibited so far in 2019, as far as the regional demand and sourcing?","In particular, also you haven't really commented that much on Germany. So if you can just remind us the percentage you sourced out of Germany of it global? And then -- and specifically what you're seeing out of TUI, just an update there in the trends that we're seeing given softening economic outlook? And of course what's been out there in the markets from other competitors?","Jason Liberty","Yes. Sure. So, first as it relates to 2020, I'm not going to start kind of breaking this down by region or by market in any way. But I think as Richard pointed out which I think is really the case is, each year we talk about how strong the demand environment is as we look into the future year and it ends up being that or better.","And as we look at 2019 which is another very strong year as I talked about in my remarks, if you kind of strip out the Perfect Day's and the part of Miami in Silverseas in Cuba 5-plus percent yield improvement on a pretty larger capacity growth year.","Those trends that we have seen this year are very much what we're seeing as we're going into 2020. And so I'll kind of leave it there versus -- I'm not going to get into the different markets and the products at this time because it is too early for us to provide specific commentary there.","Germany a very small percentage of our overall capacity for our consolidating brands, obviously most of our sourcing for TUI is for TUI cruises. TUI cruises is having another very strong year. The demand for that product even though there's been, I know some reports about concerns around Germany in terms of demand that is not really hitting TUI cruises at least to-date, it's not.","Tim Conder","Okay. Thank you. And then secondly, just wanted to ask on the destination development there's been a lot of talks about CocoCay and how exceptionally well that's performing. How are you -- just any update that you can give us Jason or Richard or Michael whoever wants to take this, how you're thinking a potential timeframe for maybe something else elsewhere in the world similar to owned and operated and then anything else and when we should maybe start hearing something out of Holistica JV of some additional projects there? Thank you.","Michael Bayley","Hi, Tim. I think as Richard had previously stated obviously destination and destination development is now really at the center of our forward-looking strategy. And we've really started to mobilize behind that both with Holistica which of course we announced a month or so ago. And we're now deeply engaged in multiple possible opportunities and particularly the one in Freeport that where the team is working on currently.","With regards to Perfect Day, I think we've been genuinely delighted with the demand that we're seeing for Perfect Day and the experience that we're delivering is really at a high level. So I think it's fair to say that we're seeking further opportunities in this space. And when we're ready to make announcements, we'll be happy to let you know.","Tim Conder","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Instinet.","Harry Curtis","Just as a quick follow-up on that question. Maybe if you can think of put this into perspective at CocoCay, what inning are you and in terms of its ability to drive your long-term growth in the Caribbean? And are the returns on invested capital such that, it really does make sense particularly to either add capacity there? Or to seek just an entirely new opportunity that will drive a 5-year growth in the Caribbean?","Michael Bayley","Harry, it's really difficult to answer those questions in a detailed way. I think it's pretty obvious that -- and I think we've kind of -- we stated this now at several times, we're generally delighted with the performance of Perfect Day and the response has been outstanding.","We feel as if it's going to be a key driver of our future growth. It's certainly demonstrating that to-date with demand from all markets. I think we will pursue opportunities and when we're ready to make announcements we'll be happy to make those announcements.","But we're really pleased. I think this idea of really curated outstanding destination experiences that can manage volume for Royal Caribbean is a direction that we're heading in.","Jason Liberty","And Harry just to kind to Michael's comments, you obviously enhancing the guest experience is kind of a key tenet for us. But also obviously, it's improving shareholder returns. And going into these investments obviously our goal here is to be investing in ways that are improving our return on invested capital and from that improving our shareholder returns.","So these are pretty high bar projects. And as we've talked about Perfect Day is doing exceptionally well and exceeding, I think those lofty profiles for returns.","Harry Curtis","Thanks Jason. And my second question is, in talking with kind of potential non-investors if you will, the issue is always concern over not necessarily this year, but the next year.","And so maybe it's pretty good idea to give folks a sense of even though you're booked at roughly the same level so far for next year, give folks a sense of historically at this point in time, how well booked is Royal Caribbean for the first quarter? How well booked is it for the second quarter because there is enough business on the books in the first and the second quarters. Do that sort of lay that fear?","Jason Liberty","Well I'm not going to start breaking down our book status by each quarter. But the commentary that I would say, the bullishness that we have about the booking environment certainly relates to Q1 and Q2 of next year on which we have a much better visibility into.","And I think it's -- for those that are always concerned on the capacity side, I would just I would remind everybody that next year, our capacity is up only about 4% versus this year our capacity was 8%. And if you normalize for Silversea it was a little bit over 6%.","And so we feel very good about the book position and we feel very good about what the next four quarter looks like, we feel very good about the next six quarters look like at this point.","Harry Curtis","I guess my -- maybe if I can just add -- ask a more general way of \u2026","Jason Liberty","Sure.","Harry Curtis","\u2026 presenting that. If you look at the first half, is it reasonable to think -- I mean, go back five years or seven years, is it -- can you say to investors who are skeptical that you've got 40% of the business in the first half booked already or 50%? I mean, is it -- is there a chunky enough business amount of business on the books, because look we are doing really well? This is not a business that comes in last-minute as evidenced by the business that we have in the first half of 2020 already on the books.","Jason Liberty","Yeah. Well, I haven't memorized -- or I've lost the data points from five to seven years ago. But what I do know for a fact is that we are in a much stronger book position on a volume or as a percent of our future revenue than we were five to seven years ago. Each year we've talked about being booked ahead and at higher load factors and rates. And so as a book percentage, especially over the next 12 to 18 months we're in a very strong book position.","Richard Fain","Harry, I also have to remind you and the others, as we've said a number of times on the call, we decide how much we want to be booked. And there are times when we say for various reasons it ought to be more or less. That's -- to some extent we can drive that number. And I think that the focus on it is it 0.5% more or less than last year? Is -- actually could lead you down the wrong path, because that is something we choose what it should be.","The fact is that over the last number of years then -- by the way, I recall on one of these calls several years ago saying we're more booked now than we have been before and I don't think it will wane. I think next year you'll see it to go down, because I think next year we'll want it to be less. And in fact, I was wrong and our revenue management people decided that we could absorb the -- taking more in the beginning.","So, I just want to give you a caution that being booked more isn't, per se automatically say the market is stronger, it's much -- it's oftentimes it's just our revenue management people think given the kinds of cruises we offer and the kind of booking patterns that we're seeing that that's a choice we make.","Harry Curtis","Okay. And I appreciate all that. And my -- the point I was trying to make is somewhat different which is that you do have a significant amount of the first half of next year booked and that should give investors kind of confidence. But I appreciate that.","Jason Liberty","That is accurate though, Harry. Your statement is accurate.","Harry Curtis","Okay. That\u2019s all I was trying to get out. Thank you.","Jason Liberty","You got it.","Operator","And we do have time for one more question today. The question will come from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia","Hi. Good morning. I guess \u2026","Jason Liberty","Good morning.","Sharon Zackfia","\u2026 I think Richard mentioned the R word. So, I'm sure as you all sit around and think about there is economic situations you do have plans for how you would address any kind of pervasive economic slowdown, understanding you're not seeing that in your business yet. I mean, how would you characterize the differences today? And how you would think about operating Royal Caribbean through some sort of slowdown versus 2008\/2009 when you curtailed the ship orders and all of that? I mean, what's different today in how you would go-to-market?","Jason Liberty","Yeah. Sure. So, I'll start off by -- Sharon, by saying as it relates to the R word or recession obviously a lot of our plans and we have many scenarios that we would consider depending on what type of a situation that we were in. But, of course, I think we should all remind everybody and this was somewhat in our remarks, in Richard's remarks is we now operate a very kind of global and diverse business that sources guests obviously from different parts of the world, but also on different segments. We also have itineraries that go to a thousand different places. So what's available to our guest is much more diverse than -- and I would say it's unfortunate that we're still quite a value relative to land-based vacations that we of course we keep trying to close.","We also have a much stronger balance sheet, much stronger liquidity position. And I think we would evaluate our sets of plans in case there was a change in the wins. But as you had pointed out and as we've talked about here on the call, we are not seeing any of those changes whether it's in our booking -- our daily bookings or whether it's the onboard trading activities as guests are spending with us each and every day.","Sharon Zackfia","Okay. Can I just have a follow-up? If you had a do-over, would you have grown throughout the last recession? Would you have canceled -- or not canceled, but curtailed ship orders as much as you did?","Jason Liberty","Yeah. There is definitely regret that we have in terms of our pullback on our growth. We would all be talking about higher earnings numbers today, better return profile today, if we hadn't slowed down our growth or our investment efforts in expanding our global footprint, investing in different projects that would have put us in an even stronger position than we are today.","Sharon Zackfia","Helpful. Thank you.","Jason Liberty","Great. Well, with that I'll ask the operator -- I'm sorry -- thank you for your assistance today in the call and we thank you all for participating and the interest you have in the company. We would be available all day for follow-ups that you might have -- actually if you have more specific -- you need to ask Carola if you have any follow-ups today. And we wish you all a very great day.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line."],"19041":["Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL) Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call April 20, 2015  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Jason Liberty - CFO ","Richard Fain - Chairman, CEO","Michael Bayley - President & CEO, Royal Caribbean International","Analysts","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Steve Wieczynski - Stifel","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Robin Farley - UBS ","Harry Curtis - Nomura","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","Assia Georgieva - Infinity Research","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. 2015 first-quarter earnings conference call. ","[Operator Instructions]. ","Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jason Liberty, Chief Financial Officer. You may begin your conference.","Jason Liberty","Good morning, I would like to thank you for joining us today for our first-quarter earnings call. Joining me here from the spectacular Anthem of the Seas, are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Laura Hodges, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call we will be referring to a few slides which have been posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com. Before we get started I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements which is on our first slide.","During this call we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risk and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Also we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures which are adjusted as defined and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.","Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview the business. I will follow up with a recap of our first-quarter results, provide an update on the booking environment, and then provide an update on our full-year and second-quarter guidance for 2015. We will then open the call for your questions. Richard?","Richard Fain","Thank you, Jason, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. As always, it is a pleasure to provide color on the progress we are making and I do appreciate your interest. As Jason mentioned, we are talking to you from onboard Anthem of the Seas, Royal Caribbean International's newest vessel, and I have to say she is an absolute marvel.","All of the industry firsts that were introduced on Quantum of the Seas are equally as dramatic onboard her sister ship, Anthem. The wows span every spectrum from technology with the fastest Internet bandwidth in the industry to entertainment with dynamic activities like RipCord by iFLY to dining featuring partnerships with renowned chefs such as Jamie Oliver.","While all of the attributes I mentioned create a powerful experience for our guests, the most impressive feature of Anthem of the Seas is her crew. The ship is truly a marvel, but the men and women who produce such a wonderful vacation for so many are truly an inspiration to us all. And the result of all that this is that the ship is quite profitable and produces strong returns.","Quantum in New York has been amazingly well received. Anthem in the UK has also been attracting disproportionately high pricing. And the bookings for Quantum in China are nothing less than heartwarming. All in all this class of ship is proving to be a terrific investment and well worth all the effort that went into designing and building her.","The profitability of our new ships, coupled with the power of our family of brands, is enabling us to deliver step change performance again in 2015. On our last earnings call we were pleased to report that earnings for 2014 were up 40% over the previous year. We were then pleased to give guidance that projected a further 40% increase in our earnings this year.","Unfortunately the currency markets have not cooperated and, as a result of the weakness in Sterling, Aussie dollars, Euros, etc., we now expect 34% earnings growth year over your. Not quite 40% but definitely not bad. Our consistent focus remains solidly on the Double-Double program and we remain committed to achieve the 2017 goals of double-digit ROIC and double our record 2014 profitability.","Now there will always be ebbs and flows in our business and we don't see this year as any different. Last year the story revolved around a weak Caribbean and a strong euro. This year the Caribbean is strong but foreign currencies are weak.","When you remove the clutter the common denominator is our performance. The fundamentals of our business are intact and we continue to deliver on the plans we have communicated, in particular those embodied in our Double-Double program.","And we are taking specific steps that I'd like to comment on to ensure the success of that program. Our new ships, the upgrading of our older ships and the strengthening of our brand positioning are all helping us drive better returns.","Similarly, our investment in China and the Asia-Pacific region are paying handsome dividends. In just 2 weeks Quantum of the Seas leaves for China where she will join our 3 other ships in that market. Royal Caribbean International is already seen as the preeminent brand in China. And Quantum helps secure that position further.","China now represents 6% of our capacity but at a higher percentage of our profitability. And we have recently announced that Ovation of the Seas will move to that market next year.","Another specific step we are taking relates to price integrity. Here we have moved on 2 fronts to improve the reliability and the consistency of our pricing model. As previously described, we have extended our booking curve by opening deployments earlier, by starting marketing sailings earlier and by enhancing our yield management systems.","The objective is to fill our ships earlier and reduce the number of state rooms we have to fill closer in. With fewer staterooms to fill at the last minute there is less need to offer the kind of drastic last-minute discounts that are so disruptive. That approach has been working and is amply demonstrated by our higher book load factors and our higher APDs.","But more recently we have adopted policies designed specifically to deal with the last-minute discounts that are so disruptive to the system. I am referring specifically to the special discounts offered in the last days before sailing, often at significant discount.","Now these may represent only a small percentage of our business, but their influence is more significant. They upset many of our most loyal customers by creating an uncertainty about the prices that they pay. They cause headaches for our travel agency partners who don't know what price they should rely on and they undermine our brand image.","As a result, in March we adopted a new policy that we would not do any last-minute discounts on bookings in North America. Depending on the type of cruise that last-minute may be 10, 20, or 30 days out. But from that point on we will hold our price at the prior level.","Obviously this may cost us some bookings in the short-term and our guidance reflects that. But we believe that the long-term advantage for our brands is worth the small short-term cost. Over time we think this will lead to happier guests, happier agents and better branding. The only exception to this rule is for very short-term cruises, i.e. 2 to 4 nights where last-minute bookings is more a reflection of the decision process.","Lastly, I'd like to comment on one of the other foundations of our business and that is our cost structure. Achieving the Double-Double goals requires a strong cost posture and I am impressed with the cost leadership that our brands have demonstrated over the last few years.","Although we originally guided towards a good expense control in 2015, the further reduction in our cost guidance is more evidence of our consistent and determined efforts to identify and deliver efficiencies throughout the business to ensure we drive strong shareholder returns without impacting our product or investment in our future. With that I will turn it back to you, Jason.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Richard. I will begin by talking about our results for the first quarter. So unless I state differently, all metrics will be in a constant currency basis. Our first-quarter results are summarized on slide 2.","The first quarter exceeded our expectations with all metrics above the top end of guidance. We generated earnings of $0.20 per share which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by approximately $0.08. This outperformance was in spite of a negative $0.05 in earnings impact due to the stronger dollar and in increase in fuel prices relative to our January guidance.","Net revenue yields were down 1% for the quarter, which was considerably higher than the top end of the range. The strength in closed in pricing on Caribbean sailings more than offset some weakness in onboard spending from our non-US guests. The majority of our onboard offerings are denominated in US dollars and the significant strengthening of the dollar has slightly weakened the purchasing power of many of our international guests.","As a reminder, the revenue and cost per ration change made in the third quarter of 2014 makes Q1 a tougher comparable. So a portion of the revenue for our high yielding New Year sailing was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014. So under the previous policy these sailings would have been recognized in Q1 of 2015. Yields for the first quarter would have been up slightly were it not for the proration change.","The Caribbean, which accounted for 69% of the capacity in our first quarter came in with better revenue yields than we initially expected. So the remaining Q1 inventory was mostly in Australia, Asia and South America. Combined yields for all non-Caribbean itineraries were up low-single-digits.","So Q1 was the first full quarter of operations for Quantum of the Seas and yields were exceptionally strong. Quantum sailed a series of the Caribbean and Bahamas itineraries from Cape Liberty and generated premiums similar to our Oasis class vessels and significantly higher premiums compared to the fleet average.","Net cruise cost, excluding fuel, was up 0.9%, which was 160 basis points better than the midpoint of guidance. The majority of the favorability is attributed to further efficiencies that are within our non-guest facing areas. It is truly gratifying to see the consistent effort of our shipboard and shore side employees to put forth to identify and implement cost savings.","There is no one major initiative or large example that would drive these continued cost savings. It is a thousand little things throughout the business that are continuously identified and then implemented. These savings have allowed us to continue to invest in our product and in growing markets like China, while still keeping costs below the rate of inflation. I am truly proud of the cost culture we have built.","Now I would like to update you on what we are seeing in the booking environment. Overall, we have had a good [wave] period with both booking volumes and pricing exceeding last year's levels. As you will recall, we began the year with a higher percent of inventory booked than ever before. This translated into better overall pricing during the wave season which in turn has increased our book to APD premium at the same time last year.","At this point booked APDs and load factors are higher relative to same time last year for the full year and in each remaining quarter of 2015. Trends during wave were particularly strong relative to expectations at same time last year for Caribbean itineraries.","As previously noted, closed in pricing for Q1 sailings was better than we forecasted. However, our previous guidance already incorporated a much healthier Caribbean pricing environment for Q2 through Q4 sailings when industry capacity returns to more typical levels and our own capacity in the region is down slightly.","The strong wave looking period has given us more confidence in our forward-looking assumptions, particularly since we now have a higher portion of Caribbean inventory sold than ever before. Given this level of visibility we continue to expect a low-single-digit yield increase for Q2 to Q4 Caribbean sailings.","Moving on to Europe \u2013 we have increased our European capacity by about 5% as we are replacing slightly smaller vessels with Anthem of the Seas and Allure of the Seas. Overall we have a solid looking period for Europe sailings with volume slightly down versus 2014, but up significantly compared to other previous wave periods.","We are seeing consistently strong booking trends for guests from North America. As a result we now have slightly less inventory left to sell in Europe than at this point last year despite the capacity increase.","Western Mediterranean and Baltic itineraries, which account for more than 70% of our European capacity, have been enjoying strong demand at better prices than last year. On the other hand, we have experienced some softness in trends for the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly for the voyages that turn in Turkey.","Taking all of this into account, we are still expecting to see record yield in Europe this summer with a year-over-year increase in the mid-single-digits.","In the Asia-Pacific region we offer a wide variety of itineraries that range from 3 night sailings tailored to the Chinese market to 18 night Australia\/New Zealand sailings that are sourced globally. In 2015 our capacity has jumped from 12% to 15% for this product grouping.","While trends vary by itinerary level the Asia product as a whole has been trending quite well. Quantum of the Seas will arrive in China in about 2 months and, as expected, is commanding significant premiums. Quantum's early success, with over 80% of her revenue currently booked for the inaugural China season, provided us with the necessary confidence to place her sister, Ovation of the Seas, into the China market when she debuts in 2016. We continue to expect yield increases in the low- to mid-single-digits for the Asia-Pacific product.","Taking into account all we have just told you, I would now like to summarize our guidance for the full year and second quarter. If you turn to slide 3 you will see our updated guidance for 2015. We expect net revenue yields for the year to increase 2.5% to 4% for the full year.","The guidance contemplates slightly softer than expected onboard revenue spend from our non-US guests due to a reduction in their purchasing power as a result of the stronger dollar. It also incorporates a moderate reduction in expectations for sailings in the Eastern Mediterranean as well as the close in discounting policy that Richard referred to.","Each of these changes are small but the change in our yield the guidance is small. While there are some puts and takes in ticket revenue expectations for \u2013 all other itineraries are generally in line with our previous expectations.","On the cost front we expect to continue the momentum realized in the first quarter. Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be flat to down 1% for the year versus our previous guidance of up 1% or better.","Since our January earnings call the dollar has strengthened 3.5% versus our basket of currencies and fuel prices have increased approximately 14%. Together these 2 factors represent a $0.36 headwind to earnings per share.","The table on slide 4, which will be in our upcoming 10-Q, ranks the impact of our main currencies to net income by quarter along with our usual sensitivities. This is to enable better modeling on a quarterly basis.","Our fuel costs for the year have increased to $834 million from $806 million during our January earnings call. While this is an increase from the previous guidance, fuel costs remain down year-over-year by $104 million. Consumption is down approximately 18,000 tons from previous guidance driven by better-than-expected results from a laundry list of fuel consumption initiatives. We are 52% hedged for the remainder of the year and that is a price of $638 per metric ton.","Taking into account all we've just told you, and based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, we have updated our adjusted earnings per share guidance to be between $4.45 and $4.65 for the year.","On slide 5 we have provided guidance for the second quarter. Our capacity in the second quarter shifts significantly versus Q1 and same time last year. 37% of capacity is in the Caribbean, 25% is in Europe, 10% is sailing repositioning cruises and 10% is in both China and Alaska. The quarter is booked nicely ahead of last year in both APD and load factor and we currently expect a yield increase of approximately 3.5%.","So I also wanted to mention 2 structural elements going on in Q2. Quantum of the Sea spends the majority of the quarter on a repositioning cruise and the Allure of the Seas will be repositioning to Europe.","Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be up approximately 4.5% and we have included $213 million of fuel expense for the quarter. The year-over-year increase is mainly related to supporting the growth in China. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $0.70 for the quarter.","Before opening up the call for questions I wanted to just take a moment to comment on our Double-Double goals. These goals are ingrained in our culture and help govern our day-to-day decision-making. While the ongoing volatility in the currency and fuel markets provides its challenges, we remain solidly on track towards these goals.","With that I will ask our operator, Brandy, to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim Conder","Thank you. And just a couple things here. One, Jason, I think you mentioned that the Asia yields are expected to be up low- to mid-single-digits. In the past \u2013 I know China is just a piece of Asia, but in the past China has been growing at 15%. So maybe help bridge that a little bit.","And then secondly, I think you guys had mentioned earlier that you were starting to take some steps to mitigate the onboard exposure of non-dollar-denominated guests. Maybe give us a little bit of color on that progress. And then just the magnitude of your onboard revenues that are exposed to consumers who would have to pay in dollars yet are not dollar denominated as their home currency.","Jason Liberty","Right. Oh, good morning, Tim. I will take the issue question and I will pass it over to Michael to take the onboard one.","On the Asia side, which also includes Southeast Asia as well as Australia, we still see the strength with \u2013 there is 66% more capacity in China and we still see significant strength happening in the yields, but not at that double-digit level that we had experienced last year, but still very strong.","And then the other products are really Southeast Asia, which is a mix of international guests which are basically kind of more on the flattish side. And then Australia, as we talked about, with a lot a capacity that has come into that market, is up slightly. And so, that balance gets you to that mid-single-digit or low- to mid-single-digit range.","Tim Conder","Okay, okay.","Michael Bayley","Hi, Tim, it is Michael. On the question of onboard revenue, we started to see a little bit of softness in the first quarter as it relates to the international guests. And we think that is related to price sensitivity as a result of the degradation of these various currencies.","We started to look at pricing actions in US dollar that don't necessarily impact the US customer. And we have had some good fortune with some of the pricing actions that we have taken and we started to change the way that we bundle products and how we are communicating these bundled products into the marketplace, both in the international markets and the US market.","It is early days yet, but some of the actions that we have taken we think are proving to be successful in relation to the mitigation for the international.","Tim Conder","And I guess, Michael, just to clarify a little bit more then, so is the consumer's bundle they pay in pounds or Euros correct? But then are you changing anything for the non-bundled portion or are they still paying in US dollars or does that have an opportunity to change also here?","Michael Bayley","Well, pre-cruise they are paying in their local currency. Obviously when they board our ships they are paying in US dollars. So it is the pre-cruise opportunity that we are currently exploring. On the US dollar pricing, the opportunity there is more with our US customers.","And just to make one comment, our onboard revenue, even though we have got this slight softness in relation to international guests, we are still heading for a record year as it relates to onboard revenue.","Tim Conder","Okay, okay. Okay, thank you.","Michael Bayley","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes Steve Wieczynski of Stifel. ","Steve Wieczynski","Hey. Good morning, guys. So if you look at your reduction in your yield guidance, and I know you talked about the onboard spend from European or from internationally sourced guests. If that wasn't the case and the dollar was basically unchanged versus where we were 3 months ago, would you have been able to hold your yield guidance?","Jason Liberty","Hi, Steve, it is Jason. Yes, if those factors did not come into play we would have held our yield guidance for the year.","Steve Wieczynski","So nothing has really changed on the pricing side of that? That is what I am really trying to get at.","Jason Liberty","Yes, that is right. And I think an important point on it, Steve, is when we went into our call in January, we had already experienced several weeks of strength in the booking environment. And I think as we commented, that strength was really seen for Q2 through Q4.","And what we saw, which was more surprising after the call, is some of those trends to bake themselves into the first quarter. So the trends \u2013 the strength of those trends that we have seen outside of the Eastern Mediterranean have really continued forward.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay, got you. And then second question \u2013 a little bit bigger picture question might be for Richard. But when you look at Australia over the next couple years, there is just a ton of capacity not only from you guys being in there but also your competitors.","I guess at the end of the day do you guys feel comfortable enough that that market will be able to absorb the amount of \u2013 ? I mean you are looking at basically mid-double-digits kind of capacity growth over the next couple of years.","Richard Fain","Yes, hi, Steve. Actually that is something we have been watching for a while. And I guess I would have to say we have been pleased with how well it has held up over the last several years actually with a large amount of new capacity.","I think what has happened and what's giving us some comfort is that we are seeing more and better ships and more and better kinds of itineraries to offer. So it has held up. But as Jason pointed out in the earlier part of it, to some extent when we look at our overall yields in the Pan Asian region, that is offsetting the very strong yields out of China.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","Jason, just \u2013 I think what would be helpful, you have given us some qualitative reasons why your net yield guidance came down a bit at the midpoint. I was just wondering if maybe you could quantify or help bridge us to the yield reduction. So some was coming from your new yield strategy maintaining prices, some was from the Eastern Med, some is from the FX impact of onboards. Just helping \u2013 wondering if you could help us think about the different pieces.","Jason Liberty","Happy to, Felicia. So the way that I would kind of frame it is about \u2013 so the \u2013 approximately 50 basis point change from Q2 through Q4, which would be the implied change in that range or the midpoint of that range, half of it is really our anticipation on the effect of the non-US guest's spend on the ship. And then the balance of that is a mix of the Eastern Mediterranean and then some impact from the price integrity policy that Richard had referred to. I mean it is really small changes overall.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, thanks. And then on the price integrity side, I know it is early and you are talking about this now, but do you have a sense if your competitors are going to kind of join the party?","Richard Fain","I think we have said that this is the right policy for us independent of anyone else and I think that is really the approach we took in deciding. It was really important to strengthen our brand because in the long run it is our brand that is going to drive our yield improvements.","And so, no, I can't comment on anybody else's. But I think I really would emphasize we think this is going to help us out regardless of what anyone else does.","Felicia Hendrix","Yes, it makes sense. Thank you. And then just final question. Jason, as we think through the rest of the year, so the net yield guidance looks a little more back end loaded than we anticipated. Just wondering if you can discuss how having the Quantum and Allure move to revenue generating cruises and then also how the prorating of cruises affects \u2013 for the fourth quarter affects your yields in the second half.","Jason Liberty","Sure, thanks, Felicia. So as it relates to the second quarter, Quantum is about to go on a 54 \u2013 55-day voyage from New York to Shanghai. So it really takes up the majority of the second quarter, so that obviously has an impact on the yield because there is \u2013 the repositioning of sailings, though they are actually quite good for Quantum relative to other repos are still lower relative to the average.","And then you have a lower \u2013 it takes several weeks to get over to Europe and that will also happen. And actually she has already left, and that will also take effect on the second quarter.","And then to your point, we had about 120 basis points or so of revenue that transferred in from Q1 of 2015 into Q4. And so that, on a year-over-year comp, will make the Q4 comp \u2013 if you don't take that out will lead you to it being a higher number.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, helpful. These repositioning cruises, I'm just getting some questions, are they \u2013 do you guys make \u2013 are they profitable?","Michael Bayley","Yes, Felicia, I can answer that. Yes, they are profitable. I mean I think the kind of deals that we are generating out of the New York market and the Shanghai market are higher than the yields we generate on these long trans-Atlantic\/trans-Pacific voyages.","So it is quite a journey, 55 days, 3 different segments to Europe through to the Indian Ocean into Singapore and then Shanghai. And those voyages just generate a lower yield than we typically see in New York and Shanghai. But still a good yield and it is profitable \u2013 all 3 voyages are profitable.","Just to also add to Jason's point, the Allure has actually left on Sunday from Fort Lauderdale on the way to Europe and then goes into a dry dock until May 19 when it starts sailing out of Barcelona. And then it is performing very well in the European market. So we are pleased with what we are saying with Allure in Europe, but it is obviously in dry dock for a couple of weeks.","Q - Felicia Hendrix","Great, thank you so much.","Richard Fain","Felicia, it is Richard, if I could just add a comment because I think as we are looking at these things we recognize this ends up causing a lot of confusion between the quarters. Because as Jason and Michael have said, we have these voyages which are doing less. But when we look in total we are very happy with the way that develops.","But it certainly does confuse any given quarter and the second quarter does have, particularly this year, those extra positioning voyages which bring down the average then. And we have taken that into account, we have always had that in our own forecasts.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, thanks for the clarity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin Farley","Questions. I wonder if \u2013 I know this policy of eliminating the last minute discounting just started in March. But can you comment on how that may have impacted occupancy just in sort of the first 2 weeks in April, just kind of what the early impact of that has been?","Richard Fain","Robin, it's Richard again. No, it is too early for there to have been any measurable impact at this point. And by the way, it has happened to have occurred \u2013 the implementation happened to have occurred during a particularly good time for us. So the impact on occupancy was less than it might in another time.","And we are going to have to follow this policy in times like now where it maybe doesn't have as much impact, maybe in some other quarters it will have more impact. But we think that getting our customers out of this sort of used car salesman kind of mentality will be overall good for the brand, good for their experience and therefore lead to longer yields in the long run. But so far it is too early for us to see a measurable impact.","Robin Farley","Great, that is helpful, thanks. And then also to follow up on China, because I thought it was interesting that you were sending Ovation there next year before Quantum had even arrived. And in your opening comments you mentioned that you were 80% booked for the accrual season.","Can you give us a little bit more color on sort of what \u2013 are you seeing the season kind of starting with Quantum's arrival in June? Or how should we think about that 80% kind of versus how far booked in advance your itineraries typically would be.","And then also, I assume a lot of what your \u2013 when you say 80% booked for the inaugural season, I assume at this point that is to the tour operators. And I am wondering if you know how booked it is at the cruise or at the consumer level.","A - Michael Bayley","Hi, Robin, it's Michael. I am not quite sure I understood the second part of your question. But the first part of your question the answer is for this \u2013 for 2015 summer we are 80% sold. We are feeling very confident about where we are with Quantum and 2016 is looking good as well.","So one of the reasons we took for Ovation was the fact that we were very confident with what we are seeing with Quantum and that is why we decided to move Ovation there in 2016.","Robin Farley","I guess it was really the comment about 80% for the inaugural season, it sounds like that was just summer. I guess I was thinking about the winter \u2013 staying there through the winter since that is maybe kind of a new period for you to be sourcing year round in China. How booked are you for the winter at this point I guess for Quantum in terms of your visibility?","Michael Bayley","I don't have the number in front of me, Robin, but, as I say, from what we are seeing we are confident and it is that confidence that really allowed us to make the decision on Ovation.","Robin Farley","And then the other question that I was asking about, how sold you are, was \u2013 is that when you charter a block to a tour operator that it is sold in your \u2013 when you think about how booked you are or is it not until the tour operator actually has sold that to a cruise or \u2013 few of your sales are direct there? Just trying to make sure I understand when you say that you are sold kind of at what level that is.","Michael Bayley","Yes, I mean when we say we are sold, obviously it is committed sailings where we have gotten money paid for those sailings. So it is really a combination of FIT groups, charters, charter for resale \u2013 it is the combination, the blend of all of these things that we have and we have got money deposited for that.","Robin Farley","Okay, great. Thank you. That is helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Nomura.","Harry Curtis","Hey. Good morning. Wanted to get back to the cost side of things. It sounds to me that, based on comments I am getting back from investors, that the lift in costs in the second quarter caught them a bit off guard. And can you walk us through just sequentially how we go from a modest lift in the first quarter to such a bulge in the second quarter?","And then the implied \u2013 there has got to be I think an implied decline per berth in the second half of 4% plus. So if you could walk us through those numbers that would be helpful.","Jason Liberty","Hey, Harry, it is Jason. So the way you laid that out I think is the right way where you would see a broader decline in the second half of the year. What is driving the cost increase in Q2 which we alluded to at the latter part of last year as well as in the first quarter, that the investments we were making in China really \u2013 the undercurrent for the launch of Quantum is what is driving those costs up.","And they would actually be higher than that amount if not for the underlying cost efficiencies that we've identified and have been implementing. And so, once that upfront cost goes away our costs get significantly better in Q3 and in Q4.","Harry Curtis","But how are they upfront costs? Maybe you can explain how those work. In other words, why aren't they reoccurring costs?","Jason Liberty","I didn't call them out to be necessarily recurring. It's if you are launching a ship, for example, when we launched the ship Quantum in the fourth quarter of last year the buildup, the sales and marketing efforts, the set ups of the offices and the campaigning is really what drives those up and they are not.","Now sometimes you can see them as being reoccurring. For example, when we launch Ovation next year, we will probably have similar costs for Ovation. But on a like-for-like basis, it is not like we just keep upping the game. As new ship comes up, there is a portion that increases as we add new ships, but it is not proportional to the capacity.","Harry Curtis","So do you pretty much accumulate these costs and then expense them in the quarter that Quantum is started in in China? Or are these \u2013 have there been prior quarters where these, say, set up costs have also included some expenses related to the anticipation of the opening?","Jason Liberty","Sure. There is definitely some in the previous quarters. Not necessarily where you kind of build up or hang it up in any way. It is really just that is really where you are spending the kind of core part of that money. And that just happens to be taking place in Q2 as the ship launches, at the very end of Q2 in Shanghai.","Harry Curtis","Okay.","Jason Liberty","There is also obviously costs around repositioning the ship and other things as well that make it a little bit higher than the average during that period.","Harry Curtis","And then my last question is related to the second half as far as bookings are concerned in your traditional markets in the Caribbean and Europe. Can you give us a sense of how well you are booked in the second half in both of those markets?","Jason Liberty","Yes, we don't go in specifically in terms of how we are booked per quarter. But as I commented, we are in a very good book position for Q2 going forward, and that would also be discretely for each quarter. We are in a good book position and at a good rate for the periods, which also gives us confidence.","And obviously, in the back half of the year Q2 forward, it implies that you need a higher yield and that is based off of the pricing and book position that we are in.","Harry Curtis","So you feel confident that based on what you have on the books in the Caribbean and Europe in the second half, I mean it looks to us like you are going to need to see north of 5% yield growth to accomplish your goal for the year. And is it fair to say that you feel strongly that your booked position is that strong?","Jason Liberty","Yes. Well, I would \u2013 obviously, we would not be giving guidance unless we felt comfortable with it. And I would say the book position, the rates and so forth we feel good about, realizing that's the journey of basically a \u2013 close to a mid-digit yield improvement, which includes both ticket and onboard in order to achieve the midpoint of the yield guidance.","Harry Curtis","Okay, thanks, Jason.","Jason Liberty","You got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman of Wedbush Securities.","James Hardiman","Hi. Good morning. A couple clarification questions for me. The $0.36 number that you gave in terms of combined fuel and FX, I think that was an absolute number as opposed to an incremental one since the fourth quarter guide. Remind us what that number looked like 3 months ago.","Jason Liberty","So in Q1 we had said relative to the \u2013 our guidance in October of last year fuel was a 59 \u2013 I'm sorry, currency was a $0.59 bad guy and oil was a $0.55 \u2013 $0.54 good guy. And then as \u2013 relative to that point, on our January guidance that gets you to $0.36.","And a breakdown of approximately is \u2013 about $0.16 of that is due to the increase in fuel prices and about $0.20 is due to the strengthening of the dollar relative to our basket of currencies. So you have got to factor those onto the other ones if you wanted to bridge yourself to October.","James Hardiman","Got it, got it.","Richard Fain","So maybe putting it another way, we had given the guidance of $4.75 at the end of January and, if nothing else changed, that number would have dropped by $0.36 as a result of foreign exchange and fuel.","James Hardiman","Got it. Very helpful. And then the onboard issue \u2013 obviously you talked about some of the international customers and the currency impact there. I guess looking at it from the other side, are there any benefits to your business from US consumers that might see international travel as more appealing?","Obviously not onboard or ticket prices, but pre-and post stays or shore excursions, were there any offsets to what we are seeing on the negative front in terms of the onboard?","Michael Bayley","Hi, James, it is Michael. Yes, I think that is a good observation and that is true. I mean, the strength of the US dollar, the weakness of currencies like the euro makes certainly Europe more attractive for travel. And obviously what we are seeing in the US market is pretty healthy.","And so, we are seeing that both in what people are buying, pre-, post-, during and then also what they are willing to spend onboard. So I think that is quite a healthy \u2013 I think we feel like we are in a healthy place with the US market so there is some opportunity there.","James Hardiman","Very helpful. And then just last question for me. The Double-Double program, no need to back off of that despite a $0.20 reduction from FX. That would seem to suggest that either you are assuming some normalization of currency, you have built in a significant amount of cushion or you have identified some other opportunities. How should we think about that and how bad would FX and fuel need to get for that Double-Double goal to be in jeopardy? Thanks.","Jason Liberty","Well, I'm not going to get into \u2013 I mean obviously the mix of whatever happens with currency and fuel can change what could impact that. I think our view is we have obviously a clear commitment toward that Double-Double goal. And as we've said in the past, you need aggressive but achievable yield improvement in order to get it to it. And you need to have good cost control.","And I think as you can see in our efforts this year to improve our cost basis, we continue to make movements and actions in order to keep ourselves on that track. And so, we are still very confident in the ability to reach those 2017 goals.","Obviously also what we commented on our last call is that we historically have seen a very strong inverse relationship between fuel and currency. That decoupled a little bit in the first quarter, but, as we said, it is not something that is perfect day by day but it generally aligns itself over time.","But at this point based on where currency is, where fuel is at and the underlying performance of the business we feel good about the Double-Double program.","James Hardiman","Got it, very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Jason Liberty","Thanks, James.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs.","Steven Kent","Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me? ","Jason Liberty","Yes, we can, Steve. Good morning.","Steven Kent","Okay. Hi. So, just to go back to the pricing integrity program, which I think is \u2013 I think people are going to be thrilled with, both your customers ultimately and also your travel partners. But I don't understand why it would reduce net yields. It seems like letting people book earlier and marketing to people earlier should ultimately lead to higher yields.","And then on the same front, have you considered rather than outright discounting giving people programs like maybe a free onboard drinking package or a excursion or a $100 onboard credit? Is that one of the other ways to handle this?","And then one final thing. Just on the FX impact, what percentage \u2013 just what percentage of the onboard spend for international guests would have gone to as a result in a 25 basis point impact on net yield guidance? I am not sure you have said they yet.","Richard Fain","Hi, Steve, I will start on the pricing integrity thing. First of all, the reason it hasn't impacted \u2013 in the short-term \u2013 sorry, in the long-term I absolutely agree with you. I think everybody is going to find this to be a better and more \u2013 less disruptive and less unpleasant way of handling it.","So I think in the long-term that is going to help us. I think that it helps solidify the image of our branding and in the long run the branding is what drives the pricing. And we have a lot of other steps in place to enhance the branding of our products and that actually has been improving over the last few years. We think this will be one more big step.","And so, in the long-term I agree with you, that will have only a positive impact. In the short-term it has a negative impact because obviously the reason that we have been doing last minute discounts is because the ship wouldn't otherwise be absolutely full.","And so, while the number is small we have used it to top up. And so there is less topping up so you don't get the revenue from those last passengers. And it may take a little while for travel agents and consumers to understand just how serious we are about this. But in the short-term it has that impact.","On the other comment that you asked about which was the value added, that is something that we have been quite aggressive about over a while. And in fact in the past I have pointed out that it is going to make it a little more difficult to judge between onboard and other revenue because sometimes \u2013 onboard and ticket revenue, because sometimes we do \u2013 we will offer what we call a value added package.","So instead of lowering our price we might give them a special promotion, we might give them drinks, we might give them a bath robe, we might give them a cabin upgrade, whatever it is. And so, there becomes an interplay between the ticket pricing and the onboard revenue.","And one of the things that I've commented on is that when we talk about enhancing our revenue management systems, part of the objective, and I think part of something that will be paying off for us, is the integration of onboard revenue into our revenue management system. So that those 2 things can work in tandem as opposed to being treated as totally independent variables.","And so I think you do see \u2013 and sometimes you see \u2013 Celebrity had a very successful promotion, which is 123 Go!. And we basically gave the consumer the option of different kinds of ancillary packages to support the ticket pricing. Very successful, very popular. But it does blur the line between ticket and onboard. And I think that is something we want to enhance and expand on. We think it is a real opportunity. So, I agree with you.","Jason Liberty","And, Steve, on your question on the onboard, just to make sure \u2013 I will address it how I understood it, but the question might be different. Our commentary on the onboard side is what we have experienced from non-US guests who have seen the value of their currency devalue relative to the dollar really over the past 6 to 9 months.","And that has \u2013 we have seen signs and evidence of them spending less on the ship as they purchase things or try to purchase things in US dollar. We have a very small portion of our total revenue \u2013 onboard revenue that is priced in local dollars, that is really just related to the Chinese sailings.","Steven Kent","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz of Morningstar.","Jaime Katz","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So for the Double-Double, it would imply that the cost side of the equation would have to rise either flat to very low-single-digits over the next couple years assuming that net revenue yields tick up somewhere in the low-single-digits.","Can you talk about the best opportunities you guys have to capture operating efficiency as in maybe how you think about that figure growing over the next year or two?","Jason Liberty","Hi, Jaime. I think we have said for some time that yield was being cost-conscious and having moderate capacity growth is really our formula to get to the Double-Double number. Obviously over the next several years we have a good amount of capacity coming online. And I think our efforts, whether it is on the shared service side or across the brands, to realize scale during that time is what is relevant to ensure that our costs stay in a moderate growth pattern.","Jaime Katz","Okay. And that is lower than inflation we could assume?","Jason Liberty","I am not going to get into assumptions. But I think we have had a pretty good track record over the past several years of keeping our cost probably moderate, but I would probably say below moderate situation with our costs being flat to down 1 this year and our costs coming in down 0.6 last year.","Jaime Katz","Okay. And then on the price integrity program, I think you guys said that it was only for North American itineraries and that it wasn't for 2 to 4 day cruises. So can you give us an estimate of approximately maybe what percentage of itineraries it actually affects?","Richard Fain","I don't think we have a number in that context because it is a long-term program. But obviously North America is our dominant market and the 2 to 4 night is a smaller percentage of the total. So it is the dominant factor in our pricing matrix.","Jaime Katz","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva of Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","Good morning. Can I follow up on the question of onboard spend? So the 25 basis points, is that something that you expect to see more in Q2 and Q3? Or is that something that is going to affect the entire year?","Jason Liberty","I think our expectation, because there is a different mix here \u2013 over the summertime you are much more indexed towards the European consumer, so you are really pound and euro. And you can see in that currency chart pound is where we are more effective on a net perspective, but there could be noise between onboarding and cost as an example.","And then as you switch over into Q4 you move more South to like Brazil and you move more to Australia and other markets where they have taken quite a hit on their currency. So I think we look at that anticipation as what it could be for the balance of the year.","Assia Georgieva","Okay, so it is not just the euro, we are also \u2013 I'm sorry, Jason.","Jason Liberty","It is a portion of the [indiscernible] 25 basis points. Yes, no, I was going to say, as I talked about, it is a portion of that 25 basis points.","Assia Georgieva","Okay, thank you, Jason.","Operator","And there are no other questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Jason for any closing comments.","Jason Liberty","Great. Thank you for your assistance, Brandy, with the call today. And we thank all of you for your participation and interest in the Company. Laura will be available for any follow-ups you might have and we really wish you all a great day. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"19175":["Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call May  1, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Jason Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Richard Fain - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Michael Bayley - President & Chief Executive Officer, Royal Caribbean International","Conference Call Participants","Steve Wieczynski - Stifel","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays","David Beckel - Bernstein","Harry Curtis - Instinet","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Brandt Montour - JPMorgan","Operator","Good morning. My name is Cheryl, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Limited First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to introduce Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jason Liberty. Mr. Liberty, the floor is yours.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carola Mengolini, our Vice President of Investor Relations. During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our investor website www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I'd like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures.","Please note that we do not undertake to update the information in our filings as circumstances change. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial metrics, which are adjusted as defined and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial items can be found on our website. Unless we state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency-adjusted basis.","Richard will begin by providing a strategic review of the business. I will follow with a recap of our first quarter results, provide an update on the booking environment, and then provide an update on our full year and second quarter guidance for 2019. We will then open-up the call for your questions. Richard?","Richard Fain","Thank you, Jason and good morning everybody. It's been a great first quarter and we're on our way to another great year. So I look forward to chatting about it a little bit. As we stated in our press release, this quarter we were able to beat our earnings guidance essentially due to higher revenues and our revenues for the full year are also looking better than what we expected with higher pricing in every quarter.","I have to stress that we're both delighted and a little bit surprised with this very nice outlook as our initial guidance was already very strong. We think that this is a result of several elements, our superior new buildings, strategic revenue management decisions, our global footprint, very well-positioned brands and an enhanced destination offering.","Now, while our revenue outlook has only gotten better, our earnings forecast was negatively impacted by some things outside our control namely currency, fuel and an incident that occurred at the beginning of April at the Grand Bahama Shipyard. The accident impacted the year's operation and therefore affected directly and indirectly the ships that were scheduled to be drydock there. Luckily, there were no serious injuries but we did have to cancel three sailings on Oasis of the Seas in order to have her repaired. This is a very unusual event and not only have we never experienced anything like it, I've never heard of anybody else ever experiencing it either.","Now as it pertains to our improved business outlook, I should first highlight the new buildings that our guests will be able to enjoy this year. First, we continue to enjoy delicious yields on our new ships from last year Celebrity Edge and Symphony of the Seas. We continue to find that our guest appreciate the innovation and the focus that's characterized, our new ship and more importantly they're willing to pay for it.","In May, we will introduce the beautiful and relatively small Celebrity Flora, which will debut in the Galapagos targeting the expedition segment. This ship was especially designed for that very unique itinerary and is already making a huge statement in the market. Two weeks ago, we took delivery of Spectrum of the Seas and she is indeed beautiful. She's currently caring happy guests en route to China, and when she arrives in Shanghai in a few weeks, she'll be the largest and the newest ship in Asia. This will help reinforce Royal Caribbean's existing leadership and our commitment to that market.","Many of you have heard me say that we have three new fundamental focuses to our strategy going forward. They are people, destinations and technology. I'll start with destinations, because we have a very dramatic new initiative coming online shortly. In the coming weeks, we will officially open Perfect Day at CocoCay, our private resort in the Bahamas. To say that, she is a beauty is a massive understatement and we believe that we have created a truly game changer for the cruise industry, in fact for the vacation industry.","On this island, we will offer guests ample opportunity to thrill or chill. On the thrill side, we have the appropriately named Thrill Waterpark that features more than 13 water slides. One of them is the tallest in North America. We have a massive wave pool over the waters ziplines, rock-climbing walls and all sorts of adrenaline amping features. On the chill side, we have amazing beaches as well as the largest freshwater pool in the Caribbean, with a swim-up bar that offers endless opportunities to relax and unwind.","Now for those, who'll be looking for a more scenic view is the opportunity to climb 450 feet above the island in Up, Up and Away a helium balloon that will provide some of the best views in the Bahamas.","While, the island will officially open to guests in a few weeks, we have been solely opening individual venues as they become ready. And the feedback has been nothing short of exceptional.","As you walk around the island, or you scroll through videos on Instagram, you hear the familiar catch praise, I love this place. I have to say that, all that love from our guests is turning into nice return to our shareholders too.","Itineraries that include Perfect Day and preclude revenue for the island attractions are up double-digits versus the same time last year. Now, I have to warn you, if you give him even the slightest opportunity, I know that Michael will go on endlessly about this wonderful new extravaganza of his and he is rightly proud of.","Now, switching to the technology focus of our company, we have Excalibur, our own, data and digital platform. And here we are transforming the onboard experience. With one single app, our guests can now control so many more aspects of their cruise experience, that it frees them up to enjoy their vacation more, instead of spending time organizing it.","I'm particularly excited this is already been so broadly deployed that 60% of our guests can get it available. And, towards the end of the year it will be virtually all our guests. And the ratings that it's getting in the Apple App Store are 4.7.","So a real success story for us. We're very pleased about it. And we're working on leveraging these opportunities. Now, besides our efforts in technology in destinations, I have to update you on the work we're doing regarding our human capital.","You've heard me say many times, that what makes us successful is, the people, the people, the people. This success has enabled us to grow a lot, but we are growing fast at a time when the competition for talent is fierce.","When skill sets are constantly evolving, and where the way we work is rapidly changing. New technologies are shaping how we work, where we work and the skills we need to do that work.","Because of all that, we are putting forward a number of initiatives to ensure that we're able to attract the best talent, while helping our own people develop their critical skills and collaborate even better.","We are investing in giving our employees the tools to do their job, and we are also investing in upskilling and reskilling internally, both for our employees on board and onshore side.","I can't stress enough. Our success depends on, the people, the people, the people. One last topic I'd like to touch on is related to environmental stewardship. Back in 2016, we announced our partnership with the World Wildlife Fund, to take our sustainability performance to the next level.","This partnership pushed us to set ambitious sustainability goals in three key areas, Greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable food supply, and destination stewardship. We believe that what gets measured gets better.","Setting measurable goals, and then publicly reporting on our performance against those goals hold ourselves accountable and that's the best way to make progress. I'm pretty proud of the fantastic work achieved by our global tour operator team in their efforts to bring our guests more sustainable tours.","We are now had reached 80% of our target of 1,000 sustainable tours by 2020. This effort takes us beyond our own internal operations. And supports sustainable travel and livelihoods at the destinations we partner with. It's quite simple, without the places tourism can't thrive.","I'd like to take a moment to discuss some of the most recent announcements related to Cuba. As I'm sure most of you know, last month the U.S. administration took a decision that is likely to prompt a litigation related to companies that do business in Cuba.","If such legislation does ensue, we believe that we possess all defenses. And we're not expecting to change our itineraries as a result. The administration also commented on possible changes to the regulations that apply to travel to Cuba.","At this point, we don't know if there will be any changes, what those changes might be? Or to what extent they would impact us. Only 3% of our itineraries currently go to Cuba. And any impact would depend on what the regulations say. And how much advanced notice we and our guests would receive.","With that, happy to turn the microphone back to Jason, Jason?","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Richard. Before getting into the results, I'd like to discuss the impact of the unfortunate incident in the Grand Bahama Shipyard on our key metrics. As we stated in the release this morning, the early April incident resulted in several canceled sailings, and higher repair costs that will impact our full year earnings by approximately $0.25 per share.","While the cruise cancellations negatively impacted our absolute revenue for the year, these shorter season sailings were essentially neutral to our overall yields. As you can see on slide 2, in an improvement in our business outlook has offset all the $0.25 impact from FX and fuel and even most of the $0.25 negative impact from the Grand Bahama incident. This improved outlook is a result of our strong top line results in the first quarter and an increase in the revenue performance for the balance of the year.","I will now walk you through our results for the first quarter of 2019. These results are summarized on slide 3. For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $1.31 per share, which is approximately $0.21 higher than our guidance and approximately 20% higher than same time last year.","Net revenue yields were up 9.3% for the quarter, which is approximately 150 basis points higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance. The main drivers of the positive variance were continued strength and onboard revenue and better-than-anticipated close-in demand. As I have mentioned over the past couple of quarters, guests spend for onboard activities has continued to shift towards areas that involved experiences over buying things and this quarter was no different.","Shore excursion and various types of packages were key contributors to the quarterly beat. In addition to the onboard revenue strength, our results also benefited from better-than-expected pricing on close-in demand, especially for Caribbean and Asian sailings. Our results for the quarter included the benefits from Silversea and Terminal A, however yields were still up almost 6% when excluding those benefits. This is particularly gratifying when considering that this level of yield improvement was on top of a 4.9% yield increase in the first quarter of 2018.","Net cruise costs excluding fuel were up 9.6% for the quarter slightly lower than our guidance driven by timing. Additionally, better-than-anticipated performance below the line driven mainly by our joint ventures helped contribute to the earnings beat in the first quarter.","Now, I'd like to update you on what we're seeing in the demand environment. I noted on our last earnings call that WAVE got off to a very strong start and we experienced two record booking weeks early on. That booking strength continued, contributing to a record-breaking WAVE season for the company. Bookings during WAVE were up nicely year-over-year and we are particularly pleased with the pricing power we have achieved so far this year.","Since the beginning of the year prices on new bookings have been up nicely. Our book per diem is now further ahead same time last year, when compared to three months ago. As a result, we are booked at record levels in both rate and volume for the year despite the increased mix of short Caribbean capacity, which tends to book much closer in. It's rare that booking patterns are strong in all regions of the world and like most years we are seeing some variation this year. We are enjoying very strong demand from North American and from Asia-Pacific whereas we believe uncertainty around Brexit has softened demand from the U.K.","Our yield management and deployment optimization tools combined with an established global footprint help ensure we source guests from regions with high quality demand. Therefore, this year we expect to source more guests from North America than we did last year. This is one of the advantages of the operating structure and capability that we have been building over these years.","Now, I'd like to update you on what we're seeing in each of our core products. The Caribbean accounts were just over half of our capacity this year and their products have been trending very well. Our new and modernized ships, Perfect Day and the overall strength of our brand have consistently been driving better-than-expected results for our Caribbean itineraries.","Perfect Day at CocoCay hasn't officially opened yet, but it's clearly fueling additional and higher-yielding demand for our Caribbean itineraries. Bookings and pricing have been exceeding our expectations overall for the Caribbean, with sailings visiting Perfect Day up by more than other Caribbean itineraries. Europe will account for 16% of our 2019 capacity, which is about flat year-over-year. Bookings from North America and Australia have been up nicely over the past three months, which have offset a slight decrease in bookings from other source of markets like the U.K.","From a pricing standpoint, the product is receiving a nice boost to the significant premiums of Celebrity Edge and the Mediterranean. Asia-Pacific itineraries account for about 15% of our full year capacity this year and are trending very well. China itineraries will account for about 6% of our full year capacity. The continued expansion of our distribution channels and imminent arrival of our newest ship, Spectrum of the Seas are contributing to another strong year for the product.","Australia and Southeast Asia itineraries account for 6% and 4% of our capacity respectively and remain core to our Q4 and Q1 deployment. Trends have been in line with our expectations for both of these products. Alaska only accounts for about 5% of our full year capacity, but is about 10% during the summer. Each of our brands has made hardware changes to the Alaska offering and as a result our capacity on this high-yielding product is up year-over-year. These changes along with strong demand from North America are contributing to yield growth for the summer season.","If you turn to slide 4, you will see our updated guidance for the full year 2019. We expect net revenue yield growth of 7.5% to 9%. This represents an approximate 75 basis points increase from the midpoint of our previous guidance. About half of the improvement was driven by the outperformance in the first quarter, with the remainder driven by a better business outlook for the rest of the year.","From a cost perspective, we are anticipating net cruise costs excluding fuel to be up approximately 10% for the year. The increase in this cost metric relative to our previous guidance was mainly driven by the reduction in capacity, due to the canceled sailings and increases in repair costs related to the Grand Bahama Shipyard incident.","Since our last call, the dollar has strengthened versus our basket of currencies and the combination of a stronger dollar and higher bunker prices have negatively impacted our earnings per share by approximately $0.25. We expect fuel expense of $707 million for the year and we are 58% hedged.","Based on the current business outlook, along with current fuel prices interest and currency exchange rate and the 25% negative impact of the incident at the Grand Bahama Shipyard, our adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $9.65 to $9.85 per share. Excluding the headwinds from fuel currency and the Grand Bahama incident versus our January guidance, adjusted EPS for the year would have been in the range of $10.15 to $10.35 per share.","Now I will turn to our guidance for the second quarter, which is on slide 5. Net revenue yields for the second quarter are expected to be up approximately 9.5% and our net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be up approximately 10%.","So, in summary, based off the current fuel prices interest and currency exchange rates and the outlook expressed in my earlier comments, our adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter are expected it to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.50 per share. If you exclude the impact from the Grand Bahama Shipyard and the currency and fuel headwinds versus January guidance, our adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter would have been in the range of $2.65 to $2.70 per share.","With that, I'll ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Your line is open.","Steve Wieczynski","Yes, guys. Good morning. So first I want to dig into the first quarter yield beat a little bit more. And I guess the question is you beat the midpoint of your yield guidance by around 150 basis points, which is, I mean, ridiculously strong. And that's after you already had a good one month under your belt when you gave that guidance.","So can you help me understand a little bit more how the last two months of the first quarter performed so well? Was that more onboard related? Or was that more close-in related? Or was it a combination of both of those? And then maybe also if you could elaborate a little more around those onboard experimental experiential products you called out in the release as well. That would be helpful. Thanks.","Jason Liberty","Sure. Well, thanks Steve. So on the first quarter beat, yes, you were right. We were about a month in when we gave guidance. Really it is a combination of very strong on-board trends and better close-in demand, specifically in the Caribbean and then China outperformed our expectations for the quarter.","On the onboard side, which has been exceptionally strong we saw an over index of spend on shore excursion our packages like beverage packaging, internet package and again more focused on the experiential stuff versus seeing more spend occur within the retail shops.","Michael Bayley","Hey, Steve, this is Michael. I just wanted to add as well that I think as time passes, we're becoming a lot more sophisticated with our ability to pre-cruise market products, services and experiences. And I really feel like we're making good progress.","The other element of course is that we're seeing a lot of demand for the products and the activities and experiences that we've got on Perfect Day. So we're kind of excited about what we see there. And I think I heard that you actually were there a couple of weeks ago.","Steve Wieczynski","Yes, I was. It was great. And so my second question was going to be directed towards you Michael. And it was going to be a question on CocoCay. So I guess, what I want to ask here is, how do you potentially -- or how do you combat the potential overcrowding possibility on that island. And I guess, what I'm getting at is with a new peer now there could be days where you could see 9,000, 10,000 passengers on that island. And I guess, how do you make sure the customer experience won't be impacted? Or another way of saying it is, do you think there is a passenger level that would create a negative passenger experience?","Michael Bayley","Yes. I mean, obviously, we've given this experience the name Perfect Day. And we've designed Perfect Day to deliver what we think will generally be a perfect day for our customers. And we -- from what we've seen so far with between 4,000 and 6,000 people on the island, we've got a huge amount of space available.","So we've engineered designed for peak and the peak was way up close to 10,000. We obviously now we'll operate it with bigger ships coming to Perfect Day, and we'll see how we go. I think we're kind of feeling pretty optimistic about the potential for three ship calls versus two ship calls that could take us up to 12,000 a day. And remember, it's a fairly large island and we've only developed about a third of it.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay. Got you. And then real quick Jason on the cost side of things for Perfect Day, Silversea and Miami, Cruise Terminal those went up by about 50 basis points in your guidance. Just wondering which one of those three is kind of driving that increase? Or is it pretty much across all three of them?","Jason Liberty","Yes. Some of it's just rounding Steve, but yes some of that's also just further, I mean, investments in Silversea would be really the driver of that and that's more on the product side.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay, great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Jason Liberty","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Jared Shojaian","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking question. I want to ask about the $0.25 from the Oasis ship. I would think that you get that back next year, but you also didn't really raise your capacity guidance for next year by the equivalent amount. And I'm also not really sure how the accounting works on the free credits that you offered. If that impacts this year or if that could spill into next year as well so can you just talk about that a little bit?","Jason Liberty","Yes, sure. So as it relates to the $0.25 most of that \u2013 well, all of that $0.25 will take place in 2019. There is some leak over for future cruise certificates into 2020 that will also impact next year. But the way that we, I mean, this is generally most of this will be something that we will we able to recover in the future. There's -- there are some things as it relates to the yard that could potentially impact us into 2020. But for the most part this revenue loss is EPC loss were -- will be things that we'll lose this year, but gain back next year.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. Thank you. And Jason, I want to dig a little bit on the Silversea synergies. When you first announced the deal you were talking about $50 million of synergies. Can you confirm that those are $50 million of operating synergies exclusive of the debt refinancing? And then maybe specifically I think in last call you talked about how some of the synergies are already in your cost guidance. If you could just break out of the $50 million how much is currently embedded into your guidance for this year?","Jason Liberty","Yes, so I won't give a specific number. But the way we look at the $50 million which was really more on a cost perspective that would be synergies that we would be recognizing over a two to three year period of time. We are on a very strong track and to meet that potentially even a little bit earlier. So there is a good piece of it that is in the 2019 numbers, but the majority of it will start to come into next year and into 2021.","Jared Shojaian","And the $50 million is excluding debt refinancing in the first quarter of next year?","Jason Liberty","Yes it is.","Jared Shojaian","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So this is probably directed to all of you, but maybe more specifically to Jason. You're all clearly bullish as reflected in your prepared remarks and commentary and the release. So when -- thinking about your increased guidance, is it coming more from ticket or onboard? And then Jason, I was also wondering if you could just comment on the sentence in the release where you kind of mentioned that the booked position and rate and volume are a product of a number of factors including market forces itineraries segmentation and revenue management decisions?","Jason Liberty","Okay. In terms of the mix of the outlook, it's probably in diff a little bit higher on the ticker side. But I mean the onboard is also a big driver of this. As we commented and Michael commented about our pre-cruise sales to our outlook into how people are planning to spend while they are on the ship is very good and we saw that take place in the first quarter.","So it is a combination of both onboard and ticket. I mean the onboard is also a very big driver of this, as we commented and Michael commented about our pre-cruise sales to our outlook into how people are planning to spend while they are on the ship is very good and we saw that take place in the first quarter. So it is a combination of both onboard and ticket that we expect to drive the yield -- the 75 basis point uplift in our yield outlook for the 2019 period of time.","The comment in the release is really just leveraging what we have been saying on our calls for some time to just kind of to keep in mind that yes, we're in a very strong demand environment and our ability to identify and harvest that demand with the tools and techniques that we have we feel very good about. But we have said that we -- there is this kind of constant internal debate about are we taking too much on too soon? And that's sometimes leaving money on the table. And I think that's really what that statement's about is that your booked position is not just a reflection of the demand it's also a reflection of your revenue management decisions to take those bookings at that point in time. And that was really more just kind of stressing that point again.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just kind of bigger picture, I think, if you ask any of us the investment community two years ago, you know, no one probably would've been able to predict that demand would be as strong as it today I mean your like-for-like net yield growth is going to be now to 4% to 5.5% for this year -- well above your historical range.","And you guys talked a bit about this in the prepared remarks and we know hardware is part of the driver there. But if you have to kind of call out the hardware versus your tech investments and other demand drivers kind of how much is that driving that high like-for-like net yield outlook? And where are we in terms of those investments being able to further drive yields? Are we kind of at -- like if you're looking at a scale from 1 to 10 are we kind of at the 2 to 3 range or are we at the kind of 7 to 8 range?","Richard Fain","Felicia, it\u2019s Richard. I'll take a stab at that and Michael and Jason can add in if they have others. It is hard. I'm not sure a couple of years ago we ourselves would have predicted a strong market as we're seeing today.","I think we look at it as an entire experience and it's hard to say well the technology is really helping. At the risk of the offending Michael, the Perfect Day is making the change. And it's clear both are by the way and both have been very effective. And we've been pleased with the reaction to our new ships.","So, Celebrity Edge has just been going gangbusters and Celebrity Flora which is coming out -- it's about to come out is going gangbusters as well. And the Island and the technology, the people, our ratings, and our ratings on our guest appreciation of our wonderful crew members is going up. And these things work together and I'm not sure I know how to separate them out.","The other aspects of that is we all enjoy reaping the benefits of that and you're quite right, we do enjoy reaping the benefits of that. But these things take a long time in advance to orchestrate. And so we are incurring a lot of costs both capital costs and operating costs to put in place these things which then don't pay off for a while into the future.","And I also will admit that it's a little frustrating to have to invest now and reap the rewards later. But this is a long-term industry. We think our success is very much related to our ability to focus on what's happening not this year, but what's happening down the road. So, I'm not sure I know how to separate those things, but I think we all worked together to accomplish the goal.","Jason Liberty","Yes and I just want to add one other thing. I think it's good to kind of break down a little bit of it. Of our core yield growth this year, about a third of it is the new hardware and a little bit over two-thirds of it is improvement in our like-for-like business.","So, I think it's a combination of all the things that Richard talked about as well as just stronger demand or poor cruise perception of cruise continues to rise demographics are certainly following into the favor of cruise, a lot of multi-generational travel.","And so -- yes, I think that the piece this year which is -- if you heard us in the past we would typically say half of our yield growth was coming from the new hardware and half was coming from just core like-for-like yield growth. This year we're seeing an elevated amount of yield growth on just a like-for-like.","Richard Fain","And actually not to blabber your question, but it opens a lot of really important doors. The other thing that's happened is the cruise industry not just us, but the whole industry is doing a better job of addressing the growth in the public's demand for experiences over things. And so I think we have been also just fortunate that our industry is in the sweet spot of the direction that the public seems to be going in as well.","Felicia Hendrix","Thank you. That's helpful. And just a quick clarification when you guys kind of break out your like-for-like yield versus the other things like Silversea and the Terminal and Perfect Day.","Specifically on Perfect Day when you're breaking that out beyond like-for-like, is that just coming -- is that just about the revenues that are coming from Perfect Day? Or are you including the increases in pricing that you might be seeing in -- on the ships that are touching Perfect Day?","Jason Liberty","Yes, it's really focused on the on-island revenue that's there. In terms of the yield growth it's -- that's something that's in the core yield number.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, great. Perfect. Thank you so much.","Jason Liberty","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Beckel from Bernstein. Your line is open.","David Beckel","Hey thanks for the question. I just want to dig a little bit deeper into the improvement in the rest of the year. First question is just trying to get at how much of that is Royal-specific and how much of that is a better environment?","You called out onboard, it sounds like a lot of that is Royal-specific initiatives and higher ticket price some of which relates to Perfect Day. Are you also seeing higher ticket prices associated with an overall increase in demand for cruise?","And as a secondary part of that question is the improvement in the year that you're seeing pretty uniform across all future periods?","Jason Liberty","Sure. So certainly Perfect Day and Royal are helping us in the yield outlook story here. But we're seeing broad very strong demand for cruise. If you look at Celebrity -- especially with Celebrity Edge, I mean yield growth associated with that or the overall demand for Edge has really been exceptional.","So, I don't think it is a specific segment. I don't think it's a specific brand. I think we're seeing overall very strong demand for cruising in general. And yes that outlook at least for this year is a pretty consistent path in terms of yield growth. But I do think it's important just to put it in perspective I mean seeing some of the strength we've seen on our core yields this is not what we typically see in a year. So yes, I think we're yes as Richard commented, we are very delighted to see the global demand accelerating. But I always would kind of -- looking out into the future I would not expect this type of yield improvement year in year out.","David Beckel","Got it. That's helpful. And my second question is about Europe. Understanding that you can source guests from different markets, when you have been tapping the European markets, you said volumes were down. Is -- are you actually -- are you also taking price down in those markets? Or are you instead simply diverting demand to other markets? And in those other markets, is that putting a pressure on pricing when you have to rely a little bit more on other markets to replace that European demand?","Michael Bayley","Hi, David, it's Michael. I think the beauty of global infrastructure is we can switch on and off demand with relevant pricing relatively easy. We did expect some volatility and softness in the U.K. market this year. It's because of Brexit and we assumed there may be some volatility in Europe. But Europe's doing exactly what we needed to do this year and we're fortunate that the demand from the North American markets has been particularly strong.","And we also have good demand for our European products from Asia Pacific as well. So it's a mix. I think that we are lucky that we do have this global structure and we go through careful planning in terms of the year before in trying to guestimate what's going to happen in each of these markets. And I think we've done a pretty good job this year in figuring out what's going to happen.","David Beckel","Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.","Michael Bayley","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Harry Curtis from Instinet. Your line is open.","Harry Curtis","Good morning and thank you. Just a quick follow up on that. Could you just touch on European demand for European product particularly for TUI?","Jason Liberty","Yes so I'll comment specifically on TUI. I think as \u2013 obviously, we saw strength in the first quarter from our joint ventures and our largest joint venture is TUI. So hopefully that can provide you some kind of insight in terms of how TUI is trading. I think as Michael said, we expected there be some a bit softness as it relates to the U.K. It's not a volume. It's just more we're seeing better demand from other markets. And of course, when we see that, we're going to look to grab that demand and optimize our yields. And when you look at the other markets, northern markets in Europe are a little bit stronger than the southern markets. And yes, I know there's been some talk around Germany, but overall as it relates to TUI cruises which is really more where we are that business continues to perform very well.","Harry Curtis","And we're also picking up positive commentary on at least the very early stages of bookings for 2020. Can you give us some color on that please?","Jason Liberty","Yes it's definitely too early to start to comment on 2020. We're obviously seeing very strong demand trends that are accelerating our yield outlook for the -- for this year and we will comment on 2020 as we start to get to the back half of this year.","Harry Curtis","Okay. Well I'll try a different one than. It didn't look like you used any cash to repurchase stock, but you should generate some free cash flow this year. What you're thinking around that of these prices?","Jason Liberty","Okay. It's a different approach, but it's -- so as we've said for some time I mean our North Star here is looking at more investment grade credit metrics so it means maintaining between three and 3.5 times. We get closer to the lower end of those metrics as we get to the back half of this year. And as we've said for a long time that we very much believe in returning capital to our shareholders and improving shareholder returns. But as it relates to share repurchase, we do that opportunistically and we will certainly be looking at that in the back half of the year.","Harry Curtis","Okay. Its pretty good, thank you.","Jason Liberty","Thanks, Harry.","Operator","And thank you very much. Our next question comes from James Hardiman from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","James Hardiman","Hey, good morning. Couple for me. So I apologize if you already answered this. I don't think you did, but the non-organic stuff, the CocoCay, the new Cruise Terminal Silversea, you're now saying that's a 400 basis point benefit to the yield guide. I think that was previously 350 basis points. Really impressive after just one quarter. I guess what drove that specifically between the three major initiatives there?","Jason Liberty","Yes, well the 400 is really just relating to the second quarter, which we have not provided any guidance for. We still expect about 350 basis points in our yield guide for the full year.","James Hardiman","Okay. That's helpful. And then sort of following up on the Europe question. You\u2019ve now had a few weeks at least since that deadline was delayed about six months, and we've heard some commentary that maybe that should help -- maybe just a slicing things little bit too thin for you. But can you speak to whether or not the demand in the UK, which you called out as being fairly weak earlier in the year, is that getting any better given that we've got at least a short-term for you?","Michael Bayley","Hi, James, it's Michael. I think we commented earlier that we expected some softness or some volatility in the UK market, and we kind of planned for that. Interestingly, what we have seen is fairly good demand for products outside of Europe. So we've seen an uptick out of the UK market for products in the Caribbean and for Asia-Pacific coming out of the UK market. And I think that's happening generally out of the UK market.","But -- and for our ex-UK products, demand has continued to be pretty robust. It's the UK gas booking product in the Mediterranean that's probably the most, I would say, volatile. And I think that's based upon anxiety of how exactly the visa issue is going to be resolved. But it's all of course, as we all know, it's an incredibly uncertain. And I think that's what's creating that uncertainty with the customer in terms of booking those products. But the other products are doing quite well.","James Hardiman ","And then, lastly for me -- go ahead.","Jason Liberty","No, no James, I was just going to add to -- just keep in mind that if that decision was taken pretty late in the booking cycle for that consumer for the Med.","James Hardiman","Okay. That's helpful. And then just the last market, I want to touch on Alaska. There's been a lot of hindering about what's going on there given higher capacity this year. Sounds like, it's going pretty well for you guys specifically, but maybe talk about the health of pricing in the Alaska market. Are the ships that have been there a while able to absorb sort of the increased capacity without taking too much of a hit on the pricing front?","Michael Bayley","James, it's Michael. I think we're kind of pleased with Alaska. I mean we -- I think as Jason mentioned earlier, we increased our capacity in the Alaska market by quite a lot this year. Ovation of the Seas is the largest newest ship to go into the Alaska market. Celebrity Edge is the second Celsius class ship. Our capacity was up in the high-double-digits. I think it was something like 24%, 25% increase in capacity.","It's only about 5% of our total capacity for the whole business, and of course, it's the highest yielding geographical market that we have. So, we've added quite a lot of capacity. We're doing very well in the market, and we're pleased with our results there. I think maybe other brands and products are having a struggle, but we're feeling pretty good about where we are.","James Hardiman","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jaime Katz from Morningstar. Your line is open.","Jaime Katz","I'm curious if you would like to comment on the expansion of the distribution channels in China that was mentioned. I'm curious mostly, how that's changed maybe over the last year, and how you sort of envision that changing in the year ahead to help sort of fortify the brand locally?","Michael Bayley","Hi, Jamie, it's Michael. We're feeling again pretty good about the journey that we're on with the distribution in China. I'm not going to comment specifically about percentage changes that we've achieved over the past couple of years. We decided, I think it was three years ago we set the course to change the model in terms of distribution, but also product and itinerary lanes. And we set ourselves internal targets to ensure that we were on the right track, and we've met or exceeded those targets each year for the past three years.","And we feel like we're really in a good place in terms of where we want to go. Obviously the fact that we've brought -- we're bringing Spectrum of the Seas our newest and latest Quantum Ultra ship into the China market I think really supports the decisions that we've made previously. And Spectrums, it's a lot of anticipation and excitement in the China market for the arrival of Spectrum and the bookings are in a really good place.","Jaime Katz","Okay. And then, I know it's small, but there's this minority interest that's sort of flowing through now, and I'm curious what the right way to think about the cadence of that is going forward? Because we don't really have any frame of reference historically.","Jason Liberty","Yeah. Hi. I think you are talking about the non-controlling interests?","Jaime Katz","Right.","Jason Liberty","Yeah. So, it really just relates to the one-third interest that we don't have, because we consolidate Silversea. That flows through our P&L. It would be 100%, and then the non-controlling interest gets back down for the one-third. And so, it is going to be difficult to model, I can see externally this year. But it should be a relatively small amount in each quarter that impacts us as we built this overseas business up.","Jaime Katz","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Tim Conder","Thank you, and congrats, first of all, for a good start of the year, gentleman. On 2020, Jason, I wanted to circle back to that. I know you said it's early and you give more color. But during your earlier comments about there's an ongoing debate as which it should be as to how much bookings you want to take on and the trade-off versus given that price. So can you say at this point for 2020 how you're booked and pricing trends relative to looking into 2019 at this point last year? Just any color there.","And maybe flush through a little bit more, should we anticipate the booking curve to continue to expand as part of that debate or not?","Jason Liberty","Yeah. Well, another good attempt, Tim. I could say, but I won't. It is very early on. Obviously, we're in a very good booking environment. But I'm not going to comment or we're not going to comment on the book position for 2020. We're -- we've obviously seen very good trends into this year that would result on those raisings our yield guidance, but it is way too early to start to comment on the outlook or to give you even a book position that may or may not provide you the proper realities of what the future looks like.","Richard Fain","Tim, I think we should maybe reemphasize. The comment that we made about booking wasn't anything to do with the world as we're seeing it today. It's a point that we've made before which is that we think that there may be too much focus on this statistics that we are ahead on bookings in both volume and price, because we actually drive some of that. And also if we just change the way our itineraries work.","So, if we shifted in one year -- and I'm not saying we're doing that -- but if we have one year where we had much more shorter cruises we would expect to have less other books at a lower prices and conversely if we had a year where we had less -- more long-term bookings you would expect that statistic to go up. And so, I think our concern is that people may be putting too much emphasis on that.","And I hate to put cold water on our ability to forecast, but a couple of years ago in one of our calls I actually made the point that I thought that we have reached a peak and that we probably wouldn't want to increase the amount of early bookings that we took and in fact, our revenue manager said no actually given the circumstances we've got to go even higher. So, my prediction there wasn't very, very accurate.","So, I think we were -- we were really making a generic comment. And we really, I want to emphasize, are not trying to make any comment about 2020 or 2021.","Tim Conder","Okay. Okay. No, no, helpful. And then on the higher cost guide, Jason, you said the majority of that was Oasis. Was that virtually all of it? Or are you maybe seeing some opportunities for the long-term and tweaking up some spending for other items?","Jason Liberty","Yeah. I mean, the vast majority of it was either Oasis relating to the APCDs or so on the repair cost. There are some other small related investments like in technology and so forth that we're making, but not large sums of money.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then lastly just a clarification on the U.K., in particular. You mentioned that soft on a relative basis on the one hand, but I guess in an absolute basis, are U.K. yields up or down just to be direct with it?","Jason Liberty","Yeah. We don't guide by market, but I -- or provide yield by market. But what I would say is that -- I think a better word is that it's -- the U.K. is softer than North America and then North America is stronger than -- our systems and tools and how we do things means, we're going to source more guests out of North America.","As Michael said this is -- based off of what we had been seeing for sometime, we expect a less sourcing to take place out of the U.K. because of the strengths we saw in the other markets. But I wouldn't read into it too deeply that there is a major issue in the U.K. It's more of that we have seen stronger demand trends from other markets.","Tim Conder","Helpful. Thank you very much, gentlemen.","Jason Liberty","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Stephen Grambling","Hey, thanks for taking the question. One of the big changes over the past few years seems to have been your ability to hold on to pricing premiums on new ships passed kind of year one to two. Is that all coming from existing customers? Or are you also able to continue to drive new-to-cruise the new customers on those ships relative to the years passed?","Michael Bayley","Hi, Stephen, this is Michael. I think we stated a few years ago one of our key areas of focus was on new-to-cruise in particularly in market like the United States we've been quite focused on growing our new-to-cruise segment. We have changed some of our strategy so everything that we've done with the short product where we took the Voyager class ships and put them through role amplified and then place them into the short product with Perfect Day CocoCay has really stimulated that new-to-cruise segment. So that's part of it.","Our loyalty customers continue to grow. They like the brands and they enjoy what we provide. I think the new ships, we've been very focused on not only the continuation of kind of on innovation in bringing new products and services to our guests. But we've done a lot more analytics on, really trying to understand what's going to attract those customers and bring them back and also be able to maintain higher yields.","A \u2013 Jason Liberty","Just to add to it as well, I'd keep in mind, these ships are having much richer mix of inventory than numerous ships. They also have many more onboard revenue venues. And I think it's also one of the things that's different about them maybe versus some of our ships or legacy ships is that, they source very well globally. So there's a lot of new-to-cruise, but a lot of that is not just coming from a single market, it's coming from many different markets.","Q \u2013 Stephen Grambling","Maybe a quick follow up. On the existing customer base, would you attribute some of the ongoing strength in that customer base, not only to the new product that you have, but also it sounds like, I don't want to put words into your month, but the way that you engage with those customers going forward whether that's using technology or being more direct to the consumer?","A \u2013 Michael Bayley","I think it's a combination. I mean one of the key metrics that we look at we're focused on and we drive towards of course is the net promoter score. And if you look at the -- all of our brands, performance over the last few years, we've seen a steady increase in the satisfaction levels from our guests. And I think that comes through on all of the things that you mentioned plus, plus, plus. I mean, I think, across the entire organization, we are focused on delivering great vacations and we're seeing that coming through with demand. And that demand allows us to maintain pricing premiums.","A \u2013 Jason Liberty","Yes I would just add I think it's -- you had mentioned Stephen about direct. I don't think it's about direct. I mean we really are a channel of choice. But I think that the technology that we're employing, I think the work we're doing around data and the consumer insights that come out of that are really yielding a better engagement with the consumer, a better understanding for the consumer is looking for in the product which is really led to a lot of our modernization of our ships and the basis of our new ships. And it is also why we're very focused on the destination experience. So I think it's a combination of all those things to make sure that we are providing a relevant product that -- or products that our consumers are very attracted to and are willing to pay for.","Q \u2013 Stephen Grambling","Thanks so much.","A \u2013 Jason Liberty","Okay, do we have time for one more question?","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Brandt Montour from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Brandt Montour","Great, good morning, thanks, for taking my question. Just hoping for a little clarification on CocoCay. So the 350 basis points from the non-core which includes that is unchanged since last quarter, so just wondering if you could help us understand what's changed in the guidance at this point for CocoCay since then? And kind of given what you guys has said pre-cruise onboard sales continued to come in so well?","A \u2013 Jason Liberty","Yes so as it relates to -- again the items that we had kind of called out of the Perfect Day and for the Miami and Silversea, on the Perfect Day side that is really relating to the onboard or really the onshore dollars. So in our 75 basis points increase in our yields or that we've provided that's really -- included in that is yield improvement that we have seen or salvation of yield improvement we have seen for the ships that are going to Perfect Day. But that's just a component of that. The pre-cruise sales we're seeing in general are accelerating and the different experiential things on the ships are also very much a part of that as well as the great demand we're seeing from our other brands and other markets around the world.","Q \u2013 Brandt Montour","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then on the fuel, just given fuel prices there are even more topical. You hedged more next year at this point than you were at this time last year, but that number is essentially unchanged this last quarter. So I just kind of, if you could give us an update on the strategy given what's happening to oil prices?","A \u2013 Jason Liberty","Well we have a very consistent hedging program. We're typically 40% to 60% hedged 12 to 24 months out. So it's not a reflection of how we maybe feel in the moment about fuel prices. But one thing I would say about if you look at our fuel hedging into the future it is more -- it's indexed more towards MGO than it is to IFO and so I would give you those characteristics of the hedged profile going forward.","Q \u2013 Brandt Montour","Got it, thanks a lot guys, great quarter.","Jason Liberty","Great. Okay thank you for your assistance Cheryl today. And we thank you all for your participation and interest in the company. Carola will be available for any follow-ups you might have and we wish you all a very good day.","Operator","Thank you very much ladies and gentleman for joining us today.

My name is James, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.'s First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise and after the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I'd now like to introduce Chief Financial Officer, Jason Liberty. Mr. Liberty, the floor is yours.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will soon become our Vice Chairman; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carola Mengolini, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com. Before we get started, I'd like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide.","During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance, and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Please note that we do not undertake to update the information in our filings as circumstances change. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP historical items can be found on our website. Unless we state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency basis.","Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview of the business. I will follow with a recap of our first quarter results, provide an update on the booking environment, and then provide an update on our full-year and second-quarter guidance for 2018. We will then open up the call for your questions. Richard?","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everybody. It's been a great first quarter, and it looks like it's going to be another great year, so I'm really happy to be able to talk a little bit more about it.","I do admit that last year was such an exceptional year that there may have been some slight trepidation about our being able to beat it. Fortunately today, we're really encouraged by the outlook, and we're looking forward to beating even last year by 16% or so. In fact, we're not only feeling very encouraged about 2018, but also about the potential for the longer-term future.","Now, last year was somewhat unusual, as the demand from our key markets was pervasively strong. There simply weren't any, or virtually any area of weakness. This year is actually following a similar pattern, but there are a few more puts and takes.","For example, sailings out of Puerto Rico are a little weaker this year due to the hurricane perception and to logistic issues in San Juan. Our original guidance for the year anticipated most of this. But regardless, last year was so strong that it's hard to be too disappointed about where we are.","On the other hand, demand for European cruises continues to accelerate, even above last year's enviable strengths. These types of aberrations are very typical and they show the true benefits of having a diversified, global sourcing platform and going to over 500 destinations.","Overall, our revenues for the year are looking to be even better than we expected. Onboard revenues have been particularly strong, while ticket revenue is generally in line with what we thought. I'd like to point out that our operating costs are also up a bit over our original expectations.","As we've said many times, we manage the company to maximize the bottom line, not the middle line. We have identified some specific steps, which we think will increase our future revenue, and we're incurring a small amount of additional costs to realize these expected benefits. Personally, I view that as a highly worthwhile trade-off.","Now, while we're pleased that this year continues to be so solid, we really focus on the implications of that for the longer term. We focus heavily on the supply\/demand balance for our industry, and that balance continues to be robust. The popularity of cruising continues to grow, and we take a lot of comfort from what we're seeing on the demand side of that equation.","I'm well aware there's a lot of focus on the supply side of the equation and that's appropriate. But the demand side is just as important, and as I've discussed in the past, something which we are fortunate to be in a position to impact in a nice way.","That's why we're so encouraged by the growing power of our individual brands, as well as the success we've had with our new ships, with our price integrity program, with our non-refundable deposit structure and with so many other initiatives across the enterprise.","People continue to gravitate towards vacations that give them experiences and memories and our cruises do precisely that.","In addition, our exceptional Internet capabilities, which continue to lead the industry, allow our guests to share these memories with others on social media. I attribute some of the recent healthy growth in demand to our success in the social media environment. Our social media teams really are doing an amazing job.","At the same time, we have recently been revealing more and more about our new products. You're all familiar with Symphony of the Seas that just started operating in Europe; Azamara Pursuit, which is coming out later this summer, also in Europe; the new Mein Schiff [1], which starts operating in May; and Celebrity Edge, which will start towards the end of the year.","The public reaction to Symphony of the Seas was surprising, even to us. Even though she's the fourth in the amazing Oasis class series of ships, she has so many new amenities and attractions that our guests and the media were simply blown away. Rarely has a sister ship received such press and rarely has it been so deserving of it. I'm sitting here across from Michael Bayley, and I can tell you that his face is still beaming from the inaugurals.","At the same time, Lisa Lutoff[-Perlo] and I recently visited Celebrity Edge, which is under construction in France. We've been overwhelmed by the level of interest that this new ship has generated. It really is staggering to see how much talk there is about such a ship, so many months before she delivers. I'm very happy to report that she justifies all the attention, and I think people will be very impressed when they see her later this year.","Now, moving onto another topic that addresses the needs of our customers. This year, we're also amping up the short Caribbean getaway. In past calls, you've heard me talk about changes in consumer preferences and the importance of being able to respond and to adapt quickly. One good example of these changes is that we're seeing more and more people opting for shorter, but more frequent vacations.","We are responding to that call by modernizing the Mariner of the Seas, which is one of our Voyager class ships. And we're raising our game in the short cruise market with this upgraded vessel.","At the same time, we also announced a major upgrade to our private destination in the Bahamas at CocoCay that we are calling, appropriately I might add, Perfect Day. Perfect Day and that destination will be another great addition to our Caribbean offering. It's really thrilling to see the work take shape, and I'm certain that this destination will get tongues wagging just as much as our new hardware has done.","So as 2018 develops in such a very constructive way, we're highly focused on 2019, which is also shaping up to be a very exciting year indeed based on the strength of our brands, the enhancements to our destination offerings, exciting technological innovations and the continued focus of our people.","With that, I'll turn the microphone back to Jason. Jason?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thank you, Richard. I will begin by talking about our results for the first quarter of 2018. These results are summarized on slide 2. For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $1.09 per share, which is approximately $0.14 higher than our guidance and approximately 10% higher than same time last year.","Net revenue yields were up 4.9% for the quarter, which is 165 basis points higher than the midpoint of our guidance. Ticket revenue was better than expected. The main driver of the positive variance in yield was continued strength in onboard revenue, which was up 6.3% for the quarter.","This result is notable considering that it follows an 8.9% improvement from the first quarter of 2017. As I've mentioned over the past couple of quarters, guest spend from onboard activities has continued to shift towards areas that involve experiences over buying things, and this quarter was no different.","Beverage packages, specialty restaurants and Internet were the main revenue streams driving the quarterly beat. Net cruise costs excluding fuel per APCD were up 11.2% for the quarter, which was slightly above the guidance driven mainly by timing.","Depreciation, favorability and outperformance from TUI Cruises helped contribute to the earnings beat in the first quarter. On the shareholder return front, we repurchased $275 million in shares during the quarter, completing our share repurchase program from last year, and paid $128 million in dividends.","Now, I'd like to update you on what we are seeing in the demand environment. On our last earnings call we shared that Wave was off to a very good start and that we were booked ahead in both rate and volume.","Those trends continued for the remainder of the Wave period fueled by strong demand for each of our brands and core itineraries. The 2017 Wave period was the strongest in our history and 2018 has been even better.","As a result, we remain booked ahead from same time last year in both rate and volume. The booking window has continued to extend and Q2 to Q4 continued to book in line with our January guidance.","Four of our brands are welcoming new ships in the fleet this year and Symphony of the Seas, Celebrity Edge, Azamara Pursuit and TUI Cruises' Mein Schiff 1 are each outperforming the rest of the fleet in their respective markets.","Demand for Symphony has been strong since we opened the European season for sale, and increased further upon her delivery a few weeks ago. Prices for Symphony have not only exceeded our lofty expectations, they've also been even better than we saw from Harmony last year. Edge will join Celebrity's fleet at the end of the year and has been enjoying very strong demand at very high prices.","Outside of our smaller Azamara and Galapagos ships, Edge is our best booked ship for 2019 from both a load factor and price perspective. We just took ownership of Azamara Pursuit and following a major modernization, she will begin sailing in Europe in August. But despite opening for sale a year later than her sister ships, Pursuit's European sailings are already booked at comparable load factors.","Our very successful German joint venture TUI Cruises will take delivery of new Mein Schiff 1 next month. Demand for TUI Cruises' brand is exceptionally strong and continues to accelerate as they further expand their destination offering.","Now, I'd like to provide you an update on what we're seeing in each of our core products. The Caribbean accounts for just over half of our full-year capacity. In 2018, the Caribbean will feature more Cuba sailings than last year, and an inaugural winter season for both Symphony and Edge. The Caribbean was very strong in 2017, which has provided for a difficult year-over-year comparable. However, demand has been strong, and bookings have been trending ahead of same time last year.","European itineraries account for 17% of our capacity and have been receiving consistently strong demand. As a result, the product is booked ahead of last year at record levels. Trends for North America have remained particularly strong, which not only results in higher ticket prices, but also increased onboard spend.","Asia-Pacific itineraries account for 17% of our 2018 capacity, and had a particularly strong first quarter with nice yield growth in Australia, China and Southeast Asia. These itineraries are in a good book position for the year, with China trending well ahead supported by our efforts to expand the distribution in the Chinese market. Overall, the booking environment for Q2 through Q4 remains very strong and in line with our previous expectations.","If you turn to slide 3, you will see our updated guidance for the full year 2018. We expect net revenue yield growth of 2% to 3.75%, an increase versus January guidance due to the outperformance in the first quarter. Our expectations for Q2 through Q4 remain essentially unchanged.","From a cost perspective, we are anticipating net cruise costs, excluding fuel, to be up approximately 2.5%. The updated cost guidance reflects our decision to further invest in demand-generating activities and consider some ships related to our joint ventures that were previously expected to benefit operating costs and will now be reflected below the operating profit line.","Since our last call, the dollar has strengthened versus our basket of currencies. The combination of a stronger U.S. dollar and higher bunker prices has negatively impacted our earnings per share guidance by approximately $0.10. We expect fuel expense of $678 million for the year and we are 50% hedged. Based on the current business outlook I previously described, along with current fuel prices, interest and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $8.70 to $8.90 per share, $0.15 higher than our previous guidance.","Before I move onto the second quarter, I'd like to reiterate the guidance we gave on the last call regarding our yield cadence for the year. Our yield improvement is expected to be higher in the first and last quarter, particularly due to drydock timing, an earlier Easter, tougher summer comparables and the timing of new hardware.","Now, we can turn to our guidance for the second quarter, which is on slide 4. We expect net revenue yields to be up 1.5% to 2% for the second quarter. Strong net yield growth of 11.5% during Q2 2017, plus the timing of Easter, made for a tougher comparable year-over-year. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up approximately 5%. Costs for the quarter are impacted by more drydock days and our decision to increase our investments in demand-generating activities.","Based on current fuel prices, interest and currency exchange rates, and the outlook expressed above, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.90 per share.","With that, I'll ask our operator to open up the (00:16:50)","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Go ahead please.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Hello.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Good morning.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. So a few questions. I wanted to kind of unpack the comment that you made both in your press release and in your prepared remarks just saying that your second quarter through fourth quarter is basically in line with the previous expectation. Now, we know that the booking curve is out far, you did say that 2018 is better than 2019.","So I'm just wondering, is that something \u2013 like a performance that you would have expected? Or is it kind of hard to expect upside when you have the booking curve this far out?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes. Well, the booking curve, I think, is always a factor in this. But I think when you look at your commentary first in the first quarter, some of the things that we were implementing early on in the year actually took faster than we thought. And so we were better in the first quarter on the onboard revenue side, but we had expected those onboard revenue activities to kind of pick up Q2 through Q4.","And so the ticket environment, which we had commented on, for the first quarter, was basically as we expected, it was a little bit better and those trends have really continued. Of course, we expected the year to be strong based off the booking activities early on in the year, and that has been pretty consistent for the balance of the year to date. And so I think our commentary is not something more to read into, except that the year, on the ticket side, is pretty much behaving how we had expected it to.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And can you just talk about \u2013 you said that the demand in bookings were better in the Caribbean. Can you talk about the pricing environment? And if you can, just kind of call through like what you're seeing in the Western Caribbean versus the Eastern. That would be helpful.","Michael W. Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Hi, Felicia, it's Michael. Yeah, demand has been strong and we're booking ahead of same time last year in the Caribbean, so we're quite pleased with the performance. When you look at the differential between the Southern, Eastern and Western, as we'd commented earlier, Puerto Rico has been slightly sluggish. But then the Western Caribbean and other itineraries have been performing particularly well, including the Cuban itineraries, which we've almost doubled capacity into Cuba this year.","So the balance of things are quite good. And then I think it's also worth pointing out that when you look at the Caribbean overall, I think it's about 51% of our total capacity in the Caribbean in 2018. The numbers by quarter are quite different. So Q1, over 70% of our total capacity was in the Caribbean, and we had a pretty good quarter as we've just announced. As you move into Q2, it drops down to the mid-40s, and then Q3 just below 40% and Q4 around 57%.","So the environment is fairly good. It's meeting our expectations. And in fact, the last couple of weeks, we've seen quite a lot of strength in our bookings for Caribbean.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's super helpful. And just final, Jason, on housekeeping, we're just getting a lot of questions about some of the costs, accounting changes and moving stuff with the JV. So maybe you could be more specific about that?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes. I mean, in terms of the geography, it's really more \u2013 first off, our JV has continued to do exceptionally well and there are just \u2013 there are some small favorability that we had estimated would benefit us on the cost line, but we're actually going to be accounting for it below the line.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And is there \u2013 like you said, is that your choice or is that kind of more of an auditor kind of advice or is...","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","No. Well, it's a combination of choice and also that's the appropriate way to account for it.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, all right, great. Thank you.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","You got it. Thanks Felicia.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley from UBS. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks. Two things I wanted to ask about. One is the higher expense from the revenue-generating activity or demand-generating activities. Can you give us a little color about what that might be, just so we can think about the timing because sort of typically you would think about, if you're just spending on like increased TV ads, you'd expect that to maybe impact booking in the same quarter. And so just wondering if the demand-generating spend is focused on something that will impact bookings today or is it more something like a few quarters out? And I do have one other question.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah. Sure. So on the demand-generating, there is lots of different things that we're choosing to invest in to improve demand and attract high-value customers, which are certainly on the rise. Now, keep in mind as we are heavily booked for the year, and so a lot of this will help influence 2019 and beyond.","But again, it's \u2013 I wouldn't go into anything specific yet, except to say that we think that there is a opportunity to continue to accelerate the attraction of high-value customers, and that's what we're looking to invest the money. But again, we're talking about \u2013 this is a small amount of money.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","And so it sounds like basically you're saying, you're not spending that. You're not having to spend more to hit the yields that you had guided. This spend is really for sort of next year's yield, is that...","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes. This year, there's \u2013 I mean, obviously, there's \u2013 you can influence it on the margins, but it's much more about 2019 and beyond.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","That's great. Thanks. And then just wanted to ask about the onboard activity, which you mentioned is driving a lot of the upside here. Is that actually people spending more when they get onboard, deciding to spend more? Or is this all part of the fact that you're pre-selling it and selling it as part of the initial ticket package and pre-selling all this before they actually board?","I'm just trying to get a sense of whether it's sort of that you're \u2013 it's maybe a package and you're sort of accounting for some of it as those things? Or if it's people getting onboard and getting out their wallets then?","Michael W. Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Hi Robin, it's Michael. It's both. I mean, obviously, we've been really pleased with our pre-cruise sales, and we've seen a significant uplift year-over-year that's been increasing for the past couple of years, and it's a big driver of onboard spend. I mean we kind of figure that if we \u2013 for every dollar that we earn pre-cruise we'll see somewhere between a 30% and a 50% uptick in the onboard spend. So it's a really positive environment.","And then of course over the years we've invested quite heavily in new venues and new attractions onboard of our ships and many of those are revenue-generating. And we're beginning to see a lot of those now yielding superior revenue because of the kind of services that they provide.","So it's really in the combination. And then I'd say the third element is, as we'd mentioned, people really are seeking experiences. So our Internet has been really selling very well. And then of course things like shore excursions, et cetera, we've seen a significant uplift there.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Robin, it's Richard here. Good morning. I'll just add, you're focusing, as I understand, clearly on sort of the marginal change. We're looking at all these things together and more as a total revenue at the margin.","But you've also put your finger on something as Michael says, this, the pre-booking is a real advantage. It increases the spend. It also increases their satisfaction. So it's across the board, it's a terrific thing to do.","But there's not only the cost associated with the specifics, but there's also the cost of the technology. And we think that is paying off over time this year and next year. But there's no question it's a cost. We think it's a cost that quickly pays for itself.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. No, that's very helpful. And I just think it's helpful to think about how the expense is not really \u2013 it's not that you're needing to spend more to maintain your yield guidance. So that's helpful to think about that as being kind of for future. Okay. Thanks.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Great. Thanks, Robin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel from Bernstein. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks for the question. Just wanted to drill into the Caribbean environment a little bit. I think it was two calls ago and maybe the last call you mentioned that there was a period of softness after last year's hurricanes.","I'm just curious, have you made up that period of softness as of today? And also wanted to confirm, I think Michael said that you are ahead in all parts of the Caribbean or just the Caribbean as a whole? And then I have a follow-up.","Michael W. Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Yeah, hi, David, it's Michael. Yeah, we're ahead overall in the Caribbean. I mean we've got obviously a lot of product in the Caribbean, in different parts of the Caribbean. So as usual, the story is mixed across different products.","We had commented earlier that the product out of Puerto Rico was softer. Of course, it's only one ship that we have full year operating out of Puerto Rico in the whole portfolio of ships.","Western Caribbean, after the hurricanes in September, Western Caribbean performed extremely well, while Eastern Caribbean was sluggish. And then we did see a period of quite a few weeks where it took time for the Eastern Caribbean to start coming back and the same with the Southern Caribbean.","It's also worth pointing out that during that whole period, I think we'd mentioned it previously, if you look at those three storms that blew through in September, it was very unique and it really impacted negatively about five or six ports out a total of around 60 ports.","So there's plenty of product and itineraries that are being opened for sale and have done very, very well even during this period.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","And, David, the other point that I wanted to add, because I think it's important just to add on to Michael's comment about us being in a strong year-over-year book position in the Caribbean, I would also consider that we have a significant increase this year with \u2013 in the short product area with Mariner coming in. And that's a much closer in booking product.","So for us to be in a position of strength in combination with the closer \u2013 in booked type of product like the short Caribbean, really kind of, I think, is a testament to the strength of our position in the Caribbean today.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. That's really helpful. And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about close-in pricing. This is the first quarter in a while that I can remember where that wasn't called out as a surprise to the upside. Is it because you're getting better at forecasting future sort of close-in demand and any upside there? Or is the curve now sort of lapping itself in terms of the extension and the amount that you can push close-in pricing going forward?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Well, I think as it relates to close-in pricing, obviously, we very much focus in on behavior of the past. And so how we have \u2013 those behaviors in the quarters, especially over the past four to six quarters where we saw strength in close-in, that's something that we would be accounting for in how we look at our book position and as well as our guidance.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah. David, I would also say, I kind of share your view. Last year, we were really constantly surprised at how strong the year turned out. And so I think we kept saying during the year, it was an exceptional year. And we think that this has been a very strong year, but I think we are not seeing the extraordinary pleasant surprises that we had last year.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. So I want to ask \u2013 I know everybody is kind of harping on the Caribbean. I want to ask just a little bit differently, maybe a little bit more straightforward for Jason or Michael. But I guess a simple question is if you removed Symphony, Mariner, Edge from your portfolio, would like-for-like price in the Caribbean still be up year-over-year for all four quarters?","Michael W. Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","That question is exceptionally difficult to answer because, of course, as one ship comes in, we redeploy other ships. So there's a lot of movement of deployment to accommodate ships that we put into specific products during specific times. So I'm not sure that's an easy answerable question. I can tell you that when you look at our deployment in the Caribbean in 2018, we're obviously excited about the fact that Symphony of the Seas is coming in, in the fourth quarter.","And I think as we'd previously mentioned, Symphony is knocking it out of the park in terms of booking. I mean, it was doing exceptionally well before we introduced it. And literally, one little statistic, the week after we introduced Symphony of the Seas, our bookings beat track by 50%. That's the week after we introduced the ship. So it's really performing well. It's coming into the Caribbean, and it's coming into our new terminal, Terminal A. And then of course, Celebrity Edge as well.","To Jason's comments about Mariner \u2013 Mariner is, we're very excited about Mariner as a product coming into the shorts market, and that's very much focused on new-to-cruise and millennial, and that really is the on-ramp for that market. That ship is literally like having an Oasis class ship in the short product market because its capacity is just over 3,000, 3,200, 3,400 every three or four days, and the sweet spot for Mariner is just coming up. So we're about three months away from launching the ship into the shorts market, and already sales are good for that product.","Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Got you. Thanks for that color. And then the second question would be around buybacks. You bought back $275 million first quarter. You exhausted your repo program. And I guess the question is now, you continue to execute \u2013 continue to produce pretty good results and solid results. And obviously, looking to your stock today, it's not really working. So how should we think about you guys, right now not having a repo program in place and kind of the capital deployment plan you guys see?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes. Well, thanks for calling \u2013 qualifying our performance as pretty well. Yeah, but...","Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'll change that to great.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Steve. So on the capital deployment basis, I think that you're going to continue \u2013 so first off, it's always something that is at the discretion of our board, whether or not we continue on with a share repurchase program. But we have generally believed that a mix of shareholder returns should include the performance of the business, i.e., to the share price, dividend growth and also repurchasing shares opportunistically. There is nothing I would say that would say that we would change that behavior at this point in time.","Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, I appreciate it.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","You got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman from Wedbush. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call here.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Good morning.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","I think we've touched around the edges on a lot of this, but I was hoping we could maybe address the two major bear cases head on. I guess, first, and obviously, this isn't the first time you've heard any of this, but the notion that Caribbean capacity accelerates particularly in the third quarter.","Obviously, we've got guidance for 2Q, but I think the bigger concern this year is 3Q. So I guess to the extent you feel comfortable, any data points or anecdotes about Caribbean pricing once capacity there really accelerates. You gave us sort of the phasing of guidance, 1Q and 4Q the best, 2Q and 3Q not as strong. I don't know if 3Q is expected to be worse than 2Q, but any data points on that front would be helpful.","And then as we think about 2019, obviously, the bear case there is that global capacity accelerates. Pretty difficult to disprove that in April of 2018 that that's going to be a big negative on yields. But I guess as we think about that supply-demand, we know that supply is going to accelerate, is there any reason to think that demand will accelerate next year to match it? And if not, should we assume that yield next year \u2013 I mean, obviously, I don't expect guidance from you guys, but on an industry-wide basis, this notion that yields are going to be worse next year than this year, is that a valid assumption or do you have any thoughts on that?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah. So first just on the question on the Caribbean side, obviously, we've commented about being in a strong book position and also with bookings accelerating for the Caribbean. I won't get into specifically by product what our book position is, but what I will tell you for the third quarter is that we are in a strong book position on both a rate and volume basis. And so we \u2013 yes, we understand where the supply is. I think people should consider our dialogue around the booking window having extended for a period of time, us being in a very strong position of strength at the turn of the year. And so we've obviously been anticipating the supply that has been coming in to the different regions and products of the world. But I would say that we are in a very good position for Q3.","On the capacity side, I think that there \u2013 obviously, our commentary about the booking environment is what we're seeing, which would include sailings in the 2019 period of time though it's still very early, but the acceleration and the strength that we're talking about also reflects what we're seeing in 2019.","I think when we consider demand, I think we've been pretty consistent about this, there are some very strong demographic shifts, there are very strong consumer trends of people buying experiences versus stuff. Richard commented in his script about the perception of cruise on the rise, and we think levers like social media and so forth are really helping break through stereotypes on cruise. And we have seen a real change in our new-to-cruise volumes. That's also suggesting that a lot of these past detractors are becoming fans of cruise.","And also, we continue to focus on penetrating the different markets around the world. We're expanding our footprint each and every year and penetration in all those different markets. So we think there's a lot of reasons why you investors and us are very excited about the future demand of cruise. And of course, we need to make sure that we're managing the booking environment and the consideration of the supply that's coming on in different quarters and in different years.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","That's really helpful. And then lastly for me, I was hoping you could touch on Cuba. When Cuba first opened up there was a lot of discussion about capacity constraints and infrastructure limitations. And yet, more and more sailing seems to be going to Cuba. I guess, how have you been able to do that? And as we look forward, obviously, there's been a leadership change in Cuba. Is there the opportunity for sailings to Cuba to continue to go up as we move forward?","Adam M. Goldstein - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Hi. It's Adam. Yes, we've been commenting over time about the fact that the Cuban market, first of all, has been a good market for us to enter. The customer satisfaction about Havana has been very, very high. But the reality is that there is still just one functioning pier that ships can go to on either side of the pier in Havana, there's going to have to be some type of considerable infrastructure improvement that takes place over the next several years. That will probably take time.","I think what we've been seeing lately is that the Cuban government has gotten a little bit more efficient at maximizing the use of the pier on both sides, and our company has definitely been a beneficiary of that. We've been able to increase the number of sailings on a year-over-year basis, even though their capacity hasn't increased. They've just been better at getting our ships into the berth.","So for what it is, it's been terrific. But in the overall sense of our portfolio, it's still fairly small. And we haven't seen any change whatsoever in their attitude towards us or their dealings with us as it relates to their change in government to this point.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thanks, James.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup. Go ahead please, your line is open.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you. First, on China. Jason, did you mention that yields were positive in the first quarter? And then would you expect the trend to improve further throughout the year as compares get easier and you just have lessening capacity in the industry?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","I did comment that China was quite strong in the first quarter. We didn't comment specifically in terms of what our yield guidance would be for China but we do expect yields to be up quite nicely in the Asia Pac area. And of course China is a contributor of that.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And in terms of the Med, could you differentiate between what you're seeing in the Eastern Med, the Western Med? And then I know you mentioned that Europe overall was strong and North American-sourced business, you called that out. I'm assuming European-sourced was \u2013 passenger demand was strong as well. How would you characterize the European-sourced passenger demand as well?","Michael W. Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Hi, Greg. Yeah, European demand for European product has been strong. And of course, North American demand for European products has been I would say even stronger.","So it's so far it's a great season and it's looking like it's going to be good for the year in Europe. With regards to Western, Eastern Med, we are seeing \u2013 I think it was a couple of years ago with all of the geopolitical issues, there was a lot of capacity shift from the Eastern to Western and Northern.","And over the past several months, we've seen an increase in demand and a shift with a lot of the Northern European tour operators in terms of taking people to Eastern Med destinations. So demand is coming back.","I think we see more stability in the region and I think that's translating into increased interest from our customers. We have started to slightly increase our capacity and itineraries into the Eastern Med.","We've got some this year and we've got more next year and the demand looks good. And I think if we're lucky and the geopolitical situation stays stable I think the Eastern Med may be returning.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis from Nomura Instinet. Go ahead please. Your line is open.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hi. Good morning. Could you give us a sense of how much marketing spend is targeted still for this year or to what degree are you able to look ahead and focus on marketing in 2019 now?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah. Sure. Sure, Harry. So I commented on this a little bit earlier, but really \u2013 and this year is very well booked. Certainly, we can be influencing this year on the margins by increasing investments in demand-generating activities.","But really what we're focused on is improving demand generation especially for high-value guests further out. So it's more related to 2019 and beyond than it is significantly influencing 2018.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah. Harry, it's Richard, just to add to that, coming back at I think a little bit you're covering some of the same territory that Robin covered. We think this is proving to be a very positive year.","And it on its own is performing at least as well as we expected it. And overall, we've raised our guidance for the year. Our marketing, our technology investments, our other demand-generating investments are really generally fairly long-term kinds of things.","And so I'll disabuse the notion that in order to keep the yields up, we've had to invest heavily in marketing. I think our focus continues to be long term.","And again, I also want to emphasize, we're not just talking marketing with some of these things. The technology, we think helps us and will help us in the future, et cetera.","So as Jason pointed out, this is a long-term kind of process. There are, of course \u2013 there's tactical marketing and strategic marketing, and we try and keep that balanced.","But this is not a response to anything other than what we think is in the best long-term interests of the company. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we're actually feeling pretty good about 2019 and the future. So I think we're a little bit surprised at so much of the questions on that topic.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","And I apologize for covering ground already covered, I've been jumping around between conference calls. So at the risk of doing it again, let me know if it's already...","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Harry, you don't have to apologize. The purpose here is to communicate as much as we can, and we welcome all opportunities to that.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Okay. Thank you very much. I did have one other quick question is relating to you guys calling out the strength in your onboard spend and the renovation-driven results there. To what degree has your fleet been renovated to the extent that you intended to, as it pertains to improving onboard spend? How much more is yet to go?","Michael W. Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Well, Harry, we recently announced significant upgrades and modernization programs both for Celebrity with Celebrity Revolution and Royal Caribbean International with Royal Amplified. For Royal Caribbean, we're literally taking all of our Voyager, Freedom class, and in fact, Oasis and Allure and putting them through significant upgrades, modernization, et cetera, which includes elements of adding features, attractions, venues that will further stimulate onboard spend.","So if \u2013 to answer the question in terms of a percentage, I don't think I could do that. I think our focus is always the balance between generating improved Net Promoter Scores and guest satisfaction, but combining that with improving revenue by taking every opportunity that we think is going to do that for us.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","And, Harry, your question actually gives me the opportunity to amplify a point that we've made before. The industry has proven its ability to respond to consumer needs. So some of the things that Michael is talking about that we're doing at Royal, that we're doing at Celebrity, that we're doing at Azamara are \u2013 and our other joint ventures are really responses to the way peoples' tastes have changed, their desires have changed, and it's paying off for us.","So I think this actually gives me a chance to reemphasize this point. We're evolving. We're evolving as an industry, and we're definitely evolving as brands within Royal Caribbean.","And that evolution, that upgrading of our product that we're offering, both in terms of the standard things you think about, the food, the entertainment, et cetera, but also the other kinds of memory-producing activities, experiential activities. We really think that's the kind of thing that has been driving and we think will continue to drive increased demand. And that's why we tend to focus on the demand side of the supply-demand balance.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","That does it for me. Thank you.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thanks, Harry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. I'll maybe look at a couple things here, or maybe, hopefully, a little different angle. But back in November at the Analyst Day, you talked about \u2013 Michael, you mentioned, I think especially with Symphony of the Seas, that you had virtually focused the marketing of that ship almost solely via social media.","So I guess, can you give us an update in general how your marketing is, percentage-wise, shifting to social media, whether that be with Edge, whether that be with Pursuit, whether that be with Symphony? And then also, your millennials, as a percent of your total guests now versus where it was a year ago, three years ago, any update there?","Michael W. Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Tim, if I gave you that information, my entire marketing team would be really unhappy with me. I would say that we have made a journey over the past couple of years from traditional to digital marketing, and it's been fairly significant and we continue that journey. We think that there is better targeting and it's a more efficient channel. And certainly, with our social media presence, we believe that we've maneuvered ourselves into a really strong position in our space.","And in fact, we just recently conducted an independent survey of where we are positioned in terms of the social media universe. And we came out of it exceptionally well in terms of how people view Royal Caribbean through that lens and how they're engaging with Royal Caribbean. We're also seeing that with the response from onboard Internet and how people are using the accelerated Internet to utilize social media to actually promote our brands, which has been really quite effective.","So it's a good channel. It's also a channel that is, obviously, preferred by the millennial and obviously new-to-cruise. So it's a great channel to activate that group. As it relates to new-to-cruise millennial, very much the strategy that we've started to reveal in terms of the modernization of Mariner of the Seas and putting that ship into the 3- and 4-day product, combining it with our significant investment into a Perfect Day CocoCay and the kind of experiences that we're creating with Perfect Day, when you combine Mariner, modernized with all of the new features that we're adding to that ship and how that ship will operate in that market, along with the Perfect Day CocoCay, we really think that's going to be an accelerated on-ramp for new-to-cruise and millennial.","And of course, marketing programs are pushing that heavily through social media. So I can't really give you numbers. All I can tell you is that we're aggressively moving in that direction and we are seeing very positive results from those actions.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Could we surmise that some of this increased spending or a majority of it is directed in that vein?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","I would say that the focus of that spending, again, is more longer term, as Richard noted. Certainly, some of those elements would be to further enhance our connectivity and marketing to segments like the millennials.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then two last ones here. Related to 2019, do you \u2013 or should we think about you're purposely \u2013 just as maybe as a little bit of a hedge and given the capacity coming, that you, the industry are putting on extending the booking curve a little bit to get that \u2013 build that base a little bit faster. And then on the Caribbean, in particular, how do you feel you're performing there given the product you have there this year relative to the industry?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Well, I can't comment on the industry as it relates to what others are doing relating to their booking curve. We are, and have been, proactively managing demand and using our sophisticated yield management tools and the consideration of the supply that's coming forward to continue to put ourselves in a posture for success. I do think that the product that, especially our Royal Caribbean International brand, is offering in the Caribbean because, obviously, it's a very large percentage of their capacity, is certainly leading in its offering and that's why we continue to see very strong demand. If you just look at the demand for Harmony and Symphony, and as Michael commented, on Mariner, just kind of core new products into the Caribbean, it's been quite exceptional.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, gentlemen. Congratulations.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Michael, I just want to follow up on something you said earlier in the call. I think I heard you say that in the last couple weeks, you've seen quite a bit of strength in Caribbean bookings. Can you just elaborate on that? Is that an acceleration from what you've been seeing? And is that Puerto Rican and Eastern Caribbean itinerary, is it specifically for Edge or Symphony or is it something else that's driving that?","Michael W. Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Yeah. Obviously, we manage against the track and we're constantly calibrating that track in terms of expectation of volume and rate and revenue, et cetera, by product and by brand. And obviously, we're constantly engaged with that performance track and a lot of our investment marketing decisions are based upon that performance. And this of course is interesting when you see things like the 1,000-point drop in the stock market at some point. I think it was a few months ago. You can see the curve drop a little bit as people concern themselves, obviously, at what's going on with the stock market and it soon returns.","But over the last couple of weeks, yeah, we've seen strength above our expectations for the past two weeks on all of our Caribbean products and we've also seen that in the Southern and Eastern Caribbean.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","That's interesting. It's very helpful. Thank you. And then I just want to revisit the close-in discounting and pricing integrity topic. I know that this has been an initiative. But as this winds down, I'm wondering if this could potentially explain why the close-in yields didn't surprise to the upside this quarter. So where do you stand with your price integrity initiative now? Is there still some discounting that's going on? Are there still certain markets where this is happening? We'd love to just hear an update.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","This wasn't an initiative that had a short timeframe. It was a program and we're continuing on it. We think it hurt us in the short term and helped us overall. It's hard to measure these things, but I personally think it's continuing to help us. In fact, I think I called it out in my comments. And we are continuing it.","We're continuing not to make exceptions. We continue to discount. I mean, I want to be clear, we've always discounted and that's a part of a normal process. What the program says is we won't add any new discounts in the last 30 days, and we're sticking to that. We think it's been successful. We think it will continue to be. And it's not that the initiative has run its course, it's that it's in place and it will continue to be in place.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then just one last quick one for me. How much of a tailwind to yields are you expecting when Celebrity Edge comes online?","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question on the yield side.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. The question is, how much of a tailwind to yields does Celebrity Edge add when it comes online? I guess maybe to ask it differently, what kind of a premium does Celebrity get to your system average and then what kind of a premium is Edge going to get to the Celebrity average?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah. Well, Celebrity is definitely higher than our average in terms of its yield performance. And Edge is \u2013 again, it's a brand new ship in a fleet that has not had a new ship in many, many years, so demand is exceptionally strong. So it is certainly higher than the Celebrity average by quite a bit. I would just keep in mind that really the benefits from Edge are really going to help us in 2019, as there's only a few sailings that will take place in 2018, mainly in the month of December.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, thank you.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","You got it. Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel from Cleveland Research. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for fitting me in here at the end. I just had a quick question on the guidance. So it sounds like fuel FX was a $0.10 headwind, but there is a $0.15 raise. So is it fair to say things are about $0.25 better on a core basis versus where you thought about the business 90 days ago? And then within that, it seems like other income and the JVs are performing better. Is that a significant part of the raise?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes. So thanks, Vince, and thank you for pointing that out. That's exactly right. If FX and fuel were what they were at the time of our January guidance, we wouldn't have raised by just $0.15. We would have risen by $0.25. Certainly, the JVs, both TUI and Pullmantur are doing quite well and they are definitely a part of the contribution. And effectively, those things are basically \u2013 we're kind of offsetting the increase in our costs that we updated here at the time of this call.","So, yes, they're basically offsetting that. And so that $0.25 raise is really relating to the Q1 beat. And then of course, the FX and fuel lowered that down by $0.10. So it would have been $0.25, but it's $0.15.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thanks.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","And then I don't know if it's been mentioned yet, but the SkySea joint venture, could you just talk a little bit about your thinking there. I think it was announced in March that that ends at the end of the year. What went into that decision?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah. I think that there was an opportunity. Obviously, we are a minority shareholder in that business and there was an opportunity to sell that ship to actually TUI AG. And it was just decided that we were going to move on from that venture. It actually will help us quite a bit in the forward years as TUI Cruises will hold on to Mein Schiff 2 for the coming years, which will further improve our profitability outlook for 2019 on.","Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Okay. You got it. Thank you for your assistance, James, with the call today. And we thank you all for your participation and interest in the company.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). I will now hand today\u2019s call over to Jason Liberty. Please go ahead.","Jason Liberty","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Celebrity Cruises; and Laura Hodges, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our Investor Web site www.rclinvestor.com. Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined. And a reconciliation of these items can be found on our Web site.","We are changing the format up a bit today instead of each of us providing commentary on the selected details within our operations, Richard is going to provide a slightly longer strategic overview explaining the Double-Double program and how we plan to get there, I will then follow-up with a recap of our second quarter results, provide an update on the business environment, and give our outlook for the third quarter and full year. We will then open up the call for your questions. Richard?","Richard Fain","Thanks, Jason and good morning everybody. As always, we appreciate the opportunity to provide more color on the earnings release and to talk about our progress. As Jason said, we are changing our usual format today to focus on our strategic opportunities and I would like to first start by providing a full description of what we are trying to accomplish with our Double-Double program and why we believe it\u2019s a right thing to do. As you know we have been dissatisfied with an unacceptably low level of ROIC and we have been working hard to bring our returns to more realistic levels. ","Fortunately, we believe we are now on the verge of some dramatic breakthroughs in this regard and this is time to push us over the top. To achieve a dramatic change in performance, it\u2019s important where possible to articulate clear and measurable goals. The Double-Double program is intended to do precisely that. Obviously these are aggressive goals especially since our starting point will be record earnings this year. And obviously there are more risks and uncertainties inherent in any such program. Nevertheless, we have been putting in place aggressive measures that we expect will enable us to achieve both of these two important goals.","There is always a danger in publicly announcing such an ambitious program but we feel that publicly disclosing these goals actually helps us drive the organizational initiatives that are still important to accomplishing them. It also provides what we hope is useful information to you our shareholders. As you know we have for sometime pointed to the underlying strength of our business model. It is enormously gratifying now to see that strength beginning to prove itself. The difficulties over the last few years really have obscured the very strong power of our business model and I am pleased that that business model power is reasserting itself.","Our Double-Double program rests on three key pillars, optimizing revenues; controlling costs and moderate growth. I would like to comment on each of these briefly. The real driver of our long-term success of course will be our success in delivering the revenue side of the equation and here I believe we have a lot of potential. Some of the reasons for this is structural and some of the reasons for this are specific actions that we are undertaking. Structurally, the difficult period we\u2019re just emerging from has had a double whammy on us.","Firstly there has been the general pressure on pricing. Secondarily, there has also been a compression of pricing as the general market environment improves, we are seeing a general rise in price and we are also benefiting disproportionately from the decompression effect as well. We see four particular areas of opportunity for significant revenue expansion. The first bucket of revenue opportunity is exploiting the strength of our brands. I think people all too often underestimate the incredible power of a strong brand. The strength of a brand\u2019s reputation and its market position go beyond purely quantitative differences.","Done properly, good brand positioning is important driver of revenue and profitability. Today, our brands enjoyed an extremely strong market position and our teams are obsessively focused on taking advantage of their growing relative popularity. For example, Royal Caribbean International continues to deliver the while and the introduction of Quantum of the Seas will take this step further. At the same time celebrity\u2019s simplification and intensification program is propelling its performance to new levels. We are seeing an upsurge in the popularity of the Celebrity brand and in our ability to attract the most profitable guests. ","And as Azamara is achieving double-digit yield improvement with its destination a Mercian and rising popularity. The second revenue bucket is the globalization of our brands, which helps us not only through diversification but also through better positioning. Our global footprint gives us a unique opportunity to take advantage of different markets at different times. For example in 2013, when we see U.S. market being particularly strong and Europe was suffering, we were able to shift sourcing by bringing more Americans to travel on our European itineraries.","In 2004, the relative economic position switched and we\u2019ve been able to use our global footprint to bring more Europeans to U.S. itineraries. The third bucket is the growth of Asia in general and China in particular. Our brand has established a terrific market position in China and the deployment of Quantum of the Seas is storing an enormous amount of excitement there.","The fourth and the final revenue bucket relates to Pullmantur. It\u2019s been a long time since I have referred to Pullmantur as providing upside potential. But today Pullmantur is on the cost of turning an important corner. We have now completed the sale of these non-core businesses and we\u2019ve increased our focus on Latin America. I am happy today to extend a welcome to Jorge Vilches who has recently taken over as CEO of Pullmantur. For a while now Pullmantur has been a significant sea anchor to our progress. Dragged down by a simply horrific Spanish economy.","Now while we don\u2019t expect a miraculous resurgence of the Spanish economy anytime soon, we do expect that merely alleviating that negative drag will help us significantly. Argo we have an opportunity to achieve significant top line growth driven especially in four areas of opportunity; the strength of our brands, exploiting our global footprint, enhancing our position in China and Asia and turning around Pullmantur. All of these factors present us with an unparalleled opportunity. The role of our Double-Double program is to make sure we take advantage of these opportunities.","Now while we\u2019re excited about the potentials on the revenue side, it remains crucial that the cost side of the equation remain under just as much focus. Our business is a broad and complex one and controlling costs requires a discipline throughout the organization. That culture of cost control has engrained itself nicely throughout our enterprise. Going forward to achieve our Double-Double objectives, it\u2019s important that we continue to maintain that strong focus on controlling costs commencement with our product delivery requirements.","The third pillar of our strategic trust is moderate growth. One of the drivers in improved results is the fact that we\u2019re growing capacity more slowly than we have in the past. We believe that this more moderate growth allows us to do a better job of maintaining the premium nature of our products and the premium nature of our pricing. That drives higher overall returns going forward. At the same time we cannot allow our product and our brands to stagnate. Sometime ago we set our course on moderate growth and we publicly annunciated an expectation of 3% to 5% average compound growth.","We believe the 3% to 5% continues to be an appropriate range for us and we do not expect to deviate from that level. Of course shift deliveries come in big lumps rather than gradual changes in the growth curve. As a result there will be significant difference in the figures for individual years, but over time the average has and should continue to be in that range.","As we said before we don\u2019t comment on the plans of our TUI Cruises joint venture. That operates separately and we\u2019re not including it in the above comments. One last topic I\u2019d like to comment on is the issue of seasonality and the timing of our earnings. We manage our business on a calendar year basis but we often find that shifts between quarters can cause confusion. It very much reminds me of the science class I took in high school. The teacher showed us a cup of water and pointed out how peaceful and calm the water was. However, when he put the water under the microscope we could see that beneath the surface there was a huge amount of activity going on. While the overall result was calm water looking at any one of the individual components was anything but predictable.","Similarly for us, our predictions for the overall figures have been surprisingly accurate within any given year. But we often see anomalies within that period. I think that it\u2019s remarkable that overall our revenue estimates have generally been within a percent or so of the actual. But I think everybody realizes that nobody can consistently be that precise. Rather the law of large numbers applies. But we often have significant variances in individual areas but these tend to offset one another.","Thus in the first quarter of this year we did worse than we expected. In this quarter, we\u2019ve done better. Within any individual quarter everything has an impact, even seemingly small things. Fortunately, they tend to average out over the year. And it\u2019s not only revenue that bounces around. Because many of our operating expenses are for large items changing the timing of something like repair work can easily shift expenses from one quarter to another. ","Lastly, I should point out that there is a seasonality factor, sometimes one quarter does better in revenues than another. Not surprisingly that may at first imply to a reader but there is a trend that will carry on into the next quarter. If this quarter is up or down, it makes sense that the next quarter will be up or down too. It seems logical but we often find that the cost for the variance is really due to particular markets, not to particular time periods. If Alaska does particularly well that helps the third quarter but don\u2019t help the fourth quarter because we don\u2019t go to Alaska much in the fourth quarter. This phenomenon makes it difficult to extrapolate subsequent quarters based on trends in the current quarter. ","Before handing the call back to Jason, I have to express our excitement over the recent delivery of TUI Cruises first new building, Mein Schiff 3. This 2,500 passenger ship is not only aesthetically a marvel but she is the first new building to be delivered with advanced emission purification technology. Together with an advanced haul and other energy saving technologies, the ship incorporates some of our best learning\u2019s for environmental friendliness. I would also like to comment on our excitement about the construction of Quantum of the Seas.","This ship will float out from the dock in a few week and it\u2019s exhilarating to see the innovations on-board come to life. With that it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call back to Jason for a closer review of the quarter\u2019s performance and forecast. Jason?","Jason Liberty ","","Thank you, Richard. I will begin by taking you through our results for the second quarter unless I state differently all metrics will be on a constant currency basis. We have summarized our second quarter results on slide 2. For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $0.66 per share which was $0.16 above the midpoint of our guidance. Net revenue yields were up 2.6 for the quarter which was 60 basis points better than a midpoint of our guidance. Better than expected pricing on close-in business for Europe and Asia, sailings drove this outperformance. As anticipated the environment in Caribbean has remained highly promotional and ticket revenue yields for the product were down year-over-year.","However, this was more than offset by continued strength on European and Asian itineraries where we had double-digit yield improvements for the quarter. On-board revenue initiatives continue to deliver positive results with a second quarter increase of 3%, making it the 10th consecutive quarter of our on-board revenue growth. Better load factor and a continued success of initiatives such as beverage packages as well as Internet services drove this positive increase. Net cruise cost excluding fuel decreased 4.7% for the quarter which was 220 basis points better than the midpoint of our guidance.","All of these savings are timely related and are expected to be spent during the balance of the year. So, below the line was favorable by $0.06 per share driven mainly by the continued success of equity investments like TUI Cruises and a portion of the change and value of our derivative entry. ","Now, I would like to update you on what you\u2019re seeing on the booking environment. Since our last call, booking volumes have been significantly higher during the same period in last year and the booking window continues to expand. Load factors and APDs for 2014 are ahead of same time last year for both remaining quarters.","While it is very early in the booking cycle, we are encouraged with the early patterns for 2015 with both load factors and APDs up versus same time last year. At the itinerary level, trends into our April call have not changed. We continue to see a highly promotional Caribbean environment counterbalanced by extremely strong demand for European and China sailing. Demand for the Caribbean itineraries which account for 46% of the full year and 28% of the third quarter, to remain highly price sensitive. We have taken advantage of recent reservation system enhancements which was offered different types of promotions which have resonated well with our debt.","These have also driven strong demand for these itineraries. Although, we are expecting yield decline on most seven nights Caribbean and short Caribbean itinerary, we continue to generate pricing premiums on Oasis class hardware and are seeing material year-over-year improvement in summer load factors on these ships. You will recall that we were 80% booked for European sailing at the time of our April call. Strong advanced sales left us with less supply to sail which in-turn is leading to quality closing demand in each of our core sourcing market. Guest bookings within three month of sailing are paying approximately 20% more than they did same time last year.","While it\u2019s not material, our five remaining Black Sea sailings have been stressed due to the unfortunate situation in the region but this has been more than offset by strength through the rest of the Mediterranean. We are pleased with how the summer season is shaping up and we continue to anticipate a double-digit yield improvement for the product this year. Looking forward, we still have a conservative outlook on the Caribbean; we remain bullish on Europe, Asia and Alaska sailings for the remainder of the year. ","As Richard discussed the Double-Double program provides us strategic platform to guide internal decision making and demonstrates our commitment to drive compelling returns to our investors. These long-term goals are conversions on our ongoing efforts to drive disruptive revenue growth while remaining focused on cost within an environment that has moderate capacity growth. Double-Double program will be a clear goal we strove towards over the coming years and ensure us proper focus on our core financial objectives.","Taking into account all we just told you, I would like to summarize our updated guidance for the full year and third quarter.","If you turn to Slide 3, you will see our updated guidance for the full year 2014. Net revenue yields and net cruise excluding fuel are expected to be consistent with our previous guidance with no revenue yields expected to increase between 2% and 3% and net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be flat to slightly down. As I previously stated continued strength and pricing for European and Asian sailings combined with strong onboard revenue expectations are driving this growth. Also 16 million and lower than expected costs realized in the second quarter are timing related and are expect to be spent during the balance of the year.","Our fuel cost for the year have decreased slightly since our April call to $949 million driven mainly by rates and we\u2019re 55% hedged for the remainder of 2014 at a price of $614 per metric tonnes. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to be between $3.40 and $3.50 for the full year.","Now I\u2019d like to walk you through our third quarter guidance on Slide 4. Net yields are expected to be up by approximately 4%, our deployment mix shift substantially in Q3, we have 44% of our capacity in Europe, 28% in the Caribbean, 10% in Alaska and 7% inside China. As a result the Caribbean pricing environment is less influential on our overall yield in Q3 and significant improvements in Europe and China as well as positive yield trends in our Alaska sailing are having more of an impact on our overall yield growth.","Net cruise cost excluding fuel are expected to be flat tough one, we have included $231 million of fuel expense for the quarter. Also we expect positive year-over-year impact below the line for the quarter driven mainly by the recent delivery of TUI Cruises Mein Schiff 3. Taking all of this into account we expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $2.20 for the quarter.","With that I will ask our operator Tamika to open up the call for questions and answers. Tamika.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","","Thank you for the multi-year benchmarks and the accountability that it implies. A couple of things here, Jason or Richard whoever wants to take this. Just maybe a little more color on what you\u2019re seeing early in \u201815 and as it relates to that I know again your global deployment is great and that\u2019s yielding fabulous benefits here. But the Caribbean, where do you see at this point a potential turning point for the industry and you guys are outperforming there. But where do you see that at this point?","Richard Fain","As it relates to 2015, it really is very early in the process, and the positive trends that\u2019s what I talked about really things that we\u2019re seeing across the products at this point in time. But I didn\u2019t give any more detail would not provide you better information that will be just communicated. As it relates to the Caribbean, I think, overall I think we\u2019re really kind of getting close to that inflection point. We\u2019re seeing a very consistent environment in there and it\u2019s been actually quite consistent to what we saw on our April call. So I think it\u2019s quite predictable at this point in time.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","And from an inflection point, are you thinking here with over the next by the end of the year. Is that fair for the industry from what you\u2019re implying?","Richard Fain","I think what I am implying, I think again going into, again it\u2019s very early on we\u2019re seeing a positive outlook on demand for the Caribbean going into \u201815.","Jason Liberty","I think Tim one comment we can make, one of the issues in the Caribbean has been the fact that has been so much capacity there. And we always over compensate for these things I am afraid. And that situation carries on through the first quarter of 2015. So I think just to gage it in terms of where the turning point would come. The first quarter is obviously going to be more difficult than the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter as we\u2019re looking ahead to next year.","But I think our process is that we look very much on a way bookings are coming in. And we\u2019re not sure that, we don\u2019t see enough bookings yet this early in the period to start being much more specific than we\u2019re being.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","And if I may one more question for Mr. Bayley. Michael again great progress in the brand. When you came into the position here and where we stand now. How would you characterize I guess the low hanging fruit that you saw coming in granted that your predecessor has done a lot of work before that. Where we started the job where did you see low hanging fruit from your perspective and where would say we are, if you want to say an inning to the ballgame so to speak?","Michael Bayley","","I think when I came into the position, I was fortunate in many ways because literally the brand was just about to take delivery of the fifth of the Solstice-class ships. And really so there have been a transformation in the brand as it relates to the hardware and so much of the energy and resources of the organization was so focused on taking delivery of all of these beautiful ships that I was in a position where, because we have finalized the delivery of the final ship that we could really focus our energy on delivering against the strategy that we created. So, I think it\u2019s a journey as you pointed out. We started that journey in late 2012 early 2013 and I feel we are probably about 30% of our way through that journey. We have got a lot more to get done and we have got fairly clear plans for the future, so that\u2019s kind of where we are.","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of Brian Dobson with Nomura. Brian your line is open. There is no response from that line. We will go to the next question. Your next question is from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.","Steve Wieczynski - Stifel","","Good morning guys. So, Richard I guess the first question is with basically your EPS goal now, have you kind of projected out the 2017 you are linking almost $7 a share in earnings and that basically implying 25% earnings growth basically for the next three years or so. So, I guess from a capital standpoint, you guys start to think about the way you are going to deploy capital to shareholders, I mean does a share repurchase program makes sense at this point?","Richard Fain","Well, I do think you are right, Steve, as you say we get to a point with this kind of profitability where the cash generation becomes a new problem to have. It\u2019s not a problem that we are that familiar with to be honest or to be blunt but it\u2019s a nice problem to have and I do think we are beginning to talk about that. And we have said in the past that over time we think returning cash to shareholders is an appropriate thing for us to be reviewing. We did double our dividend just under a year ago and so either higher dividends or cash repurchase seems to me as the success is coming through and the cash flows are coming through is very much of an issue that we should we discussing. It\u2019s very much of an issue that is the Board is discussing and does discuss and I think it\u2019s not necessarily appropriate for me to preempt them but you are right it\u2019s a new problem for us to have but it\u2019s a good one and we will be addressing it.","Steve Wieczynski - Stifel","Okay, got you and then second question, I don\u2019t know who wants to take this may be you Richard as well but broader question with China. And I know there is a lot of hype out there about the opportunity in China over the long term but how do you guys decide what\u2019s the appropriate type of investment to put in that market? And then may be help us think about where the investments will fall in that market as well?","Richard Fain","I will start and then Jason or Adam they want to chime-in. It\u2019s proven to be a very successful market for us but it\u2019s still young and we are still investing in two ways. First of all, the capital investment I think the move of Quantum was a pretty bold move now and looking back at it, it was a pretty obvious one but I feel these things are always obvious after the fact. I think that reflects our commitment to the market. It will of course, I think we mentioned this earlier that it requires some, not only capital investment with the ships that we have put in and very high growth rate that we have been having there and also requires an investment in infrastructure and in operating cost and that has challenged us this year and will be a challenge next year.","We look at the bottom-line impact and see it\u2019s very positive but there is some clear investment needed whenever you are developing any market but particularly one that is so fundamentally different than the other markets that we have penetrated","Jason Liberty","","Steve, I will add on a little bit. If I continue with the sports analogy that Tim used earlier, we are certainly pleased with its how gone so far. I would say it\u2019s something like we have scored a couple of runs in the first inning but there is a lot more innings play in that game. We have a tremendous work ahead of us to do in terms of developing the consumer awareness of our products and services. We have a significant undertaking in terms of developing the kind of distribution and loyalty of distribution that we have achieved in North American and European theaters. We have a program next year with four different ships, operating out of four different homeports in China that\u2019s something that we could not have envisioned even a few years ago really to reach the targets that we have will take a lot of work. But we\u2019re excited about it, definitely as the momentum and we feel like we created a leadership position for the Royal Caribbean international brand and we certainly want to see where can go with the momentum that we have.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","","I have a question regarding the Double-Double program. I was wondering can you talk about how management incentives might be aligned with achieving those goals.","Richard Fain","","Yes, I think that to accomplish something like this, sometimes it helps to -- we have to shift the mindset. We\u2019ve been working on this for a while here, I do want to emphasize that this is not something that\u2019s starting today, obviously this is something we\u2019ve been working on and you think you know that. But to make the kind of shift that you want, I think one of the things that Royal Caribbean has been so successful at is that to get the whole organization to move in a certain direction. And yes we\u2019re using our incentives to accomplish that and we have put in and expect to put in some special incentives to make sure that everybody is focused first on the beginning of that period but also although it hasn\u2019t been finalized it is likely that as we\u2019re looking at our longer term incentive programs like our performance space share things that we will be considering making the Double-Double targets which is a three year goal, the measuring stick for those.","So we think when an organization works everything has to work together and that includes the compensation, the incentive compensation. And I think we\u2019re seeing its working.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","","And Richard also you talked in the beginning of your prepared remarks about cost and you now have a cultured cost control. Just regarding cost expected to be flat slightly down this year. For next year would you expect to continue that kind of flat to slightly down trend particularly given the delivery of these two new ships. And I know you\u2019re not ready to give guidance but I guess what I am trying to figure out is there anything that you can foresee coming up that would cost net cruise costs excluding fuel to be up next year?","Jason Liberty","I think in terms of its early on for us as we\u2019re going through our planning cycle to be thinking about costs. But I think our general commitment to our cost culture really remains unchanged. But there will clearly be inflationary pressures, new investments as well as cost efficiencies that will be kind of considered in that equation. But I would just say our overall commitments sustain but those pressures are really now we\u2019re beginning to take into consideration.","Richard Fain","And I think I would Felicia emphasize as I did before that the focus is on getting the total profitability and so if we\u2019d love to keep having zero rose costs. I think we see that our real objective is the bottom line. And so for example coming back to the question Steve asked, the cost in China, if we\u2019re to include those costs and take us slightly over what we would like to be but it generates more in revenue than we would do that. So it\u2019s really question of the balance in our minds rather than a bring line on the page.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","","And then Jason you sounded in response to another question kind of get into the granularity about the Caribbean. But I think a lot of us on the call are just trying to figure out how that\u2019s looking right now in the third quarter. And so given we all know that the environment is promotional. So if you can give us any kind of color at all that would be helpful.","Jason Liberty","","I think in terms of just general color to start off with is that really is a very similar environment to what we were experiencing three months ago. I wish I could tell you that something had dramatically changed but it\u2019s been actually quite similar. But the volumes have been pretty steady; it\u2019s just that this required the promotional technique. The other color that I had said in my remarks is there is a little bit more pressure on the Caribbean and seven nights -- on the seven nights and on the shore Caribbean product. But that\u2019s generally kind of being balanced out. So it\u2019s a very similar picture.","Richard Fain","And I think in fairness we\u2019ve made it clear it actually got quite a bit worse between the first quarter and the second quarters. And I think we conveyed that in the second quarter call. As Jason says I think it\u2019s more or less stabilized since then. But actually that\u2019s partially because we brought to bear more yield management techniques and systems that we\u2019ve talked about before coming online. And that it helped us offset what otherwise might have been three quarters in the Caribbean.","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley - UBS ","","Great, thanks. Looking at your Double-Double program and your ambitious earnings target, I know you talked about some of the qualitative ways that you will get there and I totally understand that there will be different moving pieces contributing to it. But just too sort of think about it quantitatively because your capacity increases are pretty fixed right between now and 2017, so it has to be set in stone. And if we assume may be some load expense growth per unit given the investments you are making, is it kind of implying yield growth like compound annual yield growth north of 4%. Is that sort of in the ballpark of what you are thinking?","Jason Liberty","","So, I think that I would probably answer it that obviously there will be some add inflows in terms of how it plays out in each year but I think what we really look at is what our commitment on the cost side and then the others just look at how our yields have grown over the past five years. So, I think we really see moderate gross, I think 4% on average would be on the higher side on average but that\u2019s kind of how we kind of came to that basic math.","Robin Farley - UBS","Okay, so maybe there is actually expense reduction kind of per unit.","Richard Fain","I think Robin, we are really uncomfortable in trying to get too much into the details of this, I think we all have our models. As you say the capacity number is fixed, I think we are pressing on cost but I think if I heard your last comment correctly, I don\u2019t think we are thinking that there is going to be a dramatic improvement in cost. We just think that is a very strong underlying business model, particularly on the revenue side and when we extrapolate it out we think that it makes these targets doable. And we are determined to work towards that goal and make it happen. ","Robin Farley - UBS","Great, thanks and then just lastly you talked about how some of the factors affecting one quarter don\u2019t necessarily when you shift into the next quarter an itineraries change. So, I wonder if you could just give us a little color on Q4 but because there is now kind of an implied Q4 guidance since you have guidance through Q3 included guidance.","Richard Fain","That always makes us happy here because we implicitly end up giving two quarter rather than just one, Jason.","Robin Farley - UBS","And then so that still you are implying a pretty healthy guidance in Q4 and it\u2019s in line with our expectation but I just wanted to hear since you won\u2019t have as much European capacity, just hear a little bit about what\u2019s driving the growth in Q4?","Jason Liberty","","I think in terms of the general growth in Q4, it is relatively consistent for us in terms of having some upside happening from Europe and Asia because we do have some of those sailings come in and that we are dealing with a very similar environment, actually very similar booking environment for Q4 on the Caribbean side. But I don\u2019t think again there has been a big change on the guidance side. I think on the cost side, as we said some of the savings that we had identified in Q2 was actually realized in Q2 that will shift into the future quarters and Q3 and Q4 would be included in those comments.","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open. The next question is from the line of Robert Hagenbach (ph) with SunTrust.","Unidentified Analyst ","Thanks. This is Robert in for Patrick Scholes. So, you obviously put up some pretty strong guidance for net yields in the third quarter and we have actually been expecting that given us some strength we have seen in our own pricing work, that same pricing work really shows you guys are pretty big outlier to the industry, meaning seem to be outperforming your peers. May be you could give us just some incremental color in terms of why you think that is and how you expect to sustain that?","Richard Fain","I think I am not sure on how we can describe it in more detail. We focus on how our performance is going and the steps we are taking both on the marketing side, the yield management side and managing the demand. I know its little better than may be we were expecting before but basically the yield has just been holding up and I think we are very proud of the revenue management people who we have internally who predict these things and they have been remarkably accurate. Obviously some luck goes into that but also we spent a lot of time and money developing these systems. We have continued to invest in these systems; by the way I would refer you back to some commentary we made over the last couple of years that we\u2019ve invested a great deal in building these systems and building the capabilities. And I think that our people have tried to come up with good models and they have been remarkably accurate.","So we actually haven\u2019t ended up changing our yields forecast as we\u2019ve gone through the year and I would congratulate them in being able to do that. Obviously we can\u2019t always be this accurate but they have been pretty good and I think we will continue to invest in these systems, because we think they do help us.","Unidentified Analyst","And a quick follow up, forgive me if you mentioned this before. But I believe you recently launched a new pre-onboard planning tool. Could you give us any sense of what the usage of that has been and if you\u2019ve seen any visible uptick in spending from that?","Adam Goldstein","","It\u2019s too soon to associate the use of cruise planner with the onboard revenue outcomes, because that will be something that unfolds over these next few quarters. It was important to us, it is important to us that cruise planner tool will be used particularly by the people who have booked Quantum of the Seas for its first few months, and in fact the derivation of cruise planner was very much inspired by all the different features in many different Quantum and then applying that opportunity for the rest of the fleet. So for Quantum its run very well, we\u2019re very pleased with the usage of the cruise planner tool for that purpose.","While we\u2019re at it not that you ask, but we have a lot of upcoming developments that we think will be beneficial for onboard revenue on top of beverage packages which we\u2019ve mentioned and internet services which has already been very positive for us. But we\u2019re now just about two months away from having the O3b expanded Internet capabilities that we\u2019ve really been working hard on for a long time behind the scenes with this O3b Company that used satellite technology specifically for the purpose of beaming LAN speed bandwidth down to earth. And although they didn\u2019t think of cruise ships when they created that technology we end up being a perfect solution for it. And we will bring that out on Allure of the Seas this fall and then Quantum and Oasis and this will be a revolutionary breakthrough and the capability of cruise ships to receive significant bandwidth at great speeds. And we\u2019re very excited about that and how we\u2019ll be very interesting addition to our other onboard revenue capabilities which have been performing very well for actually all of our brands in recent past.","Unidentified Analyst","Since you mentioned on that new capability. Is the plan set to monetize that in any way marketing in other words competitive advantage in terms of ticket pricing that you charge is it in uptick or is it increase in pricing that you\u2019ll charge for Internet service or would you expect there to just be higher usage of that service?","Richard Fain","I think the Millennials are an enormous market for us and to be able to offer them home like coverage at sea is an enormous advantage and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve talked enough about it when we will have more bandwidth on one ship than every other ship in the industry combined. You are talking about something that we think will help us bring in more customers, raise our prices and this is the sort of thing that we\u2019ve been doing to try and raise our yields. And it\u2019s the kind of thing that underlies the Double-Double program.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of James Hardiman with Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","","Just a quick question here on the yield guidance and you may have touched on this maybe just quantify it for us. The midpoint of your second quarter guidance by 60 bps, you didn\u2019t really raise the full year at all. Is that just rounding and is it safe to assume we\u2019re at least further into that range for the yield guidance for the year?","Richard Fain","Yes that\u2019s exactly right James. It\u2019s rounding related, only slight negativity would take on the back half of the Black Sea sailing but as I said in my commentary that we\u2019ve been offset by further strength in Mediterranean.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","And then on the Double-Double program, since we\u2019re sort of thinking about three year outlook here. Can you give us at least ballpark sort of capacity growth assumptions over the next few years. And I guess bigger picture, how should we think about the dominator of the ROIC over the next three years, you talked about 3.5% CAGR. In general is that maybe a decent assumption for the invested capital piece between this year and 2017, I guess at least for next few years seems like a much bigger number than that at least in terms of capacity. How should we think about the puts and takes there?","Richard Fain","Yes I think James the best thing I can do Laura can certainly send it to you. But in the press release especially through 2017 it defines our capacity increases each year and it also provide our CapEx and really at this point especially through \u201817, there is very little, that anybody can do the change.","Jason Liberty","Yes, it\u2019s actually there through \u201818 as well.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","Got it, that\u2019s really helpful. And then I guess just last question in terms of Quantum of the Seas. May be talk a little bit about sort of the pricing you are seeing early on, what the occupancy assumptions are and I think you talked about in the past the costs are going to go up a little bit but may be sort of a Caribbean itinerary versus a Chinese itinerary for the same ship. Can you may be talk through some of the puts and takes and overall as I think about may be EBITDA and EBITDA margin, how do the two compare?","Richard Fain","Yes, so as it relates to just the latter half of that. On our last call basically we said that economically we expected this ship to perform at least as well in China as it was expected to do in New York post at moving on to China. And so I think economically that\u2019s the way I will look at it. It will probably require a little bit more cost but we are also expecting a little bit more on the revenue side especially with the strength on the on-board element within China. As it relates to bookings, also what we have constantly said is that for what\u2019s open to sail which effectively is the Northeast products which goes through the middle of May and also the repositioning of the ship from New York to Shanghai, the pricing and load factors on that are doing exceptionally well. And as you said in the past it\u2019s in line in terms of how it\u2019s booking relatively to when always this in the lower came out.","Operator","","Due to the allotted time for the question-and-answer session, we ask that you only ask one question. Your next question is from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs ","","Hi, I know the last person asked the question on ROIC the Double-Double goal, asked about could you do something on the denominator and I am not sure you answered that but I just would like to understand that a little bit better. I know Felicia and Robin both asked about reducing expenses, boosting revenues but what about the capital side of it and may be just think about that more broadly? And then just one final thing, Richard, how about new ships going out a little bit further, any sense for how you are going to think about that over the next five years or so?","Richard Fain","Sure, thanks Steve. So, first of all the denominator, I think the point we were trying to make is that the denominator is largely immutable at this point. There is very little that we would do that would change our capital base. As you know we have ships on order and our capital program we think we have given pretty good indications of what that is, so don\u2019t really see a dramatic change in that one way or the other that would have a huge impact on our calculation of ROIC. So, we do think that it will be the numerator, the profitability that will drive the change.","And we have previously said that we are not contemplating any ship orders for wholly-owned brands for 2017. And in terms of what we are looking at going forward, I think we have previously said that we thought the right range for us was to grow at a rate of 3% to 5% and as we are looking forward we think that\u2019s still the right number. I think as you know it gets difficult because of the ship deliveries in December one year or in January the next and enormous difference in and every ship delivery is a big lump in the curve of growth. But over any significant period of time we think that we will continue that average of 3% to 5%.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of [Indiscernible] Research.","Unidentified Analyst ","Good morning, congratulations on the great numbers. Jason, one question for you, on-board spend was nicely up, do you expect that to continue given the capacity deployments in Q3 and especially the change into Q4 from the European source market?","Jason Liberty","","Thank you, yes, so obviously this have marked our 10th quarter in a row of on-board revenue improvement and last year we were up over 7%. So, the comparability gets more and more difficult but I think that the focus we are putting on the on-board revenue line and also as sourcing, as we have more capacity for example in Asia next year, we do continue to expect a positive performance on the on-board. We haven\u2019t come out of any specific guidance on that obviously but expectations for us internally are to continue to improve ","Unidentified Analyst","And you mentioned beverage has done very well. And I imagine that in Asia retailers probably the driver. How about the shore excursions, spa, et cetera?","Richard Fain","In Asia specifically or just overall?","Unidentified Analyst","Just overall.","Richard Fain","No I think overall I mean really on all of our line items on onboard revenue, we have also kind of doubled our efforts on the shore excursion side as we try to create a more destination experience feeling across our brands.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup","","Just wanted to follow up on the European strike that you have been seeing in. Two part question, just first comparing locally sourced business versus the North American sourced. And then also have you seen any recent impact on demand just from kind of the latest geopolitical headlines that we\u2019re seeing on particularly from maybe U.S. and North American cruisers travelling abroad?","Richard Fain","So just a comment I think as it relates to some of these geopolitical. Our exposure this year really have a handful of sailings left that touched the Mediterranean region that\u2019s out risk and also on the Black Sea side. So we haven\u2019t seen a lot of changes in the demand pattern outside of -- well there has been change in sense, has been more challenging for us, bookings for the recent sailings and that\u2019s been incorporated into our guidance.","As it relates on to Europe, really the trends are actually quite positive on a local level on for both North American and European consumers whether they\u2019re travelling on European sailing or on the Caribbean. So it really is a good new story for both.","Well thank you for your assistance Tamika. With the call today -- and we thank you all for your participation and interest in the Company. Laura will be available for any follow up on question you might have and I wish you all a great day.","Operator","This concludes the Royal Caribbean Cruise Limited 2014 second quarter earnings conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jason Liberty, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Paula. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, President and Chief operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carol Cabezas, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides which have been posted on our Investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filing and other disclosures.","Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website. Unless I state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency adjusted basis.","Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview of the business. I will follow with a recap of our fourth quarter and full year results. I will then provide an update on the current booking environment, and will end with full-year and first quarter guidance for 2016. We will then open up the call for your questions. Richard?","Richard D. Fain - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. As you may have heard from Jason's voice, he has a cold this morning. So I'll use this opportunity to wish him a speedy recovery and ask him to sit on the other side of the room.","In any event, I'm pleased to have this opportunity to share more about our results in 2015 and our outlook as we enter 2016. I admit that it's very satisfying to look back on 2015 and I'd like to take just a moment to celebrate a successful year.","On the revenue side, we achieved our target of 3.5% yield improvement despite macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges that threatened to take us off course. I've said it before, and it still holds true, that while many factors may cause disturbances for short periods, our team has shown a very strong capability to make adjustments when circumstances change.","On the cost side, our team worked very hard to control this and we ended the year down 0.6%. We began the year expecting costs to be up 1% or less, but our finance organization and our operations team worked collaboratively to find further efficiencies and husband our working dollars.","Looking at the full picture, we anticipated doubling our 2013 earnings per share and we exceeded that target by $0.03 a share at $4.83. The brands are delivering and I congratulate all the employees in our company who worked so hard to make this happen.","It's equally gratifying to note that along with the financial success that we are enjoying, our surveys indicate that the highest levels of employee engagement in our company's history. Our annual survey had record participation levels and indicated higher satisfaction across all categories. We firmly believe that happy employees lead to happy guests, and that in turn leads to better yields.","This past year, we took a significant step forward on this front by establishing hospitality training schools like the one in Tianjin, China. This school teaches the art and the science of hospitality. That's an exciting challenge when most of the students have never themselves stayed in a hotel. The development of this school marks another important step in further deepening our roots with the local community in Mainland China, as it is a strategic partnership with the state-owned Tianjin Maritime College. In July, we opened a second training school in Lombok, Indonesia. And in May of 2016, we will open further a school in Pasay (05:00), Philippines. Not only will these schools provide a stream of over 5,000 high-quality employees each year, they provide these individuals the opportunity to join an international brand, traveling all over the world, and improving their community.","We also took a big step forward in our efforts to ensure the long-term health of the oceans by entering into a five-year global partnership with World Wildlife Fund. Our business depends on the health of the oceans, and we feel a responsibility to uphold the highest standards of environmental stewardship. Our partnership with WWF takes our efforts even further by setting specific and measurable targets for carbon emissions, sustainable seafood, and destination stewardship. We're serious about looking at our environment and our communities, and I'm very pleased to join with a partner equally passionate about these causes.","Turning to another topic, which we feel passionate about, Double-Double remains the lens through which we view all our decision-making at Royal Caribbean. Every employee can describe the program, double 2014 earnings per share and double-digit ROIC by 2017. As we look at our trajectory, 2015 paved the way nicely, and the results we were anticipating during 2016 will keep us solidly on our path towards Double-Double.","The two key components of Double-Double to achieving our goals are growing revenue yields and maintaining cost discipline. From a yields standpoint, our new buildings are attracting and maintaining strong pricing premiums. Quantum of the Seas in Shanghai is head-and-shoulders above the market, and the innovative amenities that distinguish Quantum are the exact same ones that will make Ovation of the Seas in Tianjin unique in that new market for her.","Finally, after five years, we're welcoming the third vessel in our Oasis class, Harmony of the Seas. We've seen the power of the Oasis class and the longevity of its popularity. Early indications are that Harmony will not disappoint either.","In addition to our new builds' outstanding performance, our existing fleet provides returns consistent with our needs for Double-Double. At the same time, we're continually learning ways to enhance onboard revenue and apply these learnings to the existing fleet to continue to grow revenue yields there as well.","From a cost standpoint, our commitment to cost control remains steadfast. It's an extraordinary coincidence that in both of the past two years, net cruise costs excluding fuel ended up down 0.6%. This cost control does not come easy, but we intend to continue to be disciplined, in line with our Double-Double targets, but also keeping firmly in mind the strategic needs of the company for the ensuing period.","While I'm pleased to look back on the success of 2015, I'm eager to move on to 2016 and the great things to come. Our metrics indicate that we are still on course for Double-Double targets. We remain in the solid book position, roughly equal to last year's record levels and at higher rates.","We're currently in the middle of our WAVE Period, as I think you all know, and we're happy to report this is proving to be a solid WAVE. As we have seen, geopolitical concerns can also threat the demand environment from time to time. These threats are generally limited to pockets of our portfolio and we, generally, manage through them. It is important to note that when demand in one area of the globe is weaker, many times there is an increase in demand for other destinations. Our intent is to maximize the overall portfolio, and we see that as one of the benefits of being a global player.","Although the current strength of the overall market is a key driver, we attribute part of our favorable book position to our price integrity policy. As a reminder, our price integrity policy is our determination to avoid the common prior practice of implementing dramatic last-minute discounts, which cheapen our brand and upset our loyal customers. The policy says that we will not implement any new discounts during the last weeks before sailing, with the time period varying by the length of the cruise.","We first started this policy about a year ago and we made a number of tweaks to it as we've perfected our formula. In December, we decided to make the policy even clearer and broader. It continues to apply in the U.S., Canada, the UK and Ireland. All together, by the way, those represent more than two-thirds of our revenue.","But we did decide that having different rules for different itinerary lengths was possibly confusing and definitely unnecessary. We have, therefore, expanded the policy to make the no new discount period consistently 30 days regardless of itinerary. The only exception continues to be three or four night sailings, which are traditionally late bookers. All of this makes the policy easier to understand and to implement.","We are a strong believer that clarity and specificity in a program like this is important because, otherwise, the exceptions undermine the integrity of the program even if they are in fact very rare. We now think we've got it right and we do not expect more changes in the near future. At this time we've had our policy in place for almost a year and we have a better view of the results. During this time, we have granted no exceptions to the policy since its adoption, and we have no intention of doing so now. Nevertheless, we've seen a double-digit percentage improvement in the booking window over this period and we believe that the policy helps solidify brand preference.","An unforeseen benefit we have found is the reduced number of bookings taken at a discount before we get to the focus period. Living the spirit of the policy has helped our revenue managers make better pricing decisions, and it has been roundly applauded by the travel agents that are so central to our success.","When we introduced the policy, we were transparent with you all that an upfront cost would result from some cabins going empty rather than being filled at deep last-minute discounts. We know that in 2016 we will still see some residual impact relating to these empty cabins. But by 2017, we feel comfortable that the impact will be positive.","One last point I would like to touch on before turning it back to Jason is our share repurchase program. As you will recall, we announced a repurchase program during our call last October. That full program totals $500 million. Of the total, $200 million was part of an accelerated repurchase program, which we have completed. We expect to continue to purchase opportunistically throughout the year 2016 until the full $500 million is completed.","With that, it's a pleasure to turn it back to Jason.","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Richard. I will begin by taking you through our results for the fourth quarter. We have summarized our fourth quarter results on slide two.","For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $0.94 per share, which was $0.04 above our guidance. Net revenue yields were up 4.9%, which was at the high end of our expectations. A combination of new hardware, a stronger Caribbean and a successful new winter season in China helped drive the robust year-over-year improvement. Costs were 70 basis points better than guidance for the quarter, with net cruise costs excluding fuel down 4.7%.","I will now discuss full year results, which we have summarized on slide three. This year, we had record earnings and exceeded the $1 billion mark. Adjusted net income was $1.07 billion, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $4.83. These record earnings also mark a second consecutive year of 40-plus-% growth in earnings.","Revenue yields increased 3.5% for the full year. Yield improvements in the Caribbean, Europe and China more than offset weakness in Latin America. Onboard revenue yield did not disappoint with a year-over-year improvement of 4%. The combination of new hardware, more onboard revenue venues on our upgraded ships and VOOM, the fastest Internet at sea, drove the majority of this improvement.","We delivered a second consecutive year of cost improvement on a per-unit basis with net cruise costs excluding fuel down 0.6%. These cost improvements occurred in non-guest facing areas, mainly through identifying further synergies amongst our brands and leveraging scale in our back-office.","Now, I'd like to update you on what we are seeing in the demand environment. I will start by taking you through first quarter trends. 63% of Q1 capacity is in the Caribbean, 23% is in the Asia Pacific region and approximately 11% is in Brazil and Latin America. The quarter as a whole is booked ahead of last year in both load factor and rate. Overall, we are seeing strong yield trends in Q1, driven by a significant year-over-year improvement in Caribbean pricing and the addition of the winter China season. The strength of these two products is more than offsetting ongoing pricing pressures in Latin America and Australia.","The WAVE Period is off to a good start, with bookings for Q2 through Q4 sailings trending similarly to last year's level. As we entered WAVE, we have significantly fewer staterooms left to sell on first quarter sailings than last year. So as expected, bookings for the first quarter have been lower than last year. For the full year, we are booked at a similar load factor to last year's record high and at a higher APD.","Capacity is increasing 6.3% year-over-year as we welcome Harmony of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas into the fleet this spring. The majority of our capacity growth is in the Asia Pacific region, with the balance mostly in the Caribbean.","Caribbean capacity will be up about 4% year-over-year as the product benefits from an upgrade in hardware. In addition to Anthem of the Seas in the Northeast, we will have at least two Oasis-class ships in the Caribbean in each quarter. We are also moderately increasing capacity in Europe, driven by a handful of sailings on Ovation of the Seas before she begins her journey to China. Once she arrives in China, Ovation will contribute to our 33% capacity growth in the Asia Pacific region.","On the other hand, we have significantly scaled back our capacity in Brazil and Latin America. While these products will account for approximately 11% of our capacity in the first quarter, they will be reduced to less than 2% for the remainder of the year.","We are seeing particular strength from the North American consumer, and our Caribbean and Alaska products are currently at record load factors. The Caribbean accounts for 43% of our 2016 capacity and is booked ahead of same time last year in both load factor and rate.","Our Caribbean product consists of a wide variety of itineraries, ranging from weekend getaways to 14-night Southern Caribbean sailings. In general, we are seeing better trends than last year across Caribbean itineraries with seven-night and shorter sailings showing the most strength. Overall, we are expecting mid-single digit yield growth for the Caribbean.","Alaska is booked nicely ahead of last year in both rate and volume despite a 6% year-over-year increase in capacity. We anticipate mid-single digit yield growth in what is expected to be a record-breaking year for the product.","Europe itineraries account for about 21% of our 2016 capacity. Although book load factors for their product is slightly lower than same time last year's record levels, recent trends have been quite strong and load factor remains nicely higher than at this point in all other previous years.","We did experience a softening in North American demand for a short period after the Paris attacks in November, and there was a minor drop in bookings from European-sourced markets. Demand quickly returned to typical levels, although pricing remains below same time last year for Eastern Mediterranean sailings.","Prices for like hardware for the rest of Europe are up slightly versus same time last year. Overall, we are expecting a low-single digit yield decline for our European itineraries, primarily driven by hardware changes and pricing pressure and itinerary modifications that relate to the Eastern Mediterranean.","Asia Pacific itineraries will account for 19% of our 2016 capacity, following significant growth in both Australia and China. Yields for the Asia Pacific product as a whole are expected to be up low-single digits, driven mainly by our increasing capacity in the high-yielding China market.","For the first time, we will offer a year-round China product, as Quantum of the Seas makes Shanghai her home for the full year. Her sister ship, Ovation of the Seas, will drive the remainder of our China capacity growth after she arrives in Tianjin at the end of June. Significant industry capacity growth, combined with the expansion of the season into off-peak periods and second-tier embarkation ports, has led us to forecast a low-single digit yield decline for China in 2016. Nevertheless, China is expected to remain one of our highest yielding itineraries and is contributing to the company's overall yield growth.","The pricing environment in Australia remains a bit of a challenge, given ongoing capacity growth in the region and the weakening of the Australian dollar. While Australia continues to deliver a strong seasonal yield, we expect yields in Australia to be flat to slightly down for the year.","Before getting into our 2016 guidance, I wanted to reiterate some of our previous comments we made during our last earnings call that relate to Pullmantur. As a result of our rightsizing efforts, we expect to incur restructuring and related costs in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 per share during 2016. Additionally, as previously discussed, we intend on eliminating Pullmantur's two-month accounting lag during the first quarter of 2016. This change will result in a 14-month reporting period for Pullmantur this year, with an estimated impact to our earnings per share by $0.10. For simplification and comparative purposes, we will be excluding all of these one-time adjustments from our key statistics. Hence, our GAAP earnings in 2016 will be slightly lower for these adjustments.","Taking all this into account, if you turn to slide four, you will see our guidance for 2016. This will be the second full year on our path towards Double-Double and our results remain on track. Net yields are expected to be up for the seventh consecutive year, with yield increasing 2% to 4%. Strong trends from North American products, additional capacity in the Asia Pacific region, and another year of strong onboard revenue are expected to drive this improvement.","On the onboard side, new hardware and upgrades to our existing ships, a greater mix of capacity in Asia, and further expansion of VOOM is expected to deliver another step change in shipboard revenue yield.","Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be up 1% or less for the full year. While the full year demonstrates our cost discipline, the cadence of expenses through the year is not linear. For example, our drydocks in 2016 are concentrated in the first quarter and fourth quarter. In addition, you will recall that in the second quarter of last year we made investments in the China market to support Quantum of the Seas. This year, these investments are being made slightly earlier to support our year-round China presence, Ovation of the Seas' arrival, and to grow our Asian market footprint. This is resulting in a shift in spend into the first quarter.","We anticipate fuel expense of $716 million for the year and we are 66% hedged. Over the past several months, fuel prices have significantly weakened, while the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen versus our basket of currencies. The combination of these two factors has resulted in a $0.14 per share headwind to 2016 (00:23:19) earnings. Additionally, the recent rise in interest rates has impacted our 2016 earnings by $0.06 per share.","Based on current fuel prices, currency exchange rates and interest rates, we expect another record-breaking year with earnings per share between $5.90 and $6.10 per share. The midpoint of this guidance represents a year-over-year increase of 24%, which comes on the heels of more than 40% growth delivered in each of the past two years.","Now, I would like to walk you through our first quarter guidance on slide five. Net yields are expected to be up approximately 4% for the first quarter, driven by a strong Caribbean and the continuation of the winter season for Quantum in China. Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be up in the range of 4.5% to 5% driven by a combination of factors. We are setting the groundwork for two new ship entries later this year, while also maximizing the momentum of new marketing campaigns for our two largest brands during WAVE. Additionally, we will be investing earlier this year in Asia as we look to continue to expand our leadership position in the market and diversify our channel mix.","As I mentioned earlier, much of this spend has been concentrated in the first quarter due to timing. Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be approximately $0.30.","With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Your first question comes from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, everyone. A couple of questions here. One, could you give us a little bit more color on the bookings and pricing, specifically the cadence over the last 120 days, say, from Canada and China? And then anything on that related to the Zika virus, have you seen that show up in any way in the recent bookings over the last couple of weeks? And then finally, could you just review the no discounting policy? Richard, you mentioned that that was streamlined to nothing within 30 days. Was it tiered before? Was there like a 10-day, 30-day, 60-day, if you could just review what it was and to now streamlined into the 30 days? Thank you.","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Tim. So as it relates to bookings over the past 120 days, they basically have had a similar cadence to last year. Now, obviously, markets like China that are later in the booking cycle can influence that. So if you look at what the cadence has been for North America and Europe, it's been slightly higher versus same time last year. So our book position would be slightly better if you were to account for the mix shift change in China. As it relates to Canada, there's nothing I would say that's specific that we've seen that is different from those trends. And again, as it relates to China, it's coming in as we would expect it to.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And pricing, Jason, on those bookings, similar, holding in there pretty well or any things you noticed are higher?","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Well, on the Canada side, I would just take our commentary as it relates to the Caribbean. We are in a very good book position. We are in a very good price position as it relates to the North American consumer. In China, obviously, we're guiding for our yields to be slightly down. A lot of that again is driven by us further expanding into the other seasons and also expanding into secondary markets and ports.","Michael W. Bayley - President & Chief Executive Officer, Royal Caribbean International","Hi, Tim. It's Michael. With regards to the question on Zika, to date we've really seen no impact whatsoever. It's been really immaterial. I mean, obviously, it's all over the media and we see it. But to date, we haven't had any material impact.","Richard D. Fain - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And Tim, on the question of the discounting policy, the previous policy had, depending on the length of the cruise, we had different periods. So in some cases, we said there'd be no discounting within the last 10 days, in some last 20, some last 30 and some the last 40. And people weren't sure which applied to which and we thought it was easier both from the public's point of view, but also a key driver of this is from our own revenue managers' point of view. And so it's important that we have a clear policy that everybody understood and could follow. And we decided to expand it to 30 days across the board except for the three nights and four nights.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, very helpful. And one more clarification there on the cadence over the last 120 days. Just on the pricing, the cadence, given your booked position in that, have you seen that pricing in China in particular, trends in the last 120 days, has that improved, remained stable? There's just been some mixed messages, I think, out there in the market a little bit.","Michael W. Bayley - President & Chief Executive Officer, Royal Caribbean International","Yeah. Hi, Tim, it's Michael. Yeah, I think China 2016 is a different kind of configuration from China 2015 because, as Jason had mentioned, we've got a deeper push into the secondary ports with one of our ships with broader seasons and we've got more capacity in Q1 and Q4. So it's a different kind of configuration. And our inventory is being released in a slightly different way in 2016 than 2015. I think as Jason had mentioned, we're feeling that our bookings are coming in as expected.","Richard D. Fain - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Tim, let me just add one thing, I know you know this, but for some of the others. When we talk about the broader season, Quantum of the Seas was unusual in, for the first time we were doing year-round in China. Previously, we've only been there seasonally. So what we've decided was it was a year-round opportunity. And while we don't get as much in the winter in China as we get in the summer in China like any other market, we do well in the winter. But when you average it in, it brings down the average. But as it relates to overall, China actually is helping us in our improvement in 2016.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Gentlemen, thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I did have a question on China, so while we're on that topic, let's stick there. So we have strong demands, we have a little bit of a different cadence this year because you're in the first quarter and fourth quarter, which is seasonally priced. You're also in \u2013 have a different mix, which you just mentioned, but overall, demand is strong and you guys said that yields are up low-single digits driven by China, so that's all good.","What I was hoping you could clarify is that we get a lot of questions just about the charter companies, the charter agents and the status there. I think the view is that some of the charter agents are losing money on the China cruises in general. I was just wondering whether or not that's actually true. And if there are issues, what is Royal Caribbean doing, if anything, to fix that? And then, also, I'm just wondering if you're seeing any differences in how different Chinese brands are performing there versus your brand. In other words, how are you differentiated? You did mention that you guys performed better than everyone else in the market? Thanks.","Michael W. Bayley - President & Chief Executive Officer, Royal Caribbean International","Hi, Felicia. Just to correct one point, yields are slightly down in China this year 2016 versus 2015 based upon all of the different elements that we just talked about.","With regards to charter companies, it's quite a mix in relation to our total distribution. But over time, obviously, we've been changing the mix of our distribution and we continue that journey. So literally every single year we're doubling the number of agents who are selling Royal Caribbean in the China market. And of course, we're broadening our regional footprint especially now with the introduction of Ovation in Tianjin.","So it's true that some of the charter companies really out of Shanghai had some challenges in 2015 in relation to MERS in Korea and, of course, the typhoon season which was particularly difficult. And so some of the charters did experience some losses during some of the sailings. But having said that, they did particularly well the rest of the year with Royal Caribbean and have done well with Royal Caribbean over the past nine years that we've been in the market. So there was a bit of a hiccup. And of course we, as we are in the United States, we're long-term partners with our travel partners. So we've worked hard at finding some workarounds with them in terms of our 2016 inventory and how we've worked with them in terms of our cooperative marketing and this type of thing. So we feel that we've been very responsive to some of the feedback that we've had from some of these charters, and we think we're in a fairly good position for 2016.","With regards to the differentiation of the brands, that's I think a highly relevant question. When you look at Royal Caribbean against the competition, we have been in the market now for nine years and we've been investing over a nine-year period in the market. We have the newest hardware in the key ports. Quantum of the Seas genuinely has been a huge hit out of Shanghai. Ovation coming in to Tianjin is doing very well. We have eight consecutive years of being the top cruise line in China awarded by the Travel Trade Gazette and the Travel Weekly. We have been focused on launching consumer campaigns and, in fact, we're launching a new campaign literally in the coming weeks. We've been working on expanding our distribution footprint. And of course, we are the largest single cruise brand in China with a really professional and competent sales organization and marketing team who really have been with us for quite some time.","So I think the spread between Royal Caribbean International and the competing brands in the market is quite significant. And a lot of that is driven by the hardware. Quantum and Ovation are world-class leading hardware and they're the only brand new ships in the China market.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you for that and you did not deserve the demotion that Jason gave you earlier in the call.","Michael W. Bayley - President & Chief Executive Officer, Royal Caribbean International","I'll be speaking to him shortly.","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","And of course, I did correct myself immediately.","Michael W. Bayley - President & Chief Executive Officer, Royal Caribbean International","A little too late.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","You did.","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","A little too late, yeah, yeah.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Jason, thank you for the cadence of the costs in the quarter. That was one of my questions. But to add on to that, if you look at how your costs trended in 2015 versus your original guidance for the full year, they came in better than expected, or lower than expected. So I was wondering what drove that? And do you think you can achieve a similar result in 2016?","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think that there's \u2013 the first thing I want to start off as it relates to 2015 is this is really a corporate enterprise-wide effort on trying to identify cost improvements. And so as I've said in the past, it's not one thing, it's thousands of little things that we do. The leadership, for example, Adam has given around supply chain and that team, the consolidation of our marine organization, and finding more efficiencies in our back-office is really what we just do day-to-day when we use the lens of Double-Double. And so that is ongoing and continuing.","There are a lot of headwinds in costs in 2016. Obviously, as we expand our mix into Asia, the cost of operating there is higher. There are some more upfront costs on the sales and marketing side as we're delivering two new ships this year. And also having VOOM, the fastest Internet bandwidth at sea also has a high cost to it.","So there are a lot of headwinds, but our efforts to try to continue to identify opportunities is never ending. But I think we think the 1% or less guidance is really our best view based off of all our plans that we have to-date to manage cost effectively in 2016.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Richard D. Fain - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Felicia, I'll just add something. I do think that Jason's focus on this is very helpful, but all of our leaders here, Adam, Lisa, Michael, the others are really very focused on it. I'd also just maybe take the opportunity to talk a little bit about the timing of it during the year. You know I've said this in previous calls; we manage on an annual basis. And one thing that's a little unique about our business that, I think, distinguishes us from many others is that we have some significant big costs that we can shift around in terms of timing. So we would look at a booking pattern to say whether we ought to drydock a ship in March or April or September or October or what have you. And when we make those decisions, we simply don't pay attention internally to whether that falls in this quarter or that quarter. But those kinds of, what we think of as, immaterial tweaking to get the best outcome, particularly as it relates, for example, if I take a drydocking, we might find that for whatever reason we were just booking better at the end of September than early October, and we would just decide to shift the drydock from one quarter into another.","From an operating point of view, they're immaterial. And those kinds of changes can actually help us in bringing our overall cost number down. But I fully recognize that, as it relates to individual quarters, they will distort the numbers. And unfortunately, that's simply a fact of life, and we think our best strategy is to continue to focus on the year. We want to \u2013 if it's cheaper for us to do it in March than April, we'll do it in March rather than April, and the Double-Double.","And the Double-Double has really been very helpful. You talked about our cost containment over the last number of years now. The Double-Double is actually a very helpful concept that everybody can focus on and move towards that common goal. So I think that's why we've had the results that we've had. But I do acknowledge it does relate to bumps in any given quarter or period.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for that color. Jason, for some glitch reason, I can't see the slides. So if this is on the slides, I just was wondering if you could walk us through the bucket of currencies. What are the weightings for the second quarter and the full year?","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","We will have, in our filing, that breakdown. But I know for the full year, our two largest exposures will be in the pound, in the yuan, then Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, and then the euro. That will be the cadence for the year. And then, obviously, there are some changes and they're based off of the sourcing or the deployment during the course of the year.","So for example, there is more exposure to the Southern Hemisphere markets like Brazil and Australia in the wintertime, and in the summertime you're more exposed to Europe. So you have more pound, euro as well as yuan because it's more of a peak period for the Chinese consumer.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks. Are you going to give the weightings or just the order?","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","I'm just going to give you the order.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great, thanks.","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Wieczynski of Stifel.","Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. So going back to China real quick, I have a two-part question. I guess first, and Jason, you've said this before I guess, when you say yields will be down in 2016, can you break that yield factor down for us? Meaning how much is ticket price versus onboard? And what I'm trying to get is, is that onboard spend holding up?","And then second, Jason, you've always talked about the profitability on a per-customer basis in China and how much stronger that is versus other markets. Is that profitability on a customer basis still holding up despite the ticket prices coming back in?","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Steve. So as it relates to our yields being slightly down in 2016, the weighting is more concentrated on the mix of these secondary markets and the seasonality. And then there is some pressure, as Michael talked about, on just general ticket. And obviously, when you have ships like Ovation come in, that also helps balance out some of the pressures we have on some of our older assets that are in that market, really non-Quantum-class assets.","The mix between ticket and onboard is actually pretty similar. It would index a little bit higher on the onboard side because you have Quantum coming into the market.","Now, the point on profitability of the Chinese guest, it is still very much there. China is one of our highest yielding markets. The product is one of our highest yielding products. It is a little bit more expensive to operate, but also we get higher yields for those products. So it is very much contributing to our yields and it's very much contributing to our profits and our margins and our business, which is why our outlook continues to be very favorable for the Chinese market.","Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, got you. And then second question on your buyback. I know you have $300 million left at this point. I mean, the stock is obviously under some decent pressure here today. And it's basically, if you look at your $7 suggested EPS number for next year, you're trading at, basically, sub 10 times earnings at this point. So I guess my question is probably for Richard. I mean, that $300 million is only call it 2% of your shares outstanding. How receptive will the board be when you go back to them and say, hey, we potentially need more than the $500 million that was originally out there?","Richard D. Fain - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we made the decision certainly without seeing or expecting this kind of a reaction here. And as I said, I think the board and the management felt very good about the trajectory we're on. And nothing has changed in our view as to what our actual \u2013 the word that I keep hearing used is cadence, but I would say the pattern of our earnings growth over the next couple of years. So our view on the business is very constant.","I think I'm always a little cautious to speak on behalf of the board on something like this because this is the sort of thing that everybody looks at. But we did see that it was appropriate to do a share buyback. We also will temper our enthusiasm as it relates to the shares because it is our intention to become an investment-grade company, and I think we would take that as a consideration factor as well.","So I certainly don't think there's been any negative change in their general view, but I don't think the board would tend to be knee-jerk on particularly a short-term change in the share price.","Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harry Curtis of Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Just on that last point, the short-term reactions to the stock prices do provide the board an opportunity to get more aggressive. Can you give us a sense of, if you do hit your earnings targets, your EBITDA targets, what your leverage ratio is going to be at the end of the year? And how much room does that give you to perhaps use your balance sheet a bit more aggressively, because this share price at 10 times earnings, those are typically really, really good opportunities to invest in your stock?","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So Harry, I'll just comment on kind of where we see ourselves on a ratio perspective and then I'll let Richard comment on more in terms of how we interact on the board side.","Richard D. Fain - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's really kind of you, Jason.","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","My pleasure, my pleasure. But I think we see ourselves based off of the guidance that we've been given that we'll be at or slightly below our targets by the end of 2016. Now, the timing of when the rating agencies decide to provide us that rating is not only subject to the metric, but also subject to how we as a corporation are behaving and are we behaving like an investment-grade credit. So as Richard said, as we look at do we do more or less, a lot of that comes into keeping the balance of our growth, the balance of returning capital to shareholders and also becoming an investment-grade credit. And those will be key things that are always evaluated when we determine how much we will buy back or how much the program will be that we announce.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","I guess (00:47:47). Go ahead.","Richard D. Fain - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead, Harry.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Well, where I'm going with this is that there's the leverage ratio, there is also the interest coverage ratio which is probably by the end of this year going to be somewhere 8.5 times and 9 times given the low cost of your debt. And so I just want to point out that there are opportunities for companies to be really opportunistic. And it would seem that if you can do $7 a share next year that this is one of those opportunities.","Richard D. Fain - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And I think as you've made clear in sort of this back and forth, there are a lot of things that go into that equation. I'm going to be very cautious not to preempt the board on something that a board rightfully focuses on carefully. But I think those are the things. It's the opportunity when there is what appears to be a downturn in the share price. On the other hand, there is the need to make sure that we have the appropriate capital for our new building program. And this is, of course, a capital-intensive business. And we also do want to get to investment grade.","So the board will have to balance those things. But obviously what's happening in the market will be something that we will be looking at very closely.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. I'll get off the soapbox and ask an operating question then. Going back to China, Jason, if you look at your pricing like-for-like, your pricing in China is being dragged down just by the timing of the introduction of your ships. Is it fair or is it relevant to try and look at pricing on a like period for like period, particularly for example with the Quantum?","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","First off, we really try to have a general conversation about the region versus the market itself. And the reason for that is because China has to work with also the winter season, which means Australia and Southeast Asia need to work. So it is and it continues to contribute to the overall yield of the region.","Quantum continues to perform as we expected and perform well. There has been a little bit of like-for-like pressure on the older tonnage that we have up in that marketplace. But the Quantum-class ships continue to demand a premium to the relative pricing that's in the marketplace.","I also think it's important to point out \u2013 I know there's been a lot of concern about what's happening in the China marketplace with the consumer. And I think the patterns that we're seeing with the Chinese consumer continue to show that they have a strong sentiment and a very strong desire for cruise. And a lot of the pressure on pricing just has to do with a lot of capacity coming in, more seasonality in terms of the China offering, and us going into other markets, which we've talked about before.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","And then my last question just has to do with, suppose the value of the renminbi continues to slide, would that, in your experience, lead to perhaps increased demand for cruises considering that you price your cruises in renminbi?","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think that certainly we can get into an economic conversation. I think it could obviously create more demand for some of their exported products and that could potentially improve their wallet in which they could spend more on the cruise side. Again, I think the sentiment in China is quite good. And I think that their demand, especially for our products, have continued to march at the cadence that we had expected.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. That does it for me. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Rollo of Morgan Stanley.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc","Yes. Thank you. A couple of questions please. First, sticking with China, roughly what was the average revenue yield premium you generated last year versus the rest of the group? And then the other question, looking at your customer deposits of $1.7 billion at the end of the year, they were actually slightly lower than a year ago, and yet you're book position is similar, you've got higher prices, you've got more capacity. I was wondering whether that's a currency impact or was that (00:52:57) if that's China or something else is causing that. Thank you.","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Jamie. On the China premium side, it's not something that we talk publicly about in terms of the specific number. Obviously, we're happy with the margins and the yields we get in that market as we add more capacity in. So you could follow where the investment is going.","And then on the deposit side, it's a combination of a few things. Some of that is currency related. Some of that also, as we expand our mix into China, the cadence of deposits are much closer or their payment is much closer to the time of the sailing, because it's a late booking market than it is for other markets, so that skews it a little bit.","And also, there's different promotional activity we do where you might put a little bit less of a deposit down and that's really what kind of drives that differential in the customer deposit line on the balance sheet.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc","Just on the yield premium, on the older three ships you've got there, are those considered a premium to the rest of the group even after the pricing pressure, or is it all Quantum driving that?","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","No. In terms of the premium it gets, especially relative to its class and to the average, it's a very nice premium. And also, those ships have lower asset bases, so the margins we get on them are quite good.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc","And just on the TUI JV income, looks like it was down year-on-year in Q4. I know there were other items in that bucket, but what did that line do, please?","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","No. There are many other items in that bucket. There are other equity pick-ups. The TUI JV actually did exactly what we expected it to do. It was up quite a bit year-over-year. Also in that line item is our other joint venture, which is really in its first year, which is SkySea which had some losses mainly just due to it being its first year of operation.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc","Thank you very much.","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs.","Steven Eric Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?","Richard D. Fain - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Steve.","Steven Eric Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sorry. Just was wondering who you compare yourself to, because to only have your net cruise cost ex-fuel up 0.5% relative to really any other industry or really any other stock we have under coverage seems pretty good, and it's actually slightly below CCL's cost guidance. So on these cost headwinds \u2013 seem \u2013 I mean, you've spent a lot of time on them. I just want to understand whether there's a reason for that and why there's so much focus on it.","And then separately, is your compensation linked to achieving those cost guidance forecasts? And then one other thing; for FX, the spread between your 2016 constant net yield and current net yield guidance of 200 basis points was bigger than what we were expecting. Can you just give us a little bit more color on that FX breakdown?","Richard D. Fain - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Steven, thank you for those comments. Thank you particularly for the first comment. Yes, we think the cost performance has been excellent for a number of years now and we're quite proud of the work. And I think the fact that it comes \u2013 then at the same time that our level of guest satisfaction goes up is an important feature for us because I think it's actually relatively easy to cut costs if you don't care about the product that you deliver to your guest. But we have been raising guest satisfaction while we've been cutting cost. And as you say, this level of cost discipline is actually quite good.","There are a couple of things. One we'll take credit for, which is that I think the management has done a really very good job of looking for new ways of doing things, new efficiencies, et cetera. The other is, and we did telegraph this when we were doing it, which is that we spent money which we thought would result in savings later on. And we talked about some of those things. We talked about the IT spending. We talked about some of the other stuff that we were doing. And so I think that also helps us a little bit by comparison.","But we're not resting on our laurels on that. We think there is more to be done, continual efficiencies, because even the guidance we've given which now is for 2016 up marginally, obviously the inflation in the areas that we're looking at is higher than that.","The answer to your second question was the compensation, yes, our compensation is \u2013 all the management team's compensation has in it a number of factors, one of which is specifically net cruise costs excluding fuel. But on the other hand, another one of which is net revenue yield. Another one is safety and environment. So we're trying to make sure that we're meeting our cost goals, our revenue goals, but also not doing things that put us at risk. This is a long-term business and we've worked hard to put Royal Caribbean in a position where it is solid on, if you will, the triple bottom line as well as just the earnings per share. I'm going to let Jason handle the last of those questions.","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Steve. So obviously, the headwinds of currency have continued, especially our hedge position on fuel outpace the benefits we've been receiving from our fuel. You just look at it year-over-year, our basket of currencies is down 10% year-over-year, and that's really what's driving that differential between the as-reported and the constant currency. And some of the currencies, for example, the yuan, which had very little volatility, has become more volatile more recently as it's been unhitched from the U.S. dollar.","Steven Eric Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just quickly, what share count is captured in your EPS guidance? Does it include the $500 million repurchase program?","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","It includes the $500 million repurchase program, but the cadence of when that happens has it generally spread throughout the year.","Steven Eric Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. Your final question comes from Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Two questions, actually. One is on China. You have talked about being likely to maybe add more ships there. You don't have anything announced for 2017 or after that. And I'm just wondering what your kind of most recent thoughts on that are versus where they were sort of two months or three months ago. And then outside of China, your commentary in the release talks about volume being at kind of \u2013 or load being at the same level as last year but price higher. And in October, both load and price were up. And obviously, your volume can only be up at the end of the day as much as your supply is up. So I guess I'm wondering if the lower volume now versus October just kind of relative to your book position in the prior year, is that pretty much in line with your expectations that because you're raising price that you've been expecting volume to slow between October and now? Thanks.","Michael W. Bayley - President & Chief Executive Officer, Royal Caribbean International","Hi, Robin, it's Michael. Just to answer your first question on China and more ships, obviously we don't make any announcements on new ships until we make the announcements. And we're aware of announcements that have been made already for 2017. So when we're ready, we'll announce. But I think, overall, we continue to be very positive about the opportunity in China. It's the beginning of something that we think is really, really positive. So our intention is to continue to invest and grow that market.","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And, Robin, on the volume and price side, as you said, on the October call we said we were booked ahead on both rate and volume. Outside of the little hiccups we saw, as it relates to the Paris attacks and some of the geopolitical events which quickly bounced back, it has been very much in line with our expectations. And as we have a greater mix of our capacity going into China, that does skew the year-over-year comparables because it is a much closer-in booking environment. But I would describe it overall as that it's in line with our expectations.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right, great. Thank you.","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Great.","Jason T. Liberty - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you for your assistance, Paula, with the call today. And we thank all of you for your participation and interest in the company. Carol will be available for any follow-ups you might have. And I really do wish you all a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Brian Rice.","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, Keihlo, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank each of you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. Joining us from London is Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and here in Miami with me are Adam Goldstein, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; Dan Hanrahan, President and CEO of Celebrity Cruises; and Ian Bailey, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which we have posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com. Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide.","During this call, we will be making comments that are forward looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Additionally, we will be discussing certain financial measures, which are non-GAAP as defined, and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.","Richard will start with his comments. I will follow with a brief recap of our results, give an update on the booking environment and our guidance. Adam and Dan will follow with insights from their brands, and then we will open the call for your questions.","Richard?","Richard D. Fain","Thanks, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. As you can tell from my comments in the press release, as well as our cautious messaging back in February, there really was a great deal of hesitancy on our part in providing earnings guidance so shortly after such an unprecedented industry event. But we did recognize the value of being transparent with the financial community, and we wanted to communicate as much information as we could even in the face of that uncertainty.","So far, we're actually tracking very nicely to the kind of ranges that we provided in early February. And as expected, we've continued to experience a slow but steady recovery in our booking patterns. Of course, I'd like it to be even faster, but the pattern that has emerged so far validates our earlier guidance. Essentially, as we reported this morning, our outlook for the year hasn't changed very much. The only significant variation in our earnings outlook for the year is fuel. That's very encouraging, but it is early days. ","The market is still highly volatile, it\u2019s highly uncertain and our guidance reflects a higher-than-typical degree of uncertainty. Even so, we've seen enough positive direction to justify narrowing our yield range by shaving a percentage point off the bottom-case scenario.","The pattern of the tragedy's impact is also informative and really quite logical. The closer one is to the location of the incident and the closer one is to the time of the incident, the greater the impact. Thus, for example, Europe, and especially Southern Europe, have been the most affected.","Also, the first quarter took a big hit, but it was also so heavily booked already that it was somewhat insulated from the impact. On the other hand, not surprisingly, the second and third quarters are suffering the most. They book a great deal during the WAVE period, and the summer is our most valuable season, especially in Europe.","With less of a cushion than the first quarter, they are therefore, and not surprisingly, the most vulnerable. On the other hand, as we enter the fall, we appear to be turning a corner. Sailings in the fourth quarter and for all of 2013 show promise. Both remain stronger than comparables from the same time last year, and I think that further validates our belief that this is a shorter-term issue.","Another point of encouragement is the strength of our developmental itineraries this year. Brazil performed nicely in the first quarter. Asia appears to be rebounding from last year's tsunami and then some, and Australia is nicely absorbing some meaningful growth in capacity this year. In fact, stepping back from industry and economic anomalies that are so frustratingly affecting our earnings, we're actually executing quite well against our multi-year strategic initiatives and globalization, improved credit ratings and improved returns.","2012 marks a big milestone for us in the globalization of our company as we expect that half of our guests will be coming from outside the United States this year. This has been a big push for us over the past years and has required a significant amount of effort -- of  investment, both human and capital, and this goal of organically establishing our brands throughout the world appears to be bearing fruit.","Our rate of global expansion will now slow as incremental birth additions slow. But despite a pretty lousy economic backdrop these past several years, we've been building and fine-tuning a broad and diversified global footprint from which to operate our vessels and source our guests.","With about 1\/3 of our footprint allocated to Europe, the Arab Spring and the Costa Concordia have disproportionately burdened results for the past 2 years. But we feel strongly that our diversification in a more normalized economic situation will provide us with significant flexibility for itineraries and for sourcing, which will help increase the pricing on our fantastic products.","I'm also encouraged with the progress we've made regarding our capital structure. Just at the end of February, we received a credit upgrade that puts us within one notch of returning to investment grade. Obviously, many factors influence rating decisions, but I'm sure that the $650 million in debt that we extinguished in 2011 did play a significant factor in the upgrade. ","Interestingly, returning to investment grade, in it of itself, won't lower our borrowing cost all that much. That's because we already benefit from access to export credit financing and other existing financing. But the fact is that the associated leverage reduction that accompany the goal will provide us benefits in terms of earnings, cash and volatility.","Looking strategically, we've really made tremendous progress globally diversifying the enterprise, and this should have a positive impact on our pricing. And it should provide great flexibility in our sourcing. We have also continued to strengthen the balance sheet and expect that to continue.","All of these together should lead us to higher returns on our investments. Can't do much about the economic backdrop, which is so challenging these days, but our focus is overcoming the headwinds in the short term and preparing ourselves to unfurl our sails and exploit the upturn when it does come. What we're really building here is a company that performs well in difficult times and performs exceptionally well during good times. ","Now I'll turn the call back to Brian, Dan and Adam to take you through more information regarding the quarter and our outlook. Thank you.","Brian J. Rice","Thank you, Richard. On the second slide, we have summarized our performance in the first quarter. We generated net income of $47 million or $0.21 per share. Net Yields improved 7% on a constant currency basis and 6.4% on an as reported basis. As you may recall, in February, we updated you on some changes related to our international distribution and deployment initiatives that will have a positive impact on yields but a negative effect on cost. In the first quarter, these changes had a positive impact on yield of approximately 350 basis points. The vast majority of our products in source markets experienced yield improvement during the quarter, with some of our highest yields coming from our developmental markets such as Australia, Brazil and Asia.","Onboard revenue exceeded our expectations, and it was particularly gratifying to see our first quarter net ticket yields surpass 2008 pre-recession levels. On the cost side, excluding fuel, our Net Cruise Costs were up 5.7% on a constant currency basis and up 5.1% on an as reported basis. Approximately 500 basis points of this increase was due to the structural changes I mentioned previously.","Below the line, we had a $3 million gain on our fuel options, which offset about half of the increase in fuel costs from the figures included in our guidance. Now I would like to update you on what we've been seeing in the demand environment.","Overall, the pace of new bookings and the price points in the market have been very consistent with the midpoint of our previous guidance. Demand is still somewhat volatile. And as many of you have witnessed, there are many mixed signals in the pricing surveys being done. Uncertainty still remains, especially for European itineraries this summer. But so far, the performance has been consistent with our earlier expectations.","As you may recall, when we reported in February, we said in the 2 weeks following the Costa Concordia incident, new bookings were down approximately 20%. In the week before our call as media coverage subsided and advertising began to come back, our new reservations were down in the low to mid-teens.","Since then, our cumulative bookings have been down mid-single digits. Over the past 4 weeks though, we have seen better demand, especially from the United States where year-over-year bookings have been exceeding last year's levels. As of today, our total booked load factors are slightly behind the same time last year for the second and third quarters but ahead for the fourth quarter and for 2013. Our booked APDs are higher than the same time last year in all quarters. ","Overall, our current pricing remains in line or higher than the same time last year for all major itinerary groups except Europe. At this time last year, the Arab Spring was in progress. But it wasn't until May that we felt the full impact on bookings in the Eastern Med, and we took our most aggressive pricing actions.","This year, the challenge is more wide spread than the Eastern Med, but the level of discounting is more contained. The net effect of all this is we expect some yield improvement in the Eastern Med, but overall European yields will likely be down slightly versus last year. On the other hand, all of our other major itinerary groups, including the Caribbean, Alaska and our developmental products are expected to have solid yield performance, with most exceeding 2008 levels. ","Now Europe accounts for 32% of our itineraries in the second quarter, 54% in the third quarter and 27% in the fourth. Based on what we are seeing today, we expect to have overall yield improvement in the second and fourth quarters. But we expect the weighting of Europe to put pressure on our third quarter performance. Most importantly, though, the full year still looks to be on pace with our original projections. ","On Slide 3, you will see our guidance for the second quarter. We expect yields to be up 4% to 5% on a constant currency basis and between 2% to 3% on an as reported basis. Net Cruise Costs, excluding fuel, are expected to increase by 10% to 11% on a constant currency basis and increase 8% to 9% on an as reported basis.","On Slide 4, we have provided a reconciliation of our second quarter Net Yields and cost guidance. The international distribution and deployment initiatives I mentioned before account for approximately 250 basis points of yield improvement. So on a like-for-like basis, Net Yields are expected to increase around 2% on a constant currency basis. Approximately 450 basis points of the cost increase was due to the international distribution and deployment initiative. ","Additionally, we shifted some marketing and related expenses out of the first quarter mainly due to the Costa Concordia incident, and we have an unusually high number of drydock days and related maintenance in the quarter. These 2 items combined account for about 400 basis points. So on a like-for-like basis, Net Cruise Costs, excluding fuel, are forecasted to increase between 2% and 3% on a constant currency basis. ","Based on current prices, we have included $232 million of fuel expense for the quarter, and we are 51% hedged. Earnings per share are forecasted to be roughly breakeven for the quarter. ","On Slide 5, we have provided our guidance for the full year. We expect Net Yields to improve between 2% and 5% on a constant currency basis and between 1% and 4% on an as reported basis. As you can see, we have both narrowed the range and raised the midpoint slightly. This modest uptick in Net Yield is due mainly to better sales for our Pullmantur brand's tour product in Europe.","Approximately 200 basis points of yield improvement is due to the structural changes. So on a constant currency basis, we are looking at like-for-like performance of flat to up 3%. Net Cruise Costs, excluding fuel, are expected to increase approximately 5% on a constant currency basis and approximately 4% on an as reported basis. Of this, approximately 300 basis points are due to the international distribution and deployment initiative. ","On a like-for-like basis, we are projecting an increase in these costs of about 2% or 50 basis points higher than in February. Similar to revenue, this increase is all due to the improved tours sales.","Based on today's fuel prices, we have included $923 million in fuel expense for the year, and we are 55% hedged. Our projections for earnings per share had been updated for current fuel prices. Otherwise, the midpoint is essentially unchanged from our last call. We are now forecasting EPS for the year to be between $1.80 and $2.10.","With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Adam for his comments. Adam?","Adam M. Goldstein","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Three months ago, I stated we believe a recovery of booking momentum is highly likely. The question is the timing and strength of the prospective recovery. What we see 3 months later is we are just now returning to last year's levels. And directionally, the recovery has been somewhat stronger in North America than it has been in Europe. ","In Asia, Australia and Latin America, we really did not see a falloff in business to begin with. Royal Caribbean International's year-round Caribbean programs are doing nicely, spearheaded, of course, by Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas, which continue to maintain their impressive performance throughout the year. We expect our Caribbean yields to be higher in 2012 than they were in 2008. ","Meanwhile, we are at the beginning of our summer seasonal programs. Many Royal Caribbean seasonal ships will be in Europe, where we are still a few months away from the peak holiday period. Although our capacity in the Mediterranean is down by double digits from 2011, we remain focused on our sales and marketing effort in the region, both to fill this year's capacity and to continue to build awareness of and preference for our brand. ","The biggest story of Royal Caribbean seasonal deployment, however, is the move of Voyager of the Seas to Singapore and then China. While the ship will not arrive in Singapore until May 26, it is clear the prospective presence of Voyager in Asia has galvanized interest in Royal Caribbean in the region. Asia is, in general, a late booking market, so we still have limited visibility into the performance of specific sailings. But at this stage of the selling effort, we are pleased at the market's response to Voyager. ","Royal Caribbean continues to revitalize its older ships under that Royal Advantage umbrella at a brisk pace. Rhapsody of the Seas has recently undergone a complete makeover in Singapore, and Grandeur of the Seas is about to have very similar work performed in the Bahamas. ","The rebirth of the Centrums as venues where aerial entertainment takes place during each cruise is a new breakthrough in cruise ship entertainment. Several other Royal Caribbean ships will also receive the Royal Advantage treatment before the end of this year. ","Dan?","Daniel J. Hanrahan","Thank you, Adam, and good morning, everyone. It continues to be a very positive time for Celebrity.  While the world events have had an impact on some aspects of our business, Celebrity continues to make strides. One of our most exciting initiatives is the slated arrival of Celebrity Reflection in October, our fifth in the 5-ship Solstice Class series, which is on pace at shipbuilder Meyer Werft in Papenburg, Germany. ","Other big initiative is the continued rollout of our modern luxury platform to upgraded and enhanced onboard programming and dining experiences. I'm particularly pleased with the positive guest reaction to our new main dining room menus. During the first quarter, we had healthy demand for all products. Both volume and rate came in about where we thought at the time of the previous call. We are pleased that our performance finished well ahead of Q1 2011 and '10 and also finished ahead of 2008 level. ","In addition, we had another record first quarter for our South America product on the Celebrity Infinity, which operates a series of 14-night open-jaw sailings from Buenos Aires to Valparaiso, as well as on Celebrity Xpedition, our boutique 90-passenger ship, which operates 7-night sailings in the Galapagos year-round. And also, on the newly introduced Australia and New Zealand product on Century this year. Given the strong results in Australia, I'm looking forward to having Solstice there for the winter of 2013 and '14. ","Onboard revenue performed well as the newly Solsticized Millennium Class ships helped us exceed expectations. ","For the summer season, our Alaska product, where we are once again operating 3 ships, is performing well. Bookings for our 7-night Bermuda sailings out of Cape Liberty this summer are also doing well, and we are on pace to achieve healthy yield improvements over last year on both of these products. ","Performance for our summer Europe product has been mixed. As it has already been mentioned, we continue to feel the impact of the Costa Concordia event and have had to get more creative through various offers and promotions. We are starting to see the promotional efforts work and are beginning to gain traction. ","Looking further out and while it is admittedly early, we continue to see positive signs for Q4 and into Q1 of 2013. Load factors are up, and pricing has been encouraging. Some of the most exciting news is the announcement and opening of our summer 2013 and winter 2013 and '14 deployment. All of this deployment will be open by the end of the month and will feature 4 fully Solsticized Millennium Class ships and our 5 Solstice Class ships, but I wanted to share a couple of the itineraries with you today that will have a positive impact on our performance. ","I already mentioned we will have Solstice in Australia and New Zealand this coming winter. And as a result, the Solstice Class ship will, for the first time, sail the West Coast of the United States during the summer of 2013. Solstice will replace the Infinity and operate 7-night Alaska itineraries from Seattle. The ship will join the currently deployed Millennium and Century. ","Finally, we'll have options for everyone with a more diversified 2013, '14 winter portfolio. Our lineup will feature our ships, 6 in the Caribbean, 5 around the globe, in Australia, New Zealand, the Galapagos Islands, Hawaii, South America and the South Pacific. ","Brian?","Brian J. Rice","Thanks, Dan. We'll now open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Keihlo?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva of Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","I have one easy question. There seems that capacity figures are coming down for the next 3 years. Do you have a ship sale in mind or more drydocks?","Brian J. Rice","Assia, the primary change there is to transfer the Monarch from Royal Caribbean International to Pullmantur. And because Pullmantur is reported on 2 month lag, it's has a slight impact on capacity.","Assia Georgieva","Okay, so no ship sales that we\u2019re not [indiscernible]?","Brian J. Rice","No.","Assia Georgieva","Question, Europe tends to book closer in when it comes to European [indiscernible]. What would be the sweet spot for those sailings on a normal year? Is it 2 months or 3 months before the sailing and should we expect that in May? We can see a significant year-on-year pickup as we enter more easy comparisons.","Adam M. Goldstein","Hi, Assia, it's Adam. I don't know that you can pinpoint the sweet spot to exactly one month. One of the characteristics of Europe as a cruise market is that the peak holiday season is more, let's say, July, August; whereas, in North America, it's become, in recent years, more June, July. So there is a little bit more time. We're beginning to see this now in April. But I would say, April, May, June and into July, that is the key booking period for really understanding the visibility of how the peak European cruise season will perform.","Assia Georgieva","Okay, so we're just entering that key season for European source passengers.","Adam M. Goldstein","Yes, there's the sense on our part that it really is a question of what begins to happen after the Easter holidays occur, which, of course, just took place a couple of weeks ago. And now we will begin to enter the key booking period.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wonder if you could just -- you gave us some good details. I always appreciate that. But just wondering if you could further discuss your strategy with us as you've been trying to navigate the cruise year so this difficult year. Other than Europe -- and we're just wondering where you've had to take the largest price reductions, Adam, you definitely spoke about how strong the Caribbean was for the Royal Caribbean brands. But just wondering, again, in Europe -- other than Europe, what you're seeing. And then also, have you found that the promotions that you have been doing have been successful enough to allow you to avoid further price reductions? And I'm wondering, what kind of promotions have been the most successful or the least successful?","Brian J. Rice","Assia, I'll give you kind of a high-level view, and then maybe Adam and Dan can talk about what they're seeing at the brand level. Overall, again, as I try to allude to in my script, other -- with the exception of Europe, the other products, our pricing today is at or above where it was a year ago. I think we have seen reassurance that there is elasticity in the market. And when we've had to do some promotions, we've seen good response from that. And I'd like to reiterate the pricing that you're seeing the market has been and will -- and is currently in our guidance and consistent with -- we have a little bit of latitude in terms of if we want to sacrifice some load or if we want to do some different pricing strategies. And I think each brand has a unique strategy depending on the circumstances that they're seeing. I'll pass it on to Dan for comments.","Daniel J. Hanrahan","Felicia, I think Brian's comments were right on. Really where we've had to take all the actions has been in Europe, and we've tried a number of different promotional efforts from prepaid gratuities, onboard credits, buy one get half off for the companion, things like that, as well as reduced air. They respond -- the different markets respond differently to all those promotions. I think we're getting better at it, and I think that's helped us gain some traction in Europe. But the rest of our categories, we really haven't had to be very aggressive with the promotions. It's really all been focused on Europe.","Adam M. Goldstein","Felicia, it's Adam. We've commented a lot about this from a geographical standpoint, so I don't think there's anything more I need to say about that. What I wanted to say is that while we still consider ourselves to be in a somewhat challenging revenue environment, 3 months ago, when we spoke with you, we really were not in a position to know if the kinds of discounting techniques that we had engaged in the past would have the kind of effect that we have seen them have in the past because we were in such a novel environment. It's pretty clear today that we are able to use the techniques that we commonly use and get the kind of results that we commonly get. For example, one of the things that Royal Caribbean International is pretty well-known for the so-called WOW sale. And we engaged in the exact same kind of WOW sale that we have in the past. We saw the kind of uplift in bookings that we have seen in the past. This happened just a couple of weeks ago. So yes, we have challenges. But from a revenue management standpoint, we're in a much more normal type of environment.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And Adam, am I correct that you did it in March this year versus April last year? Is there anything to read into that?","Adam M. Goldstein","We've flexed it a little bit in the past. We don't want to be totally predictable under any circumstances. That would probably actually undermine the value of the program. So I think if you look historically, it was on the early side of what we've done. But I wouldn't read too much into it.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just to follow up. Brian, in your comments, you tried to give us some color on how to spread our yields quarterly. And I just want to make sure I heard you correctly regarding the third quarter. Did your comments imply that we should look at the third quarter as potentially being a negative yields quarter or just less than the fourth -- less growth in the second and fourth?","Brian J. Rice","I was purposely vague there, Felicia. I kind of figured you'd pick up on that. We \u2013- we\u2019re confident that we're going to have yield improvement in Q2 and Q4. I think there's still a very wide range of outcomes for Q3 with the possibility of some yield deterioration. But as I tried to allude to, I think our biggest level of uncertainty right now is really the heart of the European season in Q3.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Yet -- but that being said, you're still comfortable with the new guidance that you gave today?","Brian J. Rice","Correct. Yes, that assumption, that range of outcomes within Q3 is considered in our full year guidance.","Operator","The next question is from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Adam, if you could -- I just want to make sure I'd heard you correctly, a clarification question here, that your 2012 Caribbean yields for the Royal Caribbean International brand would be higher than 2008. Was that what I heard?","Adam M. Goldstein","Yes, so I said that is what we expect.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay, great. Okay, the first question here that I have is onboard, continuing to see some good progress, you called that out, sequential progress here. What categories are you seeing that's driving that? And I would presume that, again, also, that's all occurring outside predominantly of Europe?","Daniel J. Hanrahan","Tim, it's Dan. You are right. It's outside of Europe because we really haven't -- we don't have much deployment at all in Europe at this point, so you're right about that. But what we've seen is pretty good across the board. It's been a very, very conscious effort to raise our onboard revenue with programs that we have at Celebrity. We've seen it across the board. We've seen it -- very strong beverage revenue. We've seen strong shore ex [shore excursion] revenue. Casino has not rebounded yet, but we've put programs as a whole. But we've put programs together with high rollers to help casino improve. So I think what we're seeing is that all the hard work on from our operations team here in Miami, as well as on the ships, is starting to pay off.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. And this is probably a very difficult question, but I'll throw it out there. I know you've given no guidance for '13. But everything that you know at this point -- and assuming nothing changes in the world, but everything that you know at this point from what you're seeing in the broad market, the hit from Europe, as your best guesstimate, what would you assume that hit piece would recover looking to next year would be a reasonable range of recovery?","Brian J. Rice","Tim, I don't think we're prepared to put any numbers around that. I think we're talking about a lot of uncertainty in Europe in the third quarter. I think to try to project that out to a year from now is a little too ambitious. I think I would comment that we're pleased that we're seeing Q4 in 2013 bookings continue to show strength, but it's so early in the selling cycle. I think it's just way too early to speculate on that.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, Brian, let me illuminate within that context of your answer. Let me re-ask it. Again, European, as you've already stated...","Brian J. Rice","I don\u2019t think you're going to get a different answer.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","But what you have seen of European bookings, those that -- the few that do book out further, what are you seeing for fourth quarter and first quarter of '13 out of European source passengers relative to normal?","Brian J. Rice","I think, in aggregate, we're seeing our bookings are healthy for Q4. They're healthy for early '13. But again, the basis is so small. I think it's very dangerous to extrapolate. I think we're going to try and be as transparent as we can with the things that we do know, but we're also going to be very honest with you on the things that we don't know. And I think that's one we're not prepared to comment on at this point.","Operator","The next question is from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","A few questions, I guess, on the techniques you're using to stimulate the bookings. I'm just curious if you're finding that different strategies are successful in North America versus Europe and if you could provide any detail on that without giving away the competitive secret sauce? And then secondarily, just -- if the North American consumer is seemingly a little bit more resilient at this point, how easy is it or is not easy to shift you're sourcing towards more of a North American consumer versus the European consumer, if you could help us understand that?","Adam M. Goldstein","Sharon, it's Adam. I think I commented on the last call that we have the opportunity because we're versatile in our sourcing to somewhat redirect sourcing where needed. And so we have some ability, for example, to promote more to North American source market for European cruises. That's mostly at the margins of the ratio. It's not about a fundamental change in sourcing, but we do have that opportunity. And we have been striving to take advantage of that where necessary. I think when you're looking at North America versus Europe, a lot of it has to do with where the source markets are in relation to where the ships are that they're going to cruise on. So for example, the U.K. market has -- is the market that we count on to have a good number of customers flying down to European -- Mediterranean homeport, cruising from there. Just as from the Midwest of the United States, we are dependent clearly on customers getting on airplanes and flying down to South Florida, for example. And in those cases, we're more packaging together air with cruise, possibly with land stay before or after the cruise attached to it. And I would say, generally speaking, we're finding that we're able to bring those promotions to bear on the current situation and get a response from the market. When it is either in Southern Europe, where people live close to where the ships go out, and the U.K. if it's South Hampton-based products, or for people who live in Florida or in the New York right near where ships are going out, then it's much more cruise-only pricing and a range of discounts depending on if you're a senior, a resident, military, what have you. And generally speaking, we find again in the current marketplace that we get the kind of response to those offers that we've historically gotten. Overall, we've said we probably are having to work a little bit harder at it in Europe than we are in North America, but we're within the range of revenue management expertise that we've built up over the years.","Operator","The next question is from Harry Curtis of Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I wanted to go back first to Asia. You mentioned that you were pleased with the initial response in your bookings. If you could put a little bit more meat around that, specifically, what is your motivation to move capacity to Asia from the point of view -- and if you could put that in the context of EBITDA  -- does the EBITDA per ship go up or down? How long does it take to improve and do you factor in all of the costs, including marketing and infrastructure?","Richard D. Fain","Harry, I think we've made it clear we see Asia, in general, and China, in particular, as a strategic objective. And we've acknowledged in the short term that it's a losing proposition. In particular, and you raised the question of infrastructure, et cetera, there's a lot of infrastructure that goes in. We've had 3 offices in China to support one relatively smaller vessel. So I think you've put your finger on something. In the short term, this is a strategic move which is going to cost us money, and we think that it will pay off relatively quickly. And part of that is to grow the volume to help cover much of that infrastructure and overhead and initial opening costs. So right now, it is costing us money. But when we do look at it, when you look at why we're doing it, we're doing it because in the long term, we think that we will get strong enough returns to justify. We're [ph] getting enough returns today, but we'll first approach breakeven then we'll be profitable taking into account all of those things.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And any sense of how long it takes to breakeven?","Richard D. Fain","Well, we're not that far away from it today.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And the second question that I had relates to if you could provide us on the update of your cost related to stricter environmental regulations, specifically your fuel mix. What have you built into your 2012 estimates to account for that? And then what are the technologies that you are considering and what might be the cost to install those new technologies?","Daniel J. Hanrahan","Harry, it's Dan. We've -- in all our guidance, we've assumed all the regulations that we have to deal with, so that's baked in there today. We have a real strong focus on driving consumption down, and I think that all of our brands have done a great job on that. In terms of abatement kind of technologies, we're still very early in studying and analyzing things like scrubbers. So it's not at the stage where I think we could say, \"This is what it's going to cost us to do it on ships.\" But we are engaged in it, but I think the thing that we're doing more than anything else is keeping our continuous focus on driving our consumption down.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then just the last follow-up is, Carnival has given some sense of what it's going to cost in higher fuel expense. Can you give us anything more specific about what the incremental costs are going to be this year and next?","Brian J. Rice","We've said -- Harry, we said it's not material for this year. And when we come out with our '13 guidance, we'll be sure to -- if that lovely detail is important, we can provide that. But I can tell you, as Dan alluded to and I know we don't share this publicly, but we do have our long-range models. We've assumed the worse-er case scenarios where we don't have abatement technologies, but I think we see some promising opportunities out there but it's still in the R&D phase.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could we just switch a little bit to the expense side, maybe talk -- I know you commented a little bit about the shifting of expenses from Q1 to Q2, but could you start to talk a little bit more about what you're doing longer term to reduce expenses, both at the headquarter level and also on the ship level? And then just broadly on shipbuilding, shipyards attract, can you just talk about attractive deals for more shipbuilding? When would you start to talk about building more or are you comfortable with the pace as of now?","Adam M. Goldstein","Steve, it's Adam. On your first question about cost, I mean, obviously, it's incumbent upon us as a management team to look like hawks at opportunities to spur efficiency anywhere in our structure, whether that be headquarters, in other facilities that we have on land around the world or on board the ships. At the same time though, we continue to invest in a range of initiatives mostly designed to enhance our revenue-generating capabilities for the future. Richard just alluded to some of them when he was speaking about what we're doing in China. But with the product in general, with respect to any of our brands, this is a very competitive industry that's constantly moving its offering forward. So if your product is staying the same, essentially, in competitive terms, you're going in reverse. And we've been very clear that we will continue to invest in product enhancement features. That puts even more pressure therefore on us to make sure that we identify efficiencies that will not touch the product experience in any way, and we're in pursuit of both of those objectives at all times, more efficiency where guests won't see it and better products where they will.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Adam, is that on purchasing power or what is it that you're able to do? I'm sorry, Brian, you can go ahead.","Brian J. Rice","I was just going to add that despite all the investments that we have been putting in for our international footprint and they -- I know you can imagine the infrastructure that we've put in place and marketing of our brands as we've grown them organically has been significant. Despite that, we have been able to keep our non-fuel cruise Net Cruise Costs well below the rate of inflation. And I can tell you, the brands in the shore side environment work tirelessly, whether it's through taking advantage of scale and leveraging the new international footprint that we have, whether it's finding efficiencies, whether it's through new technologies, whether it's finding those things that our guest and our customers just don't value and deemphasizing those or eliminating them. There is a continuous focus on how do we gain efficiency. Yet at the same time, we are making those strategic investments.","Richard D. Fain","And then, Steve, looking at -- responding to your question on future new buildings. I think you have to remember that, that's a decision which is very long-term one. If you order the ship, it takes years before the ship can be delivered. So you really have to be constantly looking out. We've made it very clear that we think in the environment that we see today and the environment that we see looking into the future, we're really looking for margin growth as opposed to simply volume growth. And where we believe that having a relatively modest amount of growth will help the supply-demand situation and therefore, pay for itself quite attractively. So we do see that growth continuing on a slower basis than it has in the past. At the same time, we really have to constantly think about these things. Unlike some industries, when the capacity comes, it comes in a big lump and that will lead to a somewhat jagged curve. And even in difficult times, you need to be thinking what is going to be needed years into the future. So I think we will continue to progress this sort of on a regular basis and not adjust that based on day-to-day or month-to-month fluctuations or even the economic situation.","Operator","The next question is from James Hardiman of Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","First, just a real quick clarification, if you will. I was hoping you could just ultimately distill the change in guidance a bit. You increased the midpoint of both the yield and the cost guidance, both excluding currency and fuel, by about 50 basis points, I believe. Was that, in both cases, changes in distribution and deployment that drove that or was there may be a slightly better outlook on the low end that also contributed to the yield side of things?","Brian J. Rice","Sure, James. We increased, if you will, the midpoint of yield by 50 basis points, increased the non-fuel Net Cruise Costs by 50 basis points. That was due almost entirely to -- we've seen some increased sales in our tour business for Pullmantur within Europe, while our cruise sales have been struggling a bit. We have seen an uptick on the land base, which includes air from Pullmantur's tour product. It's essentially breakeven, slightly positive. But for the most part, it's break even. And the change in the guidance for EPS is 100% due to fuel. We had a 15% change in fuel costs, and that's what our midpoint changed by.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Got you, very helpful. And then my question is, you're typically pretty hesitant to talk about any individual competitors but to the extent that the Concordia disaster has been a major factor for you and the rest of the industry. It may be appropriate. Carnival has talked about  holding pricing and basically taking the losses on the occupancy side of the yield equation. Obviously, they're going to do you what's in their best interest. But it's pretty clear that if they hold true to that strategy, it's a good thing for you and the rest of the industry just from a rational pricing standpoint. Can you speak to how rational pricing has been competitively and how you think that plays out over the rest of the year whether or not they're realistically going to hold true to that goal?","Richard D. Fain","As you say, we've been pretty consistently reluctant to talk about competitors, and I don\u2019t really think it's appropriate. And quite frankly, I don't know enough about what they're doing to be able to make intelligent comments anyhow. I think one of the interesting aspects of the way we do revenue management is the main driver isn't looking at our competitor. Our main driver is looking at our customer. And our customer -- we look at the volume of calls. We look at their interest at different price levels, and I think we have the best revenue management system in the business and the best revenue management people in the business. And their real focus is who's calling, what are they willing to accept. And I think that will continue to be our main driver. And I think what we are seeing is we are seeing a lot more hesitancy from the first-time cruiser, not the repeat guests. And so I think there is a period of assimilation, a period of getting over this unfortunate event. And then I think we'll move on with the system operating as it's geared to do, which is to educate people more about what cruising offers and then price it to match their willingness to pay that.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Let me ask it this way then. The big fear following Concordia was that you'd have a lot of potential travelers, potential customers that may want to hold off and may assume that pricing is going to come down. As you think about the decline in bookings in the European market, are you able to discern how many of those people are just sort of waiting for things to come down and may hop back in as we get closer to those sailing dates or is that possible to -- impossible to tease out?","Richard D. Fain","Well, I think enough time has gone by for them to see which way pricing is going. I think that was something that people talked about in the weeks after the event. But it's pretty clear that we're continuing to operate our revenue management systems in a methodical and measured way. And I think talk about those kinds of things, I know there were some people who were suggesting that was a big issue. But I think talk about those sorts of things has dissipated as -- it is very clear that the industry, and certainly ourselves, is seeing enough demand to continue to operate in our revenue management systems as we always have.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian of Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My 2 questions. First one is just in terms of the booking volume trends following the Concordia accident. How would you characterize the kind of the volatility? Would you say that, that's moderated recently? And as you talk to travel agents, are they still waiting for deals like they were maybe following the Concordia accident?","Brian J. Rice","Greg, from the volume standpoint, there has been a little bit of volatility, but there's also a lot of noise in terms of when the Easter holiday sell. It's a couple of weeks earlier. As Adam alluded to, he ran his WOW sales a couple of weeks earlier. So when you're looking at year-over-year, you're seeing a little bit of noise. But I think we have a better grip on what's happening, particularly for products outside of the core summer Europe itineraries. I think that's where we're seeing the most uncertainty at this point.","Unknown Executive","On -- with regard to travel agents, I think the most notable thing about our interaction with them, speaking for the most part here specifically to the United States market, is sort of how calm they are about the situation that they're in and believing that cruise products and services are still very much at the core of their business model and looking forward pretty optimistically. They often say they haven't seen any diminution in sales and that their business is relatively healthy. So we think that the distribution system is in pretty good shape and continues to look forward to distributing our products and services.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And just my second question, just, I guess, because Net Yields. You raised the lower end slightly so they're basically unchanged, maybe a little bit higher. Do you still think it was the Concordia accident had about 200 basis points impact on Net Yields overall?","Brian J. Rice","I think that it's hard to kind of dissect it. There's a lot more noise out of the European economy right now. But I think, directionally, around that number is probably not too far off from our best estimates.","Operator","The next question is from Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to clarify, I'm just circling back to the Pullmantur expense increase that you mentioned, the 50 basis points from higher tour sales and just trying to think about the -- your change in the lower end of yield guidance, that 100 basis points. Is it fair to say that most of that increase at the lower end of your guidance was from tour sales and that your expectations for just cruise sales that your guidance is basically unchanged?","Brian J. Rice","Yes, the tour sales, we\u2019re still right at the midpoint. And we -- as you alluded to, if you average the high and the low, both our yield and our Net Cruise Costs x fuel, we raised 50 basis points. Both of those were due almost entirely to the increase in tour sales.","Operator","The next question is from Jaime Katz of Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I know you guys talked a little bit about returning to investment grade on the call. But can you talk a little bit about how that trajectory has changed now that this year's cash flow might be crimped a little bit more than originally expected and when you expect to get there?","Brian J. Rice","Yes, Jamie, the cash flow, in the grand scheme of things, is not affected that much. I think we're still looking at $1.5 billion plus in terms of EBITDA for the year. And fortunately, these sort of hiccups in terms of if you assumed a 2% haircut on yield, you're talking about $0.50, $0.60 a share but you're only talking about $100 million, $120 million in cash flow. So it doesn't have that big of an impact on our credit metrics. I think, as a general rule of thumb, we kind of look a 3.75 ratio of net debt to EBITDA as kind of the benchmark that we're looking for. Obviously, as Richard talked about, the rating agencies are going to look a lot more than that, and it depends on whether they're forward-looking or backward-looking in terms of when they get there. I think if you look at most of the analyst models, we haven't published anything further out, I think most of them, you would see those sort of ratios probably late '13, early '14 would be where they would be getting us. But again, there's a lot of other factors, and it depends on kind of the operating environment that we're in at that time. But that should give you some sort of [indiscernible].","Operator","The next question is from the line of Kevin Milota of JPMorgan.","Kevin Milota - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I appreciate the updated commentary as you look through the year. Fourth quarter in full year '13 looked pretty solid or at least your commentaries sounds a lot better than it was post -- immediately post Concordia. I was hoping you could give us a sense of typically at this point of the year from a capacity standpoint, how much is booked, and if the fourth quarter trends that you're seeing now, how that fits into the typical booking range?","Brian J. Rice","Yes, Kevin, I do want to emphasize that it's still very early in the booking window, and I think our commentary about Q4 and 2013 is fairly consistent with what we saw back in early February when we had our fourth quarter call. What we saw was bookings had a significant impact in the second and third quarters. We had a very strong order book in the first quarter, but we had seen a continuation of the pre-Concordia demand for Q4 and 2013. We're still a ways off from our peak booking window for those periods. What we have said is if you take a rolling 12 months, we're generally about 50% sold. And that curve is fairly linear as you go out into different quarters. But I do want to caution, while things are looking good, it is still exceptionally early.","Kevin Milota - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then from a fuel consumption standpoint, first quarter being the first of -- in a long time that you haven't beat on the consumption side of things. Is that primarily related to the deployment initiatives that you're working through or kind of what's going on there? What happened in the first quarter?","Brian J. Rice","Yes, there were actually 3 factors. We had a little bit more impact from weather where the ships had additional consumption. We had a few additional medical evacuations where we had to deviate from the itineraries. But the lion's share was really driven by some of the new itineraries and just, I guess, we may have gotten a little aggressive in terms of what we felt we might be able to do with those. But as Adam and Dan have alluded to, this is a 24\/7 effort to continuously figure out how we can contain and lower our fuel consumption.","Operator","Your final question comes from Joe Hovorka of Raymond James.","Joseph D. Hovorka - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","It looks like your CapEx has gone up by $100 million in '12 and '13 from last quarter. What is that?","Brian J. Rice","Joe, it's a very slight change. Actually, we round to the nearest $100 million, and that was entirely due to the progress payments for Sunshine 2, the order that we just confirmed.","Okay. Well, with that, we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. And as always, Ian will be available throughout the day for any follow-ups you may have. Thanks, and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"19173":["Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

My name is Simon, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to introduce Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jason Liberty. Mr. Liberty, the floor is yours.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carola Mengolini, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides which have been posted on our Investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Please note that we do not undertake to update the information in our filings as circumstances change.","Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of all non-GAAP historical items can be found on our website.

I will follow up with a recap of our third quarter results. I will then provide an update on the current booking environment, provide guidance for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2018 and then close with some early thoughts on 2019. We will then open up the call for your questions.","Richard?","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. After a rough week in the stock market, we're happy to share some good news. Our business remains healthy across our major source markets, and onboard spend continues to grow. We are particularly pleased to continue increasing our yield guidance which is now almost 100 basis points higher than our January estimate, and that's on a like-for-like basis. As a matter of fact, since our January guidance we have offset more than $115 million or $0.55 per share of headwinds from foreign exchange and fuel, and we still raised our guidance.","I have to say that I am both frustrated and impressed \u2013 frustrated that we've had to overcome such headwinds and impressed that our fundamentals are so strong that we can face such hurdles and still exceed our forecasts.","As it pertains to this past third quarter, we generated an adjusted EPS of $3.98, which was 14% higher than last year's figure. In fact, it's an all-time record. Given the concerns about weather, politics, trade wars and supply, this result definitely strengthens our confidence in the continued health of the cruise market. Part of the reason our business remains so strong is that we evolve our product to meet the evolving demands of our guests. The trend of people looking for experiences instead of buying things continues to be a defining characteristic. And it is a characteristic that we, at Royal Caribbean, pay close attention to. Fortunately, providing experiences and memories is already our sweet spot. Satisfying that new consumer preference is a constant focus of ours and one where we continue to innovate.","In previous calls, you've heard me talk about our investments in Excalibur, our digital transformation platform. Today, I thought it would help to show you just how aggressively we are rolling out these capabilities to our guests. I would emphasize that our guest capabilities represent just one dimension of the program, but it's a highly visible one and I wanted to share it with you today.","Slide 2 shows the planned launch schedule. The guest app in its current form includes features such as accelerated check-in, the daily planner, onboard accounts, shore excursions as well as the ability to book various items such as shore excursions, specialty restaurants and other onboard activities. You can see in the slide that we have highlighted three milestones that represent the way we make the app available to our guests. We call them crawl, walk, run.","The first phase, crawl, refers to testing mode. In crawl mode, the app is up and running but we keep it very quiet so we can test it out with a small group of participants. When we are comfortable that the functionality has reached an acceptable level, we shift to the walk stage. When we get to walk, we allow everyone who wishes to do so to use the app, but we don't aggressively push it. This is roughly equivalent to the beta stage of most apps. It gives us a chance to test it under real-life conditions but only with a limited group of users. Lastly, when we get to the run phase, we want as many guests engaged as possible. The app is then available to anyone, and we vigorously publicize it so that as many guests as possible use it. When we get to the run stage, the app has been thoroughly vetted and most of our guests use it and love it.","Our initial priority for the app capabilities has been on easing the process of boarding and disembarking. We've also prioritized other things that our guests most want. Next will come more bells and whistles, such as facial recognition, the ability to easily book your onboard activities before sailing, new chat capabilities, and an innovative digital stateroom key. Again, I want to remain repeat that this only refers to the capabilities our guests use. A lot of focus has also been on the capabilities that make our employees more efficient and more effective.","Now one question I'm sometimes asked is how we can scale this so quickly out to our fleet. The reason is that, over the years, we have built and maintained our fleet to take maximum advantage of technology. As a result, we already have a lot of technology on the ships and that can be used to provide some of these capabilities. We need to add more, but this gives us a definite leg-up. Through this type of investment, we are not only expanding and improving the product offering but also attracting new segments to cruise. We find that using such technology to reduce the hassle factor behind traveling increases the demand for our products.","As our businesses grow, technology isn't the only area where we have exciting things happening. We are well underway in the buildup of Perfect Day at CocoCay in the Bahamas, and we are very excited about what that does for enhancing the experiences of our guests and thereby raising our yields. Perfect Day will be a nice boost to our bottom-line because it will increase our revenues nicely while only increasing our expenses a bit. That also serves as a reminder that our business grows \u2013 that as our business grows geographically and in complexity, it impacts some of our metrics in unexpected ways.","For example, last year in the third quarter it was ironic that the hurricanes, which hurt our bottom-line so much, actually improved our yield metrics. That came about because while we lost a lot of revenue, unfortunately, a very lot of revenue, from canceled sailings, those sailings had lower APDs than our average. Thus, eliminating those sailings slightly improved our average yield.","Another example is our marvelous new terminal here in Miami. Besides being beautiful, Terminal A is economically better for us than what we had been doing previously. However, the new way we have structured the financings means that we will have higher revenues and higher expenses. The net is positive, but it will raise both revenue and expense. The impact on our metrics may be counterintuitive, but the impact on our bottom-line is unequivocally positive.","The one other example I would like to mention. Actually, I don't think I need another example, but this is one I am quite pleased about, so I thought I would share it. You may recall that last year after successfully completing the Double-Double program, we gave equity awards to every employee in the company. We called it a Thank You, Thank You Bonus. Our financials always assume that we will have a certain amount of employee turnover, and for 2018, we assumed that our normal attrition rate would continue. However, in the aftermath of the Thank You, Thank You boost, we've actually experienced a reduction in employee turnover.","Personally, I view that as a terrific success. It will reduce our cost and improve our performance going forward, but in the short-run, it does mean higher compensation expense due to a lower rate of forfeiture on the equity awards. That is a great outcome.","And lastly, before I turn the call back to Jason, I want to talk about the new Celebrity Edge that will be launched in November sailing out of Fort Lauderdale. Every time Lisa and I visit the yard to review progress, we get more and more thrilled about the exquisite work that the teams have done. I know you will all be blown away at Celebrity Edge, and I'm happy to say that we are seeing that impact in our bookings. Demand for cruising is booming, and guests are willing to pay for innovation, quality, and design. The timing of this ship could not be better.","With that, I am pleased to turn the call back over to Jason. Jason?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thank you, Richard. I will begin by talking about our results for the third quarter of 2018. These results are summarized on slide 3. For the quarter, we generated adjusted earnings of $3.98 per share, which is approximately $0.05 higher than the midpoint of our guidance and 14% higher than same time last year. Better close-in demand for our core products, better onboard revenues, and better-than-expected results from our joint ventures drove the beat in the quarter.","Our net revenue yield increased 2.6% year-over-year, which was 60 basis points better than our guidance. Strong close-in demand, particularly from our Asia-Pacific, Europe and Alaska products combined with stronger beverage and shore excursion revenue, mainly drove the outperformance.","Net cruise costs excluding fuel were down 0.1% for the quarter, which was 90 basis points higher than our guidance, driven mainly by timing.","On the shareholder return front, we repurchased $162 million of share in early Q3, and last month, we announced a 17% increase in our quarterly dividends.","Now I would like to share trends we are seeing in the demand environment for the balance of 2018. As we move forward in the fourth quarter, many of our ships transition out of Europe, Alaska, and Bermuda and begin their winter season. As such, about 55% of our capacity will be in the Caribbean, 18% will be in the Asia-Pacific region, and 12% will be in Europe.","While the addition of Silversea to our family of brands does bring a number of new itineraries to our portfolio, it doesn't have a significant impact on our overall capacity distribution for the fourth quarter, nor for 2019. Despite our increased mix of short Caribbean itineraries, Q4 sailings are booked nicely ahead of same time last year in both rate and volume. As you would expect, the Caribbean accounts for most of our remaining inventory, and we are in a strong book position for the product both including and excluding new hardware.","We are also very excited to welcome Celebrity Edge into the fleet next month. It's been six long years since a new ship joined the Celebrity fleet, and she's clearly worth the wait. Edge has been booking at significant premiums for the winter Caribbean season and for our European season next year.","Now let's turn to slide 4 to talk about our guidance for the full year. We are narrowing our guidance to $8.75 to $8.85 per share. This guidance includes the negative impact of approximately $0.10 per share from currency and fuel since our previous guidance. Also, as Richard mentioned, since providing our initial guidance in January, the stronger dollar and higher fuel prices have negatively impacted our earnings by approximately $115 million or $0.55 per share. These changes have also impacted our 2019 earnings by a similar amount.","Also, to note, our guidance now includes Silversea's operations. As previously announced, Silversea's operations will be incorporated into our financials on a quarter lag and for 2018, we do not expect the results to have a material impact on our bottom line.","As it relates to our key metrics, we expect our net revenue yields to increase in the range of 4% to 4.5% for the year. This represents an improvement of approximately 100 basis points versus our previous expectations. The consolidation of Silversea's operations is contributing approximately 80 basis points, and the remaining 20 basis points improvement is being driven by the outperformance in the third quarter and an increase in the revenue outlook for the fourth quarter.","From a cost perspective, we expect net cruise costs excluding fuel to be up approximately 4.5%. The consolidation of Silversea is contributing approximately 140 basis points. This updated guidance also reflects an increase in our costs that relate to the acceleration of technology-related investments. We anticipate fuel expense of $706 million for the year, and we are 54% hedged at a price of $434 per metric ton.","In summary, based on the current business outlook along with current fuel prices, interest and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $8.75 to $8.85.","Now we can turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter, which is on slide 5. Net yields are expected to be up in the range of 6.5% to 7% with the addition of Silversea driving approximately 350 basis points of the year-over-year improvement. As such, we are reporting Silversea on a one quarter lag, so Q4 includes the results of Silversea's higher-yielding August and September sales.","Net cruise costs excluding fuel for the fourth quarter are expected to increase in the range of 6% to 6.5%, which includes approximately 500 basis points from the Silversea consolidation. As mentioned above, this guidance also reflects the increase in our costs that relate to the acceleration of technology-related investments.","Additionally, the consolidation of Silversea is negatively impacting our depreciation for the quarter and the full year by approximately $0.06 per share and negatively impacting our interest expense for the quarter and the year by approximately $0.04 per share.","Based on current fuel prices, interest and currency exchange rates and the outlook expressed above, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.50 per share.","Before providing some color on 2019 booking trends, I'd like to highlight some of the key performance drivers for 2019. We have stunning new hardware. We are amping up our private destinations with Perfect Day. We are benefiting from our modernization program. Our own terminal in the busiest cruise port in the world will be online, and we have a new ultra-luxury and expedition cruise line in our portfolio.","It definitely seems that we have more going on in 2019 than in any other year in recent history, and I want to make sure that we walk through some of the dynamics that will shape yields and cost next year.","From a hardware standpoint, we'll enjoy our first full year with Celebrity Edge, Symphony of the Seas, and Azamara Pursuit while also welcoming Spectrum of the Seas and Celebrity Flora to the family in the second quarter. 2019 will also benefit from our modernization programs, Royal Amplified, Celebrity Revolution, and Silversea's Invictus, which means more drydock days in 2019 than in 2018.","As it relates to other big elements affecting our numbers next year, we will have our first full year with Silversea, we'll launch Perfect Day at CocoCay, and the operation of the new Terminal A here at the Port of Miami. All three of these additions will increase both yield and cost metrics. We will provide more details on the financial impact of these items during our fourth quarter earnings call.","I wanted to spend a moment to discuss some below-the-line considerations for 2019. The first one is depreciation. As Richard discussed, we are very excited about our Excalibur program and the very positive feedback we have been receiving. From a financial perspective, I would note that our investments in significant technology projects, like Excalibur, are becoming a larger mix of the capital program and generally have a shorter useful life than our typical capital investments.","The other area of note will be the impact of Silversea below-the-line. Being in the luxury and expedition segment, Silversea's depreciation per berth is significantly higher than our corporate average. In addition, Silversea's current bond has a coupon of 7.25%, which is significantly higher than our cost of debt.","Now I'll provide you with an update on our 2019 deployment. Our capacity for 2019 is expected to be up approximately 8.6%, of which approximately 220 basis points are driven by the addition of Silversea. Just over half of our 2019 capacity will be in the Caribbean, while Europe and Asia-Pac will account for approximately 16%. Our Caribbean capacity is increasing by about 10%, driven by the addition of Edge and Symphony, combined with an expanded short Caribbean program that includes the newly modernized Mariner of the Seas and soon-to-be modernized Navigator of the Seas. Also to note is just over a quarter of the guests on a Caribbean cruise will get to experience Perfect Day at CocoCay in its first year.","Capacity is about flat year-over-year for Europe, Asia-Pac, although both regions will feature one of our new ships. Celebrity Edge will sail her first summer season in the Mediterranean and Spectrum of the Seas will transition to her new home of Shanghai after her delivery in the spring. We are also improving our hardware in Alaska with larger ships for both Royal Caribbean and Celebrity, plus the addition of Silversea's newest ship, the Silver Muse and Azamara's first-ever Alaska season. We haven't pointed out capacity numbers for some of our smaller products on these calls before. But with the addition of Silversea and Celebrity Flora, it's worth noting that the high-yielding expedition products will account for approximately 2.5% of our inventory in 2019 versus only 0.5% in 2018.","Now onto some early insight into 2019 bookings. We continue to see strong booking trends for 2019 and are currently booked ahead of same time last year in rate and volume, both including and excluding Silversea. While each of our larger product groups are in a strong book position, we're particularly pleased with how the Caribbean is shaping up, as it is the region that will absorb the most capacity for our company next year. Although we don't normally provide guidance for 2019 until our fourth quarter earnings call, these insights certainly point to another year of robust yield and net income growth.","With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Just kind of looking to get a little more insight into 2019. I wonder if you could \u2013 you mentioned that rate and volume ahead, so sounds like yield's likely to grow. Can you comment on sort of the rate of how far in advance you're booked versus the same time last year just so we can think about maybe the magnitude of yield growth a little bit? And then also, I don't know if you have any comments to share about Q1, given how booked you may have been before hurricane season last year. Is Q1 a particularly tough comp? Or do you also feel that Q1 would be representative of how the year would look; just any thoughts around that? Thank you.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah, sure. So first on 2019, the acceleration in the bookings for 2019 have been very strong, even before and after we lapped the hurricane comp. And we have been up in both a rate and volume basis. And really for the next 12 months, if you look at it on a quarterly basis, we're also up on a rate and volume basis, so we continue to see the booking window extend and strength as the consumer considers their vacation plans for 2019.","As it relates to the first quarter, as I just commented, we do expect our rate and volume to \u2013 our rate and volume are up. We do expect yield improvement in the first quarter of next year. And I would also just point you to my commentary and my remarks about the Caribbean, which is a big part of our Q1 picture, and that is also in a very strong book position.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then maybe just lastly, any thoughts with Spectrum going to China next year? There's been a lot of focus, obviously, about U.S.-China relations. And do you have any concerns about as you're selling \u2013 it's, I guess, early to be selling in that market, but is there any impact in your discussions with travel sellers there?","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Hi, Robin. It's Michael. We've been really pleased with the performance of the China market this year, and as you know, it's a long-term strategy. We've been in the market for 10 years. We just recently received another award as the top cruise line in China. So we're excited about Spectrum coming into Shanghai in 2019.","If you recall, Ovation is coming out of China, going to Alaska, which is doing very well in Alaska. And so our capacity overall next year in China is fundamentally flat. I think the market overall is down slightly in terms of capacity.","We've had a lot of enthusiasm in terms of forward bookings for Spectrum, and we're very pleased with where the ship sits already in terms of forward bookings.","In terms of the issues on tariffs and what have you, it's been slightly volatile. I mean, just as I think we see in the American stock market, there's been some ups and downs in the Chinese stock market, but everything's \u2013 the fundamentals seem to be still okay. We've seen nothing coming through in terms of consumer confidence or concerns from our travel partners.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","And, Robin, I would just add, because also I noted in my commentary some of the strength in the close-in business as well as some of the reason for the increase in the outlook in Q4 has been a strength we have seen coming out of the China market.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Oh. Great. Interesting. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is open.","Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, hey. Good morning, guys. So, Jason, I guess the simple question is, what is your definition of the word robust? You talked about that around 2019. Is that \u2013 I know you guys have talked about kind of a 2% to 4% start point for yield, but can you maybe help us think a little bit better about what does robust mean?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Well, I would say the 2019 booking environment has been strong, which has led us to be in a very, I think, good book position on a rate and volume basis, and I think that's probably what I would take into those remarks. There are a lot of tailwinds into our yield profile for next year, whether it's for the new hardware, like-for-like improvement. We talked about the Port of Miami and CocoCay and of course Silversea coming in.","But I think when we look at our general business, whether it's excluding items like Silversea for a second and excluding the Port and CocoCay, the demand for our new hardware, especially for Edge, which has really come high on at a premium, has been very strong and encouraging. And so far, based off of what we're seeing in the booking environment, we also expect very good comps for our business on a like-for-like basis.","Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Got you. Thanks. And then in terms of \u2013 I know you don't want to give quantitative guidance at this point for next year, but from a cost perspective next year, you helped us think about D&A and interest a little bit in your prepared remarks. Those technology investments that you are talking about for the fourth quarter, how should we be thinking about those for 2019? And then can you also quantify the drydock days in 2019 versus 2018?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Sure. So just starting off on the cost as it relates to the technology side, there's really kind of two components to it, one of which is on the depreciation side as a larger mix of our investments are going into technology-related projects. As I said in my remarks, that results in a lower useful life on average for those investments.","And so we do expect, just like we saw from 2017 to 2018, an elevation in our depreciation as a percent of our revenue. We would expect an increase as well over the 2018 to 2017, so more 2018 to 2019 will be even higher as a percent of our revenue for our investments in technology and also for our investments with \u2013 also with the depreciation being higher for Silversea.","The other component on the technology side is on the OpEx side, so a lot of the services are cloud-based services or subscription-based services and those do put pressure on our operating costs. And the more that kind of rolls out, the more that will weigh on our costs for next year. But, of course, we continue to look at how do we become more and more efficient within our cost structure. As it relates for drydock days, let me just get, pull it up here \u2013 so in 2019, we had about 360 drydock days, and \u2013 no, I'm sorry, in 2018 we had about 280 drydock days and in 2019, including Silversea, we have about 360 drydock days.","Steven Moyer Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","You got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. So just to confirm because for 2019, your outlook, it sounds like you're looking every quarter higher volumes and higher pricing for the next year?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah, for the next 12 months, we're up in both rate and volume in every quarter.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then just the phenomenon of your extending booking curves, does that historic \u2013 I mean not historic \u2013 we've looked back about a year-and-a-half, if you look at the past year and a half, ex maybe this quarter, you beat net yields by over \u2013 by about 100 basis points, does the extending booking curve kind of limit your ability to report that kind of upside because there's just less close-in bookings to be had?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah, that is \u2013 I mean obviously, us taking on more business, the purpose of it is we think that we will be optimizing yields by doing so. But as we get closer to those sailings, that close-in business is more limiting because we have less inventory to sell.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just on your fourth quarter guidance, just a couple of points of clarification. So I just want to make sure I'm doing my math right. It looks like you raised the midpoint of your previously implied guidance by 50 basis points? Is that right?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","That's correct.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just the increase in the cost, you mentioned that was project Excalibur. We're estimating that's about $0.08 to earnings? Is that right? $0.08, $0.10?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Well, it's a combination of a few things, one of which is as I commented on the third quarter, there's some shifting that's going into the fourth quarter, which may not be obvious because we lost some APCDs in the third quarter due to some incidents around some of our ships, mechanical incidents on our ships as well as on the hurricane side. So there are costs that are shifting in from Q3 to Q4, and then the balance of that is Excalibur, and then also, as Richard commented, we're experiencing lower turnover, lower forfeiture rates which are increasing our competition cost mildly.","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Hey, Felicia. It's Michael. One other point to bring forward is the nonrefundable deposits that we introduced about a year and a half ago for the Royal brand, and now we have over 60% of our bookings that are nonrefundable. And that's really helped with the stickiness of the bookings. So when we're getting these bookings earlier on, they're staying with us and they're not churning. So that's I think also been a contributing factor.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's great. And then just finally, just for 2019, just given all the moving parts for \u2013 in terms of costs, you have a lot of initiatives which are affecting that, ex Silversea. So on a like-for-like basis, can we expect your 2019 yields, the robust 2019 yields that you talked about, to offset those incremental costs from kind of how we've been thinking about things currently?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes. We certainly expect on a like-for-like basis for our cost behavior to continue and be very focused on making sure we're as efficient as we possibly can. But I think taking into account other things like Silversea and so forth, that will \u2013 the optics around that will look like our costs are higher than what you have seen in the past, obviously.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah, Felicia, if I could \u2013 it's Richard, and if I could just add to that. We're really think that our heavy emphasis on cost control has been an important constructive factor for us, and I think we just have these two things coming together which we think will be positive to our bottom-line.","One is these somewhat mechanical things. And I pointed to Terminal A as an example where we've done something which is recently a good operational thing for our bottom-line, but it does \u2013 because we are taking over ownership, it moves up our revenue and our expenses. And the other one is some of these investments like Excalibur.","But overall, we think these things will be positive to the bottom line, and we still think that we are going to come out with cost increases which are, for most industries, people would be envious of it. So we don't intend to take our eye off that important ball. But as Jason says, the way it comes across in the numbers may be a little bit counterintuitive until you look at the details.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hey. Good morning. Just a clarification. Early in your discussion, you talked about there actually being more drydock days, and I think when you defined it, it looked like there are less. I wonder if you could go through those numbers again.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Sure, Harry.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","I think you went from like 380 down to 360, so is it like \u2013 I just want to get that right.","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Harry, it was the other way around. It was 280 to 360. So 280 in 2018 and 360 in 2019.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Exactly.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","280? Okay. So obviously it's difficult when you get older. Okay. So I'm trying to get a sense of the elevated expenses in the fourth quarter flowing into next year. And if you could give us a sense of what is particularly elevated in the fourth quarter that's unlikely to recur in 2019, whether it's \u2013 for example, did development costs begin to come down. Some of these bonus accruals \u2013 will they come down?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah, I don't think there's really a, per se, timing element to this because, I mean, we are very much trying to accelerate our Excalibur efforts to the point that we can. And so I wouldn't look at this as we're just shifting some costs from January into December.","This is our ability to have certain capabilities come online a little bit quicker than we had expected them to, because as Richard mentioned, we think that the investments we're making in Excalibur to decrease friction within the guest experience and increase on-demand capabilities which we think are table stakes in the guest experience and what the customers are looking for \u2013 the sooner we can get that on the ships, we believe that will lead to better revenue and better guest satisfaction as well as a better employee experience for our crew. So I wouldn't look at this as a timing element, I would look at this as our ability to bring on capabilities sooner than we had anticipated.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Okay. And then last question is, prior to folding in the Silversea acquisition, there was a consensus estimate on consensus metrics for net cruise costs next year of, I think, it was probably around 2%, maybe 2.5%. Just kind of directionally, do you think that the Street was in the right neighborhood with that assumption?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Well, we are still very much in our planning process, so it's tough to pinpoint that. And I would just point to make sure that in that consideration, besides for Silversea, there's also the costs that we will incur with Perfect Day and also the Port of Miami. So I'm not going to comment specifically on that number, but those will also be elements that will be impacting our cost metric next year.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","And just one real final quick question going (37:54) back to a comment you just made about the technology application. Have you gone from crawling to walking? Or are you going from walking to running?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Well, I would point you to that chart. I mean, that really does depict the path and the cadence that we're going down. So I think the chart that was on slide 2 kind of shows our path on how we plan on this being implemented across our fleet and also how the capabilities are expected to grow, and that's how I would look at the cadence of what we're doing. But certainly we are leaning in as much as we can to get as much of it done and if we can accelerate that chart, we certainly will because of the benefits that we think that we're going to get out of it.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Okay. Very good. Thanks for your help.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","You got it, Harry. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Two questions for you. In the most recent earnings call, you had, for 2Q results, had talked about strength in last-minute booking trends. I'm wondering what you observed in last-minute booking trends for travel in 3Q and year-to-date.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Sure. So I'll just start on that one. We also saw, similar to Q2, we saw accelerated trends from our close-in bookings. I think the only thing that was probably a little bit different is we saw some further strength in Asia-Pac, specifically China and the close-in environment in Q3 versus in the second quarter.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Then my next question, are you seeing any notable difference in pricing and booking trends by, whether it's sort of the high-end Silversea or more of your pet (40:04) market core brands? Certainly the wealth effect has been helping luxury hotels but I'm wondering if you're also seeing that with your bookings by brand.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah, sure. So I won't comment by brand but I would just say on the spectrum that the demand we're seeing for the Royal Caribbean customer is very similar to the demand we're seeing for the Silversea customer. So that spectrum is, or the booking patterns in terms of strength have been quite similar. Of course, the Silversea customer books much further out. But as I commented in my remarks, we look at on both rate and volume with and without Silversea. We're up on a rate and volume basis in the quarter and as well as for next year.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein. Your line is open.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks for the question. One for Richard. Richard, in the past you've said that Royal is kind of like a duck on the water paddling hard below the surface despite the appearance of a smooth glide on top. Obviously a reference to your people, not your ships. But I'm wondering...","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Thank you for that clarification.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, I thought that was needed. I think part of the concern with investors that's being reflected into stock price is slowing cycle obviously. So at this point, as the cycle extends further, do you feel like your company has to paddle harder than it has in the past to deliver the same results?","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","No. I think actually the metaphor that you're using that I have used in the past is really a reflection of a cultural norm here that we think there are so many opportunities that we just want to take advantage of them and that means we have to paddle fast. Our mantra, as you know, is continuous improvement and we are very focused on that. I would not have described the situation today as any different. We always are focused on doing other things. The travel agent partners that we're working with are always focused on doing other things.","But I don't think I would describe this as that much different. Maybe the difference today would be, one, we have a lot of new things that, I think, are coming online that are really very positive for us. And so we do have a confluence of, for example, Symphony of the Seas, which we'll be naming here in about three weeks. We just about a month and a half ago did Azamara Pursuit and Celebrity Edge coming early December. It's Flora next year.","So there are a lot of really quite dramatic new hardware things. And we're probably now seeing coming to market more of the non-ship things which are helping us in very many ways. Obviously, we talked about Excalibur. We talked about the new terminals, both here in Miami at Terminal A and up in Fort Lauderdale at Terminal 25, Perfect Day. So there are a lot of those things going on, and so I think the simple answer is there is a lot going on. There is a lot \u2013 there's always a lot going on here, and I hope that never stops.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Fair enough. Thanks. Thanks for that color. And a follow-up question about the booking curve. Jason, you've given a lot of excellent color on the ways in which you're booked ahead at higher prices. But I was wondering \u2013 and maybe just splicing things too finely, but if you were to remove the effects of new hardware, which is a lot, I understand, would you still be booked ahead at higher prices?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yes, we would.","David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Jason, I want to ask you first about cash deployment for next year because your CapEx is decelerating a bit, you're guiding $2.6 billion for 2019. And on my math, I'm getting somewhere around $1 billion of free cash flow, and that's before taking on additional debt to maintain the target leverage. So my question is, should we expect all of that cash available to be returned in 2019? And just to follow up on that, I just want to confirm that when you do give full year guidance you don't plan on including any buybacks in the EPS. Is that correct?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah, so just starting off on the capital allocation front. As we've said in the past, we do look very much to return capital to shareholders. We have our leverage ratios of 3 to 3.5 times, as we talked about in terms of the target. And there \u2013 as you said, there is leverage opportunities for us to be within that target that will produce additional cash that's available to shareholders. So I think what you would continue to see is our CapEx profile is our best thinking at this point in time. And then outside of that, if there's opportunities to lever, we do believe in continuing to grow the dividend on a moderate basis and buyback shares opportunistically.","As it relates to, do we put buybacks in our guidance or not, it's not something I would comment on. There's a lot of factors that kind of go into what our guidance will be at a given point in time.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just to switch gears here, I think back to the demand side, I think I would just to try to ask this a little differently. In the past, you used to talk about a 2% to 4% yield growth as sort of your longer-term annual target. Excluding Silversea this year, you're doing about 3.5%. So for next year you're saying you're seeing robust demand, and I guess my question is excluding Silversea, excluding the Terminal, excluding the waterpark as you sit here today, is there any reason why we shouldn't feel good about 2% to 4%, that long-term target for next year, especially considering that you do have these tailwinds on the hardware side?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah, well, again, we're not going to begin to kind of comment on our yield guidance for next year. I think the 2% to 4% is, if you look at how our yields have grown over the past several years, that is a \u2013 kind of the average range of moderate yield growth. Certainly, these other items such as CocoCay and Perfect Day will improve our yield profile as well as increase our cost metrics. And that's kind of the way that I would look at it. So again, the environment for 2019, we're very happy based off of where things are today, looking at it on a rate and volume basis. But I wouldn't at this point in time because it's still early in the process to start kind of setting ranges for 2019.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","You got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Your line is open.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thanks. Good morning. I have one quick question on Silversea. It looks like there's a heavier impact to cost than benefit to the revenue side both in 3Q and 4Q, and I'm curious if there's anything timing-wise that allows that differential to reverse in the first half? And then going forward, as we think about the cost profile of Silversea and how that impacts Royal, do some of those costs sort of get better managed as they come onto Royal's platform, bringing their operating margin or EBITDA margin a little bit more close to yours? Thanks.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah, sure. So first, there's no impact on the third quarter because of the quarter lag, and since we closed on July 31, their August and September results will be the ones that hit onto the fourth quarter. And so, some of this is just math. I mean, obviously it's a much higher yielding product than our average, and that will improve our yield profile. But on the cost standpoint, because our average cost per APCD is about $100, Silversea's platform is much more inclusive and is much higher than our average. And so that's going to weigh on our cost metric disproportionately to how it will weigh on our yield metric because our yield metric is about twice as much as our cost metric.","So that's point one. Point two, definitely as time goes on, as we talked about, when we did the acquisition, that we thought that there was cost opportunities, efficiencies, them taking advantage of our supply chain, and some of those contracts and efficiencies and some of them are technology-related, take some time to work through. And we would think over a reasonable period of time, we will continue to implement those synergies into Silversea which will make that comp easier over time. But I would be less focused on \u2013 I mean, some of that will happen in 2019, but more of that will happen in 2020 and beyond.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","You got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Just a couple here. Jason, Richard, whoever wants to take this, the Eastern Med, we've seen folks like TUI start making some comments on their hotel side that they're seeing, and for Turkey comeback, we're seeing yourselves and others maybe add some itineraries in 2019 and maybe a few folks into early 2020. Just your thoughts, what you're seeing from your customer, travel agent demand base for the Eastern Med cranking back up? And then, Jason, any thoughts at this point here, the IMO 2020, where the forward curve is? How you anticipate that? And I know it's 2020, but given today, would you anticipate the impact to be flat? Neutral? Positive? And how has that changed your hedging approach?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Okay. So first on the Eastern Med side, we continue to monitor the situation in the Eastern Med. Obviously, Eastern Med currently and historically when there are even more ports that were attached to the Eastern Med definition was very attractive, and so we continue to watch, I would say consumer demand or interest, I would say caught more interest has perked up a little bit, but we're obviously making sure that experience can be sustainable before offering too much of the product or increasing what's available within the Eastern Mediterranean area.","As it relates to the IMO, our scrubber program has been very successful. We continue to roll it out onto our ships. Our mix of what we'll be able to burn via MGO versus low sulfur fuel still will be pretty much the same as it is today. And so our mix of fuel should pretty much be about the same.","Now as it relates to where the price is and hedging, et cetera, I would say that we'll see what happens with fuel prices, but we do have a bias to hedge a little bit more on the MGO side than on the IFO side because we'll be able to burn the lower sulfur fuel \u2013 I mean, we'll be able to burn the higher sulfur fuel because of the scrubbers, sorry.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So as you're skewing your historical hedge more to the MGO given the higher cost and potentially that going up and the other going down. Is that...","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","That's right. Even though \u2013 yeah \u2013 those curves today for all the fuel types are in backwardation.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. Last question. I know a lot of the focus here has been on 2019, so continuing in that vein, 2019, could you just maybe talk about a little of the puts and takes in the equity income line? TUI is the large part of that, obviously, but Pullmantur is folded into there. Just any puts and takes from that perspective, 2019 versus what we've seen in 2018?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah, I mean, I think in terms of the core drivers of the equity pickup line, which you said is TUI and which is Pullmantur, both those brands are doing well. TUI is doing exceptionally well and we continue to expect growth there in both of those brands. And so that will be something that will help us improve the equity pickup line in 2019. Outside of that, there are small puts and takes here and there, but those are probably the two \u2013 those two are definitely the biggest drivers.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So I think you've probably told us all you'd like to tell us in terms of the full year 2019, but maybe you can...","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","But you'll try again.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Yeah, well, I'm admittedly fishing a little bit here, but...","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Okay.","James Hardiman - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","...maybe talk about phasing a little bit. I mean, there's lots of puts and takes: geographic, hardware, drydocks, comparisons. My experience is it's better to get people where those now than in January when models are set. Should we generally be thinking about fairly sort of even earnings? Or are there reasons that you'd like to call out at this point that there might be some lumpiness?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Well, I would say once again, we're still in our operating plan process, so I wouldn't be in a position to start talking about significant ebbs and flows within earnings by quarter. I think the one thing I would say that's kind of more phased is that CocoCay or Perfect Day at CocoCay will be phasing in next year and so that will be one thing structurally I think that's really starting in May is when it really kind of comes online. So there will be some impact on the second quarter and beyond that will likely not be in the first quarter.","And then the other thing that I would just mention is when we do take delivery of Spectrum, it will take about 53 days or 54 days for the ship in the second quarter to go from Europe to China and that would be something that would weigh a little bit \u2013 it's a good thing on the earnings side, but it will weigh a little bit on yields and costs as we reposition the ship from Europe into China. Those would probably be the things that I would call out. Certainly when we get into January, we will help \u2013 focus on the cadences within quarters.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah, and, James, as we've said before, I do understand the desire to understand ahead of time the lumpiness and things that will tends to shift things between quarters. But one of the characteristics of our business is that things tend to come in sort of large blocks and some of those we can try and anticipate and help you all understand in the way Jason has just done, but a lot of it is either just flukes or just timing for various reasons.","And if we \u2013 I like to use the example of a drydock, if we have an opportunity to shift a drydock between doing it on March 30 or April 1, that could actually have a big change in the quarter, but we look at that as a minor decision and if we can save a few bucks by moving it a week or two in one direction, we'll do that. And I know that causes issues because in most companies you'll look at a flow and you assume everything carries out throughout the year. In our case, we really do try and manage on an annual basis. So I think we've tried to point out some of the things we already know that will cause lumpiness, but I think we ought to sort of be in full disclosure, telling you that there is a certain degree of lumpiness that we don't always predict.","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Hi, James.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah, just go ahead.","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","It's Michael. Sorry. I just have to jump in because there's only two minutes left and I was hoping in this hour I'd get an opportunity to talk about Perfect Day for a second because we keep mentioning it and I've had no opportunity to promote it to you all.","So I just want to really talk a little bit, because we're excited about Caribbean next year, for Royal Caribbean. Obviously we've got four Oasis-class ships and our Royal Amplified ships operating in the short cruise market and all of these ships will be going to Perfect Day after May of 2019 and we think it's the ultimate mix of thrill and chill with literally the tallest waterslide in North America, the largest wave pool in the Caribbean, 1,600 feet of zip line, the Oasis Lagoon, which is the largest freshwater pool in the Caribbean, cabana's, sports, you name it, a balloon ride that takes you 500 feet up into the sky. And what we're seeing in terms of interest for Perfect Day is really quite special, so we're kind of excited about the opening of Perfect Day. And seeing as we're running out of time, I just wanted to quickly promote that to you all.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Well done.","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Thank you very much, yeah.","Richard D. Fain - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","That's an answer to lumpiness. Yes.","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Yeah, there you go. Take that.","Jason T.

Could you provide a little bit of color on how your booking volumes have trended as you started to see those easier compares beginning in early September and maybe even the last few weeks where it might have a little bit more normalized on a year-over-year basis?","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Yeah, sure, Greg. I tried to hit this in my remarks but even if you look at it before the easier comp or you look at it today, our volumes are, whether it's load factor, whether it's rate, has been up year-over-year. So we've seen very positive trends even before it became an easier comparable for us.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. All right. And then if you look at Europe, I know you talked about east versus west but how about North American sourced business going to Europe versus European sourced business or European sourced customers cruising in Europe. How has that changed over the last few months or few quarters?","Michael Bayley - Royal Caribbean International","Hi. It's Michael. I mean we've seen very good demand for European product from the North American market and I think there's, to a certain degree, there has to be a relationship between the strength of the dollar and the weakness of the euro. So it's been a good couple of years in terms of North American demand for European products and it's also been good for the European sourcing as well. I think if we start to seeing a shift in currency, particularly with the euro and the sterling, then we'll probably see an improvement in demand out of the European markets as well. But it's been pretty good.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great.","Jason T. Liberty - Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Okay. Thanks, Greg.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Limited Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Mr. Jason Liberty, CFO. You may begin your conference.","Jason Liberty","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, President and Chief operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carol Cabezas, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our Investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.","Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filing and other disclosures.","Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.","Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview of the business. I will follow with a recap of our fourth quarter and full year results. I will then provide an update on the current booking environment and we\u2019ll end with full-year and first quarter guidance for 2016. We will then open up the call for your questions. Richard?","Richard Fain","Thank you Jason and good morning everybody. I'm really excited to have finally arrived here at our DOUBLE-DOUBLE year. We've worked long and hard to get here and I can't say enough about the commitment of our people that has brought us to this auspicious position. As you know the whole purpose of the DOUBLE-DOUBLE Program was to coalesce everyone's efforts to raise our performance to new heights. It's not easy to get 67,000 employees all pulling in the same direction towards the same goal, but this program has done that better than we dare hope. I'm not ready to break out the champagne until the year is over, but I am extremely grateful to each of the men and women who give their all every day. Now before I provide more color on 2017, I\u2019d like to take a moment to review just a few of some of the noteworthy items in 2016.","Our focus on the numbers for a moment as they illustrate the level of commitment and focus and our organization is placed on delivering consistent results in spite of unforeseen events that many times have clouded our forecast. First we shared an illustration with you on a last call, which is now complete.","On slide 2, you can see that our final results for each of the last five years are remarkably consistent with the guidance that we provided at the beginning of each year. I don't have to remind you that these last five years have not been easy. The period has been marked by significant geopolitical upheaval and significant foreign exchange challenges. I would be surprised if many of the companies that you follow can show a track record as steady or as resilient as this one. This doesn't mean that we are simply great predictors.","On the contrary, we suffered from a number of unexpected challenges. However, over this long period and with the help of our DOUBLE-DOUBLE Program our team has shown a very strong capability to make adjustments when the circumstances dictate. No one can forecast of future, but we hope you take comfort in our track record of predicting and\/or adjusting to overcome obstacles. As I look back on these years, I couldn't help but notice that we've reached several significant milestones that are worth sharing.","On slide 3 you can see the figures that I'm referring to we have tripled our earnings, delivered four consecutive years of double digit earnings growth, grown the dividends by five times and now exceeded $6 in earnings per share. I'm very proud of the employees, both ship or into our site, who have enabled our organization to thrive in this manner. Now these financial results are extraordinary, but we firmly believe that happy employees lead to happy guests and better yields. For that reason I would be remiss if I didn't point out that our employee engagement is at a record high as is their overall satisfaction working here. We remain steadfastly committed to making Royal Caribbean a great place to work so our formulaic for success continues to have a common denominator of happy employees.","The second part of the formula, happy guests has also improved. This past year our guests indicated the highest satisfaction levels on record. This is a result of many factors including our many innovations in vessel design and product delivery. But first and foremost, it is due to our fantastic crew, who impressed me every day.","But we now stand at a threshold of what promises to be a sensational year, so let's get to that. In our business the beginning of the year starts on a dynamic fashion with what we call WAVE Period. We define that as the first two months of the year and it's important both as a key booking period and as a harbinger of how the year might unfold. We\u2019re half way through wave and so far it's been quite strong.","Now you know we're driven by data and the sheer volume of that data is captured by our pricings and our revenue management system is daunting. Interpreting it is as much an art as it is a science. There always seem to be items that indicate one view or the other, but the total picture could probably be summarized by simply pointing out that our book position is better than any time in our history, with higher load factors and at higher rates. However, while we focus mainly on the science part of the process for our forecast, I also take some comfort from the tone or a vibe I get from the people who run our brands and how they interpret all that information.","While the numbers have been impressive, I would say that their feelings for 2017 have been even more so. Over the last few months, we have built a tone, which is as good or better than I can ever remember seeing it. Life is good. Long may it continue.","Now there are two important points I want to make as it relates to this forecast. First of all, this good booking picture is the basis for the 2017 yield guidance that we\u2019ve provided today and the guidance does take into account all the information we have available now. Secondly, over the last several years our book position has gotten better and better. As we've noted this year sets yet another record, but this process doesn't and won't continue forever. A good market helps drive more early bookings. But it is our revenue management team that have a great deal of control over it as well.","My sense is that the booking window has stretched as far as they will ever want it to do. Future years are likely to show the same or lower levels of bookings, as they work to optimize with broad pattern of when and at what level to take more bookings. It\u2019s going to depend on a large number of factors, but I don't expect to announce another record level of bookings a year from today.","In addition to industry-wide trends, there are several unique factors that are goosing our numbers this year. Our new ships Harmony of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas are beating the band the team continues to innovate in other ways too, including streaming WiFi and customized destination experiences. VOOM and Xcelerate continue to provide the best WiFi experience of sea, which is the not only a boon to our guest. But also allows unusual onboard digital enhancements. Our ship upgrades are really paying off. Since 2014, we have added over 1,000 over berths, 24 restaurants, 7 bars, refreshed our retail spaces fleet wide and added boutiques such as Kate Spade, Michael Kors and even Tiffany.","I won't go into all the other experiential enhancements we've made, but suffice it to say, that you no longer have to choose between playing in the water and watching a big screen movie on most of our ships. No one contributor though small has received quite a lot of attention and that is the approval to sail to Cuba. I admit adding Havana has generated super booking activity for those few lucky itineraries. But the scale is trivial representing less than 1% of our capacity. We are encouraged that future prospects remain positive, but it is time the impact on our financials is marginal and it will be quite some time before this is even remotely material.","Before I wrap up and hand it back to Jason, I want to touch on one other topic that I know you will not consider marginal by any means. For some time we have defined our three core financial objectives of improving shareholder returns, being an investment grade company and moderate growth. We continue following that path. Starting with shareholder returns, this is an area where we have made great strides and where we expect to continue. Besides a significant improvement in our financial results since 2012 we engraved dividends by five times and we have repurchased close to $750 million in shares.","While these actions are board level decisions, we expect the board will continue to focus on improving shareholder returns as a priority. We will continue to behave like an investment grade company, but as our free cash flow increases, it is reasonable to assume that we will focus more on that.","As the final item as you've seen from our new building orders, our growth trajectory has been balanced and remains in a similar range over the coming years. As I said at the beginning of my comments, this coming year is shaping up nicely. But I want to emphasize that the goals of our DOUBLE-DOUBLE Program are not and end in off themselves, but means to an end. Our goal was and is to push ourselves to reach and to maintain a powerful trajectory that helps 2017, but is also focused on 2018 and 2019 and beyond. You can see that we've already taken many steps that aren\u2019t so positive in the short-term, but buttress us for the longer term.","We will continue to make such trade-offs if they are in the best interest of our shareholders. I believe that the success of the DOUBLE-DOUBLE Program is not only the boost it has given us to-date. But the powerful focus it has given us that will continue to generate good returns in the future. There\u2019s a lot to look forward to and we are excited to see progress as the year unfolds.","With that, I get to turn it back over to Jason. Jason?","Jason Liberty","Thank you Richard. I will begin by taking you to our results for the fourth quarter. Unless, I state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant-currency basis. We have summarized our fourth quarter results on slide 4. For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $1.23 per share, which was $0.03 above our October guidance. This was driven primarily by better than expected costs and the outperformance of our joint ventures.","Net revenue yields were up 5.3%, which was below our October guidance. Softer close in pricing, combined with lower onboard retail sales, drove most of the yield in this for the quarter. While onboard revenue was slightly lower than expected, yields for the quarter were up 9.5%. costs were better than guidance for the quarter with net cruise cost excluding fuel down 1.9%. We are very proud of the continued effort of our team to identify cost efficiencies throughout the business.","I will now discuss full year results which we have summarized on slide 5. This year we set another record in earnings, exceeding the $1.3 billion mark, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $6.08, which exceeds the midpoint of both our initial guidance and latest guidance. As Richard mentioned, these record earnings also mark a fourth consecutive year of double digit percent growth in earnings.","Revenue yield increased 3.9% for the full year. As we look back on to 2016, strong demand from North American products, more than offset weakness in the Eastern Mediterranean and Shanghai. Beverage packaging, high speed internet and additional onboard revenue venues drove up a 7.8% year-over-year increase in ship order revenue. Our focus of effective cost management continue throughout 2016. Costs came in better than expected ending the year up 0.9%. One time launch costs associated with the deliveries of Ovation of the Seas and Harmony of the Seas combined with additional drydock days and investments in growth markets were key drivers of the year-over-year cost growth.","Now, I\u2019d like to update you of what we are seeing in a demand environment. Over the past three months, bookings have been well above last year's levels and as a result, we\u2019ve turned the year at a record book position. Our book load factors in APDs are nicely higher that same time last year, the booking window continues to extend and we have fewer stay rooms left to sell for the year. The WAVE Period is off to a strong start with bookings trending nicely higher than last year. While trends have been strong from our key sourcing regions, we are particularly encouraged by what we are seeing in North America.","Our full year capacity is decreasing by 2% due to the deconsolidation of Pullmantur with most of the decline occurring in Europe and Brazil. Our capacity is up in North America and is up slightly in the Asia Pacific region as we benefit from a full year of both Harmony of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas in each of these markets respectively.","North American products will represent close to 60% of our portfolio in 2017, while we are seeing strong trends across the group, Alaska continues to experience exceptional demand building on a record season in 2016. The Caribbean will account for close to 50% of our full year capacity, up from 2016, mainly due to a full year deployment of Harmony of the Seas and Celebrity Equinox in South Florida. Demand for the Caribbean has been quite strong with bookings trending well ahead of last year and nicely up pacing capacity growth.","At this point, our full year Caribbean load factors in APDs are higher than last year. The rate of capacity growth in the Asia Pacific region is slowing considerably in 2017 for both us and the industry. Our capacity will be up by 5% with the combination of China, Southeast Asia and Australia itineraries accounting for 21% of our total deployment. In China, our capacity is down because of the exit of Legend of the Seas and industry capacity is expected to be up approximately 20% compared to 100% in 2016. Overall, we are in a strong book position for the region, particularly in China and Australia with APDs up modestly for the region.","We have made several changes to our European deployment, resulting in an overall capacity reduction of 23%. While a portion of this decline is the result of the Pullmantur deconsolidation, we have also significantly reduced our deployment in the challenging Eastern Med, while maintaining the same capacity in the Western Med and slightly increasing our Northern European offerings. Demand for Europe sailings have been very strong thus far particularly from North America. We are now booked at a much higher load factors than last year in both the Mediterranean and Baltics and APDs are also up nicely even though we no longer have the high yielding Harmony of the Seas in Barcelona.","Now I\u2019d like to update you in the booking environment for the first quarter. Our overall capacity is up 1% year-over-year as the addition of Harmony of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas is offsetting the reduction associated with Pullmantur. Two-thirds of our Q1 inventories is in the Caribbean, 16% is in Australia and 12% is in China and Southeast Asia. The balance of our capacity is in several other markets, including Dubai in South America. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2016 was very strong with robust trends in the Caribbean and early Easter and our first winter season in China. Despite the challenging year-over-year comparable, our book position is currently higher than same time last year.","Now taking all this into account, if you turn to slide 6, you will see our guidance for 2017. As I just described, demand across all key market is trending positively, supporting a robust yield improvement in 2017. Net yields are expected be up in the range of 4% to 6%, which is our eighth consecutive year of yield growth. Our new builds Harmony of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas have been very well received in their respective markets and are significant contributors to the yield improvement in 2017. These two ships combined with further onboard packaging pre-cruise sales, streaming WiFi and enhanced store excursions are expected to help drive another year of strong onboard revenue performance.","Net cruise cost excluding fuel are expected to be flat for the year as the teams continue to identify further operational efficiencies. I wanted to provide some color on the expected cadence of yield and cost growth for the year. We anticipate higher yields and lower costs in the first half of the year. This is mainly driven by the timing of last year's new ship deliveries, the exit of older hardware and the timing of the deconsolidation of Pullmantur, which took place in the back half of 2016.","We anticipate fuel expense of $704 million for the year and we are 60% hedged. Since our last call, fuel prices have increased and the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen versus our basket of currencies. The combination of these two factors has resulted in a $0.10 per share headwind to our 2017 earnings. Based on current fuel prices, current exchange rates and interest rates, we expect another record breaking year with adjusted earnings per share between $6.90 and $7.10 in 2017. This represents our fifth consecutive year of double digit earnings growth.","Now I\u2019d like to walk you through our first quarter guidance on slide 7. Net yields are expected to be up in the range of 4.5% to 5% for the first quarter, supported by very strong demand for Harmony of the Seas in the Caribbean and Ovation of the Seas in Australia. This improvement, which is in part driven by the deconsolidation of Pullmantur is particularly noteworthy considering a very high bar set last year, but we had a 7% yield improvement during the first quarter. Net cruise cost excluding fuel are expected to be down approximately 4.5% for the quarter. Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be approximately $0.90.","With that I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix ","Jason, I have a couple of questions for you. The first one is you gave us a lot of detail about your position by region. Clearly North American demand is higher year-over-year kind of recovering from terrible host of terrorist events last year. Just wondering as you put together your guidance and you think about 2017, how did you think about Europe, particularly North American demand for Europe.","Jason Liberty","Sure, so I think we always talk about different kind of waves of demand and really even on the last call we talked specifically about seeing strong demand overall. But a lot of that was mainly driven by North America as they looking in that typical window when they started to book for the summer, as well as for the first half of the year. Now going into this, you still have a lot of strong North American demand is what we be overall see is a consistent pattern, actually an elevated pattern over the past three months for North American demand and of course a lot of that demand is specific for Europe as well as, partially to Caribbean and Alaska and so forth.","Felicia Hendrix","So, I guess my question was really though getting to given the sensitivity of the consumers to events in Europe or wherever they may be, as you sorted out the full year. Did you kind of state that into your consideration despite the strength that you're seeing right now?","Jason Liberty","Well, we never build the forecast for perfection, I mean there are events that happened throughout the period, but what was in our consideration set is really, what is our book position on both the rate and volume basis and then also looking at different market dynamics in terms of what\u2019s happening in internal pricing and overall demand, I guess, taken into consideration in terms of what we expect to take place in a product like Europe. As I said those demand trends have been quite positive.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then just moving, you gave us a very strong commentary on the Caribbean and how that\u2019s kind of coming together for this year. That said we do get a lot of investor questions on capacity growth and with the Caribbean up mid-single digits in 2017 over some are level in 2016 and within the quarters, there\u2019s some quarters that are growing nicely. Despite your booking position now, can you talk to us about how comfortable you are that the supply in the Caribbean won't ultimately become an issue?","Jason Liberty","I think we have, obviously we have very good visibility on what the capacity increases are going to be by quarter and by the way the increase in 2017 is a little bit higher than what the increase in the Caribbean was in 2016 past. And I think the way that we look at it is we have an opportunity to get ahead of that and we\u2019ve gone ahead of that and that's kind of based on the commentary of us being ahead on both the rate and volume basis overall as well as, for the product of the Caribbean.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Final question just Cuba is small part of your business, but given that current administration is of the agreements that you have, Cuba could be a risk.","Michael Bayley ","Hi Felicia, it's Michael. Yeah, I mean, obviously we're used to \u2013 we do business all around the world and we flex as the dynamics change. So we've got a couple - a few sailings open to Cuba at the moment, which is doing very well and we\u2019ve got more coming and we'll just adapt to what comes towards us. ","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, thank you so much.","Michael Bayley ","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Steve Wieczynski from Stifel.","Steve Wieczynski","So first question I guess, Jason, it\u2019s probably for you, we've got some questions about the fourth quarter close in pricing issues and I know you tried to explain that a little bit in your prepared remarks. But can you maybe dig into that a little bit more, I know you called out some softer retail sales and maybe what drove that and has that reversed in 2017? Is there something else that we\u2019re not thinking about, did you guys, basically try to hold price a little bit better than what you've done in the past?","Jason Liberty","Yeah sure. Well, I mean, first to start off is the overall revenue in this year was, but we were talking about $8 million or $9 million on a very large number. So and this year is really small and it's not really material. Close in demand I think you've seen this before some quarters, close in is better than we expected and sometimes it's as we expected and sometimes it\u2019s a little bit little bit softer. We did see a little bit of further challenges with our short product as it relates to Empress, as we have rolled that out in a smaller period of time in terms of the days to be able to book it.","Also what we saw in the quarter, which I think is also in our - is kind of baked into our commentary about 2017 and the first quarter is we saw kind of a beginning of a shift in focus from Q4 and into 2017. Then the other thing before I kind of just talk about retail for a second is we\u2019ve also instituted, as you know last year this price integrity program and what we're now willing to do is really sacrifice more price in a significant way in order to deal with volumes and we think that is helping us and that's also helping us build a better book of business. The one comment I would say on the retail side the holiday sailings were a little bit awkward in terms of this time of the year and so the mix in guests were a little bit different. I think that resulted in and lower retail and also I mean this has been a little bit of a consistent trend as we see more and more people trading stuff i.e. retail for experiences and we typically see areas like short excursion and beverage and so forth tick up and retail has been a little bit more challenging.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay, got you. Then second question, it\u2019s a two part bigger picture question. I know you guys are going to say that, we still have 11 months until in the DOUBLE-DOUBLE Program is behind you. But you can you help us start to think about maybe what comes post-DOUBLE-DOUBLE, if anything, if you would even that? Then the second part of that question is backwards looking. I mean, when DOUBLE-DOUBLE was introduced in 2014 what did surprise meaning, what did you get wrong with your forecasting? And that may not be saying the right way, but what areas did you, so much underestimate and then overestimate as well.","Richard Fain","Hi, Steve, this is Richard. With respect to come the DOUBLE-DOUBLE, I\u2019ll take the second part of the question. First, I think overall it I think worked out very well for us. I think the thing that perhaps we underestimated on the positive side was just how well the organization would respond to the push and how that really lead to everybody moving in the same way and that's been very effective. So I think that\u2019s helped us on the positive side. I think the thing that's been the biggest problem for us may surprise many, but the biggest has been foreign exchange, if we had the same exchange rates today that we had then, our bottom line would be higher by well more than, by close to, in fact, well more than $400 million, that is one hell of an unexpected hit.","The positives on fuel offset a little less than half of that, but to have that kind of an FX change that\u2019s unquestionably been the biggest negative throughout. With respect to what comes next, I think we are still the maniacal focused on this and I think, I would to our people who are focused on this and do this whole process of the service by talking about what's next. I think there is a lot of people look at the DOUBLE-DOUBLE and say well, that's been great, why don't you just replicate that or clone it in some way, I think that's unlikely. But I think at this point, we aren't done yet, we\u2019re still focusing on it and I would really like to continue to focus on just the DOUBLE-DOUBLE.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay. Great. Thank guys. Thanks for that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley","Thanks. Two questions. One is, can you give a sense of how much share repurchases factored into your 2017 EPS guidance? Then I also do you have a question on the 2017 outlook and it\u2019s kind of tying it to understanding the Q4. You mentioned some of the closer end was tied to the short product, the Empress and that was kind of specific to last minute changes in the itinerary there. Are you sort of factoring in any kind of close in softer or it really was just that short product on the Empress. You mentioned holding price and \u2013 but your occupancy I think was up like 250 basis points. So it doesn't seem apparent if there were more cabins empty to preserve price or just sort of if you could help us how to think about what happened there with the close and in the end. Thank you.","Jason Liberty","Sure. So just to take the repurchase side of it. Obviously, as Richard mentioned in his remarks, share repurchase is something that would be contemplated by the board, and would need to be approved by the board into our forecasts, don't contemplate decisions of the board hasn\u2019t taken yet, so hopefully that answers the question on share repurchase. As it relates on 2017 outlook and how that rolls forward for the fourth quarter. One on the occupancy side, the important thing to remember is the deconsolidation of Pullmantur is a factor and an improvement on the occupancy aside. Just on average because the shift at operating Pullmantur have very few thirds and fourths that are available on those vessels.","Empress as we said was a component of that and I think that - I wouldn\u2019t read too much into \u2013 and again we\u2019re talking about some really small numbers, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into what we saw close in. I do think Empress, I do think there were some awkward, the holiday sailings were a little bit awkward, and yeah, I do think that the consumer as well as, the trade really kind of began to focus their attention and obviously in a very serious way based on for the elevated levels we've been seeing for 2017 on the fourth picture.","Robin Farley","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Jason Liberty","Thanks Robin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim Conder","Thank you and congrats to the whole team, Richard. A couple of things if I may, a little bit of updated color or thoughts, I know it hasn\u2019t changed materially, but just on global industry capacity. I know some folks are still concerned about that, as you see the gross capacity versus the net capacity for the industry and for yourself looking out through, let's just say 2021. Then Jason you gave us a little bit of color on 2017 cadence, just may be a little bit more Pullmantur benefits in the front half, I think Ovation and Harmony. But then I think you get another TUI ship and a TUI JV, but maybe have a little more difficult cost compares in the back half. So just maybe a little bit of more there. Then finally Richard or whoever wants to take this on technology. We\u2019re seeing some accelerated adoption and enhancements of data analytics, CRM both in the cruise industry and theme park industry. Can you kind of just recap for us where you are, what you\u2019ve implemented over the last couple of years? Maybe what we can see in 2017 and beyond from oil or your thoughts on the industry in particular?","Jason Liberty","Well, thanks Tim. I think first on the industry side, I think we see, industry capacity during the period of time that you're talking about growing at about 5% or a little bit south of that we\u2019re closer to 4% over that period of time and that's on a gross basis. But at least for us, for example we've been selling about a ship a year, a ship every other year and as we talked about before. I mean, as shift to age and we now have ships going into more the 30 plus year category, we do think that there will be opportunity for the gross number to be reduced, as retirements come into play.","Of course, most of our ships that we have sold are going into markets in which we don't \u2013 or segments that we don't directly compete in. On the cadence side for the year, and as I said most of our yield in our cost benefit is front loaded this year. You were correct that we do take delivery of another main ship vessel, for three cruises, which does fantastically well. I think to your point in terms of cadence on, I think fourth quarter has a tougher comp on both the yield, as well as, on a cost perspective and so like I said, I think that \u2013 what you\u2019ll see is \u2013 obviously the guidance on the first quarter and in Q2 will be at an elevated level. Q3 is probably something similar or around the range where you would see in Q1 and Q4 and probably be a little bit lower. Again, that's just based off of the comps.","Richard Fain","Maybe I\u2019ll takes the question on technology as you've heard me say before I think this is a very appropriate topic, you\u2019ve heard me say that I think the pace of exchange that we're finding in our industry and then the world in general is simply slower today then we will ever see again. We need to reflect that in what we're doing. Technology can be used to help attack what is really our biggest single problem, which is that not enough people understand about cruising anything we can do to make the experience better and easier, particularly easier for our guests and for the people who haven't yet been our guest is very helpful. Obviously the question is quite apt in light of Carnival's announcement earlier this year, I view that as really a very positive thing for our industry. It\u2019s a terrific roll-out and got a lot of publicity, which I think again inures to the benefit of all of us.","As you mentioned we started a project with what we call our WOWbands a couple of years ago. That's been extremely effective in simplifying the process for our guests. But it's also obvious that the technology has improved a lot in the last two years and what we can all do today is much better than we could have two years ago. So I think you will continue to see us and I hope the rest of the industry continue to move forward with that. We call our internal project Excalibur. But we would expect to be coming out this summer with a new and upgraded new app that does reflect the technologies that are available today. Over this next year we would expect to roll this out to them 6 to 11 new vessels.","Then the next year we would expect to be rolling it out at a rate of one to two a month over the period. But I remember at the time that we ruled out WOWbands Lisa Lutoff-Perlo\u2019s comment was we want to give people their first day back. I think that's really a very good way to look at it. More that we can do to ease that process, not only makes it more comfortable for them, but gives them the time to do the other stuff and one of the benefits is not only more on ticket revenue, but also on the onboard revenue as we facilitate those types of processes. So I think this is a trend that's happening in our industry, but it\u2019s happening throughout industry and I think it will enhance the cruise experience and therefore be good for all of us.","Tim Conder","Okay. Great. Thank you both for all the color. Much appreciated.","Operator","And your next audio question comes from the line of Harry Curtis from Nomura Instinet.","Harry Curtis","Hi, good morning. Richard going back to a comment that you just made about the booking windows being stretched about as far as it can go. Can you give a little bit more color on that comment? Are there technical reasons for that? To what degree if at all, might it limit upside and pricing power in future periods?","Richard Fain","Thanks Harry. I appreciate the question because I think it's helpful to understand, it\u2019s not a question that it's limited. I don't think it limits our capability in future. On the contrary, I think that's a reflection of how strong we think the situation is and will be. Really what happens is if we take too many bookings today, it\u2019s hard to imagine that. But if you take too many bookings today, what it really means is that somebody who decides a month from today that she or he wants to take a cruise. And frankly is willing to pay more, it's simply not available. So our revenue management people are really and I do think there is the best around and there and we\u2019re quite sophisticated in this, but depending on the time and depending on the circumstances you don't want to take too few bookings.","But taking too many is just as bad as thinking too few and it's getting that balance, the price integrity program has probably extended out more to take earlier. But in any given time you look at the pattern of one they're coming. When people are calling the book and you want to get it right, not just the most you can get. So if we feel that we're taking too many bookings at a point in time, we will raise our pricing. Obviously that will lower the pace of bookings. I think it's important for people to understand that while obviously more bookings is a good thing, we actually have a great deal of discretion. Our revenue management people have a great deal of control over that pace. So I think we just feel in general that probably we're asked at the point where it shouldn't be much faster than it has been. But of course, look at the circumstances at the time and it could well be different year from now.","Harry Curtis","That's interesting and follow-up for Jason on China. You guys mentioned that both \u2013 that your pricing in bookings are encouraging there. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color or break out the difference between the booking levels amongst your travel agents versus where they may be booked because there tends to be a difference or can be a difference?","Michael Bayley ","Harry, it's Michael, I have to congratulate you its 43 minutes into the call and that\u2019s our first China question, so that's quite unusual. Yeah, I think we\u2019ve said in the past that China very much it\u2019s a developmental market. We've been in the market for a number of years, we've been working on the distribution and certainly we've been accelerating our investments in that distribution over the past couple of years. This year in 2017 we see a different kind of picture as it relates to capacity in each of the regional markets. So if you recall last year, it was a big year for capacity overall in China and certainly in Shanghai, which was about 60% of the overall China market. There was as close to 100% increase in capacity.","This year that number is close to flat, so it's a different type of environment. We've worked with our major distributors in terms of helping them develop the cadence of their marketing and the way they go-to-markets and their selling techniques in terms of the cruise product. We've also worked on opening up the other channels just as we have channels in the European and American markets and we\u2019ve put a lot of time and energy into that. So we're seeing good traction in terms of these channels that we\u2019re opening and we\u2019re seeing good traction with our major wholesalers in terms of where they are with their bookings for 2017. So I think it was Jason that commented earlier when we look at our 2017 position versus 2016 we\u2019re in a significantly better place.","Harry Curtis","Very good. Thanks guys.","Michael Bayley ","Thank you.","Operator","And you next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein.","David Beckel","Hey, thanks a lot. For my first question I was wondering if I could dig in a little bit on pricing in Asia by region mentioned that APDs are up modestly. Could you give us a little bit better color in terms of what that looks like in China, Australia and the rest of Asia? Then second question I have relates, it\u2019s a bit bigger picture, I guess, just what trends you saw in 2016 with respect to the customer mix in North America, specifically. Was there any notable trend in the mix of repeat versus new to cruise versus new to brand?","Richard Fain","On the Asia Pac question, we don't break it down by market, but what I would tell you is that that the trend that we talked about in terms of the book position and rate and volume is a similar description of what's happening, but especially in Australia and China.","Jason Liberty","Hi, David, on the second question with regards to the customer mix in North America we saw our change in 2016 and we\u2019re accelerating that change in 2017 in terms of new to cruise, first to cruise. So we\u2019ve put a lot of our time and energy and resources and growing that segment of the market and we've seen. For the first time in 2016 we saw a really positive uptick in the first to cruise to both the Royal brand and the Celebrity brand. And in 2017 we continue to see that uptick in terms of new to cruise. A lot of that\u2019s supported by changes that are occurring in our marketing strategies, both in terms of how we go traditionally to market, but also a shift more into digital marketing and we've had some success with that.","David Beckel","Thanks so much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jason, I think you said Europe is booked ahead on rate and volume and this time last year it was generally prior to the step down that we saw in demand just from all the concerns on terrorism. So does that mean Europe has fully recovered or do you feel booking activity is still not as strong as where it was before the event?","Jason Liberty","Well, I think it's tough to say especially relative to last year because don't forget the Paris attack that happened in the fourth quarter of 2015. I think that demand from North America has certainly rebounded, I don't know if I would describe it as rebounded to how strong it was in the 2014 and 2015 timeframe. But clearly we see strong demand coming from North America, we see very good demand also coming from Europe. I think the other component to that is we\u2019ve got about half of the capacity that we had last year in the Eastern Mediterranean and it seems to be very good demand, obviously, that itineraries are more West than they were East before and the other itineraries like the Western Med and the Baltics, which did well last year are brushing an uptick in demand from North America there.","Jared Shojaian","Okay Jason. And then just switching gears here on this potential cash deployment. Is 3.75 times net debt-to-EBITDA is that the starting point? If so I mean, you're almost there that's going to leave a lot of discretionary cash for buyback is that the way that we should think about that? I know you said it\u2019s a board decision, but how should we think about the timing here? Thanks.","Jason Liberty","Yeah, well I mean in terms of the provided threshold 3.75 times debt to EBITDA is of the threshold for investment grade as well as to the metrics themselves. Our goal is to be a solid investment grade credit, so I would that\u2019s probably somewhere in the range of 3 times to 3.5 times debt-to-EBITDA and I think we\u2019re certainly looking to balance, getting to become an investment grade credit, as well as, investing moderately in our growth and improving shareholder return. So keeping that balance is important, but also acting like an investment company as Richard mentioned is critical, and we will likely be at that 3.75 threshold at the end of the quarter and then we would obviously, be considering other action as it relates to cash.","Jared Shojaian","Okay, thank you and if I could sneak one, quick one in real quick. You gave guidance on most line items, what about the JV income. Is there anything that's going to offset that number in the non-op line?","Jason Liberty","Well, I think we\u2019ve said in the past actually, it\u2019s been said by our partner, is on average, as a ship, gets added on, they typically add about $20 million to $25 million in income each year that the ship comes on for full year for each of us, that\u2019s our show [ph].","Jared Shojaian","Okay. Thank you.","Jason Liberty","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush Securities.","James Hardiman","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Harry broke the ice on China, so I'm going to stay that down that path. You've given us a number bread crumbs with respect to the Chinese market. A year ago I think on this call you basically said the Chinese yields were going to be down low single digits. I guess my question is should we come away from this call thinking that Chinese yields are likely to be up this year? Or is it too early to really say definitively just given how late in the year a lot of itineraries look out.","Richard Fain","Okay, well I think, I've never heard our commentary described as bread crumbs, so that\u2019s good. So, thank you. I think that the way that you should take is that we are in good position for China. I do think to your comment that it is a little bit too early to provide specific guidance to what we believe our China yields will be. But we are encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in the booking environment and we\u2019re also encouraged as Michael noted in terms of the progress we've been making in diversifying our distribution.","James Hardiman","Got it. And then I was hoping you could just give us maybe a little bit more color on how close in pricing trended over the course of the fourth quarter. It seems to me that you know there were a couple of major events in the fourth quarter, A; you had the election, which was you know smack dab in the middle of the quarter. B; you had the opening up of Cuba officially and I know you say Cuba was not going to be very material for you. But it seems like the uncertainty around Empress in the lead up to that decision was very material. So I guess, using those is sort of key points. How should we think about how that close in price trended over the course of the quarter?","Jason Liberty","Obviously, on the quarter the first month, it was at the end of the month that we gave guidance, since we had a pretty good sense of the month of October. I think as we got into the November around the election time. I think that again we saw people really kind of focus their plans on to 2017. I think it was August when we actually put out the deployment for Empress for the fourth quarter. And so I think that again, that was a little bit more of a challenge than we had expected it to be. But again I would really chalk it up more to people focusing more on the following year. I do want to stress that every quarter, there\u2019s a little bit of a different story on the close in pricing side and I think that in combination with our price integrity program, we can sometimes make that a little bit less predictable. But again, I mean, there were several quarters last year where close in pricing was stronger than we expected and in the fourth quarter it was a little bit softer than we expected and the difference is really insignificant.","James Hardiman","Maybe just a quick follow-up there. So again Cuba is not very material for you guys in 2016 or not material at all or 2017 I should say. But Empress can you quantify how much of an issue Empress was to your bottom line? Do you get that back in 2017?","Jason Liberty","Well, I don't have the specific number and we don\u2019t talk about what it is on a ship basis. I mean, it was a more challenging vessel for us in 2016, just because ship was in drydock for an extended period of time. We kept delaying the deployment of the ship, hoping that we were going to get the approvals for Cuba. And as we mentioned on our last call, there were very strong signals that we were. So I think that certainly as we look into 2017, we have the proper windows in periods of time to sell and market the product and we don't expect there to be a few negative impact as it relates to Empress in 2017 in terms of what we saw in 2016.","James Hardiman","Got it. Thanks.","Jason Liberty","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gregory Badishkanian from Citi.","Gregory Badishkanian","Two questions. The first just on China. What do you attribute to the improved outlook relative to last year that in your answer to James. How much of it is due to capacity growth slowing?","Michael Bayley ","Hi, Greg, it's Michael. I think like many things its many factors. Certainly capacity in Shanghai is a contributing factor because if you recall we had big increase in 2016 and another increase in 2015. So I think there was a little bit of an issue with the distribution being able to absorb that kind of capacity in an emerging market, so the capacity is helpful. And then the other element was if you recall back in 2015 there were a couple of knocks in terms of MERS.","And then we had those particularly difficult typhoons, which really did impact the wholesalers, so I think they were a little shy. So I think those factors and then, of course, as I have mentioned earlier we\u2019ve really invested in building out all of the channels. So I think it's all of those factors coming together, better stability, less capacity and evolving, maturing market. Certainly not mature obviously, but maturing in terms of the relationship between the wholesalers, distributors and our company and the investment we\u2019re putting in the market in terms of developing these channels.","Gregory Badishkanian","Okay, thank you. And then just in terms of the shrink of North American traveling around Europe, taking cruises in Europe. How long do we see [indiscernible] easy comparison, how much do you think the underlying trends is actually improved to drive that strength?","Michael Bayley ","Greg, I think, again I think it's a couple of things, it does. Jason had mentioned earlier capacity is down in Europe and down in Eastern Med, so that's been one of the driving factors. The dollar is strong against the euro, so I think people are more interested in going to Europe because they get more for their vacation dollar. People, sort of incredibly popular destination with or without cruise and I think we're seeing some of that. Then also I think there's just more consumer confidence, certainly in Q4 where we saw the stock market increasing nicely. I think we've seen really uptick in cadence in terms of the bookings of North Americans wanting to go to Europe. So I think all of those factors come together and has contributed to what we\u2019re seeing in with the European bookings.","Gregory Badishkanian","Thanks very much.","Jason Liberty","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infiniti Research.","Assia Georgieva","The first one with Pullmantur making a little bit more difficult as we saw just now even on occupancy the comparisons we\u2019re looking at. Jason, could you give us a little more detail as to what organic growth would have been in Q4 and Q1? Also if we can exclude the very positive impact from Ovation and Harmony that we're seeing?","Jason Liberty","Well, as it relates to the Pullmantur and itself organically for Q4, it was worth about 275 basis points of the yield growth in the fourth quarter. In Q1, we expect it to be about 225 basis points as relates to yield. There\u2019s a little bit of a headwind on the cost side, but it's 20 basis points or 30 basis points. On the hardware side as we kind of look into 2017, certainly Harmony and Ovation drive significant yield premium and that minus Legend coming out, helps us by 125 basis points to 130 basis points.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. Great. That is very helpful. My last question, at the time of the prior call, you were 94% book, if I recall correctly. For Q1 at this point, I imagine it's a number that\u2019s just slightly lower than that?","Jason Liberty","Well, I think we said that we\u2019re booked in a better position on both rate and volume. For the year, we\u2019ve said it for the quarter and we are in a better position than we were in Q4.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. Great. Thank you Jason.","Jason Liberty","Thank you Assia.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jamie Rollo from Morgan Stanley.","Jamie Rollo","Thanks. Jamie Rollo from Morgan Stanley. Just following up from the last quarter, the hardware mix benefit of 125 basis points. Was that the full year or the sort of an anniversary impact for the first five months please?","Jason Liberty","No, that's for the full year Jamie.","Jamie Rollo","So that implied about 250 basis points for Q1 and Pullmantur you said was 225 for Q1, so does that imply underlying yield of broadly flat year-on-year on basically a tough comp?","Jason Liberty","It\u2019s a little bit lower in Q1. Like-for-like for the year is about 250 basis points.","Jamie Rollo","Okay. Then just a quick one on cost, the statement talks about benefit from setting Legend. Is that in that cruise or EPS numbers or will that be separated out please.","Jason Liberty","No. That is in the net cruise cost and the main benefit of it is it's less efficient vessel to operate. But there\u2019s several other things driving cost benefits in 2017 one of that is the exit of Legend.","Jamie Rollo","No, I meant, is the capital gain relative on a benefit to average cruise costs?","Jason Liberty","Yeah, there is a small gain on it, but it's not a material number.","Jamie Rollo","Okay. Thanks.","Jason Liberty","Thanks, Jamie. Okay. Well, thank you for your assistance Kwashia with the call today and we will thank you for your participation and interest in the company. Carol will be available for any follow-ups you might have and I wish you all a great day.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, as Mr. Liberty stated, that does concludes today\u2019 conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Jason Liberty, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason Liberty","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and, Carol Cabezas, our new Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides which have been posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com. Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide.","During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.","Richard will begin by providing an overview of the business. I will follow with a recap of our third quarter results, provide an update on the current booking environment and provide our early thoughts on 2016. I will close with guidance for the full year and fourth quarter. We will then open the call for your questions. Richard?","Richard Fain","Thank you, Jason, and good morning everybody. What Jason didn\u2019t mention was that Laura Hodges is also in the room. And most of you know Laura is the outgoing Head of Investor Relations and I think we should thank her for what she has done over this period and wish her well as she takes Royal Caribbean to new heights. I think Carol should also know that we are expecting the share price to move as much during her tenure as it has during Laura\u2019s. So no pressure, but we are looking for good things.","Turning back to the substance here. It\u2019s only appropriate that I begin with talking about the Double-Double. As I assume you all know and I hope you will know that\u2019s the name we gave to our program designed to achieve double-digit ROIC and the doubling of our 2014 earnings by 2017. That program continues in earnest and our performance this year allows us to move into 2016 confidently on track to the Double-Double.","In fact, it looks like we are hitting one interesting milestone this year which none of us paid any attention to before. When we set out on this path, our focus was on 2017, but I was very pleased when somebody pointed out to me that our new forecast for 2015 means we will be exactly twice our 2013 profit at the end of this year. It\u2019s exciting to see that we are about to double our profitability in just two years from $2.40 to $4.80. I like a good omen, and this one suits me just fine.","It\u2019s remarkable to me that on each of our three key metrics we are now back to at a minimum our best guidance of the year. On the yield front, we are back to the midpoint of our January guidance of approximately 3.5%. On the cost front, we\u2019ve gone from up 1% or better to down zero to 1%.","And on the earnings front, we are $0.05 above the midpoint of our January guidance of $4.75. All this is further proof of our ability to manage our business on an annual basis despite the fluctuations between quarters as well as our commitment to delivering bottom line results for our shareholders. This type of performance doesn\u2019t come easy, especially in our highly complex business, and this year is no different.","The languishing economies in Latin America, the MERS epidemic in Korea, typhoons and stock market volatility in China have all presented us with our share of headwinds, however, a strong North American consumer has provided us a solid base, momentum in the Caribbean is going strong and our new buildings continue to perform exceptionally well on every measure. We have a lot to be excited about.","Given that the economic struggles in Latin America are having a profound effect on the Pullmantur brand and that China is our fastest growing market, I\u2019d like to spend a bit of time expanding on both of these topics.","First, it\u2019s clear that our Latin American strategy for Pullmantur hit a brick wall when the economies of our key local markets all but collapsed. Brazil, which is our most important Latin America source market, has seen substantial economic turmoil as well as substantial political turmoil. Just last quarter, the Brazilian Real dropped by 22% against the dollar.","This type of precipitous decline dashed our hopes and plans for Pullmantur in Latin America and has triggered the non-cash impairment charge of almost $400 billion.","Taking such a large write down is always painful, and no one likes to ignore at something like this, but it\u2019s also true that every cloud has a silver lining. In this case, the write down enables us to put this issue behind us and focus Pullmantur on a simpler and more attractive proposition catering to its Spanish base. I believe that we can now move forward with a more positive attitude that enables a more positive outlook.","Shifting to the other side of the globe, we have a lot to talk about with respect to China. As you know, we\u2019ve made a real effort over a number of years to establish our position and our reputation in the growing Chinese market. That effort has been very successful for us and we are particularly proud of the strong brand position we\u2019ve achieved there. It\u2019s been a major learning experience and not an easy one. But fortunately the market has been very receptive to our product and to our message. This has enabled us to accomplish two things, expand the size of our Chinese deployment and expand the seasonality of that deployment. We now have Quantum of the Seas doing China sailings year round, and while off peak sailings will still trade above the normal fleet average, they will not trade as high as the peak summer China sailings. That is really no different than in any other market around the world.","In addition, Legend of the Seas will have sailings home porting out of secondary cities like Tianjin and Qingdao, that have lower costs, but most likely not drive as high of APDs as Quantum does out of Shanghai or that Ovation will out of Tianjin. These mix changes don\u2019t alter the fact that China and the growth of the Asia Pacific region has and will continue to be yield accretive for the brand overall.","Now as we look specifically into 2016, we are encouraged by what we see. As previously noted, we have a higher percentage booked and at higher prices than ever before in our history. And we take delivery of two of the industry\u2019s most acclaimed ships in the second quarter, Harmony of the Seas, which is the third Oasis Class Ship and Ovation of the Seas which is the third Quantum Class Ships.","All of this provides a very nice tailwind to earnings, especially for the back half of next year. I would emphasize that booking so much, so early, is not only an indication of the strength of the market, it also goes hand in hand with our price integrity policy. As you know that policy is designed to give our guests and our travel partners more comfort that when they book a cruise with us, we won\u2019t be dropping the price of that same cruise during the last few days before the ship sails.","We believe that only clear, unambiguous guidelines work. If we can\u2019t measure it, we can\u2019t properly implement it. In this case, it\u2019s both the clarity and the absoluteness of our program that makes it so powerful for our customer and for our internal revenue managers. Depending on the itinerary, we have internally banned any new discounts in the U.S. and the Canada in the last 10, 20, 30 or 40 days before the cruise starts.","The program has been in place for seven months or so, and we have not granted a single exception to the policy. I acknowledge it has cost us a bit and is costing us a bit this year in revenue, and some cabins have gone empty which could have been filled with dramatic last minute deals, but we stood firm and we have made zero exceptions. We believe our guests and our travel partners are beginning to respond as we had hoped they would and we are sticking with the program.","We still expect it will cost us a bit more in 2016, but the long run benefit in guest satisfaction, in travel agent support and in bottom line results will pay handsome dividends in the long run. In fact, we feel sufficiently positive about the program that recently we extended it to the U.K. and Irish markets, so we are now applying the same policies about no new last minute discounts in Britain and Ireland that we have been applying in the U.S. and Canada.","Now lastly before I turn the mike back to Jason, I would just touch on our share repurchase program that we included in our release. We\u2019ve previously responded to questions about such a program by saying that it would be a reasonable consideration as we get into the time when we are more comfortable about free cash flow generation. It\u2019s a gratifying sign of progress that our board has now approved such a program at this time.","With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn it back to Jason. Jason?","Jason Liberty","Thank you, Richard. I will begin by taking you through our results for the third quarter. Unless I state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency basis. We have summarized our third quarter results on slide two.","For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $2.84 per share which was $0.14 above our guidance. Third quarter net revenue yields were up 5.1% year-over-year which was approximately 130 basis points better than the midpoint of our previous guidance.","The out performance was driven by strong close-in pricing for the Caribbean and Europe as well as strong on-board revenue on our Asia itineraries. Yields were up year-over-year on all key products except for Latin America where we saw a weak demand at low price points. On board revenues did not disappoint. We achieved 10% growth year-over-year driven by improvements in beverage, retail sales and demand for Boom, the fastest internet at sea.","Costs were better than expected for the quarter with net cruise cost excluding fuel down 1.8% versus guidance of down 1.5% to 1%. The $0.02 beat and cost is mainly due to timing. Also in the third quarter we recorded non-cash impairment charge of $399 million associated with Pullmantur\u2019s goodwill, trade mark and trade names and a reduction in the fair value of select vessels in the Pullmantur fleet.","Given the further deterioration of the economies and currencies in Latin America, management has shifted strategy and will be rightsizing the Pullmantur brand to better align supply with demand and to refocus on their core market of Spain. To that end, the Pullmantur Empress will transition back to the Royal Caribbean International fleet in early 2016 and after an extensive dry dock will begin sailing as the Empress of the Seas in the spring of 2016.","As the Pullmantur management team works through their new strategy, we expect restructuring and related charges in the range of $5 million to $10 million that will be recorded in future quarters. Also, we plan to eliminate Pullmantur\u2019s two month lag in the first quarter of 2016. This change will result in a 14-month reporting period for Pullmantur next year and did not represent a material impact of full year earnings.","For simplification and comparative purposes, we will be excluding all these adjustments from our key statistics. Now I would like to update you on what we are seeing in the demand environment. For the balance of 2015 and provide early insight into 2016.","The fourth quarter is shaping up significantly better than last year from both an APD and load factor perspective and we are currently 95% booked for the quarter. Our Caribbean sailings account for 47% of our Q4 capacity and are turning much more favourably than at this point last year. We expect the Caribbean to generate mid to high single digit yield improvements in Q4.","Asia Pacific itineraries account for 20% of fourth quarter capacity and for the first time we have a ship in China throughout the winter season. Quantum of the Seas has been generating superior yields as continuing to contribute to our overall yield growth in the region.","Industry capacity growth is slightly stressing our Australian Southeast Asia products this winter. While this has led us to take a more conservative view on yield expectations for this itineraries absolute yields are still higher unlike hardware in other markets.","Our guidance reflects the impact, the economic crisis Latin America is having on our locally sourced Brazil and Latin America sailings. Before providing visibility into booking transfer next year, I want to provide you with an overview of our deployment.","We are slightly increasing capacity in the Caribbean due mostly to hardware changes and shifts in season length. By the end of the year, we will have three Oasis class ships in the Caribbean, two in Fort Lauderdale and one in Port Canaveral, our newest ship Harmony of the Seas joins her sisters Oasis and Allure for the winter of 2016 and 2017 season. The Caribbean will remain our biggest product with about 43% of total capacity.","Before heading to the Caribbean, Harmony of the Seas will debut in the Mediterranean and spend her summer season sailing from Barcelona and Rome. Overall, European itineraries will represent about 21% of our total capacity which is similar to this year.","Our most significant increase will once again occur in the Asia Pacific region. Capacity will be up more than 30% year-over-year due in part to the addition of Ovation of the Seas in Tianjin and the year round presence of Quantum of the Seas in Shanghai.","Overall, China will represent 9% of total 2016 capacity versus 6% in 2015. Structurally the main changes in our deployment from a quarterly perspective are, Quantum of the Seas has new China sailings throughout Q1, Splendour of the Seas leaves the fleet in April. Harmony and Ovation of the Seas joins us late in Q2 ultimately providing tailwinds to revenue in Q3 and Q4. Mein Schiff 5 joins TUI Cruises in June. Dry docks are also shifting next year with more in Q2 and Q4 and fewer in Q1 and Q3.","Moving onto early booking transfer 2016, demand has been healthy thus far and the booking window has continued to expand. In fact, it has shifted out approximately 30 days over the last two years. As a result, 2016 load factors are currently the highest in the company\u2019s history and APDs are ahead versus the same time last year for the full year and in each individual quarter.","The strength we are seeing in the Caribbean this year continues into 2016 and Caribbean sailings of all lengths are trending nicely ahead. We are seeing solid early booking trends for both North America and key sourcing markets in Europe for 2016 European sailings. As expected, Harmony of the Seas is enjoying particularly strong demand.","Load factors are up year-over-year for our 2016 Asia Pacific itineraries, with Quantum of the Seas and all over China winter season and a good book position at high yields. Our order book for summer China sailings is shaping up nicely and the product is expected to contribute to the company\u2019s overall yield growth for 2016.","Although it\u2019s still too early in the booking window to comment more specifically on booking trends for the full year, we do have more visibility into the first quarter. Overall, Q1 is booked ahead on load factor and APD versus same time last year. The Caribbean and China which makes up approximately two thirds of capacity are significantly more booked than last year at higher rates. The strength of these two products is more than offsetting continued pressure in Latin America.","While our key products are trending well in the first quarter, it\u2019s still too early to provide specific guidance for the full year. However, our current record high load factors and strong pricing position 2016 is expected to be our seventh consecutive year of yield growth keeping us on track to our Double-Double targets.","If you turn to slide three, you will see our guidance for the full year 2015. Net revenue yields are expected to be up approximately 3.5% which gets up back to the midpoint of our January guidance and represents a slight increase from our July guidance. This increase is due to our stronger revenue performance in the third quarter. The fact it was impacting our business have mostly remained consistent since our last earnings call. Caribbean momentum continues, we are on track to have our highest yields in Europe in our company\u2019s history and our onboard revenue and three cruises remain on a positive trajectory.","These tailwinds are somewhat offsetting further weakness in Latin America and softer pricing in Australia and Southeast Asia due to significant increase in industry capacity. Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be back in line with the April guidance of flat to down 1%.","Our fuel costs for the year have decreased since our July call to $800 million, driven mainly by rate and we are 57% hedged for the remainder of 2015 at a price of $608 per metric ton. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is expected to be approximately $4.80. These earnings represent a $0.05 improvement from the midpoint of our January guidance, despite a full year $0.25 headwind from a currency and fuel.","Before I walk you through our fourth quarter guidance, I would like to elaborate on capital returns. We continue to remain focused on improving returns for our shareholders which is one of our three core financial objectives. Our commitment to this goal has exemplified our announcement this morning of our boards authorization of a $500 million share repurchase program. This includes a $200 million accelerated share repurchase which is expected to be completed by the end of January 2016.","Further evidence of our commitment to improving shareholder returns is our recent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.375 a 25% increase year-over-year. These two actions reflect our commitment to improving shareholder returns and our confidence in the Double-Double.","Now I\u2019d like to walk you through our fourth quarter guidance on slide four. Notwithstanding the impact of Latin America and some modest pressure on pricing in Australia and Southeast Asia, Q4 of 2015 will be the best performing fourth quarter in our company\u2019s history. Year-over-year tailwinds are coming from a combination of price improvements in the Caribbean, the addition of Quantum of the Seas in China and the Anthem of the Seas in the Northeast.","Net yields are expected to be up in the range of 4.5% to 5%. Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be down approximately 4% and we have included 193 million of fuel expense for the quarter. Taking all this into account we expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $0.90 per share for the quarter.","With that, I will ask our operator, Lorrie to open up the call up for a question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski of Stifel.","Steve Wieczynski","Hey, good morning, guys. So, I guess in the past you talk little bit about 2016 in terms of what you're seeing there, and I guess some times in the past around the third quarter earnings release you guys have essentially given somewhat soft guidance for the next year. I know in 2015 you guys kind of called out that you felt comfortable with where consensus was for the next year. This year you guys did not do that. I was wondering why the decision not to do that?","Richard Fain","Yes. Steve, I'll address that. It's Richard. I guess that's an instance of no good deed goes unpunished. We did do that last year and I think we actually did the opposed well. And the reason was most of those cases we were sort of \u2013 there were lot of uncertainties about some of the structural elements that we were trying to make sure everybody understood what that is. But most people don't provide that kind of guidance and we don't really want to do so on a regular basis. And this year I think -- we think that the structural issues are clear. We have comparable situation going forward. People understand the way the fleet works and the numbers work. And so we didn't \u2013 and it's clear from the guidance that's out there \u2013 not the guidance, but the estimates that are out there that people understand the way these things are going.","But we get our best information about the year when we go through the wave period and we really feel that it's more appropriate on an ongoing basis to be doing what the rest of our industry does and provide our guidance when we've had that early insight. So I think I would suggest that last year or two have been anomalies, but this is and should the norm.","Steve Wieczynski","Okay. Got you. And then, I guess as we look to 2016, your outlook there looks \u2013 it's pretty for most of markets you're operating in. But I guess the question is going to go to Pullmantur, even though it\u2019s a very, very small percentage of your capacity. I guess at this point you guys have had issues with this as brand. The Latin American market does seem to be unstable at this point. And if you look at those five ships and the brand, I mean, the average ages, I mean, almost 25 years old. So I guess the question is at this point why not shut that down and essentially relocate those ships or essentially scrap up?","Richard Fain","Hey, Steve. I think that when we look Latin America as a key market as you brought up, I mean, there has been some real challenge there. But when we look at the market of Spain and Pullmantur position in Spain, we do think that there is opportunity with those assets and with the positioning of the brand to do well. And that's why this is a combination of somewhat rightsizing, right, so we are taking Empress of the Seas as I noted in my remarks and moving her into the Royal Caribbean fleet. And then, really kind of trying to match up appropriately supply and demand in the Spanish market and I think that we see those plans as paying off nice for us in the future.","Steve Wieczynski","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix ","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So, Jason, exciting news regarding the share repurchase program and the ASR. That just came out about a year earlier than I was expecting. So, I was just wondering if you could talk about the decision to do it now and any impact that might with the rating agencies regarding obtaining your investment grade rating?","Jason Liberty","Sure. it is a little bit early relative to when positive free cash flow generation comes in and as it evolve in modeling in our discussion most people see that towards the back half of next year. I think what we talked about was that as we starting to get more comfortable about the forward looking picture and as Richard mentioned in his comment the forward looking free cash flow generation that management and the board would be considering when that share buyback would be.","I think this is kind of more of a timing thing as it relates to the rating agencies as this is \u2013you probably are little bit earlier, but not a lot earlier than our dialogues with them in terms of share buyback program. So, I think the combination of you are confidence in future cash flows, while also trying to manage those three core financial objectives of improving shareholder returns being an investment grade credit and growing our business by maintaining that balances, this has kind of been our prospective for it.","Felicia Hendrix","And then you gave us some color on China. As you know we just did some analysis on this supply that's coming into the market over the next two years, and by account the market is going from about 10 ships today to 18 in 2017. So, I just wondering in context of all the strength that you stuffed on your prepared remarks can you just share your thoughts on the impact of that supply in the market in general and particular 2017. And then also how Royal Caribbean expectations for pricing fall into that scenario? Thanks.","Michael Bayley","Hi, Felicia, it's Michael. I'll answer that question. I think as you point out there's more supply coming into market in 2016 and 2017. We obviously feel quite comfortable with the market opportunity. We believe that it's literally untapped and as we see what's occurring in the Shanghai and Tianjin-Beijing region. We think that there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us. For Royal Caribbean, I think we feel confident. We've now been I the market for eight years. We've been building our brand for that period of time and we're being investing solidly in the market for that period, so, the aggregate marketing investments had been quite significant.","We have good consumer confidence. We're in a good position as a brand in the marketplace. In fact yesterday we just receive news that we were the recipients of the best cruise line in China for the eighth year running. We have been working on expanding the distribution channels and building our trade relationships and over this period of time I think we've also been able to introduce more sophisticated promotional ideas with our various trade partners. So, our feelings are good about how we see China. We think the opportunity is still very, very strong. So that's kind of our perspective on China.","Felicia Hendrix","And then to just reiterate something that Jason said about pricing in China. Did I hear that right that for 2016 so far what you see is it up year-over-year, Jason?","Jason Liberty","Just in terms of the visibility that we have into China and lot of that is going into the spring. We feel about load factor and the APDs we're getting there, and obviously Quantum will be there for the first time in the first quarter. And as Michael mentioned, the reception to that product has been \u2013 and that asset has been fantastic.","Michael Bayley","Yes. Just to add, I mean, we not only have we being extremely please with the performance of Quantum, but we have Ovation coming into the market in June into Tianjin. So with the two Quantum Class ships in China in 2016, we're feeling pretty good about how that looks?","Richard Fain","But you know Felicia, it also worth emphasizing that the \u2013 there's a structural change because we really now going into the market and doing it on the year round basis. And so you have to add in the mix that we have now have winter sailings. Actually significant part of the increase and the capacity in China is not so much new ships, but it's actually just that we broadening when during the year that we're there. So, we're quite encouraged by it. We're already there. The Quantum has done very well. The Quantum has clearly \u2013 the Quantum Class is clearly distinguishing themselves as an outstanding vessel. But there's also a lot of uncertainty about China in everybody's mind. And we feel good that we're going at in the right way. And I just want you to forget structural change.","Felicia Hendrix","Yes. Thanks for that. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim Conder","Thank you. And first of all congrats to everyone on continued great execution. Couple of things, Richard, just to continue on to that and whether you or Michael or Jason want to take this, but regarding China, so it sounds like we may see a little bit more seasonality, obviously, and somewhat similar to what we see in North America, where we have a shoulder period in Q1 and Q4. Can you sort of talk about the cadence there of pricing, and obviously it would appear that you would get your highest yields in the summer. So, that's question one related to China.","Question two would be, Jason, you mentioned I think that the pricing as it stands right now is up on a very early basis looking for China for next year, but if you could maybe, if you can or if you want to, break it down into your existing markets and then as you expand here into some of these periphery markets, somewhat your top cities versus your new cities, if you could give any color from that perspective?","Michael Bayley","Hi, Tim, it's Michael. Yes. I think as Richard point it out and as your question asks, there is seasonality and so the cadence is very similar to the kind of cadence that we see in other markets. There's a peak summer when the demand is high, particular around Golden Week, when the demand is extraordinary. And then as we move into the more of the shoulder seasons than we typically have slightly softer pricing that we do in the peak, so that's very typical. And I think that we expect the behavior to be similar, although I think for us, it\u2019s the fact that we're broadening the seasons. It's also a new experience for us as well. So we're going to have to see how it really does play out. We're fairly confident in terms of demand in the marketplace. So I think \u2013 but the seasonality is we believe quite similarly.","Tim Conder","Okay.","Jason Liberty","And then, Tim, in terms of your commentary on the market and secondary markets, I think in Richard's comment he talked about that these secondary markets have a lower cost base to them and do get slightly lower yields than what you would get in these primary large metropolitan areas like Shanghai and Beijing area. And so, I think again it's still very early on in that booking process, but that will play into the mix of yields for China, but again, we all thing that that contributes positively to the overall yield of the region, as well as it corporation the full year.","Michael Bayley","And Tim, I just add one more new ones. We talk about the complexity of our business, one of things you also are very well aware, I know you're well aware of, but it gives me an opportunity to mention it for everybody is the issues that it's not just China. We really look at this pattern as in some cases it's year round China, but in some cases its summer in China and our winter Northern winter in Southeast Asia and then Australia and New Zealand and you were also commenting on what's happening particularly in Australian market, New Zealand market which have also had very large increases in capacity. So you have to balance all of those as we're going through.","Tim Conder","Okay. Understood. That's helps. I guess just one more piece there on the China. If you looked at your comparable cities in the comparable period, how is pricing trending at this point from that perspective?","Jason Liberty","Hi, Tim. On a comparable basis and again in terms of the visibility there we see. And as I commented we \u2013 our load factors are on a good position year-over-year as well as our rate based on the level of visibility that we have which is really through the spring at this point.","Tim Conder","Okay. Gentlemen, thank you.","Jason Liberty","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins of Credit Suisse.","Joel Simkins","Yes. Hey, good morning, and thanks for the update on trends here. I guess you mentioned the window now for discounts sort of being out as far as 40 days. Is there any thought to sort of extending that a little further? Do you feel like you could push it at this point given that the consumer seems to be getting used to it and obviously the competitive environment seems to be rational?","Richard Fain","Yes. I think we take these things as they come and we're learning from it. This is a new program and we need to be a little bit cautious as we roll it out. The rollout has been very encouraging, you've seen that. We have extended it. We actually look at these and don't make those decisions in advance. So I wouldn't speculate this to what might be the case in the future. All I can say is that we have felt good about what we've done so far and that's caused us to extend it both in terms of time and also in the areas where we're putting this in place. And I'm quite comfortable that that is working and we will continue that. I have no comfort as to what we will do in the future, and I think we would simply look at that as that comes to play.","Joel Simkins","Sure. And one follow-up on onboard obviously the trends continue to be very, very strong there. I guess as you think about onboard and what's driving and I guess how much the overall health of the consumer, how much has been priced and how much has been sort of product and innovation particularly as you renovated some the legacy capacity?","Michael Bayley","Hi. Joel, its Michael. I think its really all three. I think with certainly in the summer during Q3 both in Europe and Caribbean actually and nearly all of our products, we've seen more spend coming from the consumers. We've been more I think aggressive with our dynamic pricing model as it relates to pricing onboard which allowed us to take opportunity of some of those moments where people seem to be more willing to spend. I think product mix has been a really major contributor. The investment over time in terms of building out and changing out different retail options and what not has certainly beginning to help us. So I think really it\u2019s a combination of all three. It was certainly for the Q3 it was just a really good quarter. And of course China played a big part of that as well. And we've been very pleased with them. One of the big contributors has been the VOOM, the fastest internet of sea, and we've seen significant increase in our revenues in that area. ","Joel Simkins","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs.","Steven Kent","Hi. Good morning. On the pricing integrity program, its not clear to me, is that just for the Royal brand or all of your brands, and when you said, you're rolling it out into Europe and other markets, is that for all of the brands. And that's my first question.","And then on the buyback, can you just talk about how the board looks toward that versus dividends and the discussion there. And then one final thing, just on \u2013 can you talk about the earnings potential of your JVs and how that factors in to achieving your Double-Double goals?","Richard Fain","Steve, its Richard, and I'll start on the price integrity program and then I'll ask Jason to answer the other two questions. The price integrity program is for all of our brands across the broad. It's only in the U.K. and Ireland that we've added it, we haven't added it elsewhere in the world. But it is in the U.K. and Ireland. It is for all of our brands.","Jason Liberty","Steven, in terms of on the share buyback versus the dividend, I think that obviously historically we've look at the dividend as kind of the core mechanism to return in capital of the shareholders. And I think there's a recognition that they needed to be a mix of those two things. And I think that's how we and the board will be considering those mechanisms going forward.","Steven Kent","Just to stay on this for a second, why not be more opportunistic, Jason, versus this accelerated share repurchase, I mean you can't help but see today you're -- I think you're at an all-time high, which is terrific, but why not just wait for the occasional downdraft that seems to happen in this industry?","Jason Liberty","Yes, great question. I think it\u2019s a point to point out. Two things, one which is the ASR -- the ASR is really for 200 of the 500, and the other 300 we haven't announce how we would go about on doing that. But that's not as definitely something we very much keep in line. And I think that the share repurchase I think should be an indictor of \u2013 again our confidence, the board's confidence and now we see things going forward.","As it relates to the joint ventures, you're certainly \u2013 we have two key joint ventures, one is TUI AG, our TUI Cruises venture which does and continues to do very, very well. That is obviously a key contributor to our Double-Double program and our outlook going forward as that brand continues to successfully operate as well as grow. SkySea is really in its infancy. It just launched this past May. I think \u2013 how we contributes to Double-Double, we'll probably be something more on modest basis as we look to grow that \u2013 the positioning of that brand in the Chinese market with our partner Ctrip as well as grow that brand over time.","Steven Kent","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Minolta of JPMorgan.","Kevin Minolta","Hey, good morning. Appreciate the time here. As we look at capacity growth in 2016 picking up a touch here for the fleet. Could you give us a sense for how we should be thinking about net cruise costs on a go-forward basis both with fuel and without? Thank you.","Jason Liberty","Hey, Kevin. I think we're obviously \u2013 we're still in our planning process on both the revenue and cost standpoint. We will give guidance on cost next year. But I think that you should just generally expect that our focus and rigor on cost has really exceeded well into the culture of the company and you should expect us to behave similarly going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman of Wedbush Securities.","James Hardiman","Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Two questions from me. First, maybe just little bit of clarification. Was the repo factored into your original Double-Double plan? I guess another way of asking that, do you think that net income will double 2017 over 2014?","Richard Fain","When we gave the Double-Double and I would remind you that it is both net income and ROIC, we didn't caveat that with what actions we would take over the market takes. We're not adjusting it for fuel, foreign exchange, share repurchases or anything we might be doing, we've really just said, it's the target. And the one, the earnings per share would be impacted by share repurchases, but the ROIC, I would point out is not impacted by share repurchases as well.","James Hardiman","But just to clarify, I think you just said that the expectation was that net income would double, not just EPS?","Richard Fain","No, no, we try to be explicit. We have two targets and they are exactly what we've said, which is adjusted earnings per share would double that is it would get to $6.78 by \u2013 for the year 2014. And ROIC would reach double-digits, i.e. that it would be 10.00 [ph] or 1% or better by 2017. And those are two targets that we're using internally, essential we will take what actions we should operationally and the world will give us what it would give us, whether that's foreign exchange gains or losses, it's been bad, but whatever it is fuel or whatever it is et cetera.","James Hardiman","Got it. Very helpful. And then my second question was on the price integrity program. You said in the prepared remarks that it's cost you a bit in 2015 and will cost a bit more in 2016. Are you saying obviously the program is going to help with pricing and hurt on the occupancy front? Do you saying that the net effect of those two has been a negative and will continue to be a negative in 2016 or is just that its cost you a bit on the occupancy side.","And I guess related question, occupancy step down a bit in the second quarter and was down again in the third quarter. I'm assuming that's a function of the price integrity program are safe today, safe to say that's going to be continue to down until you lap that maybe second quarter next year and then resume growth or how should you be thinking about that?","Richard Fain","Yes. I think your description was accurate that we think that the price integrity program probably helps us on the rate, but hurts us on the volume. And so the net effect of that in 2015 and 2016 would be negative on our total revenue. So, I think your articulation was exactly correct. In terms of the actual occupancy that you are experiencing especially by quarter, I think there are so many other factors that the price integrity program would not be a significant part of that. And so, to the extent that its down or up in any quarter, that will be really driven by our yield managers and our yield management system. The price integrity program would be a de minimis part of that.","James Hardiman","Make sense. And maybe just a follow-up there then, so as we think about the net being negative into 2016, should we sort of think about that as a negative most significantly in the first quarter and then once we lap that maybe it becomes a positive beyond that or how should we think about that?","Jason Liberty","Hey, James, it's Jason. I think the way that you need to look at is first off, we're talking about very, very small numbers here in terms of what we believe the impact is on this program on a negative basis and we expect to see that continue, because these programs are continuing to rollout to more product, into more markets. And as we said previously we expect that to kind of lap in and move into a positive direction in 2017. And when we talk about the effect, we really do talk about on an occupancy because as Richard mentioned in his remarks, its what we can measure, but we do think that this is really changing the conversation with the guest who have booked and behave in the way that we wanting them and also helping us expand out the booking window to position us for stronger pricing.","James Hardiman","Excellent. Thanks guys.","Jason Liberty","Thanks, James.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin Farley","Great. Thanks. A couple of questions. First is I wonder what the Pullmantur write-down if you could quantify, it looks like their write-down will end up adding to EPS in future years, because you're eliminating some things that would have run through the depreciation and amortization line. So could you just help guide us little bit what that will add EPS each year having taken the write-down?","And then, a question on China, this is a topic, not totally exhausted yet. We had a recent analysis out and in our channel checks we had heard some of the distributors there maybe not getting as large of markup, but that is, in our view is not a negative for Royal or for pricing since its not really a commission model, it was the charter model there. So is it fair to say that that's going to be the same. it's still primarily going to be charter model for next year, so the width of the travel sellers markup is not really something that's a negative for you guys? And then I may have one more question after that, thanks.","Jason Liberty","Hey, Robin, it's Jason. I'll take the Pullmantur question. Really the majority of the other write-off were again it was a non-cash write off and it was relating to intangibles that were not amortizing or depreciating in any way. There is a portion of that that it relates to some of the ships. It would probably help us by couple of cents going forward, because it's not just about write-down, it also some adjustments in the residuals as we look at those assets going forward. But it\u2019s a couple of cents. It's not material.","Michael Bayley","Hi, Robin, it's Michael. I'll answer the question on the China and the distribution markup, Yes, I think there was a period when we had the MERS outbreak in Korea and then we have the triple typhoon impact, and then of course we have the explosion in Tianjin, so we had a period of about \u2013 I'm going to guess, its about three months or so where it was a little wobbly because of all of these events. And then of course we had many of the distributors have this charter or group resell relationship with us and I think many of our competitors. So during that period I think some of them incurred losses, that didn't flow through to us, but of course it impacts us because they are long term partners. And so we worked on strategies to help them through that and to ensure we're in a good place for 2016, but it didn't really have a financial impact to us.","And of course the model is really quite different in China in relation to the distribution. But one of the things that we've been actively working on is expanding the distribution and opening up that channel through various strategies which of course it\u2019s a long term play but we feel like we're on a good track to broaden that channel.","Robin Farley","Great. That's very helpful. Thanks and maybe just a last question. Just looking at the full-year EPS and on the full-year EPS went up by $0.10 and the beat in Q3 was $0.14. I think you mentioned kind of $0.02 was maybe borrowed from expenses shifting. If there another $0.02 of -- because I think FX and fuel kind of net out. There are another $0.02 of your yield outlook in Q4 that maybe that would Pullmantur Latin America that was just that hair lower than previous just to clarify? Thanks.","Richard Fain","Hi, Robin -- so just to clarify it\u2019s really a combination of Latin America and a little bit later on the Australia, New Zealand product just due to the level of capacity that\u2019s in there that\u2019s driving the differential.","Robin Farley","That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.","Richard Fain","Thanks, Robin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Katz of Morningstar.","Jamie Katz","Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. With moving from capacity back to Spain and launching Harmony in the market next year, I'm curious what you guys are seeing in that local market, and then generally how you're feeling about European demand for next summer.","Jason Liberty","Sure, hey Jamie, it\u2019s Jason. As it relates to you know the capacity going in to the Barcelona market, first off for Harmony, it\u2019s a really global sourced product while and it doesn\u2019t really compete directly with Pullmantur and that\u2019s putting some more capacity into Spain. And by the way when we say for more capacity it focuses on Spain, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s sailing out of the Western Mediterranean could be sailing out of different places sourcing guests from Spain.","And then when you look at the European customer, we\u2019ve actually seen very good signs and trends that were still early for the European products coming from Europe as well as that continued strength we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years from the North American consumer who has been highly attracted to European sailings?","Jamie Katz","And then I'm curious, you guys hire a few months ago. Have there been any thoughts on changes to the marketing strategy and how to attract consumers going forward, or has it been pretty static?","Michael Bayley","Oh hi, Jamie it\u2019s Michael. Yes, we are very pleased to welcome Jim to Royal Caribbean International a few months ago and he\u2019s been very busy. You may have seen, we just launched our new campaign \u201cCome Seek\u201d for Royal Caribbean International that\u2019s come literally into market this week. And hopefully you\u2019ll see us go a slightly different twist towards it, and the way we are approaching the market with this idea of come seek and the imagery and the kind of TV commercials, radio and digital that we are putting into the market has tested exceptionally well, not only with existing cruises but probably more importantly with new to cruise.","So part of our focus is on the new to cruise markets and I think you\u2019ll start to see that in the marketing that comes from Royal Caribbean International over the coming period and that really is being led and directed by our new CMO.","Jamie Katz","And then lastly, can you guys add any color on Celebrity, I know you usually don\u2019t break it up but I\u2019m curious if those consumers are performing disparately or incrementally better than the Royal Caribbean passengers and the willingness to spend is a little bit higher?","Richard Fain","I\u2019m quite happy to actually -- I think one of the things that has us feeling pretty good is just how well our brands are being received in the market place and Celebrity is a good example of that. Michael is here himself has [Indiscernible] is how his brand is doing, but atleast if we are here, she would say exactly the same.","It\u2019s really, and Michael mentioned that he has a new ad campaign coming out so has Lisa and she\u2019s -- here\u2019s is actually been out for the longer and its being received quite well. So I think we are really seeing except for geographic issues like Latin America we are really seeing our brands doing quite nicely in their respective markets, and the Celebrity brand has been holding its own and I think -- now it\u2019s also been affected by the geographies because it for example has had more volume in particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean this year.","So you will see changes, we see changes between brands. We see a lot of changes between brands and between different geographies which is just a normal fact of doing business, and I think we sometimes read too much into it particularly because we\u2019ve historically been so surprisingly accurate. I mean, I think for us to come in looking like and the year is so close to being over. We\u2019re pretty confident about looking to be in the range of 3.5% yield improvement that is essentially exactly where we predicted it at the beginning of the year. And I wish I could say that we were that accurate. Its\u2019 simply the margin of error in these things is a little bigger than that and we have been fortunate that the plusses have offset the minuses, but overall I think that\u2019s not unusual for us and I would expect that to continue.","Jamie Katz","Thank you.","Richard Fain","All right we have time for one more question.","Operator","And your final question will come from the line of Ian Rennardson of Jefferies","Ian Rennardson","Thank you. Good afternoon from England. My question is regarding the share buyback. I\u2019m assuming that the 500 million isn\u2019t a one-off and I wondered how you calculated what ratios you\u2019ve used to calculate that 500 and what sort of ratios you will be thinking about as being applicable for the medium term? Thank you.","Jason Liberty","Ian, could you clarify what you mean by ratios?","Ian Rennardson","Well net debt-to-EBITDA or\u2026","Jason Liberty","Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Okay, great. Yeah, so we still are very much focussed on getting to your 3.75 times net debt-to-EBITDA and we see ourselves progressing towards that, towards the end of next year as we consider these buybacks. So we see this buyback a little bit of as a timing opportunity in terms of buying back shares.","Ian Rennardson","Okay, thank you.","Richard Fain","And I will just add, I think as Jason said earlier we would reiterate our objective is to get to that investment grade. And obviously almost anything that we do that involves capital including ordering ships or buying back shares makes it a little more difficult but we think that the move towards investment grade is so inexorable that we can balance those things.","Ian Rennardson","Okay. Thank you and I think we\u2019ll just finish off on that. I think in 2007 seen you only have $500 million of CapEx projected which is significantly lower than the other year, does that have any thinking on your medium to longer term thinking on share buybacks?","Richard Fain","No you know it\u2019s interesting because one of the interesting because one of the interesting features of our business is CapEx tends to come in big bunches and whether a ship delivers in January or December makes a huge difference on the numbers you just quoted. We don\u2019t tend to look at it that way, I think it\u2019s we made a decision '17 was a year that had no ship deliveries, but then we start having deliveries again in '18. And so I think that\u2019s simply a coincidence '17 worked out that way.","Ian Rennardson","Okay. Thank you. Great.","Jason Liberty","All right. Thank you for your assistance Lawry [ph] with the call today. And we thank all of you for your participation and interest in the company. Carol and Laura will be with her. We\u2019ll be available for any follow ups you might have during the day, and I wish you all a great day.","Operator","Thank you for participating in the Royal Caribbean Cruises Limited 2015 third quarter earnings call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Jason Liberty, you may begin your conference.","Jason T. Liberty","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Celebrity Cruises; and Laura Hodges, our Vice President of Investor Relations.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides which have been posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com. Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During the call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking.

I will close with our outlook for the full year and fourth quarter. We will then open the call for your questions. Richard?","Richard D. Fain","Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everybody. It's always a pleasure to have the opportunity to provide additional color on our progress. As you know, our most important initiative is our Double-Double Program. This program reflects our determination to reach double-digit returns on investment and to double our earnings by 2017. We are pleased with the progress to date, and we continue to see this as the right goal at the right time. One objective of publicly announcing the program was, of course, increased transparency to the investment community. However, the more important objective is actually to inform and motivate our employees around both our EPS and our ROIC targets. Each employee plays a role in reaching these targets, and it's important that each of them understand how crucial they are in the successful achievement of the Double-Double goals. In this context, we have been showing our internal teams a short 2-minute video that we thought we would post on our website so you could see it, too. I must tell you that the announcement of our program was even better received by our people than we anticipated. It's worked its way through the fabric of our organization in a very positive way, and it's proven to be a remarkably effective way to get all of our people to rally around our goals of aggressively improving our returns. We are on a roll. As the video explains, the 3 main drivers of our Double-Double success are: improving revenue yields, maintaining cost consciousness and moderate capacity growth. Taking these in reverse order, our capacity growth is set to at least 2017.","Our cost-conscious culture is well established and we had numerous tailwinds on the revenue side, that I'll expand upon briefly. Addressing the revenue opportunity, let me start with the power of our brands. Royal Caribbean's International takes delivery of the Quantum of the Seas in just a few days. She is truly a marvel and I will comment more on her in a moment. Celebrity Cruises market segmentation strategy has also changed the trajectory of this brand, and we look forward to continued improvement in Celebrity's results. Pullmantur, our Spanish brand, has faced enormous challenges for the last few years but that's shifting. The management there is adding a focus on Latin America and this strategy is well underway. Azamara continues its dramatic upward trend based on its very successful destination immersion programs. And lastly, TUI Cruises continues to deliver exceptional returns but below the line. With the addition of 3 more new builds on -- over the next 3 years, the TUI Cruises venture will continue to be accretive to our earnings, as we work towards our long-term goals. In addition to our brands, we have a myriad of other initiatives that are supporting our success. Our growth in China, our global footprint and our investment and yield management tools are only a few of the other reasons why we remain confident about our Double-Double Program.","Looking specifically into 2015, we are very encouraged by what we see, although our first quarter will be tougher than the rest of the year. There's continued capacity growth in the Caribbean during this first quarter, and we don't get to easier comps until next April. However, after that, essentially all of our markets are looking robust, and we expect a notably better operating environment for the last 9 months of 2015. We're also starting the period with more bookings in the end and at higher prices. Amazingly, despite the addition of 2 new vessels, we actually have fewer cabins to sell in the U.S. and Europe, even in absolute terms, than we had at the same time a year ago. With fewer cabins to sell, we have less pressure to do such last-minute discounts. This not only should help our yields but it should increase guest satisfaction as last-minute discounting is a significant source of discontent to many of our early booking guests. We're in this favorable condition because of our strong order book and because China is growing a massive 68% in 2015, including the introduction of Quantum of the Seas. We therefore decided to take a more consistent approach on pricing. This may well result in slightly lower load factors, but we think it will raise the satisfaction level of our guests and strengthen the perception of our brands' superiority. Strong brands are the best guarantor of our future performance, and we will keep working to continually enhance the strength of our brands.","On the cost side, it's way too early to give specific forecast as we're still in the midst of our planning cycle. That said, 2 areas we are investing heavily in are Internet bandwidth for our ships and developing the market in China. These investments are costly but they are critical to the long-term success of our company and they should provide very short paybacks. We maintain our commitment to strong cost discipline, and we will be measuring any cost undertaking against the criteria of rapid payback.","Given all of the above, and emphasizing that it's still early days, we are pleased to confirm that we're comfortable with the current Street consensus of $4.55 per share in 2015. That would represent another 30-plus percent increase in earnings. It also represents another step towards our Double-Double goals. Of course, while I may wish to do so, I can't ignore the topic of Ebola. As I've consistently said, there's no such thing as perfect safety but there is a perfect dedication to safety. That perfect dedication to safety encompasses the safety of our guests and crew to public health concerns like Ebola. From what we've seen and heard, the probability of a serious outbreak in the United States approaches 0, but the probability of an epidemic of fear approaches 100%. The CDC and CLIA have extensive protocols in place designed to contain the disease. While there have been some new steps in the early stages, the fact remains that the CDC is one of the strongest and most professional organizations in America. We are lucky to have them leading this effort, and I am confident that they will contain it successfully. Unfortunately, it is hard to assess the fear factor.","So far, we've not experienced any big impact on our bookings. Furthermore, the hysteria over the issue seems to have abated even over the last few days. The closest parallel we could think of was the fear over SARS some 12 years ago. Although that was a more contagious disease, the fear factor was then, similarly, more relevant than the actual danger. In that case, we experienced a sudden negative impact on our bookings. But fortunately, the reversal of the impact was just as rapid and the recovery was very swift.","Returning to the delivery of Quantum of the Seas, we are excited by the unprecedented interest this ship has generated. I've just returned from a visit to the ship and I'm even more confident that everyone will find that the excitement was justified. Personally, I find it interesting to reflect on what differentiates unique new vessels. Voyager and Freedom class ships were notable for creating a new style of ship, with more wows than ever before. Oasis of the Seas was notable for her scale and her grand spaces. Celebrity Solstice was known for the beauty of her architecture and for the uniqueness of her special features. After all these spectacular new ships, I can't help but sit here and wonder what Quantum will be known for. There's been much publicity about the physical features on Quantum like North Star, SeaPlex and Two70\u00b0. These features are indeed dramatic and they alone justify much of the excitement. But part of the reason we're so enthusiastic about Quantum is because it also has so many additional nonphysical elements that have never been seen before. For example, Dynamic Dining is the most radical change in our culinary offering since the company was founded over 40 years ago. The entertainment on board is dramatically different, both in scale and diversity. And the use of technology is undergoing ambitious transformation that exceeds the cumulative change of any previous decade. For us as a company, one of the best parts of the new technology is that it's fungible. If these features are as impactful as we hope, we can roll them out to the rest of the fleet more quickly and in a more easy way that you can hardware elements.","For example, our exclusive partnership with O3B brings super Internet bandwidth. There's also a no check-in check-in, where you don't even have to go through the check-in process at the terminal, just show your boarding pass and passport and you're off. Our new luggage tracking technology allows you to track the progress of your luggage from the curb to your stateroom, utilizing RFID technology. And if that wasn't enough, our new Royal iQ app will allow you to manage your entire vacation experience from your mobile device. No more standing in line to book your entertainment, change your spa appointments or make a reservation in specialty restaurants. I believe all of this technology will be a huge differentiator for Quantum, but the fact that it could be installed in our other ships in the fleet make it especially beneficial for the brand.","All of these elements are game-changing, but the aspect that I think observers will be most surprised about is Quantum's elegance. People are expecting the wows. Certainly, we've done our best to generate the publicity. But I think everybody will be pleasantly surprised by how elegant the total package is. This is probably one of the most sophisticated and elegant ships Royal Caribbean International has ever built. So yes, we are excited to be finally able to show off this amazing vessel, and we believe she will help our drive for better returns on investment.","Just before turning the call back to Jason, I have to acknowledge the men and women who have worked so hard to make this ship a reality. The passion of our people to complete this work and implement these game-changing features is fantastic. I continue to be in awe of the teams working so hard to get Quantum of the Seas ready for her debut. And I can't wait until their efforts become apparent to everyone. With that, it's my pleasure to turn the microphone back to Jason.","Jason T. Liberty","Thank you, Richard. I will begin by taking you through our results for the third quarter. So unless I state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant currency basis. We have summarized our third quarter results on Slide 2.","For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $2.20 per share, which was in line with our previous guidance. The business performed as expected. Net revenue yields were up 4.2% for the quarter, which is right on our guidance of approximately 4%. Europe, Asia and Alaska itineraries delivered double-digit yield improvement, while the Caribbean yields were down year-over-year. Onboard revenue was up 4.4%, which marks the 11th quarter in a row of growth. Increased load factors, coupled with strong beverage programs, mainly drove the year-over-year improvement. Costs were better than expected for the quarter, with net cruise costs excluding fuel down 1.2%. About half of these savings are timing-related and are expected to be spent during the balance of the year.","During the quarter, the combination of the stronger U.S. dollar and improvement in fuel prices resulted in a net negative of approximately $0.03 per share. To be consistent with how we have presented adjusted earnings, the loss on the sale of the Century and the voyage proration impact as described in the press release are not included in our adjusted earnings for the quarter.","On the capital front, we increased the quarterly dividend by 20%. We continue to remain focused on our 3 core financial objectives of reaching investment grade metrics, moderate capacity growth and improving shareholder returns. As we progress towards our Double-Double target, we expect to continue to return capital through dividend distribution and by possibly buying back shares.","Now I would like to update you on the booking environment for the balance of the year, including our early thoughts for 2015. In the fourth quarter, just under half of our capacity is in the Caribbean, with the balance mainly split between Europe and Asia Pacific. While pricing in the Caribbean remains challenging, we feel we have a good handle on the types of tactical actions that resonate well to drive demand. This has resulted in a bit more discounting but is driving better-than-expected load factors, which help compensate for lower prices and further benefits shipboard revenue. The tail end of our Europe season is close to being sold out, and this will be our third consecutive quarter of double-digit yield growth for this product. Yields for this season are expected to be about 5% higher than the 2008 peak. We've seen strong demand trends from Europe sailings from all key sourcing regions throughout the year. And the anticipated challenges in the Black Sea and Holy Land were not material to our yield performance. Asia and Australia remain key during the winter, and despite an 11% year-over-year increase, these products continue to deliver superior yields relative to our other winter deployment.","As Richard mentioned, based on current booking trends, we are very encouraged by the outlook for 2015. Before digging into the booking trends, I wanted to provide the landscape for deployment next year. We have made a number of deployment changes in 2015 that we expect to benefit yields and performance. Our most significant capacity growth will be in the Asia Pacific region with the entry of Quantum of the Seas in China during the summer.","Asia Pacific will increase from 12% of capacity in 2014 to 15% in 2015, with China representing approximately 10% of our capacity in the summer months. European capacity will be up mid-single digits in 2015, that will represent 22% of total capacity. In the spring of 2015, we will take delivery of Quantum of the Seas' sister, the Anthem of the Seas, which will sail out of Southampton for the summer. The Allure of the Seas is another significant capacity change in Europe. She will be taking European vacation and will be spending the entire summer out of Barcelona and Rome. Both of these ships will be replaced by smaller vessels with [ph] established itineraries.","So Caribbean capacity will be up slightly in 2015, driven by Quantum of the Seas in the Northeast this winter, that will represent 44% of our total capacity. Caribbean capacity in Q2 and beyond will be down year-over-year, with summer capacity down approximately 5%. So now I'm going to discuss the current 2015 booking environment. We have been experiencing very healthy demands for 2015 sailings, with bookings consistently trending ahead of same time last year levels and outpacing capacity growth by a considerable margin. So as a result, our booked load factors and APDs are higher than same time last year. So our Caribbean load factors are higher in all 4 quarters versus same time last year, and they are materially better beginning in Q2; which is a point in which the industry capacity begins to decrease. We are also seeing strong bookings and pricing trends from both North America and Europe for our European itineraries.","As we expected, Anthem of the Seas and Allure of the Seas are each seeing particularly strong demand for the summer season. Also, the remainder of the fleet sailing in Europe is also trending ahead. As Richard mentioned, we are very excited about the delivery of Quantum of the Seas and Anthem of the Seas. As we expected, both ships are seeing particularly strong demand with pricing similar to the Oasis class. We expect Q1 to be our toughest quarter next year, as industry Caribbean capacity is at an elevated level through April, and we are seeing the promotional environment continue throughout the first few months of the year.","First quarter Caribbean sailings, which account for close to 70% of the capacity for the quarter, are booked at higher load factors than at this point last year but at lower prices. We expect to offset the Caribbean pressures in the first quarter with capacity increases in our Asian, Australian and South American products, all of which are performing well. While the accounting change related to the voyage proration will have a negative impact on Q1 comparables, we do expect to see yield improvement in the quarter. It's still too early in the booking window to provide specific guidance, however, 2015 is expected to be our sixth consecutive year of yield improvement. Also, we expect our 2015 yield improvement increase to be higher than the yield increase we are experiencing in 2014. While it is still early in the booking cycle, we are pleased to confirm that we are comfortable with the current Street consensus of $4.55 per share for 2015. This would represent a year-over-year increase of over 30% on top of 2014; which would be a record earning year for the company.","If you turn to Slide 3, you will see our guidance for the full year 2014. Net revenue yields are expected to be up approximately 2.5%, which is consistent with the midpoint of our previous guidance of 2% to 3%. Net cruise costs excluding fuel are also expected to be consistent with our previous guidance of flat to slightly down. The factors impacting our business have remained consistent since our last earnings call. Europe and Asia itineraries as well as on-board revenue continue to outperform, more than offsetting the weakness in the Caribbean. Our fuel costs for the year have decreased slightly since our July call to $943 million, driven mainly by rate, and we are 52% hedged for the remainder of 2014 at a price of $614 per metric ton. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is expected to be approximately $3.45. While this is the midpoint of our previous guidance, there are puts and takes in the numbers that shifted during the third quarter. The net negative impact of the strong U.S. dollar, partially offset by reduced fuel prices, did impact our earnings guidance for the full year by approximately $0.10 per share. Also, as we described in our press release, we did make 1 change in how we recognize shorter voyages at the end of each quarter.","Historically, we would only prorate revenues and related expenses for sailings of greater than 10 days that crossed over the end of a quarter. Starting September 30, 2014, we are prorating all voyages to recognize revenue and related expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Included in our adjusted earnings guidance for the year is a benefit of approximately $0.07 per share that's related mainly to the additional capacity from the Quantum of the Seas holiday sailing that would have previously been recognized in Q1 of 2015.","Now I would like to walk you through our fourth quarter guidance on Slide 4. Net yields are expected to be up approximately 3.5%. Our deployment mix shifts substantially again in Q4, with the Caribbean becoming an increasingly important product for the remainder of the year. As a result, the Caribbean pricing environment is a little bit more influential than it was in Q3. Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be up in the range of 2% to 3%, and we have included $225 million of fuel expense for the quarter. Taking all of this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.40 for the quarter. With that, I will ask our operator to open the call up for questions-and-answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jason, you said, in your prepared remarks regarding the Double-Double Program and how you are on track, you made a comment about potentially being able to or contemplating buying back shares. I was wondering if you can comment on that, particularly, given where you are with the rating agencies.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, I do apologize but there will be a slight delay in today's conference.","[Technical Difficulty]","Jason T. Liberty","Felicia, are you there?","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'm here. Are you there?","Jason T. Liberty","Yes, sorry about that. We had some type of technical difficulty.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But did you hear my question or shall I repeat it?","Richard D. Fain","We heard the question. Maybe that was the problem, you asked about share buybacks. I don't know if that offended Jason.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, maybe, yes so -- I'm on pins and needles waiting for your answer.","Jason T. Liberty","Yes. So obviously, as we progress through the Double-Double period, we generated a lot of free cash flow. And while it is obviously a Board of Directors' decision in terms of how we deploy that capital, we do think share buyback is a feasible way, as well as through the traditional dividend distribution process that we've done in the past.","Richard D. Fain","Felicia, you also asked us how that impacted on our objective of being investment-grade. And clearly, that's a part of our thought process. We continue to intend to be investment-grade, but we think we are well on the track to do so. We're already getting essentially investment-grade type pricing and type covenants. And so we think that any decision we made in terms of share buyback would keep that objective fairly in mind and would not be a really big factor in that progression.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great, very helpful. And then Jason, my follow-up question is just regarding the accounting changes that you made in the release. You -- I believe you're pretty clear in how you listed them out in the release, but we are getting a lot of questions this morning regarding why you called out the impacts from the Quantum of the Seas when it was already contemplated in your prior guidance. So I was just wondering if you could talk to that for a moment.","Jason T. Liberty","Yes, we were just calling it out. So this has always kind of been anticipated in our guidance. And so we were pointing it out as it relates to the fourth quarter because those few days that would typically be sitting in Q1 will be sitting in Q4. And we just thought it was important to point it out. But overall, this is really an immaterial change to our key statistics for the year.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But just to make sure I understand, so that $0.07 is not incremental to your fourth quarter. That was already in there before?","Jason T. Liberty","That was already in there before, that's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Greg. Just first question is, it's very encouraging about your 2015 bookings. In the press release, you mentioned strong, robust, up year-over-year. And I'm just wondering maybe if you could parse out volume and pricing. In my book, maybe that's mid to high single-digit robust. Maybe if you wanted to give a little color, that would be great. If not, I understand.","Jason T. Liberty","The latter part of that was probably good to hear, that you would understand. It is very early in the cycle. But overall, we are -- and it's generally and it's across all products -- seeing good demand, so strong volumes, good pricing. I also, in my opening remarks, talked a little bit about for the Caribbean, that were really -- Q2 and beyond -- seeing that promotional activity that we've seen over the past several quarters dissipate as well.","Richard D. Fain","Yes, and then I think we did give a little color. Jason commented that we expected the increase to be better than the 2% to 3% that we have been looking forward to this year. And I think it's very encouraging to see a really very different tone in the market. And I think that's part of what we've been seeing, that's part of what you all have been seeing on your calls out to travel agents and others. The tone for 2015 is just very different. On the other hand, as you well know, we are -- we tend not to have big swings in terms of yield improvement. So that tends to ameliorate downswings when we have a bad year and it tends to put a governor on big upswings. But overall, the tone of the market is simply very encouraging for us. And that's why we went to the fairly unusual length of reaffirming -- or not reaffirming but confirming that we were comfortable with the Street's estimates for '15 and we don't usually do that this early.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, I would agree, I mean, that's what we're hearing, too. So it's good to see that. And just if I could ask a question on hedging. I know you typically like to do that more just to mitigate upswings in fuel, but could you opportunistically maybe hedge some more? Is that something that you'd consider, strategically, or not?","Jason T. Liberty","So we're always looking at trends and -- as it relates to both fuel and currency. And as we've talked about it in the past, we typically see, especially over the medium and long term, a kind of inverse relationship between currency and fuel. And so we're kind of maintaining that kind of 40% to 60% range on the fuel hedging, but it tends to kind of bode well over time relative to currency trends. But it is something that we are consistently watching.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So opportunistically, if you think, fuel is low now, you might consider maybe going a little bit to the upper end of that range?","Jason T. Liberty","It's definitely something in the consideration. But again, in that conversation, there is also taking a look at what's happening in the different currency markets relative to the U.S. dollar.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A little more color if you could, again within the context of how much you're -- it's early and how much you're comfortable sharing, but I think you've alluded to that you expect China to be up again double digit in yields for '15. Any color, should we see similar acceleration or maybe a little bit deceleration from the performance that we've seen in Europe this year? And then any directional comments you want to give in relation to Europe or China as it relates to the Caribbean as far as yields for '15.","Adam M. Goldstein","Tim, it's Adam. We didn't make any specific projection about yields for next year in China. We obviously have a significant capacity increase, which is reflecting the optimism that we have about the continued development of the market and the position of Royal Caribbean International in it and specifically, the arrival of Quantum of the Seas right around midyear to China, which is clearly one of the more dramatic strategic steps that we have taken, really, over the course of our history. And having just been there last week at their big conference, it's clear that the arrival of a state-of-the-art cruise ship is being incredibly well received in the marketplace. The Chinese feel like they should have access -- immediate local access to the best cruise ships in the world, and now they're going to have that. So there's a lot of excitement, but it's early. China is a historically late booking market. There's a lot of group business that needs to be accomplished and so forth, so it will be until later quarters before we can comment on yield performance specifically.","Richard D. Fain","And then, Tim, talking about your other questions, Europe was a particularly good year this year, but part of that was compared to the prior year. Next year, we have relatively modest capacity increases in, sort of, the 5-odd percent range; which is I think -- we think quite manageable, and as I mentioned, the tone of the market is very good. We also have Anthem of the Seas starting up; which -- it's not only the Chinese who are excited about Anthem, it's also the U.S. market and the European market. It's really doing very well. Allure of the Seas is going over there next year for the summer, and that should be a positive move. And so -- and then if you look at -- your other question was, sort of, how that all interrelates into the Caribbean, Caribbean capacity, once we get past the first quarter is also doing fairly well. We actually have a decline in capacity next year as opposed to the 13% spike in capacity this year. So overall, I think all of those things are coming together to produce this very nice tone as we're looking into 2015.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in relation to your booking curve commentary, are you seeing that extend in all geographic regions? I guess, as just a follow on to that. And then finally, TUI, with ongoing growth in the TUI Mein Schiff fleet, can you just give us some -- how we should think about the incremental impact of each ship to the profitability from TUI and then as it relates, of course, to your portion of those profits?","Jason T. Liberty","Tim, it's Jason. Just to comment real quick on the booking window. We have -- we've been talking about this for some time: An ongoing expansion in each key market of the booking curve.","Richard D. Fain","And, Tim, in relation to your question about TUI Cruises, TUI Cruises has been a very solid performer. I dearly wish it were included in our yield stats, because it would make them look very good. TUI Cruises has done an exceptional job of positioning itself in a very good way in a very good market. And the addition of these new vessels is really quite a powerful driver. The ships themselves are exceptional as the first ship's proven to be. And the fuel consumption is a fraction of what it was with the older ships. So that continues to be -- the new ships will continue to be powerful drivers, albeit below the line.","Jason T. Liberty","And Tim, just to add to your -- per your question, in terms of how to think about it. Obviously, this business performance improves every year. But I would look at as these ships are coming in on a pretty consistent basis, or about the same time, you can look at that year-over-year change as a way of thinking about the forward-looking years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman of Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","So obviously, a number of ships moving out of the Caribbean next year, and I think you spoke to trends commensurately getting better post 1Q. Can we maybe peel back the layers on that a little bit? Do you think that aggregate demand for the Caribbean market is getting any better? I think the comparisons probably get better post 1Q as well for the Caribbean. Or are you in fact seeing literally as ships leave that market, pricing firming up? And I guess, on the flip side of that, as some of the ships leave the Caribbean and go into other global markets, are you seeing any negative impact on pricing in those markets as that capacity gets added?","Jason T. Liberty","James, so I think looking at the Caribbean in itself, obviously, in the first quarter, there is some additional capacity there, for the industry and for us. There's also additional capacity with Quantum out of the Northeast. So that has some level of stress in the first quarter. But then as us and our competitors are taking capacity out, we are seeing the need for promotional activities to really be modified in terms of us having to do anything tactically. What we're not seeing is, as the capacity is going into other markets like Europe and Asia, a need for that environment to act in any way like the Caribbean environment did this past year. So we're not seeing a need to be promotional or do any unusual tactics in order to stimulate demand.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Very helpful. And then just to follow up on the whole Ebola issue. It sounds like in spite of that, you feel pretty good about next year, but how should we think about that? Do you think that it's having any discernible impact on your business for the fourth quarter and '15? Or would things have just looked all the better, had you not run into the Ebola hiccup here. You spoke to what SARS did to your business. Are you seeing a similar impact from Ebola?","Richard D. Fain","We're not seeing anything like the situation we had with SARS. I think the impact, so far, has been very small, and in fact, if anything, the press seems to have changed, so there's much more discussion of why we overreacted rather than the actual overreaction. So no, we're not seeing anything -- so far, we're not seeing anything like the situation with SARS. I gave that parallel because I think we've had a lot of questions as to how should one look at these things and if there had been an issue. But at this point, we're not seeing anything like that. The impact has been quite small.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on Europe. So I'm a little bit surprised by the strength of the comments that you made with respect to Europe, given that there is a 5%, 5.5% capacity growth and still a relatively soft economy. Can you give us a little bit more color on where you're seeing that strength? What is the source of it?","Jason T. Liberty","Hi Harry. It's Jason. Similarly, last year, we saw very strong demands pattern coming from North America as well as from Europe. And those are very similar demand patterns, actually, probably slightly elevated demand patterns that we're seeing from the North American consumer for European itineraries as well as for European -- selling European itineraries. It's obviously still very early in the cycle, especially for the European consumer. But those trends are continuing to bode well.","Richard D. Fain","Harry, I think also -- sorry, it's Richard. If you could also -- your comment was more addressed, sort of, in a macro sense. And part of what we're seeing is the strength of our brands. And I think people always underestimate the importance of brand and the brand strength, how that gets communicated to the consumer, both directly and through the travel agents. And we have done a lot that has strengthened the role of our brands. I think that is being seen, as I say, both by the public individually but also the travel agents who continue to be an important driver. And so that also helps us do perhaps a little better than might be seen, purely looked at it from a macro point of view. And that's why we've put a lot of focus on developing our brands.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So then the follow-up question would be, can you remind me what the mix of North American passengers is typically in Europe?","Jason T. Liberty","Hi Harry. About 1\/3 -- well, 2\/3 of the guests for European sailings come from Europe, with the balance coming mainly from North America.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two questions. One is just to clarify, since I think there were some questions about Q4. If you could just tell me if I'm thinking about the math right. Really, even without the $0.07 of benefit from the accounting change, the only thing really changing are some expenses shifting between quarters, and of course, FX and fuel, which we knew about before today. But on a fundamental basis, it looks like your guidance for Q4 is just the midpoint of what you talked about before. So tell me if I'm doing the math right, but I don't actually see a change in any of the drivers. So I would -- it looks like it's, kind of, relatively in line. And then my second question is when you sold the ship to Ctrip, you really didn't say much about it, but Ctrip's talked about having discussions with you to do a joint venture. So I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how soon Ctrip's -- this startup cruise line could be operating and selling in China?","Jason T. Liberty","Robin, just taking on Q4. The proration was always in our guidance, or even in the implied guidance previously. So our business is actually slightly better in Q4 than we had anticipated. Some of that comes from cost, but some of that's also top line, and some is also below the line. But in general, it's slightly better. Unfortunately, currency has been a headwind for us, with mainly the strengthening of the pound, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar during that period which is more exposed to those currencies.","Richard D. Fain","And Robin, to answer your second question, as you pointed out, we haven't said a lot about that. Ctrip did make some comments. But our practice has been not to really talk about things unless they are firm. And while we did enter into a letter of intent with them and are pursuing those conversations, we really feel that these are the sorts of things any prudent businessperson looks at. But until they're final, they're not final, and we don't speculate on where that might lead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva of Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","A couple of questions on the cost side. Jason, you mentioned that half of the decline in Q3 was due to timing, and so that will be spent in Q4. What would be the biggest item there? Is it the advertising? I don't imagine it's drydocks at this point.","Jason T. Liberty","Hi Assia. Yes, so in terms of the cost side, the things that are shifting, it's really a sundry of different things. It's not one specific thing within the quarter. But some of that is -- it's mainly timing things around the things that we're doing on the ships.","Assia Georgieva","And overall, when you look at the full year, has your advertising spend been higher than you anticipated or pretty much in line?","Richard D. Fain","I would say largely in line.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. And the second question relates to scrubber technology. Do you anticipate a more accelerated drydock schedule over the next couple of years to be complying with the ECA regulations?","Jason T. Liberty","Hi Assia. In terms of our schedules, our capacity numbers, our CapEx numbers, all -- forward-looking, all contemplate the implementation of the Advanced Emissions Purification systems; which we call them scrubbers.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. And in terms of the actual cost of the drydock, we should expect possibly a slight increase in net cruise cost over the next 12 months, 18-month period, is that fair?","Richard D. Fain","We've -- all of that has been in our figures, we've been working on the AEP for a long time. And it's in all of our projections. We've been doing some of that. We have -- the first working scrubber came out 6 months ago. We had the first working scrubber on a new building 6 months ago. Quantum of the Seas has -- I'm sorry, AEP. Quantum of the Seas has and will next week, when she comes out, will have a good, working AEP system. We think we also have the only working prototype on an existing ship that I'm aware of. And that's been operating for quite a while for us. So we think we understand the cost. We've incorporated them in our guidance, and we're just moving forward. It is, of course, a new technology and new technology can bring surprises. But so far, we are moving along the trajectory that we set forth a while ago.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. And one last question. In terms of the booking curve and how far you're booked during 2015, is it fair to say that you're at about 25%?","Jason T. Liberty","We're not going to be specific on our exact book position. Typically, we have said in the past that we cross the year at about 50% booked, and that's traditionally pretty linear. So you can try to work in the math from there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs. Okay. Your next question comes from Jaime Katz of Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So the guidance for next year sounds like it implies that yields will be slightly higher at least; which has some implications for the cost, at least on an as-reported basis, perhaps they could tick up. So can you talk a little bit about the best opportunities you have to control those costs or maybe where you might see some headwinds in the year ahead?","Jason T. Liberty","First, I mean, just to point out, we really pointed to that we were comfortable with that number. So you can imply different -- people can have different scenarios in terms of what the key statistics will look like. There are always headwinds in which we're facing, investments in new opportunities, there's inflationary costs and so forth. And then there are also opportunities; which we try to balance in that conversation as it relates to scale and as it relates to just general continuous improvement activities; which is why we still maintain very committed to our cost-conscious culture. But there aren't -- there isn't anything in particular that is a serious headwind. But as Richard commented in his remarks, we are looking -- there is possible spend on things that we would see a quick turnaround in terms of bottom line performance on that we're always considering.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Rollo of Morgan Stanley.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First question was just on the pricing approach. I think you said you're going to take a more consistent approach that could offset load factors. It sounds like a price increase, but could you just talk a bit about that, please?","Richard D. Fain","Well, I think it's pretty dramatic for us to be in a position where despite a quite considerable amount of -- 2 new ships coming on next year, in our core markets, U.S. and Europe, we actually have fewer beds to sell. And I think that's a testament to the strength of the market. We've also indicated that they are on the books at higher pricing. And one of the comments that we made, and I think everybody is aware of, is that it is a significant de-motivator and source of quite a bit of upset when somebody books the cruise early and then the price goes down as we approach the end. So clearly, we feel that we're in a position to hold the price and not to give the kind of last-minute discounts that were more a feature, particularly this year in the Caribbean. And we think we're in a position to do that, and that's our plan going forward. And I think that's part of the reason why we feel so confident in what we said, the specific guidance we have given for 2015. I think it is also more generally a positive indicator for the achievement of our Double-Double Program.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So is this, sort of, a change in the strategy away from maximizing occupancy or is it just a function of the stronger demand environment?","Richard D. Fain","I don't -- I think it is a realization that our objective is always to maximize our total revenue -- total net revenue. And it's our view is to the best way to accomplish that. So it is a bit of a change, and it's a change that's enabled by the better markets. So I'm not sure which comes first, but it does reflect a change, and in my mind, not a trivial one.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then could you help us understand this, sort of, yield benefits from Quantum and Anthem next year. In the past you've said these newer vessels generate at least a 20% yield premium. And I think together, those 2 are about 6% of your capacity. So is it fair for us to say that the mix benefits about or at least 1% to the group from those ships next year?","Jason T. Liberty","I won't comment specifically, Jamie. But what we have said, for ships that are post 2006, that those ships were delivering yields that were 25% higher than ships from previous periods. I do think it's -- you kind of using that as a default is a prudent way of looking at the contribution for Quantum and Anthem. Obviously, ships post 2006 have Oasis and Solstice and Freedom class and so forth in there. And obviously, with Quantum coming out and our commentary about their booking similarly to Oasis and Allure can, kind of, help you index to where that probably settles out.","Jamie Rollo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just final one. On the TUI JV, the other income line was very big, $18 million, $19 million. How much of that was TUI, please?","Jason T. Liberty","We don't specifically call out TUI, but a large percentage of that is related to TUI.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to delve a little bit more into the Chinese, kind of, opportunity that you have because it's obviously becoming much more important. So could you, kind of, update us on what the distribution structure looks like in China and then how that passenger really behaves on the ship relative to what we see in North America or in Europe?","Adam M. Goldstein","Sharon, it's Adam. So as we've said many times, and probably will continue to say for a while, as excited as we are about the strategic opportunity, this entire market situation is very much still in its infancy. And one of our biggest responsibility as an industry leader is to develop the kind of distribution fidelity in China that we have earned over the years in North America and in Europe. It is there to a degree. It's particularly concentrated today in the large coastal population centers in and around Shanghai and in and around Beijing and Tianjin. It clearly has the opportunity to go over more of the country as time goes on. I suspect we're going to see new forms of distribution emerging in China; not only different from what there is today, where some of the traditional distributors from earlier times remain relatively visible in the distribution equation, to possibly, forms of distribution that we haven't seen anywhere, because China is just such a novel and different proposition. But what's interesting is that as travel agents are learning more about our products and services and beginning to experience them for themselves. They are apparently forming the same type of enthusiasm to explain them to prospective customers as we've seen in other markets. So the second part of your question about the experience on board, the Chinese clearly love the product. We get very strong ratings from a satisfaction standpoint. Interestingly, for the Royal Caribbean International brand, which anyway has sort of been focusing in recent years on multigenerational family travel, and I would say excelling at that, that's a very relevant proposition to the Chinese consumer, with the single child policy and a lot of vacations taking place in the form of grandparents, parents, and child and all generations of the family enjoying themselves on our ships. We are trying to introduce them to Western experiences, at the same time as tweaking culinary and entertainment and activities to make sure they can, sort of, go in and out of their Chinese comfort zone into Western experiences as they see fit. It's hard to generalize about a whole nationality, but clearly, the Chinese customers enjoy being where the action is on board, in terms of activities and culinary and -- or maybe not as much in the outdoor areas as they are -- as we see in other markets. But overall, they love their cruises just like pretty much everybody else in the world.","Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And Adam, I think I was kind of gearing towards, is the on-board spending profile similar to what we see in other regions?","Adam M. Goldstein","There are differences from line to line compared to other nationalities; which we prefer to keep that differentiation to ourselves. But overall, it's a very positive on-board revenue environment compared to our norm.","Jason T. Liberty","Thank you for your assistance, Brandy, with the call today, and we thank all of you for your participation and interest in the company. Laura will be available for any follow-ups you may have, and we all wish you a great day.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"19038":["Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) Q1 2014 Earnings Call April 24, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Jason T.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. 2014 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Jason Liberty. Please go ahead.","Jason T. Liberty","Thank you. April. Good morning. I would like to thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Celebrity Cruises; and Laura Hodges, our Vice President of Investor Relation.","During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our Investor website, www.rclinvestor.com. Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined. And also, a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.","Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview of the business, and I will follow up with a recap of our first quarter results. We'll provide an update on our business environment, and Adam will provide an update on Quantum of the Seas, China and Caribbean. Michael will provide an update on Europe, Alaska and onboard, and then I will walk you through our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. We will then open the call up for your questions.","Richard?","Richard D. Fain","Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everybody. It's a pleasure to provide some commentary on what's happening in 2014. And certainly, we have a lot to comment on. Most importantly, it's a real pleasure to be talking today about how we're beginning to realize the potential of our business model, rather than having to point out how resilient we are. Of course, we have a long way to go, but the fact that we're able to present such a very positive picture demonstrates the excellent trajectory that we're on. Now as you know, the first quarter ended up near the low end of our previous guidance, but that's accounted for by several small incidents during the quarter. Any business expects some anomalous events impacting individual quarters, but our plan is to make sure that we compensate for that in the course of the year. I'm particularly proud of the cost discipline our teams have exercised and what that means for our ongoing results. They have accomplished this while maintaining focus on the things that make us money. For example, they continue to focus on a product quality that astounds our guests, and they remain focused on communicating this amazing product ever more effectively.","The biggest improvement in our returns will come from getting paid better for the tremendous vacations we offer. Getting that message out there is one of our biggest opportunities, and the results show that our teams are working hard to maintain that balance.","We've also had some big announcements during the quarter. First of all, Adam's promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer of the group is exciting for him and for all of us. After 12 years of ably running the Royal Caribbean International brand and, of course, 26 years with the company, we think this move will allow us to do an even better job of exploiting best practices across all of our shared services areas.","Next, we announced that we completed the sale of Pullmantur's non-core businesses. This is an important step in shifting Pullmantur from one of our biggest challenges to one of our biggest opportunities. Then, our joint venture German cruise line, TUI Cruises, takes delivery of our new ship, Mein Schiff 3, in almost precisely 1 month from today. Actually, as we speak, the vessel is out on sea trials, and she is spectacular. We do talk a lot about new ships in our market over here, but Mein Schiff 3 is a dramatic addition to the German scene, and I don't think that we put enough emphasis on that on this side of the ocean. One interesting feature of this ship is that she will be the first cruise ship ever constructed with the new advanced emission purification system already installed. This system, this AEP system, also known as scrubbers, purifies the exhaust and removes the sulfur down to less than 0.1%. We've had one of the first successful prototype AEP systems in the industry on Liberty of the Seas. We've had that for some time. But this ship, Mein Schiff 3, will be the first new building to incorporate this technology as a new ship.","We are also -- we earlier announced a major strategic move with Quantum of the Seas dedicated to the China market. We consider this a very important market for our future, and we intend to maintain a preeminent position. And obviously, Quantum will do that for us -- help do that for us.","Lastly, I'd like to talk about something that may sound technical but, strategically, is really very important. That announcement was an increase in internet bandwidth. I would refer you to the slide here that shows a progression of our internet bandwidth on Oasis of the Seas. Over a year -- so we originally had what's shown on the slide as legacy systems, which gave us 4 megabytes per second download capability. And over a year ago, we changed out these old legacy satellite systems to a much better system provided by Harris CapRock.","The new Harris CapRock system has substantially improved our internet capabilities, and they, today, give Oasis of the Seas one of the fastest internet services at sea, some -- more than 5x as fast as what had been there. But now, we're in the process of installing a new satellite system on Oasis, which offers not just a substantial improvement, but a truly transformational one. The new system is provided by a very innovative company called O3B, and their mission is to bring internet to the parts of the world that don't yet have good connectivity. Until now, you could include cruise ships in that category. And that new system, which is providing some 500 megabytes per second of download capability, is already functioning on a test basis on Oasis, and we expect it to be completely rolled out by early this summer.","Interestingly, this system, by itself, will give Oasis of the Seas more internet bandwidth than every other cruise ship of every other cruise line in the world, combined.","Now this is not only an important feature for so many of our guests; we believe it will be of particular help in attracting Millenials to us. We're starting out with this on Oasis and Quantum Class ships, but if it's as successful as we expect, we would consider rolling it out to more ships as well.","By the way, I'd just also mentioned that not only is it more bandwidth, but the latency, the time it takes for the signal to go back and forth, goes down from a norm of 750 microseconds to 140. So it'll be very fast and very helpful to us. As you can see, our company and our people are on a roll.","So with that, I get to turn it back to Jason.","Jason T. Liberty","Thank you, Richard. Now I'd like to talk to you about our results for the fourth -- first quarter. Now unless I say differently, all metrics will be on a constant currency basis. We have summarized our first quarter results on Slide 3. For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $0.21 per share, which was at a low end of the $0.20 to $0.30 range that we had provided in January.","So unfortunately, we had to shorten or cancel 6 voyages in the first quarter, which cost us $0.05. Some examples of these disruptions included the oil spill by a cargo ship collision with a barge in the Gulf of Galveston, which caused the port to close and affected the sailing. To give you another example, a steel fishing net that was floating beneath the surface in the Tokyo shipping channel had damaged a propeller, which affected 2 of our sailings. So if not for these unplanned events, our earnings would've been slightly above the midpoint of our previous guidance.","Net revenue yield were down 30 basis points for the quarter. Exclude these voyage disruption, yields were slightly better than flat and in line with our previous guidance. It is worth noting that, in the first quarter, we were up against a very high comparable. The first quarter of last year was one of the highest-yielding first quarters ever. Ticket revenue yields declined as a result of voyage disruptions and the expected lower pricing in the Caribbean.","Now as a reminder, we have our greatest exposure to the Caribbean in the first quarter, where the Caribbean represents approximately 2\/3 of our capacity. While not enough to offset lower Caribbean yields, we continue to see strong yield growth on sailings in Asia, even with the significant capacity increase in the region.","The onboard revenue yields continued to advance. In the first quarter, onboard yield increased 3.4% as we continued to see the benefits of our fleet upgrades and onboard revenue management initiatives. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, were up 1.3% for the quarter, which was better than our previous guidance of 2% to 3%. The favorability was driven mainly by timing.","We ended the quarter with over $900 million in liquidity. Now during the quarter, we utilized our liquidity to settle the maturity of our approximately $1 billion Eurobond.","Last year, we took a series of actions as part of our profitability improvement program, which included a global restructuring and the sale of Pullmantur's non-cruise business. As we discussed at that time, the accounting rules dictate that some of these charges for these decisions are spread out over a period of time in 2014.","In 2014, we will recognize $23 million in expenses associated with restructuring, as well as losses of $11 million associated with the sold business, which closed at the end of the first quarter. $19.6 million of this was included in the first quarter results, and the rest will be recognized later this year. Note that these items are excluded from our key statistics and adjusted earnings. More detail for the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in the press release.","Now I'd like to update you on what we're seeing in the booking environment. Since our last call, booking volumes have been accelerating. The past 8 weeks have been much stronger, with bookings up more than 20% year-over-year. While the strong demand trends have been partially driven by promotions available for Caribbean sailings, we are also seeing elevated levels of quality demand for itineraries not being discounted.","So as a result, our book load factors and APDs for the year are higher than same time last year. While revenue expectations at the itinerary level have shifted slightly, revenue guidance for the full year remains unchanged, as we've been able to offset the voyage disruptions experienced in Q1.","Looking forward, we are even more bullish than we were at the beginning of the year for China and European sailings and have incorporated a more conservative outlook for the Caribbean. While we were seeing strong bookings for the Caribbean, with recent booking volumes trending well above last year's levels, the environment remains very promotional.","The pressure on pricing has almost -- has mostly been limited to 7 night and shorter Caribbean itineraries, as we are seeing continued yield growth on long Caribbean sailing. So although pricing is down overall, we are still generating historical premiums for newer hardware and expect to see higher Caribbean load factors than last year during the summer.","So as Caribbean capacity for the industry is up more in Q2 than in all other quarters, that is subsequently where we expect our largest yield decline for the Caribbean. European sailings have exceeded expectations and are booked at significantly higher load factors and prices than same time last year. Demand and pricing have been broadly strong for these itineraries, with all key source markets trending ahead. Trends have been particularly strong for North America, and we are finally starting to see a recovery in pricing from Southern Europe.","We are expecting European [indiscernible] areas, which account for 22% of our capacity this year, to generate double-digit improvements versus 2013 and higher yields than 2008.","For Asia Pacific sailings, which account for 12% of our capacity, continued to exceed both pricing and volume expectation. China sailings, which represent about 1\/3 of this capacity, those are expected to generate double-digit yield improvements. This is in spite of a 30% year-over-year capacity increase in the market.","As Richard discussed, we are very proud of the cost discipline ingrained throughout our culture. Last year, as part of our profitability improvement program, we took several steps to significantly reduce our cost in 2013 and expect to be flat to slightly down in 2014, despite inflationary pressures, rising insurance premiums, as well as nominal capacity growth.","To achieve this, we focused on reducing our global acquisition cost by also improving service levels, which included outsourcing our call centers and further centralizing back office functions.","We also went through an extensive benchmarking process that brought our running cost closer to the best-in-class while not affecting the guest experience or crew welfare.","Another major initiative was recapturing scale in back office areas that had grown excessively. While we are very proud of these achievements today, we continue to identify further opportunities through benchmarking, as well as synergy opportunities amongst our brands that help maintain our cost discipline while allowing for further investments in our product and business expansion.","I would now like to ask Adam to give you an update on the Caribbean, as well as Quantum of the Seas and our much-anticipated arrival in the Chinese market, and Michael to provide an update on Europe, Alaska and onboard. Adam?","Adam M. Goldstein",".","Thank you, Jason. There is a lot going on in our business at the moment. Our main focus is to continue to drive strong revenue in the Caribbean, given the competitive trading conditions that exist in this important market. As you have heard, the Caribbean sector continues to experience significant promotional activity. Fortunately, the additional flexibility to craft attractive promotions that we recently instituted in our system has enabled us to compete more effectively in a tactical environment than we would have been able to do in past years. As a result, our bookings in March and April, relative to the same time last year, have improved double digits, thus improving our occupancy positions overall.","Directionally, short and 7-night Caribbean sailings are the most impacted by the promotional environment. As a result, we still expect Caribbean itineraries to be down slightly year-over-year. While we are now entering the summer Caribbean season with the annual reduction in capacity, we expect, and our forecast expects, continuation of a promotionally-oriented Caribbean market environment for the remainder of 2014.","Before leaving this topic, I will add that, while no Caribbean products are immune from the prevailing tactical environment, we are fortunate that our Oasis-class ships continue to command the highest premiums in the Caribbean market, notwithstanding the newer ships that have entered the market since 2010, when Allure of the Seas entered into service. They clearly set the standard for family cruising in today's industry.","Moving to Quantum of the Seas, we are now 6 months from her delivery, and we are increasingly excited about Quantum on several fronts. In addition to the fact that she is currently in a very encouraging booked position in terms of both load factor and pricing, we recently unveiled her culinary approach under the name Dynamic Dining. Departing from our traditional main dining room concept, Quantum will offer 5 distinctly themed complementary restaurants, one of which is reserved for the use of suite guests. In total, she will offer 18 culinary venues, including the new Wonderland specialty restaurant concept, as well ass restaurant featuring our relationships with Jamie Oliver, Michael Schwartz and Devin Alexander. Dynamic Dining was exceptionally well received by the media, travel agents and our loyal guests.","Last week, we were in the news for the announcement that Quantum will move to Shanghai, China, at the conclusion of her inaugural winter season out of Bayonne, New Jersey. This is obviously a significant strategic move that will clearly establish Royal Caribbean International as the leader in the rapidly emerging Asia Pacific cruise market, with a particular focus on China.","We continue to be very pleased with the performance of Mariner and Voyager of the Seas in Shanghai and Tianjin, respectively. Our 2014 summer China season is booked far ahead of the same time last year at a higher rate. The travel agents and tour operators are increasingly comfortable resuming itineraries, which include Japanese ports. We believe our already strong onboard revenue on China-based cruises will improve even further based on our greater experience and the world-class retail brands, which we continue to bring on board with each passing year.","As you have heard, we are expecting a double-digit yield increase in 2014. At the same time we announced Quantum's move to China, we also announced that we will relocate Liberty of the Seas to Bayonne, New Jersey, for the summer 2015 season. Liberty will become our first Freedom-class ship to serve the Bermuda market. For the winter 2015, '16 season, Quantum's sister ship, Anthem of the Seas, will take over the Bayonne, New Jersey, program, offering cruises to the Bahamas and the Caribbean. We are pleased to be able to strengthen our presence in the New York area, even as we are pursuing our interests on the other side of the world. With the third Quantum-class and the third Oasis-class ship arriving in 2016, we will enjoy additional flexibility with which to accomplish our strategic market objective.","Finally, as it relates to my assuming a new management position at RCL, the parent company, I'm very enthusiastic to participate more broadly across the company's brands and functional areas. We are fortunate to have a very strong shared services capability. However, there is always room for improvement and for wider dissemination of best practices. That will be a focus for me, along with the further development of our global footprint.","In closing, I would like to thank the outstanding management team at Royal Caribbean International for their support and their excellence over the last 12 years, and especially the men and women onboard the ships who have relentlessly delivered the WOW. It has been a great honor to lead such a brand. Michael?","Michael W. Bayley","Thank you, Adam, and good morning, everyone. European deployment remains a key driver of our profitability, with extremely strong demand driving premium yield. Capacity-adjusted bookings have been outpacing last year by more than 25% for the past 3 months. And as a result, both APD and load factor are significantly higher than same time last year, with load factor at its highest since 2007.","We are seeing strength across global source markets for our European itineraries. And as Jason noted, demand from North America has been particularly strong at increasing prices, and we already have more than 80% of our forecasted United States and Canadian revenue on the books. This is considerably more than same time last year.","Our brands are leveraging our relaunched ChoiceAir program to offer North American guests simple, convenient and easy-to-purchase European cruise vacations. ChoiceAir provides the lowest airfare guarantee, assured arrival, your choice of flights and 24\/7 support. The percentage of guests booked on European sailings who have purchased their air through us has doubled year-over-year. An added benefit of our ChoiceAir program is that it increases the retention of the booking. Both our Mediterranean and Northern European products are a higher booked position in prior year and are driving elevated PDUMs [ph], with Mediterranean sailings doing particularly well. The new Celebrity Cruises collection of 7-night round trip and open-door Mediterranean itineraries, which are combinable into 14-, 21- and 28-day sailings, continue to surpass our expectations.","In addition, the mini-European season for Oasis of the Seas in 2014 is also performing very well. We're expecting a second-year of significant yield growth for the Europe product, with yields to be up double digits versus 2013. Alaska was a key product for us during the highly profitable summer months, where it accounts for around 10% of our revenue. The product continues to be a solid performer, and we anticipate -- anticipate it to be one of our highest-yielding products for Q2 and Q3. We expect Alaska yields to increase in the low to middle single-digit range and to be similar to yields in our record 2011 season.","It is encouraging to see that both Europe and Alaska are shaping up very well for the all-important summer season. Shipboard revenue yields increased in the first quarter by 3.4% on a constant currency basis, marking 9 consecutive quarters of year-over-year onboard revenue yield growth. We continue to optimize each of our onboard revenue channels, driving margin improvement, and focus on the areas of most opportunity.","Our Celebrity Cruises brand has formed a partnership with Canyon Ranch, one of the world's leading spa and wellness brands. And today, onboard 10 Celebrity Cruise ships, guests can now enjoy the Canyon Ranch SpaClub at Sea experience.","We are differentiating our shore excursion program, offering a range of branded tours; for example, Azamara Club Cruises has added their Insider Access and Nights and Cool Places program, and Celebrity Cruises has launched Celebrity Exclusives and Celebrity Family Challenge.","In February of 2014, we completed the first full revitalization of our Voyager-class ship for the Royal Caribbean International brand with Navigator of the Seas. Two more Voyager-class ships, Voyager of the Seas and Explorer of the Seas, will be completing -- completed in the upcoming 12 months. A key feature of the Voyager-class revitalization is adding additional capacity, which will drive improvements in both tickets and shipboard revenue. Additional revenue-generating features, which includes pervasive Wi-Fi, multiple new dining venues, upgrades to the casino, retail and photography areas.","Jason, back to you.","Jason T. Liberty","Thank you, Michael. Taking into account all we just told you, now I'd like to summarize our guidance for the full year and second quarter. If you turn to Slide 4, you'll see our updated guidance for the full year 2014.","Net revenue yields and net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be consistent with our previous guidance. Net yields are expected to increase between 2% to 3% for the full year. And net cruise, excluding fuel, for 2014 are expected to be flat to slightly down.","Strengthened pricing for European and Asian sailings, combined with stronger onboard revenue expectations, is offsetting the competitive pressures in the Caribbean. Our cost guidance is unchanged. We intend to invest more in sales and marketing efforts in China. Our fuel costs for the year have increased the $957 million, driven mainly by rate, and we are 55% hedged at a price of $616 per metric ton.","In the first quarter, we continued to leverage our improving credit profile in a healthy banking market to further reduce our interest expense for the balance of the year. These savings, combined with a weaker dollar and further operating improvements in TUI Cruises, are expected to improve our bottom line by approximately $0.05 in 2014. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to be between $3.25 and $3.45 for the year.","Now I'd like to walk you through the second quarter guidance. On Slide 5, we have provided guidance for the second quarter. Net revenue yields are expected to increase between 1.5% and 2.5%. Strong pricing for European and Asian itineraries is offsetting the promotional Caribbean environment. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be down 2% to 3%, and we have included $245 million of fuel expense for the quarter. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.55 for the quarter.","With that, I will ask our operator, April, to open up the call for questions-and-answer session. April?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. You mentioned that European bookings are improving. What are the expectations for the European consumer? Is it just you're offering different and maybe more innovative product, or is it just broader European consumer trends? And then Jason, maybe you can just give us a little bit more discussion on the 6 unplanned voyage disruptions. You gave 2 examples. I frankly don't remember seeing these in the press, and I don't remember an EPS estimate change during the quarter on them. So I'm wondering how you think about these disruptions and when, in the future, would you give us an update on any impact to EPS?","Michael W. Bayley","Steven, this is Michael. I'll take the first question on Europe and the European consumer. It's difficult to pinpoint one particular item. I think it's a variety of benefits that we believe our brands have in the European market as it relates to the European source market. I mean, obviously, we've done a lot of work in making our products easier to sell. We have what we believe are phenomenal products, very innovative itineraries and significantly superior hardware. So when you combine all of those things together with a -- I think the fact that we are leveraging the European source market infrastructure that we've set up over the past several years, we're beginning to really see the benefit from that investment over time, and we've continued to do that. So, for example, in the U.K. and Irish market over the past 12 months, we've invested more, and we've created single-branded sales and marketing teams in that market, and we're seeing positive results from that investment. So I think it's really a combination of factors. And I think the underlying, probably, factor is the fact that the European market seems to be fairly strong, and we're seeing a bounce-back from the Southern European market as well.","Jason T. Liberty","On the incident side, all of these, individually, were small in nature, and that's why there wasn't any specific disclosure about them. I mean, some of them were -- in the press was on Explorer with the norovirus, as an example. But this is really a unique amount of affected sailings within the quarter. We will consider, as we always do, as these come up, on whether or not they're disclosable events.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Felicia Hendrix, Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Everyone, your comments on the current state of the industry was encouraging. I just wanted to talk about the Caribbean in more detail for a minute. I was wondering if you've seen a change since the end of March in terms of bookings or pricing. We've just heard that call volumes have slowed a bit, so I wanted to have you touch on that. And then, also in terms of the competitive pricing environment that you are seeing, is there any change there, again, since the end of March relative to euro pricing programs, your ability to price your product?","Adam M. Goldstein","It's Adam. So as you get further away from the WAVE, the bookings are normally trending somewhat down, so other things being equal, you would always expect to see April somewhat slower than March. So even at an equivalent level of promotional intensity, that would be an expectation. The point that we've tried to make in general, looking across the 2 months, is that they have had more volume than we would have expected for a normal March and April, and so we have been able to eliminate a good portion of the Caribbean load factor deficits that we've had prior. So -- and I think I mentioned in my commentary that if you compare March and April this year to March and April last year, we were up double digit booking volume. So the combination of the 2 show that there is a market reaction to promotional intensity, and we're pleased about that, but April is normally slower than March.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. The slowdown that you're seeing this year isn't any different than what you've been seeing in the past?","Adam M. Goldstein","I don't know the percentage point, I just know that it's -- we would expect that to be the case, and that has been the case.","Richard D. Fain","I think, Felicia, I think the point, as Adam said and as we mentioned in the release, we really have been a little bit surprised that the post-WAVE period has been as strong as it's been. The volumes have just been unprecedented. The WAVE that we described earlier as typical, and that is what the WAVE ended up being, and I think that generated a little bit of concern on our part if that continued. And then slightly to our surprise, the volumes really picked up in the post-WAVE period, which isn't the normal pattern. But as Adam said, we drove a lot of that by the promotional pricings that we did. And actually, both the Royal Caribbean International brand and Celebrity had some very good and innovative ways of packaging. So the 123Go! and then Pick Your Perk and the \"kids sail free\" were ways of doing promotional pricing by adding on as opposed to by simply discounting the price, so giving the consumer more for the same price rather than giving them the same amount for a lesser price. And that actually turned out to be surprisingly effective.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's very helpful color. Jason, just quickly, I appreciate the color on what was driving the $0.05 increase to full year guidance. But you also are making up the $0.05 that you lost in the first quarter from the loss by voyages. So I was just wondering what was driving that, since your yields are essentially changed for the full year?","Jason T. Liberty","Yes. I mean, it's really driven around the commentary around the strength in Asia, Europe, as well as onboard. The collection of that is really making up that $0.05.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So I don't know who wants to take this, if Adam wants to take it, but if you look at the Caribbean, your view on the Caribbean now versus where it was about 6 months ago, can you comment on how you see that market today versus, again, a couple of months ago? Is it the same? Is it getting a little bit better? Is it getting worse? Maybe some commentary around that would be helpful?","Adam M. Goldstein","Well, we understood, and I know we talked about in the last couple of quarters, the fact that we saw the Caribbean as having a promotionally-oriented outlook to it, and that has continued to be the case. What we have also now seen, though, which was the news since the previous call, which Richard was just commenting on, is that we've been able to cause a pretty strong reaction, strong positive reaction in terms of generating volume in the Caribbean, with effective promotions. So we're clearly in a promotional environment. Our forecasting takes that into account and does not expect that to change substantially for the rest of the year. And we've made our guidance on that basis, so it incorporates our expectation for the Caribbean. So we would have loved to have been able to say that we're onto a different and less promotional chapter. But at the moment, we expect that to continue.","Richard D. Fain","Actually, and Steven, it's Richard again, as well. Can I -- just adding a little more color because I think we have tried to be clear that, directionally, the Caribbean is actually weaker today in terms of total yield than it was at the end of January, when we gave the last guidance. As Adam says, it's really been much more promotional. So we've generated the volume. And so when we talk glowingly about how the other markets are doing, we also -- that -- the implication, the converse is that the Caribbean is probably -- is, in our view, weaker than we thought it was going to be.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then second question, Adam, you gave a lot of color on Quantum and the decision to move that over to China. But I guess, bottom line, is that the decision -- a longer-term call on the quality of the Chinese market, or is it a call that, over time, you think the Caribbean will be a very tough market over the next couple of years?","Adam M. Goldstein","Definitely the former of those 2. We have, step by step, going back to at least 2008, been ramping up our presence in China. And we had -- we started with one of our smallest ships. I think we pointed out at the time that, from a research and development standpoint, that was an immaterial amount of our capacity to devote to an interesting opportunity. And we're now up to the point where, last summer and also this summer, we have Voyager of the Seas and Mariner of the Seas there, 2 Voyager-class ships, clearly doing very well. And our sense was that the brand's capability and the attributes of Quantum of the Seas made sense for us to take a bold next step for 2015. So it's not a commentary on any other market. It's a commentary on what we believe is an important future opportunity for the company that's actually delivering results right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","So obviously, a lot of hand-wringing about the growth in Caribbean capacity this year. You guys are moving an enormous ship out of the Caribbean into China for next year. I think Norwegian announced that they are moving one of their Caribbean sailings to Europe. I know that all of the itineraries aren't set in stone, but given all this reallocation of capacity, how should we think about the growth overall, on a net basis, that we're going to see in the Caribbean in 2015? How do you guys think about that?","Jason T. Liberty","On a Caribbean perspective, I think, for next year, with Quantum moving into China, I would expect Caribbean capacity to be very slightly up for next year. Obviously, not knowing what is going to happen with the other players in the industry, but for us, that's what our expectations are at this point.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then on Quantum, when they make the move from the Caribbean to China, should we expect pricing to generally be the same across those 2 regions or a little bit up, a little bit down? How should we think about that?","Adam M. Goldstein","I just want to be clear that -- are you contrasting the China region with the Caribbean region? Are those the 2 that you're talking about?","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, with specific focus on the move of the Quantum. Will it benefit from pricing as it makes that move on those Chinese itineraries, or is it going to be a net neutral?","Adam M. Goldstein","Okay, thank you. Understood. So Quantum, as I remarked upon earlier, is in a very favorable position for her inaugural winter season serving Bahamas and the Caribbean out of New Jersey. So she is doing very well. And we also expect her to do very well in China, both from a ticket and on onboard perspective. So it's too early to say the exact comparison, but there is -- we're very confident that she will maintain a high level of performance in both respects.","Richard D. Fain","James, if I could just also ask -- add one other thing. You asked about the revenue, but I think we also should maybe round it out by saying, as we've said before, it is more expensive to operate in China. You do have to go after the market. You do have to build a strategic foothold there, et cetera. So there are costs. I think, as Adam says, we would expect the net of that to be positive. But you asked about one side, and I just want to make sure we're also answering the other part.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","It's very helpful. And then just last quick housekeeping question here. It looks like sort of your guidance today versus where it was 3 months ago, it seems like you're getting a little bit of benefit from currency, but it looks like your -- it looks like that benefit's yields haven't changed costs, is that how I should think about that, or is that just sort of a rounding thing?","Jason T. Liberty","Yes. It's definitely more of a rounding thing. On the cost side, some of the currencies that have either helped or affected us are -- some positions were long-end, some were short-end. But for the most part, it's rounding that's causing that differential.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Ferraz with Morgan Stanley.","Andrea Ferraz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just one question from me. You've mentioned that you are expecting Caribbean capacity to be very slightly up next year. Given that this is the -- being the weakest market and the increasing promotional activity, is this just because you didn't have enough time, perhaps, to change the capacity? Or is it just too challenging to put ships in other regions over Q1 and more the winter months?","Adam M. Goldstein","It's Adam. It's actually, mostly, a mathematical function of the fact that our long-disclosed Caribbean deployment through first quarter this coming year has a first quarter increase that's still relatively higher. According to our disclosed deployment for the back 3 quarters of next year, to Jason's commentary, it's basically flat.","Andrea Ferraz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And -- but the year after that, would you be considering perhaps moving some capacity out. And also, specifically on the Anthem, for example, it's going to be based in Southampton for the summer and then moving on to New York. Is that coming back to Southampton, or is that going to stay there?","Adam M. Goldstein","Okay. So we have not disclosed any particular deployment decisions far into 2016. Obviously, one of the great advantages of our business model is the ability to move ships around, particularly amongst the 3 regions of the world that are now very important to us: North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. So we continue to evaluate what our choices are from second quarter 2016 forward. And we will make those announcements as they -- as we get to the point where we need to in the regular deployment cycle. But we do understand, and we evaluate all the market performance very carefully and what we believe -- where we believe the ships can perform better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research.","Assia Georgieva","One quick question for you, Adam. And first of all, congratulations on your new position. Could you let us know whether China is profitable at this point?","Adam M. Goldstein","Thank you, Assia. Yes, China is profitable for us at this point. Even understanding, to Richard's earlier commentary, that we have a lot of work to do in building consumer awareness, creating travel agent familiarity with all -- with the concept of a cruise, not to mention our own products and services. There is more effort to be put in there in the near term. But the revenue performance of the market is very strong, and we are in a profitable position today.","Assia Georgieva","That's great. And going back to another market that seemed very promising and fast growing, South America, one of your competitors' brands had to scale back because of the high cost of operation. And you don't seem to be talking about South America so much. Could you let us know whether that has taken a back seat to expansion in China?","Adam M. Goldstein","Well, China is clearly very, very significant to what we're doing and inherent in the conversation, I believe, that we're having about it on this fall, particularly with the news about Quantum moving to Asia. We still see opportunity in Latin America. But it is true -- and we've been vocal and the whole industry has been vocal about there are cost pressures in Brazil that we would really love for the Brazilians to address because there's this market opportunity down there if the country would have a more favorable regime for cruising. So that's an opportunity, hopefully, for the longer term for us. But we don't mean, by the fact that we haven't been talking about it, that it isn't interesting to us or that we haven't been building up of our capabilities there. We have the Pullmantur brand, which is -- sees opportunity in becoming a brand known for its appeal to Latin American cruisers. But I think, from an overall strategic standpoint, particularly with respect to news for today, China is in the leadership position.","Assia Georgieva","I see. And a quick question for Mike...yes, Richard?","Richard D. Fain","I think, just to comment more on Pullmantur because we are making a thrust there, and talking about South America is a little bit like talking about Europe. It's -- although we talk about it as a place, it's really a series of quite individual countries. And while I think all of us have experienced the challenges that Adam referred to in Brazil, there's quite a few opportunities there, and our Pullmantur brand will be focusing on that, and we think that is an opportunity for the brand.","Assia Georgieva","I appreciate that color. And one last question for Michael. With Canyon Ranch onboard Celebrity, I would imagine a transition like can be somewhat like disruptive, especially when the ships are not in dry dock and you're doing it as you have ongoing Voyages. Can you describe to us, in a little bit of financial terms, I guess, how Canyon Ranch has performed relative to your prior operator?","Michael W. Bayley","Yes. I mean, we've actually, literally last week, finished the entire transition of Canyon Ranch onto the Celebrity fleet. We accomplished that in pretty much less than 4 weeks. And obviously, during that 4-week transitionary period, there was, inevitably, disruption. We managed to isolate, we think, the disruption quite well. So literally, the last day of the cruise and the turnaround day and the first day of the next cruise were disrupted. But I think we got ourselves through that pretty well. As it relates to revenue performance of Canyon Ranch versus the other operator, it's way too early to make a comment on that. We're literally one week post the transition of 10 spas. So I think we would probably be able to give you more color on that during the next call. But we're very optimistic. We are extremely pleased with the relationship. We believe we've got the perfect partner for our target market, and we certainly believe that we're on the right track with this relationship.","Assia Georgieva","And part of the 3.4% onboard increase, was that driven by spa or other items?","Michael W. Bayley","No. It was -- we saw a lot of strength with the gaming and beverage in the first quarter. So spa was not a key driver of the incremental revenue in Q1.","Assia Georgieva","Okay. And last quick question, are you protected on the downside in terms of minimum guarantees, et cetera, in case Canyon Ranch is able to scale having taken on so many new ships?","Michael W. Bayley","Yes, we are.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder, Wells Fargo.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Given that Europe has -- you've commented here for, now, 2 quarters in a row that it's been booking well, can you give us any color what you've seen specifically out of the European source passengers as you're in the WAVE season? I mean, you gave us a little bit already, but just some additional color that their WAVE season's begun here in April? And then, as it relates to the Med in particular, your comments that, that was getting better. What's driving that in particular for what you're seeing in the Med?","Michael W. Bayley","Mediterranean, I think, again, it's difficult to pinpoint one factor. I think it's a combination of factors. Part of it is probably capacity related. There's less capacity in the Mediterranean this year versus last year. I can't recall the exact percentage change, but there is less capacity. We're seeing a little bit more strength coming out of the European markets, particularly out of Southern Europe. And of course, we feel very good about our brands and the products that we've got on offer in those markets. So -- and we've worked hard at making these brands and products easier to sell through our distribution channels, plus, over the years, as I pointed out earlier, we've really invested and built what we think is a good European infrastructure as it relates to sales and marketing and revenue management capability in Europe, and we're beginning to leverage and see the results of that. So I think that's -- again, it's just a whole series of different factors. As it relates to, I think, the question on European bookings or a WAVE Period, we're seeing -- usually, around this time, we see a kind of a transition between U.S. bookings and European bookings for European product. And we're beginning to see the bookings from the European markets pick up quite nicely. So we feel quite good about what we're seeing out of the European markets, and it's really across all markets. One of the markets that we've been particularly pleased with, is the Spanish market that seems to have picked up quite nicely for us. And we're seeing strength out of the U.K. and Irish market as it relates to pricing.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And back to the Caribbean, correct me if I'm wrong here, it seems that your tone on the promotions -- and again, you'd said that overall, since the beginning of the year, your outlook for the Caribbean has weakened a little bit while other areas of the globe have strengthened. But between the 3- to 5-day market versus the 7-day market, in particular, it seems like maybe the 7-day as a whole, your comment there, it has become a little bit more promotional. And -- or has that -- the promotional activity really intensified, even more so, in the 3 to 5?","Adam M. Goldstein","We really haven't been that sharp in our distinctions. What we've said is 7-night and shorter cruises is where the most of the promotional intensity has been. And to the extent that the Caribbean area is somewhat weaker than we were expecting it to be 3 months ago, I think, you could characterize that weakness as pertaining to 3 through 7 nights. Not going into microscopic detail as between them. So it's just generally shorter cruise have felt the impact more than long Caribbean-type cruises.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to clarify, on the tour business that you're showing you have it held for sale, and if I'm reading it right, it looks like that added $0.05 to your reported earnings by taking the $0.05 loss and putting it in kind of unusual items now or one-time items. So I guess, I just wanted to clarify then, on a full year basis, does selling that add to earnings just from, basically, having the loss out of your recurring earnings? Kind of -- I just want to get a feel for that number. And then also, on your expense per day being flat to slightly down, is that excluding the tour business from both years, or is that -- is some of that improve helped by having the tour business out?","Richard D. Fain","Robin, I'll take first of those. The tour business has been plus or minus 0 for a while now. And it's had a couple of years where it's been marginally positive, a couple of years where it's been marginally negative. When we gave our guidance, we assumed it would be sold, and we left it out. We weren't sure exactly the closing date, so the exact amount of the loss. Obviously, January is the worst month of the year. So if we had finished something before that, we would have had less of a loss. And actually, it ended up closing at the end of January. So we had to absorb that month of loss. But none of that was in our projections, none of that was in our guidance. So the guidance remains like-for-like comparable. And I'll let Jason answer the second one, but basically that -- we kept the guidance so that the tour, when we talk about cost, is not a factor. So it's -- we're comparing like-for-like without the tour, without the tour. So when we're talking about cost being flat to slightly down, if we had included the tour, it would be actually down quite a bit because the tour was a big expense. But we took it out of both the before and the after.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, no, that's helpful clarification. Is there any way just to quantify what the decline if tour -- with tour in last year and not in this year, just to get a sense of the decline?","Jason T. Liberty","We could certainly offline, Robin, just walk you through, because those numbers are physically out there for us to show you.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then the other question was just the onboard was up nicely, and you mentioned some new programs, direct programs and things that you sell onboard, And I'm just wondering if there is a point where that anniversaries because when I look last couple of quarters, you've had really nice onboard, so there doesn't seem to be like -- it's not like there's -- I mean, you had 2 very strong quarters at the end of last year, but generally, you've had onboard up. So I'm just trying to get a sense of is there a point when that program started that it would anniversary and we would expect, maybe, the increases to be more in line with ticket price increases?","Richard D. Fain","A lot of that are -- is initiatives, but the initiatives we keep working on, I don't know that it's a point in time that one thing suddenly happened and we did it, but it's a series of things we've been working on. For example, the -- one of the big drivers has been the revitalizations. Those have been very successful for us, and they have been coming on or will come on. I think, last year we had a 7.5% improvement in onboard revenue, which was exceptional. But we keep working on improving it, but I think, obviously, we don't expect to continue to be generating 7.5% annual increases.","Jason T. Liberty","April, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your final question come from the line of Harry Curtis, Nomura.","Brian H. Dobson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","It's Brian Dobson in for Harry Curtis. Just a quick question on China. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on the breadth and depth of your sourcing operation over there and where you plan to source your passengers for the new ship?","Adam M. Goldstein","Okay. So we have 3 areas, which are developing nicely, with the main area of those 3 being the provinces in and around Shanghai. So with Quantum of the Seas herself going to Shanghai, that will be the most hurdle source market area for her. We have also been working very hard over -- since, again, going back again to 2008, in the Tianjin, Beijing northern area, where we have a Voyager-class ship on a regular basis there. The newest of the 3 areas that we are interested in, in the near term, would be the Pearl River Delta and the South of China plus Hong Kong. And all of those communities are obviously near to the coast. That's where most of the incoming wealth generation is taking place in the country. And over the longer term, we believe we will have opportunities in the inland cities and provinces. But for the near term and to support Quantum, it will continue to be mainly the coastal communities featuring Shanghai area.","Jason T. Liberty","Thank you for your assistance, April, with the call today. And we thank you all for your participation and interest in the company. Laura will be available for any follow-ups you might have, and I wish you all a great day.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
