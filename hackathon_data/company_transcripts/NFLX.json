I'm Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today, our CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, Spence Neumann; Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; and Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters.","Our interviewer this quarter is Mike Morris, Guggenheim. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary. ","With that, let me turn it over to Mike now for his first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","MikeMorris","Great. Thank you, Spencer and good afternoon. Before we dive into some of the details we provided in this quarters letter. I'd love to have Reed provide some strategic thoughts as we head into the New Year, the new decade. Perhaps we can start with just what were the most important strategic accomplishments in your mind of 2019? And as you look forward what do you hope to accomplish this year?","ReedHastings","We've had the same strategy basically for 20 years which has pleased our members and they helped us grow. Ad we've done that in a variety of ways. Of course, initially just with DVD-by-mail then the combination. And if you look at what we've done in expanding film and making that a really strong aspect of Netflix. We've had a lot of continuous progress. But the same strategy we've always done how do we learn? How to please our members? Whether that's on the product side, marketing side or content side. And the next decade we anticipate the same. How do we use the great resources that we have to do even better? ","MikeMorris","Now let's talk a little bit about some of the key specifics from the letter today. The first, of course, is the guidance on your member growth for the coming quarter. You have a very strong fourth quarter compared to your guide. The first quarter is lighter than it was in the prior year. You talked about some of the potential for timing between the first and second quarter. I think the key question on investors' minds is how to think about the full year. 2019 looked very similar to 2018 with the strong fourth quarter. How should we think about the coming year in that regard?","SpencerNeumann","You want me to take this one? ","ReedHastings","Sure. ","SpencerNeumann","I'll take this one, Mike. So and first, I just say, Mike, our opportunity, we view our opportunity are long-term opportunity, is big and unchanged. So we should be clear about that. We're not providing full-year guidance but when you think about Q1, again it's comping off of the all-time biggest quarter we've ever had in Q1 of last year. We guided to 7 million paid net adds in 2020. So when you look at that Q1, 2020 number of 7 million that's still big growth. That's-- we've only had four quarters in our history where we've grown more than 7 million in paid net adds. And the number specifically it reflects, first, there's primarily a US story there and that we've -- we have seen and we talked about in the letter. Some elevated churn in the US from combination of pricing and competition.","We've -- we can roll that through into Q1 including a full quarter of competition in Q1 versus a partial quarter in Q4. We also anticipate that competition rolling out globally throughout the year. So we're trying to be prudent of thinking about that impact throughout the business. And then we talked about as well as when we think about the seasonality, the arc between Q1 and Q2, the first half of the year, we think it's likely to be more balanced because of the timing of the price it changes. We took that rolled through Q2 of 2019. So we think that our seasonality is going to look more like 2018 and 2019 when you think about the first half of the year.","MikeMorris","Okay. When we talk about competition, you've mentioned churn a couple of times with respect to the potential impact. Can you talk about competition on both gross adds and engagement as well? Especially on engagement. I know it's early but clearly the Disney Plus product is a -- has a very heavy kids and family focus to it. Have you seen any specific engagement change on your content in that genre?","ReedHastings","Sure. Well, I'll jump and others can, we actually alluded to this in the letter, Mike. The great thing is, first off, we're growing in Q4 including in the US even with some of those noise from competitive launches. And ultimately what drives our business is increasing member satisfaction and viewing. And what you also see in the US what we saw across the board is that our viewing, our per membership viewing grew not just globally but in the US through Q4 and continues. So that bodes well for our long-term opportunity as long as we keep getting better.","SpencerNeumann","And, Mike, thinking with the Disney product, Disney Plus has a lot of great catalog product and one big new show Mandalorian. And it primarily is going to take away from linear TV and takes away a little bit from us. But again most of the growth in the future is coming out of linear TV.","ReedHastings","It draws down by a variety people because they were so broadly distributed prior to the launch.","MikeMorris","Okay. And I guess the last thing on this particular topic is the behavior outside the US as compared to the inside. Clearly within the US, a more mature market and that's where the products were primarily focused in the fourth quarter, their launches. We do have some more expanded international rollout particularly Disney talked about or announced a broader European rollout at the end of the first quarter. Any thoughts specific to that? Is that factored in? Is it one of many things? What's your thought there?","ReedHastings","It's one of many. I mean, Disney is going to be a global service quite quickly. And there are many other global services. Remember that we compete a lot for time with YouTube. And it's not dollars because that's ad supported. But we compete very broadly for viewing and as Spence mentioned our viewing on a per member basis is up. And that's because our content is getting better. Our service is getting better. And that's all coming out of linear TV.","SpencerNeumann","And I would say that they're --their brands are definitely global brands. But they're no --with the exception of China, they're not more popular than they are in the US anywhere else in the world.","MikeMorris","Okay. And so, Greg, a question on pricing. When we spoke last quarter, you felt that these competitive launches would not have an impact on your prices.","So I guess the first question is now that you have this quarter under your belt. Any update on that point in particular?","GregPeters","Yes. I think it's useful to start with just noticing that our revenue in the United States is up 23% year-over-year in Q4. So we're still seeing a pretty significant growth there. And we're not seeing anything that fundamentally contradicts our core model or suggests that it's changed in a material way. And that model is if we do a good job of judiciously investing, the money that our members give us every month and great stories and better product experiences creating more value for them then we occasionally earn the ability to come back to them and ask them for a little bit more money to keep that virtuous cycle of improvements going. And everything we're seeing continues to support that core models intact. So that's our job.","MikeMorris","Okay, great. And you go down that path a little bit further historically you have done some sizable price increases at least on a percentage basis on a somewhat spread out timeframe. How do you think about possibly doing perhaps a single annual price increase in a more mature market at a more modest rate? I hate to say this but maybe somewhat more similar what people have experienced with their cable bill or something to that effect.","GregPeters","We don't have a fixed model that our PR, we're coming in and saying this is the right approach. So I think our job is to actually listen to our members. Give it -- if the signals that they're giving us in terms of the engagement that we're seeing that we gain from growth that you heard we're going after. And we'll really use that as a mechanism to guide us towards when if we earned that opportunity to come back and ask for more. So we're not really coming in with just a fixed model that we're going to shift to or anything like that.","SpencerNeumann","And if we're -- we're putting hits on the board. And we can see that in the terms of watching an engagement and subscriber growth and growth and the zeitgeist to run our projects then the more --the more you can do that the more frequently you can go back. So we have to --we're in this great model of where we have to prove ourselves to our members literally every month. So it's really -- it does hold us to a very high bar and keeps us coming back and doing more and topping ourselves if we need to.","MikeMorris","One last question on this is around premium plan subscribers versus your standard plan subscribers which largest, you've mentioned in the past clearly the largest group. On what has been the trend with respect to your subscribers moving to the premium plan? And is there a way to further incentivize them to almost have a self opted price increase but also clearly getting an improved product as well?","GregPeters","I think we're --again constantly evaluating the right balance of what's -- what features, what prices at those various different tiers. But we haven't seen a significant shift in that. And we see a healthy take rate across all of our plan options which are a really good sign. I think that we're providing a range of options at a range of price points that allow consumers in the markets that we serve to sort of selecting into the right model. Again, we want to be innovative about that. And we'll look for ways to create more value across all of our tiers. But right now that blend is pretty healthy, we think.","SpencerNeumann","And, Mike, I would just add that in terms of plan mix, you have over the years seen a slight migration towards the higher price point plans. That is something that we have seen but it's quite gradual. So there's no sort of big jump in any sort of given quarter, but quite a gradual increase in that which I think maps to the growth in smart TVs and high-definition TVs.","MikeMorris","Okay. I'd like to switch to a few questions on content and content strategy. So, Ted, the ramp in feature-film product in particular both development release big step forward for you in 2019. As you looks into 2020 what are you most excited about either from a content perspective or an overall thematic perspective. There's a healthy amount of information on some key titles [Indiscernible] but would appreciate you highlighting the things that are most important to you.","TedSarandos","Well, looking forward to next year, we get the opportunity to do some things that we know have worked and come back with some sequels. And they are super popular. YA genres, we've got these rom-coms; To all the Boys I've Loved Before and Kissing Booth coming back with sequels in Q1 and Q2. We have a big ticket action films with Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth more like the things you've seen in Q4 and trying to program our movies like we do our series for every taste, every mood, every region of the world.","So it's not trying to make one-size-fits-all program. That's what we have so much of it, just what we all -- we want to hold it all to a very high entertainment bar. So you're going to see us working across all genres like we did in Q4 and still continuing to kind of press up the production quality and the production investment in these films.","ReedHastings","And those are all coming out in Q1 and Q2 of this year and some in Q3, Q4.","TedSarandos","Yes. ","ReedHastings","Just got a tremendous slate this year.","TedSarandos","Yes and I think the one thing we have been putting out in the letter, it's exciting that we end up with being the most nominated studio at the Oscars this year with our films. But the most exciting thing is those films are all incredibly popular with our members as well.","MikeMorris","So that leads into another question which is as you have sort of shifted and increased this focus on film, Ted, and particularly you've highlighted a couple of reasons for that and benefits to the members. Those have included some comparison with respect to the value proposition, right and compare to a film. ","TedSarandos","You know what a movie ticket costs so sure.","MikeMorris","Exactly. I think we've also talked about the ability for film content to travel. There's sort of a perhaps a broader global base of interest. Anything else that you would highlight or remind us up for why this shift in investment or maybe not shift but expansion is important? And also now we have another year under our belt with a pretty robust slate, so have things been progressing as you would have expected given those objectives?","TedSarandos","Yes. I would say, look, when I look back at Q4 I look back say, I'm glad we decided to do this about a year and a half ago. That's about the time it takes to secure the deals that obviously do the production and go get through post and get everything delivered at the level of quality that we were able to. And so now we have all of that kind of ramp up behind us. And while the steady flow of projects like you see in Q4. Similarly with the feature animation. When I see where we're at today with access to programming and all those other issues, we've been ramping up our feature innovation for almost three years. And it really hit the ground their first project with Klaus in Q4. There was a complete audience pleaser and an Oscar nominee for Best Animated Feature. And that will keep a steady drumbeat going there as well. ","In Q2, we have an animated feature called the Willoughby's and in Q4 we have Over The Moon, which is from Glen Keane, we did Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. So these are big theatrical scale animated features and big scale feature films that would be competitive with anything you would see in the box office. And I think people really do value them. And to your point they do travel much more predictably than TV series do.","MikeMorris","One of the things you just mentioned and clearly has been very widely reported and seen is the critical acclaim that you've achieved and you've had growth in Golden Globes, now at this point, Oscar nominations. My question is around the business benefit of that and the cost of achieving it as well. Maybe it's a somewhat open-ended question but how much is it costing you at this point to have those films in a place that they can be considered for that? And what does the timeframe for the benefit to, the business look like for that?","TedSarandos","What you've seen the expansion this last year within the confines of our existing content budget. So we're growing, it's how we're choosing to bring the incremental spending to the table in terms of the bigger breadth and scale of films, but not taking it away from our growth in series which is also growing and in particular in our local language series which we've reported before where we're growing by a 130 seasons of local language series around the world as well.","So to me, I look at it as the growth --the benefit to the business is the growth that you're saying.","ReedHastings","And I would just add to that. Sorry - you'll see that if we further our reputation for doing well for content, sorry for talent by being one of the best in the world at winning awards for our talent then the business benefit is that we will win deals that we wouldn't have otherwise won for incredibly entertaining content. So think of all of our awards work as a really smart way to make us the best home for talent in the world.","TedSarandos","I think it's also worth noting that there's a consumer component this too. I mean some of our members around the world use the awards piece as a sign of what they want watch so that when we present those, that information to them we actually see them respond to that. So there is an immediate benefit there as well. ","SpencerNeumann","And just one point one more time there is typically there seems to be a big gap between critical acclaim and award winning and popular. And we are really trying to do and we have in the past quarter achieved both of. Meaning we are bringing popular film to the market at such a quality that's also being recognized by the critics and by the awards groups.","ReedHastings","Sorry, Mike. I just want chime in just to that point, it is working already, and the model is working in terms of seeing the return to our business. I mean that programming at that level of diversity and quality across such a broad member base ultimately is driving member satisfaction. It's growing our member base, it's growing our revenues if you seen roughly 30% growth this year. We are growing our profits. Both our profit and margin and up to $2.6 billion of operating profit this year. We are delivering on our cash flow objectives including on a path to improve our cash flow profile next year as you saw in the letter, material improvement from negative $3.3 billion this year to roughly negative $2.5 billion next year on that path to cash flow positive over the coming years. So you are seeing it play out in the business model already. ","MikeMorris","To that point, Spencer, my next question for you is really around your cash investment. On content in a coming year, can you share a specific in terms of the growth that you are anticipating there? And also can you just help us with the modeling side which is the amortization of that content relationship between that amortization and the cash investment? ","SpencerNeumann","Yes, sure. So we'll continue to increase our content investment across the board next year. Because as I just said, we are seeing a great return on that in terms of our business model. Our content amort is just a little under $10 billion this past year in 2019. I think you should expect to see with our specific guidance, a similar level of growth and that kind of grew I say roughly in that 20% range this past year. And you should assume we will continue to invest at those types of levels this year. The conversion or the relationship between our cash spent and our amortization, that ratio was about 1.6 meaning 1.6x the cash investment relative to our amortization of about $15 billion of cash investment this past year in 2019. And you should see that ratio continue to come down a little bit. ","Again, without a specific number but we are scaling into the business. So we've moved the long way in this business model transition from what was once an all licensed content business to now the well over 50% of our cash spent is on originals, the future of our business is mostly originals. And we've very much transition there. So that puts less sort of pressure on our working capital, so that's playing out in the numbers as well. So similar growth rate and amortization, but it's getting closer in terms of our cash versus amort and you're seeing that in terms of the improvement in the cash flow trajectory next year.","ReedHastings","And, Mike, I am sure you realized it but it is a huge milestone in our growth of last year being peak negative free cash flow. And so we're on the glide path slowly towards positive free cash flow. We're excited about that but that's not coming from shrinking back our content spending. That's coming from the increase in revenue and operating income.","MikeMorris","All right, great. So let's pull it back a little bit and talk about some of the --couple of additional content issues or topics, if you will. Friends, a big title I believe one of your more popular titles came off the service at the end of 2019. I realize we're only three weeks in but you do see the data real-time. Has this content being moved off the platform impacted your consumer engagement, your member engagement at all?","TedSarandos","Nothing that we've seen or can measure.","MikeMorris","Okay. So let's also talk about viewership then. A couple things. I had a question here and then you gave us an entire page of viewership metrics [in form of letter]","TedSarandos","Mime that is why I should probably put a little more color on that simple answer. Just to say, we've had over the years incredible popular product come on and off the service and expires. And typically what happen is our members through our incredible personalization, deep library and broad library are able to find their next favorite show. And that does will happen with Friends. With Friends fans and some of them will find it elsewhere and some of them will find, some their next favorite show.","ReedHastings","Like, Mike, it was about years 10 ago we dropped, we had to drop all the Disney content, not phased out like we are but all the ones, we added to the Starz deal. And we were all worried about the big impact and instead people came back the magic of the personalized service and they were able to find other things to watch and viewing growth just kept rising. ","TedSarandos","Yes. And we've seen that phenomenon over and over again even in, when one that may be been even more dramatic than that was the all, the Nickelodeon content when they came up and was completely displaced by other kids watching overnight. I should say equally good content just people had the ability to find something new.","MikeMorris","Sure, understood. And so within that what I was coming to is the viewership metrics that you provided in the letter for a number of your programs. I'd be curious if you wanted to highlight something that stood out to you. But I'll tell you something that stood out to me is the information you provided about The Crown. Okay, so in particular season 3 saw growth and early season viewing and yet it's still I think by the metric 21 million households through the first four weeks of season 3 compared to 73 million households worldwide for the series overall. And I guess what strikes me is that they're -- your members have enough content that even though that was important to 73 million and 21 million was a big step up, they're still a 52 million yet to watch it. So --","TedSarandos","Correct. But I have mentioned with that first 28 days doesn't capture also are things like brand-new viewers to season 1 that just started in the ramp up to season 3. The show has been incredibly adorable in the UK, in the US and around the world.","MikeMorris","How does that compare to other key shows, right? I understand that every show doesn't behave like The Crown, but is that viewership pattern something that somewhat similar for a show like, let's say, Stranger Things that has three seasons and--","TedSarandos","It's so unique. Sometimes the show can enter the zeitgeist in such a loud way like Stranger Things season 3 around the 4th of July phenomenon, everything that happened that a lot of that viewing-- a lot of that viewing pops like that. Something similar we saw with a huge launch for Witcher, Witcher was kind of pent-up demand for known IP, but man people, the show delivered for people, who delivered viewing hours for us. And people loved it right out of the gate. Other shows come out and they pop and they're dependable and they build and people are going to watch it as soon as they finish what they're watching right now.","So it's very different from show to show. I see you can see that in that list of how those shows will perform. And sometimes that it's a really great indicator of its full-year performance. And sometimes its new shows will continue to build on their positive word-of-mouth and become even bigger over time.","MikeMorris","I'd like to ask a couple questions about product and distribution. So, Greg, I'd like to come back to the topic of pricing. We spoke a little bit about the US, but you have expanded your mobile-only plans I believe during the quarter. Can you talk about where that is now? I think it's India, Indonesia, I believe Malaysia but maybe the balance between what has become a more permanent part of your offering? What's still being tested and how we should think about that mix going forward?","GregPeters","Yes and you've got the three countries correct. And we've seen in the performance across those three countries is that because we've added this price at a lower price point, this year at a lower price point. We've been able to add incremental subscribers which are great. We've seen increase in retention not only at that noble plan but in other plans as well. And net that's a revenue positive action for us. And so we're super excited about that. We think that that's a pretty good indicator that there might be other countries around the world where that kind of offering will work as well.","So we're going to continue to test both that in different countries and see how that goes. We're also --we've got a bunch of different other approaches that we're going to try out and we'll really try and be active and innovative in that area to try and improve the accessibility of the service for more and more people around the world, but in a way which we think is long-term revenue optimizing as well.","MikeMorris","Can you expand on that as well in terms of expanding that availability?","GregPeters","I mean really I'd say that anticipate that we'll do more testing of the mobile plan in more territories. That's probably the one to talk about at this point then we'll sort of see what else works through our testing as we go.","MikeMorris","Okay. Great. And then over the weekend, I believe it came out on Sunday, expand it I think you were referred to as you can strengthen partnership with Sky. What --how did that become a stronger partnership?","GregPeters","Yes. I think what we are seeing is there's more and more opportunity that we're finding through whether it's mobile operators, pay TV operators, ISPS to reach out to a customer segment that while we're probably growing with them in general. We can actually accelerate that growth. And so it starts by just at being available on set top box or the device that they're using to watch TV, and we can put Netflix there and make it easy to see the service and potentially sign up there. But increasingly now with bundles we've removed yet another point of friction. So that that's just a part of their offering and they can just, we can do a call to action like right in front of them like it standard things, it's launching right now, watch and that's a very effective way to introduce people to the service.","But also we're finding that with co marketing programs and other things that we're getting more sophisticated that we can actually do more effective job at reaching out to more of those members to be around the world.","MikeMorris","You brought up the topic of bundling. Two kinds of questions with respect to bundling or different pricing packages. The first is a question of the need for consumers for this re-aggregation of these multiple services. And if that is the case perhaps a third party would like to or should be taking some portion of the payment for adding value. I guess my question is your position on the need for some sort of aggregation of these multiple services. ","My second question is around annual pricing versus monthly pricing and perhaps a discount for consumers who choose to take an annual plan. Either of those --how do either of those factored into your thoughts here?","GregPeters","Yes. I think we'll see sort of what the right solution is for consumers as we shift to this online streaming world. I anticipate that there are our models that make sense where they'll bundle multiple content services together and make it more sort of easier for consumers to access that. And that might be the effect that we're seeing but really most of the bundles that we have are either connecting to an existing pay TV sort of legacy pay TV service or they're connecting to things like your mobile plan or your internet plan. So I think there are multiple different opportunities to find the right mix where we're able to introduce Netflix as part of a set of offerings that just make it simple for people to sign up and it's logical and it's intuitive for them to go do so.","TedSarandos","And the likeliness that we have your favorite show your favorite movie raises the chances that you're going to figure out how to get to us as well.","GregPeters","That's right and then you also you mentioned I think an annual, a question on annual.","MikeMorris","That's right.","GregPeters","Yes. So I think it's an interesting model and certainly we see some. There's on legacy plans are sort of some-- since that there's certain countries around the world where that's a more common standard, right. So we want to experiment with that and test that out and understand if that's a more effective way for our members to access us. So we'll go do that and we'll sort of hear from them if that's something that's more effective or not. We don't know yet.","MikeMorris","Okay. I'd like to revisit the topic of advertising as a source of revenue or a means for your members to pay you for access to the service. Remind us we talk about a lot every quarter the topic comes up again. So remind us why advertising is not a right option given that you do have a focus on providing your members with them. Some optionality in terms of their way to enjoy the service.","ReedHastings","Yes. Mike, I think we addressed this last quarter in the letter. But I go over it again which is Google and Facebook and Amazon are tremendously powerful at online advertising. Because they're integrating so much data from so many sources. There's a business cost to that but they makes the advertising more targeted and effective. And so I think those three are going to get most of the online advertising business. And then to grow $5 billion or $10 billion advertising business you have to rip that away from other advertisers. In this case, say or other providers, Amazon, Google and Facebook which is quite challenging.","So don't think of that as in a long term, there's not easy money there. And instead we think if we don't have exposure to that, the positive side is we're a much simpler place. We're not integrating everybody's data. We're not controversial that way. We've got a much simpler business model, which is just focused on streaming and customer pleasure. So we think with our model that we'll actually get to a larger revenue, a larger profits, larger market cap because we don't have the exposure to something that were strategically disadvantaged at which is online advertising against those big three, which over the next 10-years are just going to integrate incredible amounts of data about everybody. And we won't and we're not trying to have access to. So that's why we're really pretty confident that the best business model is this way is certainly in the long term.","MikeMorris","I do think that last point is something we do hear people lose sight of sometimes which is you are not aggregating an immense amount of data about your viewers. You have viewership habits but beyond that I think correct me if I'm wrong, you don't collect a significant amount of personal data that would be used to target advertising. Is that accurate?","ReedHastings","We don't collect anything. We're really focused on just making our members happy. And we're not tied up with all that controversy around advertising. And again, if you wanted to succeed in online advertising, you can't just have a little data. To keep up with those giants, you've got to spend very heavily on that and track locations and all kinds of other things that we're not interested in doing. We want to be the safe respite where you can explore; you can get stimulated, have fun, enjoy, relax and have none of the controversy around exploiting users with advertising.","MikeMorris","Now one of the biggest changes that you guys have made in a while with respect to what you share with us is the geographic breakdown that you're providing now with respect to your actuals. So maybe just briefly can you remind us the reason that you made this change. We have had some questions whether it was somewhat suggested or required of you. So why did you make the change and then I do have a couple of specific questions about the markets, if I could.","ReedHastings","Spencer, you want to handle that?","SpencerNeumann","Sure. So to answer a question like, no, this was not a required change. This was a change that we made and as we talked about it was to, we always evolved our view of our business as our business changes. And with our launch of rest of the world in 2019 were basically a fully global company ex China. So we have increasingly been looking at the business internally along these four regions. So we want to map our external reporting and align it with how we look at it internally. So it was not a requirement but our choice.","ReedHastings","So we work hard internally to not be US and international. There's no such thing as international. There's a bunch of nuance of every market around the world. And part of our development from and originally just domestic company is to lose those kinds of distinctions. And instead think of it as four equal regions. And we're growing all of them. And we're sophisticated about all of them. And that's why we look at it, in that four regions way internally, which is of course drives the external reporting.","TedSarandos","It's been a great internal discipline for everybody to think about the business more in that way for sure.","MikeMorris","Well that's a great segue into some questions specifically about the nuances in these regions. Perhaps we can start with Latin America, which was your first broad international launch in 2011. And so what we noticed then and of course this quarter, you had record member growth in each of the regions, but it does look like Latin America is perhaps closer to being mature with respect to its growth trajectory. At the same time, we would look at the data and say, it's still the penetration level of broadband households is still very low in that region. Can you characterize for us where you think we are in the lifecycle of member growth in that region?","ReedHastings","Spence, you want to take that?","SpencerNeumann","Yes. Sure. I would say across the board we're still early days right. So even with the roughly 167 million members across the globe and big membership in Latin America, you can see what we're or still roughly kind of in that 30% penetration. We think is pay TV households you've seen around the world whether it's pay TV or broadband households, we don't see why we can't get into all of those households over time.","So, yes, we're a bit more mature in Latin America than perhaps we are in APAC and some specific countries. But we're continuing to grow. It happens to be a region where similar to the US our price increases were a bit more significant than in other parts of the world.","So I think that may have been a bit of a headwind as well. We had foreign exchange working against us more meaningfully in Latin America. But I'd say in general very long runway. We continued --continue to see both global content and local content working really well in that region. So we will, I think you'll see continued healthy growth on the horizon. ","MikeMorris","And you just, Spence, you just mentioned APAC. And there are a couple of questions here. One is because this region has both Australia, New Zealand, so larger English-speaking markets and a large emerging market population. The first question is can you share at all the sort of balance of subscriptions in that market between those two? And I would think there's still a relatively high ASP there, which would imply some mix of higher price markets. But first the mix there and then also should we expect that ASP to come down based on what you're seeing now with respect to adoption of the lower price mobile plans.","SpencerNeumann","I'd say in terms of the mix and others can jump in as well, but we don't break it down specifically by country. I think the take away should be though that we're seeing healthy growth in all of these markets, so across Japan, Korea, India. I mean all of these markets were increasing that content market fit. We're getting much smarter about the markets in both say the content we offer as well as the pricing and packaging and bundling and distribution to our members and payment methods for our members.","So I think we're getting better literally every quarter every year and that's playing out in terms of very healthy growth across those markets. And then with respect to pricing, certainly that pricing is different in every country around the world. But we don't -- we're not managing to ARPU. We're managing to revenue maximization as we talked about earlier. So we're not going to provide a long-term focus. Obviously, as we have lower priced mobile offers that are going to bring down a blended ARPU in a country or in a market, but if we're doing that in a revenue accretive way, we think that's great for a long-term business. We're growing subscribers and we're growing revenue.","TedSarandos","Again, our local content and our regional content in Japan and Korea by way of example becoming much more sophisticated about what is super impactful in those countries. Plays pan regionally and occasionally plays globally. So those investments are paying off in the form of things like the Naked Director, which was a big, big hit for us in Japan and Kingdom which was the second season coming up at Korea that's been a big global hit for us. And as you think about the exciting things that happen in the content space, movie like Parasite coming out of Korea, that's done $140 million globally, $100 million in Korea and about $40 million outside. And the expansion of people finding stories from around the world is going to only make the opportunity bigger and bigger. ","MikeMorris","Might be a time for one or two more questions. Okay. Let me hit on EMEA and then I'll get a wrap-up question. I think in that European, Middle East and Africa market, it's somewhat similar in terms of some mature markets and some emerging markets and opportunities there. So as you think about that market growth opportunity is the answer similar to the same as the question on Asia. And I think the question is a little bit rooted in, we do have some specific mobile only lower priced plans in Asia that we've been focused on. But should we think about that EMEA market as perhaps following a similar pattern.","ReedHastings","Greg, do you want to take that pricing. I would say in terms of the opportunity we see a huge opportunity in EMEA. It's a multiple of the number of addressable, their pay TV or broadband households as you see for example in the UK or US and Canada region. We're less than 20% penetrated in the market. You've seen it's driving more than 50% of our paid member editions in recent quarters or roughly 50%. So we're low penetrated and we're growing in a very healthy clip in that market. I'll turn to, Greg, though in terms of pricing strategy.","GregPeters","Yes and their pricing and plans approach, again that region much like APAC has both, it's very affluent, very mature markets as well as less affluent markets. And so I anticipate that what we'll find is that we'll have a mix of plans and approaches that will spread across that region that again will be different price points. But it'll be looking to sort of maximize revenue through that mix across the entire region.","MikeMorris","Great. So I'd like to conclude again as we did last time with a little bit of a 5 for 1 question last quarter. We talked about each of your -- something each of you was excited about in the coming quarter. This time, I'd like to ask you repress analyst reports et cetera about your company. I'd love to hear your take on what you think is most misunderstood about the company or at least well appreciated about the company. So last, as with last quarter I'll start with Spencer and go from there.","SpencerNeumann","Sure. I honestly don't think that there's that much that's misunderstood. We're a single product company. And I think pretty straightforward I think for most investors understand. I think I'd like to think about one thing that I personally think there's probably a bit of an over focus on the streaming wars sort of notion. And I know it's exciting for folks to talk about The Clash of the Titans and all that kind of stuff. But I think really the big thing that's going on is this transition from linear entertainment to streaming on-demand entertainment, which is really, really big and very similar to that transition the industry went through from broadcast to cable.","And there what you saw was a lot of those new cable networks didn't really take much share from each other, but really grew together as broadcasting sort of became smaller over time. I think that's what's the really the big thing that is happening that's probably less well understood.","MikeMorris","Thanks Spencer. What about you, Spence?","SpencerWang","I think you're going to pick up me because I got the order wrong last quarter. So, okay. I'll say, I think was most misunderstood is the business model and what you see in our cash flow generally. And folks thinking that we are losing money, if you will, when we --what we've shown is that we are increasing our profitability both growing and growing our profit margins. And what you've seen over the last few years is forward investment as we've been going through a really kind of pretty significant transition of our business model from licensed content where you pay basically ratably for content you receive over the time and it's on the network to original content not just licensed originals, but self-produced originals where oftentimes we're investing many years before that content is on the service.","And we've moved as they say, well, along the curve there were the bulk of our cash spend is now on original content. So as we've gotten bigger, as we've moved towards originals, it just --it fundamentally changes that cash flow profile over time. And we're a very profitable business and one that will ultimately over the years become meaningfully self-funding.","MikeMorris","Thanks Spencer. Greg? How about you?","GregPeters","Yes. Spence actually took mine. It's my favorite sort of gap between external and internal worldviews. So I'm very excited to be turning the corner on the free cash flow issue. So that we could sort of put that behind us and really focus on growing the business ahead.","MikeMorris","Great and Ted?","TedSarandos","In terms of misunderstood, I think I did use this notion you hear every once in a while to where there is so much stuff on Netflix everything gets lost. And I think that's the opposite is true, which you'll see in those numbers that we release you in the letter. The-- our ability to launch new brands, to sustain brands over multiple seasons or multiple sequels and at a very high volume from all over the world has been unparalleled. And the idea that we can create brands out of thin air over and over again sometimes multiple times in a week like this past week is something that I'm super proud of.","And I think it gets lost on people because they think all this content is for them. It isn't. It's just meant to be your favorite show and your favorites movie and that's going to be something for everybody.","ReedHastings","And for me, it's really that we keep doing these amazing numbers. Doing [88] in Q4, it is just amazing. So happy with that and with Witcher performance ending the year on a high note of a massive new franchise that will develop season after season. So if you think about the next couple of years, it's really the rate of improvement that's the big thing. How much we're learning and we're doing so many shows. Our learning is higher. Doing so many product tests. Our learning is higher and the quality of our service two or three years from now will be so much higher than it is today. That's the thing that's not well understood. Everyone focuses on how's the current service look as opposed to how good we're going to be in three years.","End of Q&A","Spencer Wang","Thank you, Mike. Great job and look forward to talking with all of our investors and everyone over the quarter."],"15785":["Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call October 16, 2018  6:00 PM ET","Executives","Spencer Wang - VP, Finance and Investor Relations","Reed Hastings - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer","David Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Greg Peters - Chief Product Officer","Ted Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Analysts","Eric Sheridan - UBS","Spencer Wang","Good afternoon and welcome to the Netflix Q3 2018 Earnings Interview. I'm Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, David Wells; Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; and Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters. Our interviewer this quarter is Eric Sheridan from UBS.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary.","With that, over to you now Eric, for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Eric Sheridan","Thank you, Spencer. Maybe I'll kick off with what clearly is the headline from the earnings results, much better subscriber performance in Q3, and a fairly robust guide within Q4 in terms of looking out on the subscribers. I'll turn it to you guys to sort of layout the framework you saw develop in Q3, what do you think might develop in Q4 that was different than what happened earlier in the year?","Reed Hastings","Eric, I think we\u2019re getting a little better on the forecasting in particular the evolution to paid net ads. So if you look at that paid net ad growth that we showed, you can see how remarkably steady. So I'm afraid the Q2, Q3 story is probably mostly an issue of forecasting as opposed to anything changing in the business, and you can see the noise that the free trials added into the paid, which gets you the total creates. So I think by focusing going forward on paid, we'll be able to be a little more accurate and focused on the fundamentals.","Eric Sheridan","So when you think about some of the distribution deals you've done over the last couple of years, that's creating some noise that I think you're now trying to clear up with these new disclosures. But can you also talk a little bit about what those distribution deals maybe in terms of opening up packets of the market that haven't been available to you before not only just this year, but as you think out longer-term about the business?","Reed Hastings","Sure. Over to you Greg.","Greg Peters","And can you clarify, Eric, in distribution deals you mean the device partners, et cetera.","Eric Sheridan","Correct. Different ways of going to market via partner as opposed to direct.","Greg Peters","Yes. So I think what we are doing is, we are slowly learning more and more about how we can leverage partners. We've seen it sort of an evolution from just doing device integrations and to things like billing integrations, so we can make it that much easier for our members to sign up for the service. This latest round we're seeing now is bundling where whether we\u2019re bundling with an Internet service provider or a mobile operator or pay-TV operator. We can make it even easier for people to just find Netflix and to try the service out.","And what we're seeing here is that this allows us to access a set of subscribers, a consumer demographic which might be less technology early adopter than the folks that are signing us up \u2013 with us directly, and so we're able to sort of accelerate our growth in a new segment via these deals. So we're learning more and more about that, we're trying to figure out which markets they work and how to optimize that bundle strategy.","David Wells","Eric, I would say these aren't new disclosures in a sense that that's pretty strong term. I would say this is an evolution of a partner strategy, and as Greg talked about, we've been doing many of these for a while. There's nothing sort of strategically different than what we've been doing for the last five years or so.","Eric Sheridan","And maybe following up on something that Greg said there, just where you're discovering growth and awareness of the product that didn't exist before. I'd like to separate that into domestic versus international. I think one of the questions we get from investors all the time are, where is the growth coming from in North America given the brands awareness, given how long the brand has been around in the marketplace. Anything you could tell us about where those pockets of growth are and where you're discovering new awareness for the Company?","Greg Peters","I\u2019d say even in America, where the awareness is super high and the brand is well understood. There's still pockets of consumers who \u2013 it's harder for them to get the activation energy to go directly to the website and sign up, but if we can actually put a Netflix application, a call to action and maybe even bundle that the service subscription as part of their pay-TV offering or the mobile offering, they can just click on something and then get right into the service.","And so even for a place where we\u2019re well known, we make it easier or more effective for our folks to sign up. We see actual acceleration of ads there. Then obviously in markets where we're less well understood in terms of what the offering is, that simplifying, that making it less friction full provides other types of members maybe that are even more technology adopters, simple way is just to try to experience out and we get the growth there as well.","So I wouldn\u2019t say we're seeing the sort of the same dynamic which is to remove friction and it works both in high-penetration and high-awareness markets as well as in lower-penetration and lower-awareness markets.","Eric Sheridan","One of the other things sticking with the domestic market for a minute, pricing power in the business model. You raised prices as we came out of last year and into this year. It's now been a couple of quarters and some of those pricing actions have worked through the marketplace. What have you learned about the value that consumers put on Netflix? And how much pricing power there might be in the business model especially when you look domestically?","Greg Peters","I think we\u2019re just \u2013 what we're seeing is just reinforcing this sort of core theory that we have, which is our job is to focus on, invest and providing our members incredible experiences, more great content, great product experiences. And when we do that and we do it well, we earn the right to increase price a bit and then we take that new revenue, invested back into the model and that sort of continuous positive cycle we get to keep going, and we foresee that that will keep going for many years in the future.","Eric Sheridan","Maybe pivoting back to international, I\u2019d love to talk about both India and non-India. Within India, we saw a big push earlier this year into local language content. I\u2019d love to talk a little bit about what local language content does in India to stimulate subscriber growth and then how you think about penetrating the India market from who you need to partner with and how you have to get pricing right over the medium to long-term. So I\u2019ll throw that open maybe to probably touch the spot a little bit of everyone within the group?","Ted Sarandos","This is Ted. I'll talk to you about the incredible success with Sacred Games followed it up right away with Ghoul and prior to that with a movie called, Love Per Square Foot. What it really was able to do was take this product that maybe was less known in India, when we launched and make it feel more local, more relevant. And what we saw was a \u2013 all of that was following a nice steady increase in viewer engagement prior to us launching those big original shows.","So what they had was a product that people understood more, talked to their friends more about that was written about more in the press and certainly talked about more by influencers, and then delivered with content that isn\u2019t otherwise available in the market series being produced at the quality \u2013 the production quality of Sacred Games by way of example.","Greg Peters","And then to the question on pricing what I would say is, we're just getting started in India and we feel like with the existing model that we have and the prices that we're at, we've got a long runway still ahead of us. And we've seen that in sort of the increasing traction that we're getting in that segment as we have the great content that Ted was mentioning. We increased our partnerships, we\u2019re improving the product experience.","Now we\u2019ll experiment with other pricing models, not only for India, but around the world that allow us to sort of broaden access by providing a pricing tier that sits below our current lowest tier and we'll see how that does in terms of being able to accelerate our growth and get more access. But even on the existing model, we feel like we have a long runway ahead of us in India.","Eric Sheridan","But maybe following up on something that Reed has talked about publicly in terms of the potential for growth in India longer-term, how does the model have to morph to maybe line up with longer-term goals of adding 100 million subscribers in a market like India?","Reed Hastings","We\u2019ll have to see. We\u2019ll go from expanding beyond English into Hindi and then into many more languages, more pricing options, more bundling, all of those things are possible. There's over 300 million mobile phone subscriptions or households, that\u2019s almost twice that in mobile phone subscription. So there's a huge market and people in India like around the world love watching television. Now, we\u2019ll take 1 million out of time and figure out how to expand the market as we grow.","Ted Sarandos","A couple hundred million people watching content through the Internet in India is a really exciting idea.","David Wells","And just to wrap that, Eric, in terms of investor expectations, Reed\u2019s 1 million at a time, we're super encouraged with India and the growth that we've got early on, but we know it's going to be somewhat of a tough market, right. So there's \u2013 that notion is along \u2013 is a million at a time, right. It's not going to be overnight where we're going to get to those higher numbers.","Eric Sheridan","Is there any way to tease out when you see subscriber growth internationally like you just published for Q3, obviously in even bigger number as you forecast out to Q4 to tease out how much India is contributing to that versus non-India and are they any markets on either the content side or the subscriber side you'd like to call out ex-India?","Reed Hastings","For competitive reasons, we're not going to give you too much color on that. What's driving the P&L progress is doing shows that carry a multiple territories, creating a great synergy around those great excitement, and that's what we really \u2013 we hardly look at it U.S. and internationally, when we look at it internally almost all just globally.","Spencer Wang","And Eric, as you probably saw in the Investor Letter, we talked about the growth in our membership being very broad-based and very global. So I think you should read that as what we've said in the past, which is the phenomenon of Internet entertainment is really global phenomenon that we're benefiting from.","Eric Sheridan","Fair enough. One of the things you're shifting a little bit further down, the P&L into revenue, international saw some headwinds from FX this quarter. Understand the translation issues around that, but wanted to understand if FX volatility is causing any headwinds or tailwind you're seeing in terms of end demand for the product or consumption of the product or is it truly a translation issue?","Reed Hastings","It's mostly a translation issue. Absent foreign exchange or ASP, international ASP would have grown, and so I don't think we see any demand effect from foreign exchange.","Eric Sheridan","Fair enough. Maybe two bigger picture questions. One, they came in a lot of formats from people ahead of the call competition. As you look out to 2019, I know not within the forecast period, but as you think about how the competitive landscape might shift? Where the market is going from a global standpoint on the competitive standpoint? How do you think about some of the friction points you're trying to solve for as a company when you look out at that competitive landscape?","Reed Hastings","There are so many competitors, of course Disney is going to enter, AT&T is going to expand HBO, YouTube is just on fire growing around the world, video gaming like Fortnite. I mean there's so many ways to have great entertainment on a screen.","So we don't focus that much in any one because no one seems to affect us that much. What affects us is can we produce the best content the world's ever seen? Can we get people excited about that content? Can we serve it up in ways that make it really fun and easy, again focusing on our fundamentals?","Someday there will have to be competition for wallet share, we're not naive about that, but it seems very far off from everything we've seen. So \u2013 and we're continuing to work with many of those firms where it makes sense to for both of us and it's creating a big and vibrant industry.","Eric Sheridan","Maybe one follow-up to that, directed to Ted. When you think about the competitive landscape and what it might mean for either acquiring, sourcing or partnering on content with people globally. Ted, how is that changing the conversations maybe as you look out over the medium to long-term? Where might we see some of the pressure points that competition could play out on the content side?","Ted Sarandos","Well, we've been a pretty dependable buyer and increasing the \u2013 some of those sellers have been more complicated sellers, meaning there are conflicts within their companies of what they want to sell, when they want to sell, or what Windows that would allow for. They allow flexibility to offer their own services, which is something we foresaw years ago when we started doing original programming.","But in the meantime, I think that they are the studios and who are always have been somewhat of potential competitors have to look at those things today and say what's the best way to get return on investment for creating great content. And so in some cases it's going to be launching it through their own direct-to-consumer initiatives, in other cases it's going to be selling to Netflix which has proved to be very positive for them for many years.","Eric Sheridan","Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 maybe sticking with you Ted about some of the asks are coming from content creators. We continue to hear as we talk to people in the media industry about awards, campaigns or marketing budgets put behind content, people want their content seen who are content creators. How have some of those conversations changed? What might it mean for ways you go-to-market when you look out over the next couple years due to the taking content into the marketplace?","Ted Sarandos","Well, I think what you said was perfect that people definitely want their content seen and the best chance of doing that is doing it with Netflix. And you see in the long list of content brands and newly minted stars, out of Netflix just this quarter. You could see what we're talking about \u2013 by putting content into the culture and into the Zeitgeist. And what\u2019s really great, it can be nominated and win Emmys or Oscars. And those are really important to filmmakers and creators and we're super proud and happy for them when they win.","But in general, we want to do is try to make great content, elevate it to the right audience in the most efficient way possible, so we can do more of it. And what we've seen more is that these shows that come out on Netflix are really piercing the culture, some of the most watched shows on television are on Netflix and the creators know that.","So when they \u2013 the asks that are coming into forms of marketing campaigns and awards campaigns, they're seeing that in very big numbers from us anyway. We had 40 shows nominated for Emmys this year and became the \u2013 tied with HBO for the most Emmy wins this year. And that comes with great content and great campaigns both marketing and awards campaigns.","Eric Sheridan","Maybe two follow-ups here. The first one on the products side, the team has talked before about lowering the friction to consumers finding product. That seems like a bit of a machine learning\/product development issue that you have to solve for friction points as you look out over the next couple of years. How should investors think about lowering friction to consumers finding content? What are some of those key investments that are being made? How those investments might change in the next couple of years?","Ted Sarandos","Again, I\u2019d draw your attention to the letter of \u2013 that list gave some very specific examples, people who went from being completely unknown to being global superstars in the span of a few weeks or a few months of this quarter alone. So I think that it's evident that things are being found in \u2013 at incredible pace on Netflix versus getting lost in the [sea] of things on Netflix.","Greg Peters","Our job is to make that even more of the years to come and so we're investing a variety of different dimensions when you mentioned, but in terms of the design, the UX that we have the user experience. Just this quarter, we released an upgrade to our TV UI navigation that allows users to be a little bit more specific in terms of the content that they are looking to browse through.","So imagine, it's Friday night, you what an engaging movie. You can tell us that, and then we will present the recommendations or suggestions that we have of some of our growing impressive film titles that you can really immerse yourself into. And that's just one of a line of multiple product updates that we anticipate having that we think will magnify that effect that Ted is talking about, about incredible content being discovered in the show and then becoming a big social phenomenon.","Eric Sheridan","Bigger theme that maybe I wanted to talk about was alternative content. There was a partnership announced with Sirius XM. How you're thinking about new forms of content to be distributed on Netflix as you look out over the next couple of years? What are some of those things you think your consumer is asking for that reduces churn, gives you more pricing power, gives you higher ROI against some of the investments you're making? We'd love to sort of tee that up broadly for the group.","Ted Sarandos","Well, in the case of the Sirius XM that is a \u2013 looking for a kind of a marketing synergy for a stand-up comedy initiative being able to have bites of our stand-up comedy specials that are otherwise only available on Netflix in their entire run as a way to entertain fans of stand-up comedy and discover new talent, and that's just some of the ongoing part of our overall initiatives.","So it\u2019s pretty \u2013 it's a small test right now to see how that goes, putting up clips and interviews and interview shows featuring our talent and supporting our talent. So think about it as a different way of marketing, the existing program that we're doing when you're not on Netflix when you're more likely on your car, when you shouldn't be on Netflix in your car.","Reed Hastings","So Eric, per Ted\u2019s comment, we're not really focused on the monetization of those efforts. It's really around deepening the brand connection, which ultimately monetizes as faster growth for us. So all of our auxiliary efforts are not around creating additional profit streams for now, they're really aimed around strengthening these mega titles because that's what drives the business. And a little bit incremental growth is much more profitable for us than creating separate businesses. So we're always evaluating them on, do they help the core? Did they help that love of the new stand-ups?","Eric Sheridan","Maybe continuing to move through some of the costs in the business model, marketing has been heavily debated topic with investors as we've gone through the last year. Saw a pretty big change from the \u2013 over 90% growth in marketing you saw in Q2 to something much lower in Q3, I think prior management\u2019s called out the idea that marketing would be sort of in a tested learn mode this year, maybe pivoting away from just fewer subscriber acquisition.","So a couple questions; number one, what have you learned in some of the changes you made in marketing this year? And how do you think that might inform how you go to market as a company going forward both for subscriber growth and then support on the content side?","Reed Hastings","Ted, do you want to take that?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, I would say that, one thing that we've learned as we\u2019ve gotten along. There was a time when we didn't market any of our content. We spent all of our marketing effort just talking about Netflix and how to use it. And today, we find is that selling house of cards in its final season is really all about selling Netflix.","So what we're learning more and more is that, yes, we can drive some viewing up and down. Yes, we could drive, but that's all mostly centered around getting people excited about watching a show that\u2019s only on Netflix because it's a great thing for Netflix and how to sell the service.","So that gives us \u2013 and we do it over many titles because people's tastes are very different. And being able to aggregate people to talk about the same things and watch the same things at roughly the same time has got a lot of value, and we\u2019re still learning all the fine arts of that.","Spencer Wang","And Eric just sort of on the financial aspect of the marketing spend, some of that as we call that on the letter was sort of timing related and shifted a bit into Q4, so that's sort of the dynamic that you highlighted isn\u2019t a signal on any sort of specific change in the strategy.","Eric Sheridan","And that would lead to maybe my next question, so Spencer, teed that one up for me. Thinking about the pace and cadence of investments in Q3 versus Q4, I thought there were some key learnings in the letter, but just want to give a little bit of an opportunity to frame what might have shifted out of Q3 and into Q4? How investors should think about that again some of the longer-term investments you're trying to make in the business?","David Wells","It\u2019s either for Ted or I'll take that the sort of marginal progression or the quarterly progression. I think we're balancing the steady growth of operating margin but allowing the business to have the flexibility to choose sort of optimal release timing and promotional timing and create that flexibility for them. So yes, next year, we see a little bit more steadier progression towards the 13% target that we have for the year, but I think we'll see some natural seasonality in terms of release, content releases and maybe that's a pitch to Ted now to take the next part.","Ted Sarandos","Yes. We've really been trying to optimize and when is the best time for the content creators and for the fans to release that content and sometimes they're regulated by outside forces and other times are just trying to line up that perfect viewing time. And they're trying to lead with that. We end up with very happy members and very happy creators.","Eric Sheridan","Following up on that, the comment from the letter about less quarterly variance, is that then just purely a function mostly of smoothed out marketing spend and I thought that you are such a scale of content that it smoothed out more evenly over the year or is there anything you\u2019re doing actively to sort of create less seasonality or less volatility in the cost structure of the companies as you look out into 2019 versus 2018?","David Wells","It's mostly the latter Eric, so we\u2019re not actively doing anything to the cost structure. We're just planning a little bit more in terms of the content and the associated promotion that goes with that, but it's a bit of a balance. We don't want to go too far with this either because we again want to create that flexibility for the business, right. We're not optimizing for marginal margin progression by quarter, where optimizing for rolling 12-month growth of operating margin. But we're just indicating this year is a little bit unusual. We don't see as much pronounced lumpiness next year as we do this year.","Eric Sheridan","And maybe just one more on this probably for you, David, the 13% plus or minus keeps up with sort of the pace you guys have talked about over the last couple of years around 200 million to 300 basis points of margin expansion on a rolling forward basis. What are some of the things that could cause that number to arc upward or downward that you think people should keep in the front of their mind as the business continues to take investments you want?","David Wells","The biggest one is foreign exchange in terms of yes, on a mid-terms to longer-term, basis we use pricing to offset negative foreign exchange or dollar appreciation. But in the short-term, we don't immediately do that and so we can go through a couple quarters where you're seeing foreign exchange affect both just like this quarter, where we had it affect international ASP. But on a mid- to long-term basis, that's should even out as we use pricing. So foreign exchange is the big one. And then growth \u2013 if we have more to growth than we expected, that's going to drive more revenue and we'll get more of that in the back half of the year, but that could affect us as well\u2026","Reed Hastings","If you think of our content cost as pretty big there's a little bit of flexibility quarter-to-quarter, but not much. The marketing kind of has flexibility, but you really want to launch the title. So it follows the content schedule and you can't shift it around trivially. So then, as David said, they\u2019re mostly topline factors between FX and revenue growth, the cost structures, pretty stable for next year.","Eric Sheridan","So following up on that Reed and maybe for anyone who wanted to take it, you talked a little bit off free cash flow in the letter, the lower end of the range, loss about $3 billion this year and then possibly replicating that a loss around $3 billion next year. One of the questions that came in to me in a variety of different forms was trying to size out either max free cash flow burn and where some of the variables in the model that people should be focused on and max leverage that you be willing to take up in the business as you take out over the medium- to long-term as well.","Reed Hastings","Eric, you're using the word loss and I think you mean investment. We definitely hope that they're not turning into losses. A track record would show that those investments have turned out to be very successful for us. But I\u2019ll let David handle that question.","David Wells","Reed took the immediate one that I was going to take, but so thanks on that. Yes, we're seeing those investments drive a lot of growth. So there's a little bit of attention to that from us. Eric, the biggest thing is that we're approaching \u2013 Netflix is approaching a point where the growth in operating profit is going to grow faster than our growth in content cash spend.","And that's really going to drive the free cash flow towards improvement. It will eventually breakeven. I think what we said in the letter is flat with this year, and mainly that's because 12 to 18 months ago, we probably would have expected a little bit of a steeper peak and then a reduction, which happened is content timing is kind of shifted back, we're growing faster so we're investing some more of that into content and so you get sort of a flattening of the trend forward.","But we expect material improvements in 2020. We still think it's going to be a few years towards breakeven because we're optimizing again for long-term cash flow and long-term profitability, and we think that's the right thing.","And then in terms of peak leverage, I think what you're going to see is, at least electively funding our content that leverage ratio is going to start to improve, but we're also looking at optimal weighted average cost of capital, which we've already discussed and indicated that would be based on about a 20%, 25% leverage to market cap ratios where we think the long-term optimal cost of capital ought to be, and so once we pushed past the point where we're more secure and it's less about funding the immediate working capital needs of the business will turn over a shift to thinking about long-term optimal cost of capital.","Eric Sheridan","One of the key themes in the shareholder letter was you bucketed three different forms of content, number one and number two were licensed and number three clearly was original owned and operated with a theme I thought of preference for bucket three to be the driver for the business over the medium to long-term.","As you do think about some of your partners maybe pulling content off the platform in 2019 that's been talked a lot of publicly. How do you think about either replacing that content from a volume standpoint or just redoubling your efforts around marketing and increasing ROI around existing content and scaling against your own original content plans are rather than thinking about those license buckets?","Ted Sarandos","Well, I\u2019ll tell you going back just a few years, that\u2019s just we started entering our original programming, what we turned out is that our own original shows tend to be more valuable than licensing someone else's shows and later windows and the kind of shared window model versus that purely original model.","So when we invest in original show, we find that we're having a better payback its terms of people watching and appreciating Netflix and valuing their subscription, so that's why we're leaning in that way.","We have a variety of models in which we used to get content, so really what we want to do is focus on what is the best programming, so we get to be a little business model agnostic about if we don't own the IP then we want to figure out how to make that deal with the people who do.","In some cases they produce that for us in the first window. In some case they produce that for their own networks and we license it in the second window and that will continue. But we are pointing out in the letter is as has been a big \u2013 we are driving a lot of programming to our owned and produced originals that we're producing in-house, some of our biggest brands like Stranger things, our owned and produced in-house and we're still licensing a lot of original programming from our partners as well.","In terms of backfilling things that are coming off the site, one of the better examples we think of how it could work well for us has been in our unscripted initiative, which last year we had no unscripted original programming on Netflix and this year about half of our weighted watching of unscripted programming are Netflix originals, and therefore, the benefits of \u2013 and about the same cash outlay, but with much more efficiency, meaning people are watching them in greater numbers for the same dollar spent.","So and with that we have much steadier access to programming, we're building brands that people associate with Netflix like Queer Eye and Fastest Car and Nailed It! and Sugar Rush. These are all the shows that people really love an enormous numbers around the world and we don't have to go through the gun to your head renegotiation every couple years from them.","Eric Sheridan","Ted, you had some good examples before per region like Bodyguard and Sherlock. So maybe you can...?","Ted Sarandos","We announced yesterday our co-production on Sherlock. I'm sorry, not Sherlock, Dracula, from the makers of Sherlock with Steve Moffat. We would love to make more and more content with Steve Moffat. His deal is with the BBC and we get to be partners with them to make this great show Dracula available around the world and in a fast follow model in the UK.","And we'll do a lot more of that. Bodyguard is coming up in a few weeks and it's been a tremendous hit in the UK. And we came in very early on that financially and creatively, and we think they've made a much bigger and better show because of it, and we think we could be great partners with local public broadcasters and networks around the world.","Eric Sheridan","Maybe following up on that because that's both a local as well as a global content sort of comment. How do you think about the ROI of local content and what it can do when it goes global and act as stimulant for the platform in a much broader framework and maybe it was originally planned for?","Ted Sarandos","What\u2019s super amazing about that today has been that these local language shows have been incredibly relevant in their home country and then they work very well in their region, and then when they really connect, they play multiregional and sometimes completely global. And we have enough subscribers in the different territories today that we can have a real global hit without much viewing in the U.S. or with a lot of viewing in Latin America and the U.S., but not in Europe.","So we're seeing a lot of those things that are benefit of scale obviously, but also picking great storytellers who tell stories that people want to hear around the world. And what we have found is that a good story well told works and it works in almost any language. So as long as we focus on the quality of production, those shows can be worked to drive local subscribers in country, but also drive global viewing when we do it right.","Eric Sheridan","Maybe one more follow-up on the content side for you Ted, the film side, obviously been a big push for the company, there's now been multiple efforts that have gone out to the marketplace. What have you learned? What are some of the friction points you're still trying to solve for in terms of both go-to-market and partnering with the right content creators on the film side, and how do you think about what that does for the platform again medium to long-term?","Ted Sarandos","Well, we've been thrilled just recently and we're releasing original films on Netflix from really A-list Directors like Alfonso Cuaron and Susanne Bier, the Coen Brothers, Tamara Jenkins, and these are film people who made movies directly just to the theater their entire careers and are now moving to producing more and more for Netflix, because what they're finding is to your point earlier they want their content to be seen. They want their film to be in the discussion and they're able to do that on Netflix in ways I've never seen before.","Paul Greengrass film 22 July just came out a few days ago and millions of people are enjoying it all over the world and ways that he's never experienced for his films yet. And that'll roll into 2019 with big new films from Michael Bay and Martin Scorsese and we're finding is that people want their audience \u2013 their films to find an audience and that they're in a better position to do that with us than without us, and that's a really exciting position to be in for film lovers.","Eric Sheridan","Maybe pivoting back to the product side of the equation, you've talked a lot in the last couple of calls about getting mobile right not only short-term, but as a stimulant for long-term growth. Reed referenced earlier there's a lot of people that want to consume content especially mobile-first as you think globally. What are some of those product developments we should be looking for that you are hearing that from consumers would either increased engagement or increased adoption of the platform that aren\u2019t there yet when you think about where mobile viewing of media content globally will go over the long-term.","Greg Peters","Yes, I think we see an opportunity to improve almost every aspect of that product experience, but I'll just throw out a couple interesting ones. One is as a method of acquisition, and again it's very consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about in terms of extending the partnerships, the kind of partnerships we have with mobile operators, whether that's a bundle model, like we just did our first bundle in Japan with mobile operator KDDI. We've done a bunch of preloads with the Verizon or Android phones in the United States.","So in just all these different ways, which we can use that as a vehicle to bring more subscribers on to the service, but it's also a great sort of subscriber experience component of it too, which is something that we're exploring more and more as not only just a direct content enjoyment part of the experience, but things like previews and teasers and what's coming now and how can we sort of create a continuum of experience, which is not only that great directly engage moment when you're watching that show you've been dying to watch.","But also things that sort of lead up to that which maybe don't take 30 or 45 minute viewing session, but can you get five minutes you're waiting in line and you can catch a preview a show that you are excited to watch, maybe you watch that when you get home later tonight, and that's the kind of experience I think we really can invest and see good returns from in years to come.","Spencer Wang","Eric, I think we have time for one last question please.","Eric Sheridan","Yes, maybe I\u2019d love to end on a bigger picture question for Reed. Reed, I think you've seen other technology platforms like \u2013 some of the other companies I cover diversify more as they become more mature, enter new areas. Netflix's team fairly focused on streaming media and pushing your message globally about adoption and creation of content, how do you think about staying focused on the business model you have today versus looking for areas for diversification as you go globally that can be put on top of the business model, especially the brand awareness and the technology platform you've built as you look out globally over the long-term?","Reed Hastings","Yes, I think about it, if you've got five to 10 years more growth in your current market, you're probably optimizing value to stay in your current market and strengthen. Eventually, your market may not be able to hold your growth ambition. So that happened to us in DVD. We couldn\u2019t stay in DVD forever.","Of course, we diversified in a streaming, so we're open to those possibilities. But there is so much growth ahead that\u2019s possible in streaming video entertainment. So we're just going to focus on that for a very long time. Unfortunately lots of other companies are also focusing on that, but that's going to make it exciting for us for the next few years, great for consumers, incredible for producers. I mean there's never been so much TV and movies being created around the world.","And so the game is on. We're super excited about pleasing consumers as much as we possibly can. And someday, many, many years from now, we may need to diversify, but for now, let\u2019s focus on the core of those amazing title brands. And when you look at the content, we have coming out this quarter and next year, we couldn't be more excited, we couldn't be more busy.","End of Q&A","Reed Hastings","So with that, let me thank everyone for participating in the call. Thank you, Eric for connecting it, and look forward to talking with you all soon."],"15471":["Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 21, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Erin Kasenchak - Director of Investor Relations","Reed Hastings - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer","David Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Ted Sarandos - Chief Content Officer, Vice President - Content","Analysts","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Operator","Good afternoon. I am Erin Kasenchak, Director of Investor Relations at Netflix. I would like to welcome you all to our third quarter 2013 earnings interview. During today's discussion, we may make forward-looking statements and our actual results may vary from those statements.","With me today, is Reed Hastings, our CEO, David Wells, CFO, Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer and helping to facilitate our discussion is Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research and Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan.","Let me now turn it over to Rich for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Thanks, Erin and thanks, everyone from Netflix for being here. We are going to switch questions tonight between me and Doug. I think the first question, though, really for Reed is, when you look at the investor statement, your stock is up a lot, year-to-date and you actually make a comment about the fact that it is a little bit of a sense of euphoria like there was in 2003. Normally, you have always said that you leave it for Wall Street to determine what happens to your stock. Why did you make the comment this time about your stock and specifically about euphoria?","Reed Hastings","Well, Rich, every time I read a story about Netflix is the highest appreciating stock in the S&P 500. It worries me, because that was the exact headline that we used to see in 2003. You can definitely, we have a sense of momentum investors driving the stock price more than we might normally. There is not a lot we can do about it but I wanted to honestly reflect upon that.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Go ahead, Doug.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Great. So our next question, we are going ask you a couple about 3Q in particular. So, Reed, can you help us understand what kind of impact you think Orange Is the New Black had on subscribers and in 3Q you pointed out pretty early, obviously, in the letter, and maybe if you could compare to some of the initial impact that you have seen from other originals this year?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think Orange was a great success for us but we don't have a way of separating out, is that why we did well, you know where the top half of our U.S. guidance or how material it was. It was also our overall content improvement. There was the general brand improvement. Then remember we have a soft comp from last year. So being up, year-over-year is not as tough this quarter or in Q3. So it definitely helped. We are thrilled about it. But there is no clean analysis and we are not particularly trying to - we are trying to do more great content like Orange, but we don't need to know, was it 2% or 5% or 10% of our sub-goal.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And from the standpoint of the Chromecast, you announced an offer during the quarter where Google, I believe, was funding some of the subscriber acquisitions for Netflix. Was it a material - you didn't really make a lot of comment about it in the press release. Just curious, how significant that was and how do we think about those type of offers going forward?","","Reed Hastings","Well, we would like to see more of those types of offers. They work particularly well for consumer electronics companies, selling smart TVs and other things. But it's pretty small today and it was not material on the Chromecast, because most of those three months went to existing subscribers.","If you think about the kind of person who orders a Chromecast in the first three days, you are pretty into technology and gear and most of those people were already Netflix subscribers, so it was a nice way to get a jumpstart for Chromecast. We are very excited about the in the long-term, but it was not in this instance material to the membership growth.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Just a quick follow-up on Chromecast, can you help us understand how the economics work there?","Reed Hastings","Dave, what did we said so far?","David Wells","Yes. Doug, it's no different than other devices. So, we don't talk about the very specifics of all our deals, but it's no different than the economics of other devices that we have had out there.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","In the statement, you make a comment about Latin America, that you had a significant number of what you would call low quality promotions in the market. It looks like if you are doing the math right, that it added somewhere around the [$200,000] to $400,000 if you compare the growth in total numbers versus the paid numbers, you lose a few hundred thousand plus subscribers. Just wondering why did you do the low quality promotions? What was going on there? Give us some background.","David Wells","This is David, I will probably take that one, Rich. It's not that we did low quality promotions. It's that we are continuing to optimize and hone our payments in Latin America. It's something that we had been challenged with. We were first in the market and we optimized how much we are validating upfront in terms of methods of payment both, on direct debit card and on credit card and you can make choices to let in a number of subscribers that you think might be a high percentage of fraud, in which case you have got a lot of people in the free trials that aren't become paid subscribers.","You crank down on that and you run the risk of blocking a few people that are going to be paid subscribers, so you are always optimizing between the two, so our statements were more about the continual optimization and the fact that in September we had a fair number of folks, say, less than 20% in our Latin American free trials that were - we were in a state, where we didn't think that we are going to matriculate to a paid subscriber.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Just one more related to 3Q in particular for you David. Can you help us understand the breakdown in the amortization cost and the library between domestic and international?","David Wells","Sure. I mean, you have got some that in our cost-to-revenue breakout in our financial statements, but if you are referring to the change in the amortization, the $27 million in additional amortization, $20 million was domestic and $7 million was international","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Moving on to Q4, now when you think about Q4, you are looking for a notable improvement in Q4 profitability internationally in terms of streaming. You didn't really give much background in terms of what was driving that. Is it just that purely a subscriber growth in no new market launches or is there is more to why international profitability is starting to really improve?","Reed Hastings","You have got right synopsis of it, Rich, which is about growing the revenue and we don't have a new launch country, so on the natural, on a sequential basis, you would see it steadily improve absent additional launches.","David Wells","The only thing I would add to that, Reed, this is David, is that with more and more markets, if you have got a small improvement in each one of those additional markets, it's just the nature of having multiple markets that when you stack them all together you see a total that actually improves sequentially. That's a little bit of easy math there, but it is part of that picture.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Reed, just a question on 4Q and the outlook in particular, you talked about in 3Q having the easier comp from the summer Olympics. Why not expect 4Q U.S. streaming net adds to be above the 4Q '12 levels given the way content has improved over the past year.","Reed Hastings","Well, that's where I started our internal forecast discussions, because you know we have had three quarters where we have been above past year, so it makes sense that you know we would all think that but it really does turn out that in Q1 we were ahead of year ago because of our subscriber redefinition we did in the prior quarter.","In Q2, with a launch of Arrested, which is the only franchise that already had a big market upfront, and then Q3 we have the soft comp, so that's why we will be quite pleased with steady year-over-year out for Q4 and that's a underlying belief system and that's what we are tracking too also in the first three weeks of the quarter.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And when you look at that, we move on category wise in domestic streaming, when you think about your comments about margin improvement, I think on the last few calls you have talked about 100 basis points, you shifted 100 basis points to 400 basis points year-over-year for each quarter and you said that that was really [contingent] upon your ability to continue to grow subscribers domestically at the same rate that you have been. When you look that you seem pretty good confident in your ability to keep that going, going forward, should we take that to mean that you think that you can continue to add 7-ish million subscribers in 2014 and beyond? Or does margin improvement have to slow as you move into '14 or '15?","Reed Hastings","Well on this calendar year it's about 6 million domestic net additions, not seven, but if we are able to continue six next year then we believe we can keep the margin continuing to grow. So that's what that says is that, we really need that 6 million next year consistent with this year and then the margin can continue to grow the 400 basis points quarter-over-prior year quarter. Does that answer your question?","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","Yes.","David Wells","And Rich, this is David. I would add to that that we are also growing content expense. So the growth that we were talking about allows us to expand margin and also grow our context expense.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","When you think about domestic streaming and, for Reed in particular, you have talked about 60 to 90 million U.S. subscribers potentially at some point. Do you think about either the quality of content or the technology as being the bigger inhibitor toward reaching this goal overtime?","Reed Hastings","We have that same debate internally and the metaphor I use is that it looks like a plane with two big engines and you want both engines working as fast as you can. You don't really know which one is contributing what but we want to have the most incredible technology that we can in terms of on-demand, the personalization and that makes a fundamental difference and we want to have the most incredible content that we have, both licensed and original. And if we can do both of those really well for the next couple of years, that is very optimistic for us and would lead to a big growth.","The third one that we are getting better and better at, is our advertising. As you can see we put in some links in the script and you can get the feel and sense of the improvement in our ability to market our content and really develop that connection. And why don't I flip it to Ted for a second on kind of what you see Ted as kind of content growth improvement because I think Doug is talking about that.","Ted Sarandos","Yes, thanks, Reed. And Doug, I think that the content continues to improve and I guess, as David pointed, out in the current forecast it includes room to continue to invest. What we have seen is, is that some of the original content has got a particular halo effect on the brand that creates a stickiness that we are liking the signs of, for sure and that's why we are continuing to invest in that space. So it is like one of those things where evolving Netflix from being a place where I can see a lot of my favorite shows to the place where I can see the shows that I love, I think is a big investment that we are moving towards. So it is all dependent on having the great delivery technology that keeps that kind of in the background for consumers, when they define how Netflix works, that's where you lose them. So it is fun to know, you just push play, and it works.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","So you launched personal profiles in the quarter. That's something that has been talked about for a long time getting to more an individualized basis. Did it have a notable impact? Are you seeing most consumers set up personal profiles? Or is it still something where it's an education process? And just attached to that, you haven't updated in, I think, six months now actual usage of Netflix from a global standpoint. I think in Q1, you said 4 billion plus hours were streamed after House of Cards aired. Any update you can give us on those numbers?","Reed Hastings","Sure, Rich. We did about 5 billion hours in the last quarter. It's continuing to grow. On profiles, we are seeing continued growth in the adoption. It's mostly targeted at new member signing up. Most existing members have waited. They use Netflix like they used to and a few highly motivated of those will set up a profile but most of it comes in the initial set up screens and hence targeted largely at families where you want to set up a profile for one of you kids or all of your kids and keep the kids viewing separate from the parent. So there is a little more use of profiles. In that, you can use them in various ways but that's the initial big focus. And there have also been great - yes it's been talked about a long time and we are really excited to actually have it out in use.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","A question for David. Can talk to us more about how you expect streaming margins to scale overtime and do you believe you can get to the current margin levels of pay-TV cable networks?","David Wells","Sure, Doug. What we said in our long-term letter and previous questions we get, and as we don't really have a long-term margin target. We think as long as we are able to continue to grow at the rates we have seen this year, next year we can continue to expand and investing content and grow margins. With continued scale and growth, our margins should continue to grow, but we don't have a long-term target.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","You know when the studios, if we are going to kind of move over topic wise over to your actual original programming strategy. I was thinking, when content is commissioned, you end up with people watching a whole number of episodes at once. It really is up to the consumer to choose how they want to watch and what they want to watch. The average broadcast show is actually, I think people try it and generally get only a couple of episodes in before they end up usually giving up and it is a very rare show, where people end up watching an entire season of content.","For Netflix, when you say that your content is going to \"successful\" and I think all of you talk to a kind of five-for-five batting average. Does that assume that the average consumer is watching all of the episodes or your average Netflix subscriber who starts House of Cards has actually watched the whole series, or they are only watching say six or seven of the shows. How do we think about that?","Reed Hastings","Rich, we have a remarkable complete rate and that's one of the metrics we talk about. We talk about success, because it's a pretty safe bet that if somebody watches all 13 episodes of a show in a pretty short time span if they love that content, so it's a good leading indicator for us that we are doing okay with them.","I know, to your point where there is a traditionally a pretty bailout rate after the third or fourth week of new show and what we see is a pretty kind of steady growth as people both, been drive out of the gate and then settle into a more comfortable viewing pattern, so we do have I think a favorable complete rate to anything that I have seen on television when I check the ratings.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Just as a follow-up on original, Ted. You said in the past that, each subsequent show has been better or had more viewing than the one proceeding it in terms of originals. Can you just talk to.","David Wells","\u2026first week. That's comment was that in the first seven days of each of the new shows.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Okay. Can you tell us how audiences are building for some of the early originals for example like of House of Cards?","Ted Sarandos","In what and what patterns are they building?","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Well, just in terms of how the show continues to build audience even after the initial run?","Ted Sarandos","They are continuing to build. I mean, we have this kind of burst of excitement at the beginning usually tied to the marketing that we are doing and also the positive press event that's going around the new shows in their first couple of days, but unlike other shows it tend to lose audience week over week over week. We cumulatively kind of gain audiences as we go along and House of Cards get another unique bump when the show was nominated for the Emmy Awards.","It was a measurable bump in both, users and hours watched as people discovered the show for the first time and or returned to the show after having tried it at the beginning, so we are seeing kind of - they are certainly not dead after the first couple of days or the first couple of weeks to the show and they continue to find unifying new audience. The way we do for a licensed content too where we saw lots of audience build around Breaking Bad early seasons as the last season came on air was receiving a lot press attention, so no different than that.","David Wells","One of the things that we will see for the first time next year is what we are able to do with Season 2 of these shows, so when we have Season two with House of Cards, we are going to be doing a lot to get people in to Season 1 in the beginning and to really complete that, so we think we will get a big boost in Season 1 viewing as we are remarketing the brand House of Cards and really gauging the excitement around Season 2.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","You recently announced that, I think Ted announced actually when he was speaking that you are increasing your investment in originals. You had before said that it was maybe kind of under 10% and now you seem comfortable with a number larger than 10%.","Our overall programming eventually over the next couple of years being original programming, curious I assume embedded within that as now in the Season 2 all the shows we just mentioned, but also the new damages writer show that you just announced with Sony. Then just curious you also had a show, I believe, from the [Whitehouse]","David Wells","Yes. We announced that a few months ago. Right.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","That's also a 2014 show, because that wasn't in your press release. I am just wondering what is actually in your expectations for '14 original programming and why the change in the level of spending?","David Wells","Well. I would say remember that we are kind of trying to optimize for a high-quality shows, so they take a long time to discover, they take a little bit longer to build and the delivery time becomes a little bit longer to build. And the delivery time becomes a little more elastic. So we have announced last year, we expected Sense8 to land in the end of 2014 and we still do. It's subject to move a little bit, I imagine. We do expect the KZK show to deliver in '14 as well. I know we have some other announcements coming along the way. So to your earlier part of your question, we said it's a doubling of where we are at today. That includes some of these shows, some shows that we are yet to announce and then including some big shows that have yet we have to launch like the first wave of the DreamWorks Animation deal, the season two is another of the content. So we are trying to move as quickly as we can and we think that, its not that we are beginning comfortable with the number if begin in 10. We are comfortable at the number that we are currently sitting at and where we are currently looking to grow to and we are going to keep reviewing it. So HBO, as an example, about 40% of their spend is on original programming. So there is a big gap from where we are to where we could be.","David Wells","And Rich, this is David. Just at the risk of repeating a little about what Ted just said. To reconcile some of those comments our intension is, as we have said, to double it. The expense, it will still be a sub 10% likely next year. It just takes along a long time in terms of the lead time to get the shows out and with the commitment to quality to get those out but the doubling of expense over time is certainly there and we have talked 10%, 20%, 25%. We don't know what the right number is but we know that it is going to grow over time and with the success we have seen to-date we are going to continue to expand it.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","Just along those lines, would you even want to own content outright? How do you think about ramping up your own production capabilities to control a series completely? What would have to happen for you to shift the model more in that direction?","Reed Hastings","So we would like to control the territories and the windows that we need and we could either achieve that through owing it out right or by negotiating with third party producers to end up in the same place. And I am a little indifferent between the two. I think in our early goings we were protective and trying to kind of hedge our bets as we stepped into the content and certainly do want to build a big infrastructure around ownership. Something we would be much more comfortable doing today and could, particularly considering the complexity of new territories as we open them up.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","When a company fails in the original production business, all of your peers, Ted they end up taking an immediate write down of the content. They really have to expense it right away. Given your model where it's all part of the subscription process, how does one determine whether a show would have to be written off and given the long life of being able to be on the Netflix \"shelf\", will we ultimately see write-downs from Netflix, because obviously everything you won't make won't be in a five-for-five batting average range.","Reed Hastings","Yes, I will probably take this, Ted. Rich, likely you won't see many write-downs, in the sense that we have already got a shorter amortization period than the license period. But if we feel like the hours viewed are not going to be generated from a particular title or PC content, we would look across that category, we would look at the title and say are we materially off of it and then we would have to make a judgment. But generally, we are already sort of shorter than the license period. So there is a some conservatism there. And then we would look at our projections to see how far apart we are but generally it is about those hours coming in spread over the life of the term which is less about whether you have a piece of content that you think is going to be viewed half than something you expected before and it is more about the pattern of those hours.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","How quickly the viewing happens right?","Reed Hastings","Right, and so there is an opportunity cost though. If we do have a show that is performing significantly less than we expected that will obviously crowd out other investments that we could be making in other content that we could be making.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","This one is for Ted. You have obviously already broken new ground in terms of releasing all the episodes of a particular season at the same time. How do you think about breaking further convention and perhaps releasing a second season or next season of the show sooner than that tradition 12 month Hollywood cycle?","Reed Hastings","Yes. We are very excited about trying to do that, in terms of when we go to into a show, particularly if we committed to multiple seasons upfront, then we would accelerate the production schedule. But again we don't want to loose track of quality. So we want to leave time for the writing to be as best as it can be and also for the talent to rest in between seasons. But ideally we would like to reduce those cycle times between seasons beyond the tighter than the one year we are seeing today.","David Wells","We went to a second season of Orange Is the New Black early because we have seen all 13 episodes. We are highly confident the forecast models and the quality of the show and it enabled us to move into production sooner and close the window between Season 1 and Season 2, so you see in that show already.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","If we look at the content beyond the TV series that you are creating and think more broadly, I asked you at the end of the last conference call about movies and it seems like over the last few months more and more of people in the movie industry keep expecting you to do something in the movie business. Curious what's stopping you? It seems like you seem to have quite an interest in breaking into the movie business. If you did it, what would it look like? Documentary, 100 million-type? We talking Avengers? What do you want to doing and why would you want to be in the movie business?","David Wells","We are looking at all those things you just described and we are actively looking right now to few documentary projects that will premier on Netflix versus more traditional windows.","On the movie side, I would keep my mind wide open to what those films would be and what they would look like and really the driver of it is like we are able to kind of break convention on television by operating all episodes at once, hoping that consumers have really loved we like to do more of that in the movie space. In that today we are kind of held to the traditional pay model meaning the movies are not coming to Netflix, until they hit pay television almost a year after they are in theaters. Even through that window is moving, I don't know if it moving aggressive enough for people who really do have experienced more in demand and on-demand lifestyle around their content, so I think that the more we would be aggressive with windowing by taking more control over the content earlier in the process that would be good for our members.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","There is an increasing talk about the NFL looking to sale certain digital rights to other providers. Can you talk about your appetite for a live event and sport content and how you might be able to use that potentially as loss leader for sub-acquisition is a possible you can even make the economics on that content itself workout.","Reed Hastings","I would say we are in the same place we were Doug, we are still not interested in sports. What we bring to the table is a lot of improvement, because of all the attributes are on-demand and I don't think that brings much to sports viewing which is primarily a linear experience.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","A topic that I think is near and dear to everybody right now in terms of Netflix is, your MVPD, ISP relationships and kind of how that plays out. I think Doug and I have a number of questions on that topic. I think first off, John Malone was in New York for the Liberty Analyst Day, obviously representing [Charter] and he basically said that riding on the pipes of the ISPs for free is \"simply unsustainable\". He was hoping from kind of a big picture response from Reed.","Reed Hastings","Yes. I mean, when you look at broadband collecting $40 to $60 dollars a month for operating broadband and not having to pay content cost, I could say, well that's unsustainable. They have to pay some of the content cost.","In fact, the arguments works both ways and we think it will work out in the long-term best if there is neutrality and that if we bring the bets there is an interchange and that there is no charging at the interchange and this the architecture that's allowed the growth of the global Internet which is not taxing each other, so we are very optimistic that that will continue. There are people who say own cable companies or own content companies who aspire on the other side to collect I don't think it's going to happen. It's definitely still emerging and growing.","In general, with our Open Connect, which is free to all our ISPs, we are seeing a great adoption. It's nearly every single ISP outside of the U.S. and its many of the smaller once inside the U.S. so we are definitely making some real progress there and I think it will leave room for great consumer services from broadband companies and from content companies.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Along those lines, can you help us understand how the recent deals are structured with Virgin Media and in the past I believe you primarily paid for on devices and subscriber acquisition on more of a per sub basis. Are we seeing any more of a shift toward recurring economics with these kind of deals going forward?","David Wells","Yes. Doug as you would suspect I can't get it into the individual terms. What I would say is that we are really set to try to that help Virgin expand their footprint. They are doing a leading hedge job with their MVPD and what we hope to do is be able to use their quality of experience that they are generating to help them grow share because of course then other MVPDs so long to do that also.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","When you look at the U.S., what are the biggest challenges? Google Fiber has you on their box. They actually in some ways sell their box to the consumer. Others are leasing the boxes. Is it possible for you to be on a Comcast lease set-top box or does it have to be on a box like the Roku or an Apple TV? Can you just walk us though what are the biggest hurdles to replicating this in the U.S.?","Reed Hastings","No, I am sure we could be on a Comcast box. So the real question is, we have to figure out deal terms that make sense for both sides. And it's been an ongoing discussion with many of the MVPDs not limited to Comcast. But I have a X1, the Comcast box at home. It's got an apps and I listened to Pandora on it. I think personally, I would like to be able to watch Netflix and that will keep me on the Comcast X1, which is a great product. So I am really hopeful that we can do that with both Comcast and other people in the industry.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","But David, I think was speaking at a conference just a couple of weeks ago and said that, some of your programming deals make that very challenging. Could you elaborate?","Reed Hastings","Sure. I don't think at this point it would be a problem to be on a Comcast box and presumably others. So, historically there definitely were some concerns but I think we are through that at this point.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Just following-up on that, just the CDN you built play into implications for getting wholesale deals done?","Reed Hastings","A little bit, because what we want to do is have a great experience on these boxes and the ISPs that directly interconnect with our Open Connect CDN get a better experience, higher video quality, less rebuffering. And so with Virgin, we are integrated all the way through and it creates a better experience. I am not sure that what everybody wants is a better experience.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Could you talk about your ISP penetration rates? Do you see notable difference in terms of cable operators versus telco fiber versus DSL? Are there real differences at this point? And are people looking towards the highest quality charts that you roll-out each month in terms of who's the best?","Reed Hastings","Yes, let's say a few consumers look. But I can't say that people move in droves from one to another just based on our comparison. But what we really see is that ISP's, especially cable and fiber, want to invest in the next generation architecture to be able to offer 100 megabits, a gigabit and you are seeing this. This is a very highly profitable businesses, if you can get them to scale and there is a no point for a consumer getting a 100 megabit pipe or gigabit pipe if doesn't get to places like Netflix and YouTube quickly. So it's both the on ramp that's the speed that's rated and just how well interconnected it is and that's why we developed this free Open Connect program to be able to supply those highest possible speeds.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Just shifting gears to talk about international streaming a little bit. How should we think about the relative degrees of profitability in the international markets? How many, perhaps, are currently profitable and how do you think about the general timeframe to reach breakeven?","Reed Hastings","Go ahead, David.","David Wells","Either one us can answer that. But Doug, we have said, for competitive reasons, that we provide additional color on the markets. You can take the information that you do have, which is the progress of the overall international loss getting better each quarter and in our statements that we are growing net additions or members in each one of those market. So both of them give you an indication of improving pictures in each one of our markets.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","When you look at the top 10 broadband markets, I think Netflix right now, if you look at total household subscribers in millions, Netflix is only in three of the top 10, the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil. That leaves seven very large broadband markets that you haven't attached yet. The markets that you have actually entered most recently, leaving of Latin America, are actually relatively smaller in terms of total broadband subscribers. When do you go for the big ones? What's holding you back from getting into some of those very large broadband markets?","Reed Hastings","Well it is definitely something we are looking at, Rich. We definitely have been being a little more cautious since the price change two years ago and our thinner base in the U.S. Now we are gaining momentum there. We expanded in the Nordics a year ago. Netherlands, recently. And so when we look forward to next year, we will definitely be looking at some larger expansions, in terms of their size of broadband markets.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Just following-up there. You highlighted the initial response in the Nordics and the Netherlands. Can you talk a little bit more about the experience you have had there so far, the characteristics in those markets that have made them potentially off to a faster start than some of the other markets that you see?","Reed Hastings","We really we have great and consistent success across all of the markets except for the payments issue that we underestimated in Latin America. We have been straight forward about that. We are making progress on that. And over time, Latin America will be an enormous success for us. It's already growing rapidly, the number of broadband households in Latin America will exceed the U.S. over the next five years, so it's really a huge and broadband household is subscribers' household we have enough money to pay for broadband, so that kind of evens up the count and Latin America will be huge in that category and huge for us. But other than the payments issue, we had a very consistent reception across all of the markets. People want on-demand and everybody loves, not everybody but in every market there are a lots of people that love Hollywood content. Then we are continuing to argument that with lots of local content.","David Wells","It's probably worth point out too, Reed, that, House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black particularly, but also Hemlock Grove and all the original shows have been remarkably popular in every territory we operate in. Even on much lesser market expense. So we have been thrilled that we have been able to find some real scale, international scale with the original programs as well.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","And Ted, while my Brazilian is not great or my Portuguese is not great, it does seem like from reading some of the local papers that you have done a little bit of local programming in Brazil. Wondering if you could talk to us about that? How significant spend wise and is this the start of much larger local programming strategy overseas?","David Wells","Rich, it's pretty much a scale problem. So you have to have enough people there to program for them specifically order produce for them specifically. I would say what we are doing in Portuguese local language content in Brazil is very much at the experimental stage and we think given the indicators that we are seeing in Latin America that's it's very feasible that we can make the economics work for the local productions in some of these territories.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Just one more on the international markets, do you ultimately believe that most of these markets can look the U.S. in terms of penetration, usage assuming the technology. The broadband capability is ultimately on a comparable level or do you think that there is something else unique about the U.S. just in terms of penetration or usage goals that would make this market different?","David Wells","No. I don't think there is anything fundamental that's different about the U.S. If you look at YouTube usage, it's about 80% international. If you look at Skype revenue before they were acquired, it's about 83% international. Given the relative size of the economies, the U.S. which is 5% of the population, generates more revenue than its population count in the world, but it should be around 20-80 in the long-term may be 30-70 since we started so U.S.-centric and DVD-centric, but those are the numbers that they are the large internet firms have.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","If we shift over to competition, we have new management now at Hulu, new cash infusion of $700 million at Hulu. Amazon supposedly it seems like worst-kept secret is rolling out some form of set-top box. Wondering when you look at 2014, are you expecting a more aggressive domestic competitive landscape than we have seen throughout 2013?","Reed Hastings","Not particularly. There are certain markets like the U.K., that are very competitive with BSkyB and Now TV. There are other markets, well, all of other markets really are pretty competitive. Remember, we don't just compete against say other $8 to $10 video services. We compete broadly I guess cables and satellite, we compete against video games, we compete against just browsing time killing time on the web and so it's because we compete so broadly that we haven't seen any material effect as competitors more direct competitors have risen and fallen in the last two or three years. There is a lot of competition for content, but then if you think of our originals, there we compete with about 40 different cable networks that are producing original, so if you are a writer, you have the great idea you know you are biting it all broadly to see who will buy it at the best price.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Just one more in the competitive front, Reed. If we look at Google Searches for Netflix, it looks like they vastly exceed those for LOVEFiLM right now in the UK. What do you think is driving the success that you are having there relative to lot given that they were earlier to the market?","Reed Hastings","It's a really tough thing doing a hybrid play with DVD. People associate you with DVD and the branding of LOVEFiLM Instant is impossible to deliver on. It's a congruent that we figured out that we were doing both, so LOVEFiLM people are meant DVD is supper broad selection and LOVEFiLM Instant which is the brand means all that but now streaming and for a series of rights issues no company can deliver on that. And so Redbox Instant has the same problem. The brand, fundamentally, is not correct because they can't deliver on that promise, as exciting as it sounds to consumers. So that's a big tension. Now Amazon is having a lot of success on the pay-per-view side and on streaming inside of Prime. So I think those are really the areas of focus for them and they are very successful in those areas.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","Playing though, is that thing what you just said, Reed and shifting over to your DVD business, Netflix really has become synonymous with streaming on a global basis. Is your DVD business at this point strategic? Are there other ways to best create value out of that business for Netflix?","Reed Hastings","I think the best way is within Netflix and it's running as a standalone group. It's doing great work. We have got over 7 million people that are very excited to have that breadth of selection including all the HBO and Showtime series on DVD. So it's just got a super selection. But we don't market it a lot partially because of that brand confusion problem. So it's really, it will shrink a little bit every year but I think the best way to monetize it is going to be keep it as it is.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","Reed, you have only talked about users preferring to watch Netflix content on their large screen TV's. Google, the other night, said that 40% of YouTube usage was now coming via mobile. How much of Netflix's total viewing comes from mobile devices currently? And how much of a driver do you think mobile ubiquity is just in driving new subscribers and also reducing churn?","Reed Hastings","Well there is mobile on cellular networks and that's fairly small for us. I think it's a combination of the long form content and the data caps that are one those plans. Then there is mobile within the home where it's on Wi-Fi and it's the device you watch in bed, you watch curled on the couch and that's been quite large for us. So it really depends on the sub category but fundamentally where Netflix works best is with a Internet screen that's got on Wi-Fi rather than on cellular networks.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","And when you think about those devices, could you give us any color on, is tablets now getting the in-home viewing, is tablets now a meaningful percentage and do you see differences between - are people using it more on iOS than on Android? We have heard from some people, Alan from Machinima the other day indicate that most of their viewing actually occurs on tablets on iOS devices. Are you seeing similar type patterns where there really is skew?","Reed Hastings","Well. We don't give that individual breakdowns, either on devices or on OS'. But in general, I think the competition between the Android family and the iOS family and the Windows family is creating a great bounty for consumers because of the low prices and attractive usage patterns. And then Netflix, YouTube and others benefit from all of those usage patterns. So tablets are growing, mobile phones are growing but frankly so are smart TVs is going very rapidly for us.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Can you talk about what kind of lift you expect to see in 4Q from the new gaming consoles and is this as material now as it was in the early days of streaming when you were just beginning to get distribution?","Reed Hastings","Doug, I think we will see very little lift from that because the people who buy the PS4 and Xbox One are the people who already have the PS3 and the Xbox 360. They are the hardcore fans who want to get the coolest, latest thing to play more games. So the first way does not expand the market for us or for them. So it's really a question of, do those companies, over time, pioneer a model where instead of 60 million or 80 million as a lifetime, they get to 200 million or 300 million units. If so, through some combination of price and utility and then it becomes expansive. But that's a couple of years down the road.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","When you look at the overall viewing that you have, you have talked about three quarters of it coming from your recommendation engine. Just curious, when you look at that recommendation engine going forward, can it still get a lot better? I think in your press release you talked about or actually, the update to your long-term view, you actually detailed that you are increasing your spending on technology up to like $400 million from $350 million was in the prior long-term view. Is that to make things like the recommendation engine better? What are you trying to do in terms of make the product better? Like what's not good right now in terms of baby offering?","Reed Hastings","Well, the recommendations are getting better and better which is a combination of the data that we can collect and then how much CPU intelligence we can put in terms of processing that. And so its got a long way to go. If you think about where we will be in 5 or 10 years, how much better will Google Search be? How much better will Netflix's recommendations? How much better will Amazon will be? All of the different businesses are getting better at processing these large amounts of data to synthesize better and better recommendations, so, I am very optimistic about it over the next couple of years getting to where there is half dozen recommendations that we offer that are cherry picked and that a large percentage over time one of those half dozen or exactly what you are looking for.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","A question for David just on the balance sheet, what are your thoughts on the strength of the balance sheet currently? If you had access to more capital, how would you potentially look to deploy this in terms of either TV production moving into movies, perhaps more directly or expanding international quicker?","David Wells","Well, Doug, we haven't used any cash this year. We started year with the February raise we were about $1 billion. Now we are about $1.1 billion. The two primary things that continue to be a use of cash are our international investments in the sense that they run, we run negative on those and there are on a loss on a consolidated basis and our content spending and that's predominately originals and output style deals and we will continue to assess these, but we are pretty comfortable where we are right now. Obviously, the market conditions are attractive in a number of different places, but we still continue to assess and be pretty comfortable with where we stand.","Reed Hastings","Just a follow-up, last quarter I think you made a comment that there might be a need to tap the markets to move faster. Is that something that you think about? I guess, given where your stock is, given where debt markets are, why aren't you trying to move even faster right now than you are in terms of international expansion? I mean, debt is cheap and your equity at all time record highs. Just why not faster I guess it's really the open question.","David Wells","Well, I think Reed and I can take a piece of this together, but I would say that we don't feel capital constrained right now in terms of our pace of expansion. If we did, we would go out and tap the market, but Reed if you got a follow-up for that too.","Reed Hastings","No. I would say the same thing which is, we think we are going at a great clip. We wanted to get back to solid profitability, be able to fund our international work. If we weren't much faster on international, we would drive the global P&L negative, which is not something we have been comfortable with, so on a practical basis we are more P&L constrained on the international.","On originals, Ted knows. He has got the cash if he needs to use it to be able to get the right talent on the right projects, so there is no particular constraint there. The only reason frankly that we haven't raised more money is, we don't see the need right now, so then we just balance what's a good security market and we think we are pretty comfortable, but you can certainly make an argument we should, given all the conditions you said, take it up a little bit but it will be pretty immaterial if we did something.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Just following-up on that. In the past you have talked about running the overall business on a breakeven basis. Of course, we see in the domestic streaming business the 400 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion and being reasonable obviously in terms of how you are expanding into international markets. How do we think about that statement of running breakeven going forward?","Reed Hastings","Well, we definitely say running profitable now. Keeping the business profitable, so that's how we have evolved that statement.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","When you think about Aereo, they have kind of defied the logic of the broadcast and seeming to prove themselves legal to-date in the courts. Well I know that you look at yourselves as a cable network or digital cable network much like HBO, the combination of an offering of $8 a month for a DVR with a bunch of broadcast television stations as well as deep catalog and great original programming from Netflix does seem like a pretty potent combination for a good chunk, maybe not 10s of million, but certainly millions of consumers, is an alliance or some form of greater working arrangement a possibility for you as you look forward?","Reed Hastings","Well Aereo is both opportunity and threat. To some degree it's opportunity that more people get used to on demand and love that. It's also a threat because the natural course for them as they get to a couple million subscribers is first to license other cable networks trying to build the better package. Then ultimately become a competitor for Netflix.","Now, there one competitor or many of competitors as I talked about so we don't spend any particular time on Aereo. Think of it as the entertainment time pool for money and time. It's very large. And so no one competitor really has seemed to be able to effect us either positively or negatively. So I would really doubt that we notice anything specific about areas growth upon Netflix, either positive or negative in the next couple of years.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Just a question on cord-cutting, Reed. Can you just talk about your current views in terms where we are with cord-cutting in the U.S.? What do you think the trends are there? And if you have any kind of idea in terms of how much of a driver this is for Netflix?","Reed Hastings","Well the trends have been quite clear that there is zero cord-cutting. We are at $100 million on a year-over-year basis and Q2 does down a little bit every year as students move but it same as Q2 last year. So right now there is zero cord-cutting. The question is, well, will that last? And that really depends on does cable continue to get better. Cable is taking share from satellite, fiber is growing a little bit a too. So there are some important and interesting secular notes in that. But in general consumers are getting a lot of content on cable and that's doing well for them and our market has not been the cord-cutter market. I mean if you think about it domestically, as we have grown from zero to 31 million and there has been no decline in MVPD household. So it really seems pretty strong that consumer see as complementary to MVPD rather than a replacement for it.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","From an HBO standpoint, you have passed them now in the U.S. I know that certainly the media blogosphere seems very excited about that statistic, but it seem like in shareholder letter that you seem more focused on a much bigger long-term opportunity, which is the international subscribers of HBO at a 114 million and obviously with your international business where it is now you got a long way to go but it also sounds like you have some big plans for international market launches in the next 12 to 24 months. Is it years away? Meaning five plus years away to be bigger than HBO globally? Or could you actually get there even faster than that given the pace of broadband adoption on a global basis?","Reed Hastings","It will get probably take longer than that because they are continuing to grow. You know the thing about us is, as we grow HBO is really focusing on doing incredible work. They will probably do some of the best shows they ever do in the next five years. They are expanding more aggressively in international. So I think what we will see is they grow some. We hopefully grow a lot and I don't know when we will catch them. It is going to be a long time. I mean at 114 million, they have been at it since 1972. So that's 40 years and we have been at it, in the streaming sense, only seven years. So I am really happy with our progress to-date they but we do have a long way to go catch up to them.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","A question for Ted, just on originals and other content. Can you just talk more about, obviously, since you have had the originals over the last six to nine months or so, this particular wave, how much that's opened up the door for writers and producers to come to you directly where you are on inbounds and how that's changed the environment for you?","Ted Sarandos","So both the success of the shows, in terms of the launching and certainly the success at the Emmy Awards was helpful. But mostly, I think, content creators are really attracted to the notion of creative control and being able to come here and make the show that they intended to make without a lot of creative interference. So we get a lot of inbound traffic. I would guess that on most major projects, we are the first and not the second stop for these content creators because I think they are mostly incredibly enthused about the idea of how we make and release the content and how we support it once it's live. So far it's been incredibly door opening which was the intent of doing high profile shows like House of Cards, right out of the gate.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Kind of a housekeeping question for David on the amortization change that you\u2019ve made. You talked about that 27 million number. What was the offset? Because you are obviously ramping your marketing spend that Reed talked about. You are continuing to ramp your technology spend. You, I assume, didn't know heading into last quarter when you gave guidance that you were going to have the step up in accelerated amortization, both in Q3 as well as in Q4. Where is the offset? Is it just purely on a subscriber growth number that you are making it up or how do we make up that delta?","David Wells","Sure. So you are correct that we didn't know heading into guidance. 20 million of it is domestic and about half of that we were made-up in terms of our performance with subscribers, revenue, lower content and some marketing expenses that got pushed. The other half we were able to adjust marketing spend, and so you will see some of it get shifted into Q4, some of the discretionary items that we were able to shift some of the other money around, so we made up the difference that way.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","The question just on the DVD front, can you talk about where you are now in terms of distribution centers compared to where you were are the peak and other things that you have done in terms of the improving efficiency there?","David Wells","I will probably take this one, Dough. We were about 39 centers and I think we peaked out at about 48 and maybe around 50, so probably about 20% less, but we still continue to reach a great percentage of the U.S. in one day service, because even if we drop a distribution center we will add a shuttle which still gets the nail to that local postal center, so it's not a one-to-one relationship when we close a distribution center that folks in that area get two-day service. It has a large part to do with the U.S. postal system and what's happening there, so when they close distribution centers, there is only so much we can do in terms of moving things around, but we are still pleased with how much of the U.S. we get in one day service.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Shifting over to Open Connect. Reed, you mentioned it before, when you had this video hang out the last time, I believe you were acquiring Open Connect in order for people to have access to your highest quality content. It seems like you\u2019ve dropped that mandate in order to get higher quality content up into the market. Could you just discuss that change in strategy?","Reed Hastings","Yes. We realized with 4K coming, we want to be one of the big suppliers of 4K content next year that we want to not to complicate that as to which networks that was available on and not and if we are going to have 4K available everywhere. We should have super HD also available, so it's really driven from the impending next year 4K expansion.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","David just a follow-up on the amortization, so you pulled forward the $27 million in 3Q, can you talk just a little bit about over the few quarters how we should think about that impact?","David Wells","What we said was, we are not coming off our targets, so the impact is absorbed basically right now. You shouldn't think of there being any impact. Obviously, there is some hit to the international side and so that's part of the losses of the international, but overall, I will just remind folks that it's still less than 10% of our overall content expense. Even though there is this change, the majority of that was catch up amortization related to titles that were released prior to Q3.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","When you see a show like Walking Dead versus let's just say House of Cards, you are seeing a dramatically different profile in terms of viewership, in terms of people are watching House of Cards basically within a few month window where something like Walking Dead every night, the most watched episode is still the first episode of Season 1 and so you are seeing that define trend change or do you think that once you launched Season 2 of House of Cards, that's going to actually change back to more of the Walking Dead like modeling, change in the amortization policy may have been too early to adjust if that makes sense?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, well it is possible, Rich, that will be true, but we have to do what we can based upon estimates that we have. The difference is not so much on kind of what happens to the tail. Remember with The Walking Dead, we don't get it on the same day as the new episode comes out. We get it following season, so you are tapping into a much more stable part of the demand curve in society, whereas, when we released House of Cards, we create a fervor around it as the new episode of the new show, and so think of it as when with content that they have used on Netflix, there is surge of viewing in the first couple of months that's quite strong. Then so, we allocate the cost on that basis. Whereas, when we get prior season from anybody else then it's not the amount of backup promotion going on about that show is less for the prior season, so it's a relatively stable demand and that's the fundamental difference in the linear versus accelerated.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Just the question regarding social and Facebook in particular, any update just in terms of social sharing and how that's driving engagement currently?","David Wells","Well, we are continuing to work on it, we have got some big tests that are in flight now, trying to find the right balance, the right consumer model that people are excited about, but so far no big news to talk about.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","We have gotten several questions from investors asking about Carl Icahn and what your relationship with him is now and if you have any sense of just how Carl thinks about what you have done in a fairly short time of his investment.","David Wells","Well, he says he likes people that make him money. So he is happy with me for now. But I would have to refer you to him in terms of how he feels about the investment.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Just a question on pricing. Reed, you make it pretty clear in the letter that the $7.99 price point is working well in terms of members and contribution margin growth. How do you think about that potential to change further out?","Reed Hastings","Well we are always looking at ideas and thinking about it, but we are not on the edge of doing something. So the $7.99 is working for us very well. We will continue to monitor the trends. We have got many markets around the world. So we are able to potentially look at some different avenues. We did do a price increase in Brazil that was necessary relative to inflation and it is something we can look at if we have to. But right now the $7.99 is working great for us.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And when you look at international markets, we have got a couple of questions that both point to in terms of what you are looking for now? I mean obviously you chose to go into some relatively smaller markets. But what are the key things now as you go forward that you are looking for in terms of which markets to launch and will we see kind of groups of markets like Scandinavia and Latin America or should we expect more targeted individual countries going forward?","Reed Hastings","Ted, do you want to take that one?","Ted Sarandos","In how we are looking at? We are looking mostly at markets that have all those characteristics that we have looked for from the beginning. Really active online consumers, sophisticated payments structures that we can tap into. So well established e-commerce behavior and a good healthy appetite for Western content. I think our programming has been, like I said, so for has been really successful wherever we go. So we are looking for markets where that programming will travel incredibly well and continue on that path.","Reed Hastings","Well, you guys are almost set here.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","We have one more. Well, at least I have one more question, and Doug has one more as well. But the one question that everyone wants to know from Ted and this is very important. Something that Ted is really excited about. Breaking Bad, when are we going to see the final season of Breaking Bad on Netflix?","Ted Sarandos","It has a DVD cycle that we need to honor with Sony who puts that through. So I don't have the date in front of me but it's going to be open in few months","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","Before the end of the year or probably after the end of the year?","Ted Sarandos","After the end of the year.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Alright, great, I think. We are good from my end guys.","Reed Hastings","Thanks","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Thank you."],"15466":["Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 24, 2012  6:00 PM ET","Executives","Ellie Mertz","Reed Hastings - Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Member of Stock Option Committee","David Wells - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer","Analysts","Anthony J.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ellie Mertz, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellie Mertz","Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to the Netflix Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Q&A Session. I'm joined here by Reed Hastings, CEO; and David Wells, CFO. We announced our financial results for the second quarter at approximately 1 p.m. Pacific Time today.

Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to the risks and uncertainties related to the business. A detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the commission on February 10, 2012. A rebroadcast of this Q&A session will be available at the Netflix website after 6 p.m. Pacific today.","Now let's move directly to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Ellie Mertz","[Operator Instructions]","So we're going to start with questions about subscriber metrics and our guidance. First question. How closely tied are hours viewed per subscriber and your subscriber metrics especially churn? Has there been any material improvement in customer churn in domestic streaming? If not, why does not the higher engagement reflected in the higher hours translate into improved churn?","Reed Hastings","Well absolutely, viewing and retention are connected. The more a subscriber uses Netflix, the more that they stay a subscriber as you would expect, and there's significant variation between those who watch an hour a month, 10 hours a month and 50 hours a month. And so, we're always trying to improve the experience, more content, better viewing, better streaming to increase the amount of viewing because then, subscribers prioritize the $7.99 for Netflix above other expenses.","Ellie Mertz","You said in the letter that Netflix's goal was to become the world's most popular TV and movie service. Presumably, you're defining success by the number of global streaming subscribers. The bears [ph] believe that Netflix cannot become this large because at $8 a month, the company cannot compensate the content providers enough. Can you comment on this?","Reed Hastings","Well, we've been charging $8 a month for streaming for several years and we've continued to grow the subscriber growth and to grow the content. And we're basically continuing to execute on that game plan, and that's helped us grow very considerably. So I don't see what the issue is per se with an $8 service if you get a lot of members, and that's what we're focused on: to be able to continue to build out the content.","Ellie Mertz","On guidance, I'm curious about the Olympic impact comment. In previous Olympics, how much did the games impact subscriber growth?","Reed Hastings","Well, it's hard for us to gauge the Beijing 2008 Olympics because we had a 3-day DVD outage right at the same time. I would say that we did feel some impact and there's uncertainty around whether that impact is permanent, meaning it's just a permanent reduction in acquisitions or if it's just a deferral through the games. So I would say that through the first 3 weeks of 2012, we would have expected to be above 2010 levels, and what we're seeing is that we're nearly at 2010 levels, so it gave us some more uncertainty in terms of what Q3 would look like in terms of being at a 2010 level of 1.8 million net addition.","Ellie Mertz","A related question. You talked about some of the headwinds you're facing on subscribers, including the Olympics this summer. Given these headwinds, what will it take to reach your full year goal for net adds? Another question, what are the risks in Q4 net add guidance to make that 7 million number?","David Wells","Well, I think there's a number of puts and calls. There's Netflix's reputation. As that continues to build back, there's improvements that we make between now and Q4. Then there's all the Smart TV sales that are -- all the manufacturers are very focused on Q4. So those would be all the positives. Negatives would be if there's a substantial new competition between now and then, other factors like that. Economic issues don't tend to affect us much because we're so -- such a good value so I don't think we have much risks on up and downs in the economy.","Ellie Mertz","A question on devices. Does the slowdown in game console and DVD players sales impact new streaming adoption? What about the slate of low-end tablets in the back half? How are you thinking about the benefits from smaller and cheaper tablets?","Reed Hastings","We'll see, take -- to that second part first, on tablets. They're mostly used at this point as a laptop substitute, and so we don't see it as net incremental availability because everyone who's got a tablet, also has a laptop and could've been using us on a laptop. And then Blu-rays, the question asked about DVD slowdown, that's true. But Blu-rays haven't yet slowed down. Presumably, they will eventually and most Blu-ray players can play Netflix and then the big category growth is in Smart TVs.","Ellie Mertz","Can you give us some color on U.S. streaming growth adds and churn during the quarter? Were both metrics as you expected? Was there a seasonal pick up churn?","David Wells","We hit the -- basically, right about the midpoint of the range. So yes, both churn and gross additions were as expected. We saw a seasonal -- a small seasonal decline in retention, which we have seen before from Q1 to Q2. So we're right where we thought we were going to be.","Ellie Mertz","Moving to questions about content. Has there been a shift in content acquisition away from large-scale buys to a more focused, cost-effective approach that targets lucrative niche areas such as kids TV, past seasons of original series such as Mad Men, not to mention your original programming. It appears that a more streamlined focus strategy can help rein in content costs while quite possibly, improving the streaming selection. In other words, is this a focus on quality over quantity?","Reed Hastings","Well one, we're not trying to rein in content costs. We're continuing to invest more and more each year in content. Two, there's no shift. We're always focused on what does a piece of content cost versus how much we think it's going to get viewed. And so, where you see us get small or interesting films or TV shows, it's because we think the economics work in the amount we pay versus how much we think it's going to get viewed. And that's been consistent for several years.","Ellie Mertz","What are your release plans for original programming? While consumers would clearly love you to follow the all-at-once strategy to enable binge viewing, that strategy appears far from ideal vis-a-vis churn. As disconnecting and connecting Netflix is so easy, how do you balance those 2 dynamics?","Reed Hastings","Well, we're fundamentally focused on making it a great consumer experience and we do think it's an improved experience that only an on-demand service like Netflix can offer to have all the episodes at once. And so, we're going down that path. And I don't think there's a negative churn implication to it. I think there's a positive implication because it's a better and unique experience. And the more we develop compelling experiences, the bigger our market opportunity is.","David Wells","I would also add to that, that our expectation is, if we're successful with our originals, that we'll have multiple launches. So the availability of one season of one particular title might be followed up by another title that becomes available.","Reed Hastings","And as an example of that, Lilyhammer season 2 which I know all of you are hanging on, is going to be available next year.","Ellie Mertz","Another question on originals. You indicated you would \"blow away\" already impressive streaming hours when originals launch in 2013. What gives you the confidence that it will not simply be a substitute for existing Netflix content?","Reed Hastings","I think what we've seen is growth in viewing that's just huge over the last 5 years and we expect that growth in streaming to continue, including the originals. And we've been very happy relative to the investment on Lilyhammer, and so we're feeling quite good about the rise of Arrested Development season 4, House of Cards and our other originals.","Ellie Mertz","A final question on originals. Why have originals slipped to 2013 from late 2012? Is production on schedule?","Reed Hastings","Production's on schedule for first quarter 2013, yes.","Ellie Mertz","Streaming consumption seems to have swung heavily toward TV shows, and Netflix is benefiting from having some high-profile exclusive TV content like Mad Men. Is this a core strategy or at the right price, would you shift your content dollars more aggressively back towards movies?","Reed Hastings","We're in the business of providing great entertainment to our members at a very low price and part of that is the programming strategy which is to acquire content, that relative to the dollars we pay for, gets viewed a lot. And we're agnostic as to whether that's features, TV, kids TV, different kinds of episodic. And so where you see dollars shifting around, it's because that's where there's value to offer our subscribers. So yes, we would be totally open to getting good value, either on the features side, or on the many different types of television side, including originals.","Ellie Mertz","It sounds like you'll have nonexclusive Epix content for one more year. Are current discussions on potential exclusivity complete? Any chance of keeping the content beyond 1 year?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think it's just great content and we have it for the next year guaranteed and then we'll go from there. Certainly, it's working very well for both Epix and us at this point.","Ellie Mertz","Another question on that. How would you expect Netflix to be impacted by the likely appearance of Epix movies on competing services?","Reed Hastings","We wouldn't expect to be affected significantly. Epix is not a particularly large source of total viewing. Much more of our viewing is on our exclusives as was referenced, Mad Men, Breaking Bad and such shows.","Ellie Mertz","Do you think the recent renegotiations between MSOs and cable companies will negatively impact your access to content or the price will be apt to pay going forward?","Reed Hastings","No, we don't have that expectation.","Ellie Mertz","Question on HBO. So why did you comment -- in the letter, you commented on working together with HBO. How would you work together with HBO? Would you license HBO programming and\/or co-finance programming? Potential timing?","Reed Hastings","I'm not sure what we would do. My point is that we're just another network, and that when you have multiple networks, they often find ways of working together. So it's a general point that it's not a zero-sum game between HBO and Netflix. And that, in fact, there may be ways of working together. But there's nothing particularly pressing.","Ellie Mertz","Leading to a question on competition. How does Netflix plan on competing with growing online streamers? For example, with Amazon, Hulu and Google?","Reed Hastings","Well, we've been competing with 2 of those. Google doesn't really have a subscription premium TV service at this point. And so, with Google, we advertise a lot on YouTube and we're one of the biggest advertisers there, which is very successful for us and for Google. In terms of Amazon and Hulu Plus, if you look at the Sandvine data on streaming usage in the U.S., we've got a huge lead and that lead is only growing.","Ellie Mertz","Moving to questions on internationals. What gives you the confidence that you can achieve breakeven, let alone profitability, in international markets outside of Canada, arguably the 51st state?","David Wells","Well, we've seen increasing engagement in those markets outside of the U.S., and we've seen our ability to improve our losses from Q1 to Q2. Now, we've made the decision to raise our content spend in the U.K. like we did in Canada because we are encouraged by the results, the early results we've seen. So I think it's the ability for us to demonstrate the growth in those markets quickly and in the engagement in those markets that gives us the confidence that we can.","Reed Hastings","Do it and get the profit to breakeven and it's not just to breakeven and to substantial profitability.","David Wells","Correct.","Ellie Mertz","Some of these are related questions. What would cause the company to slow its international plans down and concentrate on growing consolidated profits instead?","Reed Hastings","When we have finished our international expansion, we would certainly do that. But until then, our model, as we've explained, is to get back to profitability and then open a new market, get back to profitability, open a new market. And that's based on the view that there's an extraordinary once-in-a-lifetime or once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a franchise in many markets as we've been building. And we think that our U.K., Ireland and LatAm expansions to date will, over time, prove to be very valuable and we'll all be very happy that we've done it.","Ellie Mertz","So doesn't this mean that the street should not assume meaningful growth in reported net income for the next few years, the profits from new market launches offsetting rising profits in the rest of the business?","Reed Hastings","Yes, that's completely consistent with what we've been saying. As long as there are good markets to enter around the world, that we would take the U.S. profits or the global profits and put them into faster international expansion.","David Wells","And I'd say just to round that out, the 3 conditions for additional expansion that we've said before were: one, that we would get back to global profitability to a breakeven level; two, that we are pleased with the progress that we're making in our existing markets; and three, that there would be an additional market identified that we think represents a good opportunity to expand.","Ellie Mertz","Given the capital needs for launching new markets, particularly for content acquisitions, is income statement-based profitability the right metric to use in determining new market launches or is there a component of cash flow or cash balance that you should also use to determine the timing and size of new market launches?","Reed Hastings","If international was a user of cash outside the P&L, that could be true, but it's not. It's substantially neutral between cash and P&L on international. The only big cash uses relative to P&L are the originals and some of the movie output deals. Anything else, David on...","David Wells","No, I'd say that -- I mean, there's a small -- a minor thing in Q2 where we had content added in the U.K. to the site that came in mid-quarter that was a small use of cash. But other than the mid-quarter, that's correct. We're -- our cash -- our content expense is matching our content cash, other than those exceptions you mentioned.","Ellie Mertz","Do you have enough data to discuss whether or not the usage trends in the international markets differ compared to the U.S. via TV shows versus movies, amount of time spent watching, et cetera.","Reed Hastings","There are many interesting similarities and differences. For competitive reasons, I'm not going to go into them.","Ellie Mertz","In your letter under the Latin American section, you've stated you've modified your sign-up flow to improve free trial to paid conversions. Can you flesh that out for us and tell us exactly what you mean by that? What do you mean by modified in your sign up flow?","Reed Hastings","Why don't you answer that, Ellie?","Ellie Mertz","One of the challenges we have in Latin America is that there's great popularity for trying a free trial, yet a month goes by and we try to run your credit card, your payment method and we can't get the payment method to run. So what we've done in Latin America is increase our upfront checks to make sure that when that free trial comes to completion, we have a valid payment method on trial. And so what we've done is increase the validation and seeing the results through improved conversion.","Turning to some questions on marketing. Given the solid earnings results, I would like to know if you believe you might have been able to dial up a few more subscriber adds with the somewhat larger marketing budget. In other words, why did you decrease marketing expense quarter-over-quarter with net adds volume?","David Wells","So narrowly, yes, we could have but that would've been inefficient spend. Typically, marketing goes down from Q1 to Q2 because it's a less attractive quarter to acquire new subscribers.","Ellie Mertz","Why do you emphasize content titles so much in the investor letter but not in your marketing?","Reed Hastings","In our marketing, we're really focused on try Netflix for free and then a consumer gets to experience the content. And so, it's a little different with investors. They already know of the content, they're generally users and what the content in the latter helps do is flesh out the picture of the new things that they might not otherwise be aware of. So they're sort of 2 different audiences.","Ellie Mertz","Some questions on your DVD business. Redbox Instant by Verizon unveiled its management team this morning. Does the coming Redbox Instant subscription offering increase the importance of your Netflix DVD business?","Reed Hastings","Our Netflix DVD business is very important, both amongst its 9-plus million members and for the profit it generates. We don't see any change in that. The Redbox Verizon streaming subscription service will have a long way to go just to break through the top 3. So we'll see what happens as they launch.","Ellie Mertz","We've heard and read increasing complaints about extended wait times for Netflix DVDs. We are curious how DVD inventory per subscriber compares to your historic metrics and whether you are using DVD inventory as a margin lever.","David Wells","So we measure something called first choice here and have a long time, and I would say that metric was flat through the second quarter. There are certain titles that you get caught in between content negotiation deals. And I would say HBO, for the HBO titles, were one of the only places you can actually get HBO through physical delivery. So we may be seeing some concentration of demand on those titles. In general, it's not a large profit lever for us because most of our shipments are catalog and I would say that the profit characteristics of that from Q1 to Q2 were more driven by reduced usage that's seasonal, seasonally low in Q2.","Ellie Mertz","How sustainable are the contribution margins for the DVD business going forward especially beyond this year?","David Wells","So what we said in the letter, it would be flat going through this year. I would say with the postal increases that we expect going forward, there'd be a slight decline.","Ellie Mertz","Of the 850k domestic DVD subscribers lost during the quarter, how many of those just dropped the DVD subscriptions but kept streaming or dropped from DVD to streaming?","David Wells","The migration patterns stayed consistent through Q2. We've got a bunch of people that joined the streaming service, some leave and come back as rejoins and a smaller percentage joined DVD only.","Ellie Mertz","Question on the service offering. It seems that you are now more consistently policing the policy of limiting to 3 simultaneous streaming devices. Do you see revenue with the opportunity for family plans or additional personalizations?","Reed Hastings","To clarify the premise of the question, there's no limit on devices. There is a limit for a standard Netflix streaming, $8 streaming account on 2 concurrent streams. So of a couple, you can each watch one different show at the same time or kids can watch one and adults can watch another. And that's been consistent for several years, so it's been quite a while.","Ellie Mertz","Does Netflix plan on streaming current episodes that were aired a few days ago to its customers for a small premium?","Reed Hastings","No. We're really focused on prior seasons and helping the current content developers build audiences. This is what we've done with Breaking Bad and Mad Men and other shows that are quite serialized. And that's a good way for us to build out the total ecosystem. The only shows that we would have fully current, we would have current and exclusive, will be our original series, House of Cards, Arrested Development season 4 and similar.","Ellie Mertz","A question on streaming delivery and Open Connect. Open Connect already serves some 10% of Netflix's streaming traffic. Can you break out the cost of hardware deployment so far or characterize the expected long-term cost savings? What pace of transition from third-party CDNs do you expect?","Reed Hastings","The cost savings will show up in the P&L more than on the balance sheet, and timing is of over -- it will just continue to grow. The 10% will continue to rise every quarter, and then it partially depends on the economics. I'm not sure about 2 years from now, what the ratio will be. But we'll just continue to invest in Open Connect. It's a more efficient, more tailored single-purpose CDN for our needs.","Ellie Mertz","Has Netflix changed its position with respect to paying MSO and telcos for preferred data access? Do you think this will evolve differently for wired and wireless?","Reed Hastings","We don't have a position on paying for preferred access and we don't pay for preferred access.","Ellie Mertz","A few questions on the financial statement. Why did the fully diluted share count increase from 55.5 million in Q1 to 58.8 million in Q2, a 5.9% jump?","David Wells","Because we swung to a profit. GAAP accounting would have you bake in the fully dilutive effects of the convert we did in November and that's not the case when you're at a loss -- in a loss position.","Ellie Mertz","What is the balance streaming content as of 6\/30\/12 that are currently reflected on the balance sheet?","David Wells","I think I know what you're asking, which is what is the minimum streaming obligations that are reported in our commitments table. Last quarter, in Q1, it was $3.7 billion of long-term liabilities and obligations not reflected on the balance sheet. That's $3.8 billion, so roughly flat. If you include the $1.2 billion in short-term liabilities, the total is $5 billion, corresponding to a $4.8 billion total in Q1. So again, up slightly.","Ellie Mertz","At this time, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator and we'll begin taking call-in questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have 2 questions. First, for Reed, you've talked in the past about how TV Everywhere authentication is potentially a big long-term competitor for you. In a lot of negotiations between the content programmers and the distributors, digital, I think, has come into play and I don't -- whether it has to do with ratings declines. You could argue that the presence of some programming on Netflix is having a little bit of an erosive effect on linear TV ratings or whether it's just the digital rights themselves. I think some of the distributors would like to have them in the traditional multichannel bundle. You, I think -- I think you said earlier that those negotiations should not or you do not expect those to impact pricing or availability of additional content. And so, I just wonder why not and why wouldn't they?","Reed Hastings","Anthony, it sounded like just one question. Did you say you had 2?","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, I wanted to also ask about a comment that you made about profitability. I think you said that it would be either a couple or few years before you stopped reinvesting profits or contribution margin from the U.S. business into international. And so, we're just trying to model earnings going forward and it sounded like you'd mentioned the company would be operating at breakeven for the next couple of years. So I wanted to clarify that too.","Reed Hastings","Yes, it's true that modeling earnings, global earnings for Netflix for the next couple of years is a relatively easy task because as the U.S. and our profitable international expansion become positive, we'll tend to turn that money around and invest in additional markets. Back to your first question, think of it as it's whoever pays the most money. So if a content owner wants to make money, the most money possible, they'll offer those digital rights both to us and to the existing distributors and sometimes exclusive, one or the other or sometimes noninclusive to both. And then it's just a matter of who bids the most for the different content sources. And so, they've been active bidders, all the networks have, and as well as Amazon, Hulu Plus and others. So that's why I say there's no particular effect to say the recent battles between programmers and distributors because for several years, programmers have wanted to get as much money as they can, which they should. So there's no particular climate change in the last 3 months.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Could one potential climate change be that now the distributors have their own broadband distribution solution, whether it's Comcast X1 or a different sort of Netflix-like service that's in the multichannel bundle that now, they're clearly are paying so much more in overall affiliate fees that they could integrate or bring in the digital rights as a holistic package with the content that they're buying already such that they get the hometown discount. I guess that's the concern.","Reed Hastings","Yes, it's a concern but ultimately, the programmer, if we offer $10 million and the programmer will then use that as leverage against the other distributors and say, \"Hey, we want at least $10 million more.\" And so, again if you look at it from the producer's standpoint, having more bidders than the other distributors is good for the content owner because then there's more bidders at the table. And we've said from the beginning that we think TV Everywhere and improving MVPD is our long-term competition and that thesis remains intact.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Citi.","Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on 2 things. First, Reed, I know somebody asked you earlier about tablets but I wonder if I could draw you out just on the impact of smaller tablets. I know we've had very few in the market, but your thoughts on what kind of impact that could have, maybe overall, to video streaming. That would seem to be less cannibalistic or substitutable, whatever the word is for laptops? And then secondly, could you just go over again the personalized plan options or the revenue opportunities new, if you have any, that come from the simultaneous -- the extensive simultaneous streaming you're currently seeing amongst your user base?","Reed Hastings","Sure. On the smaller form factors, if they're Wi-Fi connected, they're used in the home in pretty similar situations to how a laptop might be used. And as they come in, it makes a better viewing experience, the battery life is better, they're easier to hold so that would be a mild positive. There's certainly nothing negative about it. It's just not a revolutionary new way to watch. Whereas for example, a mobile phone when you can watch out of the home subject to the data caps, that's more impactful. And then on personal streams, think of it as, let's see, today, what we offer is a 2 simultaneous-stream program and some large families, that doesn't work for. They'll have 3 or 4 simultaneous streams going today, and what that family has to do today is get 2 Netflix accounts. And then they have to partition their devices, some set of TVs only work on one account and some set of TVs work on the other account. And ultimately, we want to help those families save money by being able to offer a family account, which has more than 2 simultaneous streams. So I wouldn't model it as a revenue opportunity. If anything, it would be a discount for those families in a lower price for more consumption. But in whether it's a slight reduction or slight increase, it's very much on the margin.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer & Company.","Jason S. Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So you talked about streaming -- the increased streaming usage helping to reduce or increase actually, member retention. I mean, can you talk directionally -- I mean, over time, one would imagine that we get to some type of 75% retention rate, which is typically what we see at subscription services. If you could just talk about direction, are we going in the right place and do you see that as a potential level over time? And then secondly on the international front, you do talk a lot about the letter. Most of us know about the competition in the U.K. but can you talk about the competitive environment in Latin America?","Reed Hastings","Yes. In terms of retention, it'll sound strange but we really don't focus on it that much. We want to make it really easy for people to come in and out of the service, to give consumers a sense of control. At a high income level, consumers don't care about that, they just leave it on. But at a lower income level, they really value that ability. And so what we focus on instead is total net additions in any period or any geography. So that as there's more and more positive word of mouth about Netflix, we get more and more net additions. In terms of LatAm competition, there's a couple of streaming companies, one in Brazil, 1 or 2 in Mexico. Some of them do pay-per-view, some of them do subscription. Telef\u00f3nica has an offering also. So there's a wide variety of competition. But none of it with the global scale and the ability to invest in the R&D to be able to have really incredible streaming and choosing experiences. So we think we have a really big advantage over any single nation firm that tries to compete.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tony Wible from Janney.","Anthony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I was hoping you could speak to the drop in amount of content acquisition in the cash flow. You alluded to earlier that the spread between you and Amazon is growing on title count and it does look like it's up substantially I guess, in the U.S. in the last 3 months. Are you just getting better terms or can you discuss why you guys have seen such a nice improvement there?","Reed Hastings","I just want to correct you. There's been no reference to -- relative to Amazon in terms of title count. So the reference is in terms of viewing hours as judged by the Sandvine or other reports about Internet streaming. And then you want to handle the cash flow?","David Wells","I mean, in terms of the cash flow, basically, the increased commitments would indicate that we were adding content through the quarter, but that content was coming on the balance sheet and off the amount that wasn't recognized or net recognition criteria before. So I don't think you can conclude from the cash flow that we got better deals.","Reed Hastings","And then just adding on to my prior answer on LatAm competition, piracy is one of the biggest competitors and I didn't mention that. In each country, there are pretty developed piracy networks and that's a significant source of competition.","Anthony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Second question is you guys haven't acquired anybody in the past. What would it take for you guys to consider acquiring your way into new countries? And to flip that around, what triggers would you need to see to consider merging with somebody?","Reed Hastings","We haven't given that a ton of thought. As you pointed out, in 14 years, we've never acquired anyone. I don't know that we would never do it, but it would be a pretty high bar for us to want to do that versus do what we do best and continue to grow organically.","Operator","Your next question comes from Barton Crockett from Lazard Capital.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I wanted to make sure I was understanding what you said in your letter correctly about Epix. You said our online exclusivity expires shortly. Does that mean you've decided not to pay more money to retain exclusivity for the balance of the contract? And if that's in fact, your decision, I was wondering if you could talk about why you chose to do that.","Reed Hastings","Barton, it's something I don't want to add anymore comment to besides what we put in the letter.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. Well if I could try one other question then. You spoke about the Beijing Olympics. What about the Winter Olympics? Did that have any effect on subscriber growth a couple of years ago?","David Wells","It had a small negative effect in terms of as much as we could discern from it.","Reed Hastings","You can see, Barton, that people are viewing the Olympics impartially instead of viewing Netflix, which you -- it's harder to tell is do you make that up in the balance of the time period and sort of delay. But there's definitely, during those 10 or 14 days, people are shifting some consumption there. And we saw that on a lesser level with Euro Cup. And when -- an interesting anecdote is when the U.K. was in the Euro Cup, our viewing was at a certain level, and then they got knocked out of the Euro Cup and Netflix viewing expanded sharply like the next day. So that's to kind of give you an eye of the sort of substitutability of, I'm looking for entertainment, and if my nation's team is competing well, then there's less viewing.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","If I could follow up on that, are you seeing more of an impact early on from the Olympics now than you did with the Winter Olympics or you're guiding...","Reed Hastings","The Olympics haven't started, Barton.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I know they haven't started but you've -- cautioned in your guidance.","Reed Hastings","Sorry, we won't be able to see the impact for a week or 2.","David Wells","Yes, to narrowly answer your question, no.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Hargreaves from Pacific Crest.","Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I know you weren't planning on talking about the next international market in detail until Q3 report, but I was wondering if you could give us any sense for what the initial start-up costs might be relative to the other markets that you've entered.","Reed Hastings","We haven't characterized that again, for competitive reasons, Andy. But when we announce the market, I think you'll be able to ballpark it reasonably.","Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you give us any update on how you guys are thinking about Facebook integration now that it's kind of regulatory-wise or a little bit of quagmire. Are you changing the process and do you still plan on going ahead with that this year?","Reed Hastings","It's working very well for us in the U.K. We're continuing to learn and expand that approach around the world outside of the U.S. And then as you pointed out on the legislation, it hasn't come out of the Senate at this point. So we're trying to figure out what's the best option there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to ask 2 things. I apologize if I missed this but on Amazon, you've talked in the past about them potentially becoming more of a standalone competitor, breaking away sort of with prime video. Any updates there on your view? And then secondly, can you give us any kind of color on how we should think about content costs going forward given that you won't have the exclusivity with Epix?","Reed Hastings","Doug, on the Amazon question, I assume that will eventually break it out of prime, but our view is that they would do that earlier this year hasn't yet proven to be true. So I don't have any further update on that. And then any cost savings from going nonexclusive on Epix, we would tend to turn around and invest in other content to continue to have more content.   And consistent with the 100 basis-point growth in contribution margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nat Schindler from Merrill Lynch.","Nathaniel Schindler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two quick questions. One, about a year ago, you guys were saying that exclusivity in content usually costs about 1.3x to 1.5x what just access to the content, nonexclusive rights costs. Is that holding true now that Amazon has become aggressive in buying and wouldn't you expect it to rise if Amazon is, in fact, buying a lot of the similar content that you are? And then I have another quick question after that.","Reed Hastings","Nat, yes, you're right. You would expect it to rise as there are more bidders and anecdotally, that can happen in some places and not in others. It really depends on the type of content.","Nathaniel Schindler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And the other quick question I had was a little bit on your decision on where and which countries to move into and when. I noticed that you're making a move into another European country in Q4, and you made the move -- the big move into the U.K. and after earlier, had said that the U.K. probably wasn't one of the best markets for you to move into early on. As I look at both the U.K. and a lot of the other European markets, their viewing habits for TV content and their willingness to pay for TV content given -- based on their history of pay TV, are pretty light in compared to the U.S. and Canada. Wouldn't it make sense more to go after countries where they have a bigger history of that and a history of viewing more TV content in general, much more like the U.S., maybe something like Australia?","Reed Hastings","We see a big opportunity in Europe to provide an on-demand service, the likes of which really have not been seen. It's very different than just another linear ad-supported network. And while Australia is indeed a great opportunity, it's relatively isolated. And so for now, we're focused on Europe because we've been extremely pleased with the U.K. launch and with the 1 million subs in the first 6.5 months. So we really are feeling quite good about our competitiveness in Europe.","David Wells","And I would say, Nat, you were referencing earlier, anxiety or worries around the U.K. competitiveness balanced with the pros of it being a more developed market, more device penetration, more online viewing. And so, that was the sort of debate we were having about developed versus developing markets and the relative pros and cons in going into each. And Europe obviously has more developed markets that have much more attuned factors for people to watch online viewing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.","Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could give us a sense in the markets where you have been able to leverage Facebook integration and obviously realizing that those are all very early markets for you in general, what kind of response you've seen? And then within the U.S., has Facebook or even social in general, the Netflix Twitter account is particularly active, have those become meaningful channels for either paid or pre-customer acquisition for you?","Reed Hastings","Heath, it's Reed and I would say social, around the world both on our efforts in the U.K. and Ireland and in terms of our usage of social media in the U.S. have continued to expand like they have for all of our peer firms. So I don't think there's anything inconsistent or surprising in that, which is the society is evolving to becoming more socially -- the Internet is becoming more social and we're moving right along with that. In terms of the particular Netflix product integration that's been very successful in the U.K., we've been very pleased with those results. And now we're trying to -- well, we're continuing to try to figure out how to make it legal for U.S. consumers to get access to that.","Operator","The next question comes from Richard Kang from Tiger Asia.","Richard Kang","Reed, could you comment briefly on any future plans as it has to do with applications or apps, specifically in app developers who might help drive viewing and users into Netflix by creating their own communities or other types of services that run on top of Netflix's platform?","Reed Hastings","Richard, we don't have any near-term plans like Spotify to develop a app ecosystem. We think with video and its consumption patterns, we're better off on making our experience better and better, and that's what we're focused on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov from Susquehanna Financial.","Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just wanted to clarify first, did I understand correctly that when you were answering Anthony's question, you said that you most likely will not be profitable on consolidated basis because of international investment for 2013?","Reed Hastings","We haven't guided to that. What I said is consistent with what we've said for the last about half dozen calls, which is our basic model is to become profitable again on a quarterly basis as we have last quarter, and expect to this quarter, Q3 and then to add an additional international market, which generally drives us negative slightly and then through growth in the profit streams, gets us back to positive. And that's what meters our rate of international investment, is to stay approximately breakeven or sort of in and out of profitability.","David Wells","And I've said earlier that the 3 conditions upon which we'd launch another market would be that global breakeven, that we were pleased with the progress that we're making in our existing international markets, and that we'd identified a third market or an additional market. The third condition being we'd identified an additional market.","Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","That would be -- would it be fair to say that you have more than one target market in mind at this point?","Reed Hastings","Our basic view is that as the Internet becomes very global, and as an example of this, if you look at YouTube viewing around the world, that there's no reason why an on-demand service for movies and TV shows like Netflix shouldn't be highly successful. In general, China would be difficult for us as you would all appreciate. And then any nation that has extreme online piracy would be difficult. But outside of those 2 conditions, most of the world will have services like Netflix and we would like to be that service.","Ellie Mertz","That's the last question for today. Reed, would you like to offer some closing remarks?","Reed Hastings","Great one. I thank you all for your support. We're extremely pleased with our U.S. streaming profitability growth. Our contribution margin is expanding very nicely and shows us and everyone what can happen in scale. And now, we're focused on getting our other markets to the same scale and profitability levels as we continue to invest. So thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today's program. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect."],"15469":["Netflix, Inc.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Erin Kasenchak, Director of IR. Please go ahead","Erin Kasenchak","Thank you. Good afternoon. Welcome to the Netflix first quarter 2013 earnings Q&A session. I\u2019m joined by Reed Hastings, CEO; and David Wells, CFO. We announced our financial results for the first quarter at approximately 1 p.m. Pacific Time today.

Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to risks and uncertainties related to the business.","A detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission on February 1, 2013. A replay of this Q&A session will be available at the Netflix website after 6 p.m. Pacific Time today.","Now, let\u2019s move into questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Erin Kasenchak","As is our standard practice, we\u2019ve organized the questions by topics as we\u2019ve received them this afternoon. The first question is in regard to domestic streaming. How do you think about the risk in allowing domestic streaming margins to rise too high quickly, example enticing  more competition or under investing in future growth?","David Wells","Hi. This is David Wells, the CFO. Well, we think that, with our growth, we are able to do both, and we don\u2019t think that we are raising margins very quickly, so we are taking a measured approach and with the growth we are able to do both.","Erin Kasenchak","Great. Do you believe you can maintain domestic streaming marketing costs in 2013 flat with 2012?","Reed Hastings","We will take that, it\u2019s Reed here, we\u2019ll take that quarter-by-quarter, but as our reputation improves from the service improvements we are making and we get great PR around the original content, then that is what gives us a larger presence despite steady paid marketing spend.","Erin Kasenchak","Do you see direct correlation between the time and consumer spends using Netflix daily or monthly and their propensity to churn?","David Wells","Yeah. We do. We said this before, and it still holds that the more a subscriber watches, the better they retain in the  service.","Erin Kasenchak","Great. When you think about drawing your domestic subscriber base, how do you prioritize, one, reaching first-time streaming subscribers; two, finding a way to bring back consumers who have tried the service before and left; or, three, reducing churn to maintain your current subscriber base. Have you seen any notable changes in these three groups over the past several months, if so, why?","Reed Hastings","Well, let\u2019s see, in the rejoin case, most of what we do is improving our service, so that it works better for them. And so, someone who is rejoining wants to hear about the content\u2019s gotten better or the device-based streaming is better, or the iPhone interface is better depending on the reason that they cancelled.","In terms -- and you can\u2019t move a rejoin very much with paid marketing, because they have a pretty firm idea of what Netflix is. You move someone and rejoin because you can change, if you claim the benefit that they didn\u2019t perceive before by those examples that I had.","With new member marketing, they have a more hazy idea of what Netflix is, and so paid advertising can have a bigger impact in changing their perception to be something that they are interested in trying for free. And so, when we advertise, we think of it mainly as this great service applying to new members. But of course, there is a spillover benefit to existing members that are still on the service and to rejoin, but the fundamental of it is to never join.","Erin Kasenchak","Great. Another question as it relates to marketing. Your marketing campaign has evolved pretty dramatically over the past year as we have illustrated. Could you discuss why you\u2019re taking brand marketing and commercial so much more seriously?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think we\u2019ve always taken it seriously and our demographics have evolved. And so, our advertising evolves as we become more streaming instead of hybrid and as we get bigger. So I think it\u2019s a natural outcome as well as just great execution.","Erin Kasenchak","How do you think about shared accounts? It grows your brand, yet it is revenue loss. How do you think about the need or importance of cracking down on shared accounts?","Reed Hastings","It depends what you mean by shared accounts. We usually like to think that a husband and wife can share an account, and that\u2019s perfectly appropriate and acceptable. If you mean, hey I got my password from my boyfriend\u2019s uncle, then that\u2019s not what we would consider appropriate. And so, we focus on serving the immediate family.","We\u2019ve got -- our standard plan has two simultaneous streams, and that serves the vast majority of families around the world quite well. There are a few times when the family of large that two streams doesn\u2019t work, and so we\u2019re now offering or will be offering shortly a four-stream option for about 50% uplift.","But again as we said, we expect a fewer than 1% of our members to take that plan. So the core focus is on the immediate family, and we really don\u2019t think that there is much going on of the -- I'm going to share my password with marginal acquaintance.","Erin Kasenchak","What do you see the realistic TAM  for Netflix? If you look at other premium networks, they tend to peak  out at about 30 million subscribers. If you get to that point, where your net ads start to slow down, would you put in place price increases, especially since HBO retails for $15 and you only charge $8?","Reed Hastings","Well, first we started streaming at $7.99 three years ago when we introduced the streaming plan. We\u2019ve kept the same price for the last three years. We are very happy with that price. We\u2019ve improved the content significantly, improved the devices, and we\u2019ve kept the same price, $7.99, and that\u2019s provided us a lot of growth. So, I don\u2019t see any changes in the near term coming in that.","Second, in terms of the total available market, we\u2019ve generally described it as best we can as two to three times that of HBO linear. HBO linear is at about 30 million and our best guess is that market for service like Netflix, because it\u2019s less expensive than HBO, it has got more content. It\u2019s all on demand. It\u2019s personalized. It\u2019s on multiple devices. It\u2019s somewhere in the two to three times HBO or 60 to 90 million, and we\u2019ll really only know that with any confidence when we get there.","Erin Kasenchak","What was the biggest driver of domestic streaming subscriber upside in Q1, higher growth additions or lower churn versus your internal projection?","Reed Hastings","Well, we don\u2019t really talk about the individual. I would say that we\u2019ve gone to great lengths to raise the content and the quality of the content on the site. And I\u2019d say that was the biggest driver in Q1 overall. More people really engaged in the site and with the content.","Erin Kasenchak","Great. Moving onto questions about content, based on the greater than $4 billion streaming hours reported by Netflix in Q1 2013, we estimate the average Netflix subscriber is streaming 87 minutes of content per day. However, when we analyzed [Sand Wine] (ph) data related to overall bandwidth consumption, we have noticed a dramatic difference between the mean and median, but the median only one-third of the mean. Is Netflix\u2019s median monthly streaming dramatically skewed from the mean?","Reed Hastings","No. Median typically is less than the average because of the heavy users, but it\u2019s not dramatic.","Erin Kasenchak","Have there been any notable changes in third-party content  negotiations since you became more active with original?","Reed Hastings","No. I would say the only thing that\u2019s noticeably changed in the last 12 months is Hulu and Amazon bidding more aggressively, and that that\u2019s made content owners much happier and has made the prices to us higher than they would otherwise be.","Erin Kasenchak","How many users access Nickelodeon and MTV content monthly?","Reed Hastings","Well, I\u2019m not sure. We don\u2019t look at it that way of how many users, but it\u2019s been part of our service for the last two or three years. And as we stated in the letter, we have some bids in on particular shows, and so we will see how that works out.","Erin Kasenchak","Also, on the Viacom relationship, as you moved from a global licensing deal with Viacom to one covering specific titles, can you provide some color on the magnitude of impact this could have on the money you spend licensing domestic content from Viacom?","Reed Hastings","Well, I don\u2019t think you will see any change. You are not going to see any blip in what we spend or in contribution margin, for example in Q3.","David Wells","I would say that the content -- our content acquisition has already factored in, what may or may not happen, and we\u2019ve got things in the wings that we can add. So you will continue to see us invest in content.","Erin Kasenchak","Great. Let\u2019s move on to questions about originals. Why wouldn\u2019t we expect Arrested Development to drive significantly higher net additions in Q2? The guidance implies rather modest sequential gains.","Reed Hastings","If in Q1, we had seen, for example, the week before House of Cards launched and the week after of the Spike, I think then we would be forecasting bigger numbers around particular titles like Arrested Development. But what we\u2019ve seen with House of Cards is a very nice impact but a gentle impact, not one that\u2019s an overnight impact.","And Arrested Developments coming in at the end of May, and so it\u2019s going to be great for us, but it\u2019s not a step function where on that day, we\u2019ve had no evidence or no history of it being a step function. So we are comfortable with the projection being our median probability.","Erin Kasenchak","Releasing all episodes of House of Cards, Hemlock Grove and soon to be released Arrested Developments clearly puts the consumer first, yet the social media buzz appears to die off very quickly. In contrast, when you look at TV series, especially HBO and Showtime, which it appears Netflix is trying to emulate social media buzz benefits notably from the weekly release of a new episode. Why are you so confident in your all-at-once releasing strategy?","Reed Hastings","Well, I would put the buzz on House of Cards, and I think we are going to see that with Hemlock. As we mentioned in the letter, Hemlock viewing has been fantastic for us and as fantastic as the House of Cards is, Hemlock is getting viewed by even more subscribers in its first couple of days in opening weekend than House of Cards. So we are feeling very good about our original strategy including the release strategy of being focused on all episodes at once.","Erin Kasenchak","Next, there are several questions about how to gauge the success of House of Cards? Would we share any metrics like what percentage of the base watched  one or more episodes, how viewership of House of Cards compared to other top shows on Netflix? And if not, how do we convince someone that it was a  good investment?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think, when you look at Netflix you get to invest in Netflix, not in particular shows. So, what an investor cares about is that Netflix is a good investment as opposed to say House of Cards. And then individual marketing programs, individual shows, individual regions are really what we have to do as management in terms of making good tradeoffs to make Netflix more valuable overall.","And on that basis, we are feeling very excited about what happened with House of Cards and with Hemlock, what\u2019s coming with Arrested Development and Orange Is the New Black. And I think over this year with continuing rollout  of these original shows, you are going to see a very nice redefinition and broadening of what Netflix is to our members. But it is something we will take a step at a time. As we mentioned, our total P&L spending on originals is still single digits, it will still be single digits next year, so it\u2019s growing, but it is still relatively modest part of our total content then.","Erin Kasenchak","House of Cards is available for pre order on Amazon.com, can you explain where your rights for the show stand in relation to sales of the show on DVD and Blu-ray, do you receive a cut for each one sold, and if so, how much?","Reed Hastings","We are not going to comment on the specifics, each deal for original is a little bit different, MRC developed House of Cards, and we were the first window licenser in certain territories, and then they have the other rights with certain hold backs. And so, occasionally you\u2019ll see something where the DVD\u2019s out earlier than you might otherwise expect.","Erin Kasenchak","With House of Cards you promoted the show in a very visibile way when people logged into their Netflix account? Should we expect ongoing Hemlock Grove promotion in the same way?","Reed Hastings","Only if your demographic profile and what you\u2019ve been watching includes things like Vampire Diaries and such shows, because what we do is match it to the person and to their viewing history or someone in your household is watching that, so we try to be very good about matching the right promotion to the right person.","Erin Kasenchak","Looking over the next few years, how many original series do you believe you would willing or able to produce?","Reed Hastings","Well, we\u2019ll start this year with just our six or seven seasons, and then we\u2019ll take that up a little bit next year, and then we\u2019ll see as we go in terms of what we learn, what experience, so there is no set number we are trying to target, and it will depend upon the results that we see.","Erin Kasenchak","How do your originals perform in international region versus the U.S.?","Reed Hastings","Well, we\u2019ve only got three so far Lillehammer, House of Cards and Hemlock. And I would say each one is unique in its territory. So we do program for these being good internationally and some of them have been really big hit and you may have notice that with Hemlock we did one of the first premiers for it, premier party in Mexico City. So that\u2019s indication that we really focus on the global attractiveness of the content.","Erin Kasenchak","Regarding the expensing of original content such as House of Cards, over how many month, quarter, years, does Netflix anticipate amortizing a cost of the content, that is what is the expected life of original content, also does original content generally carry a longer useful life relative to other purchased content?","Reed Hastings","It doesn\u2019t generally carry from an amortization period longer than other content. We could discuss whether not the actual useful life of that content might be longer, but we don\u2019t have any history, so we\u2019re little bit conservative at this point and the typical license period or typical amortization period is over -- straight line over the license period.","Erin Kasenchak","Looking at the costs produce very high quality content like House of Cards. Do you think that cost will increase, decrease or stay about the same overtime?","Reed Hastings","I\u2019m not sure, it hasn\u2019t move dramatically despite digital film making and if any thing the scale of distribution drives both movie production cost per hour and television cost per hour up because the value of great product with a large distribution channel has increased, and that effect has over overwhelmed what some people thought we\u2019ll bring down the cost a lot of production through a digital film making techniques.","Erin Kasenchak","With the success of House of Cards and your growing stable of originals has movie became a less strategic assets in Netflix?","Reed Hastings","Sure hope so given -- sure hope not given how much we\u2019ve signed up to spend with Disney and we very much our investors in the movie franchise both in the U.S. and around the world and big believers in the role of movies on a service.","Erin Kasenchak","Great. Let\u2019s turn to question on competition. Amazon has clearly bid up some popular title, are you seeing them be highly competitive in most of your negotiation or they just stepping up for select content?","Reed Hastings","It varies quite a bit by region and by type of content, but certainly all the sellers of content want to have many active bidders, so they are approaching everybody Redbox, Google, the cable networks to try to get bid to be competitive.","Erin Kasenchak","Great. Let\u2019s turn the question on international. Do have a set reinvestment plan for international growth, meaning is there percent of cash flow generated domestically that you will invest annually into international. Do you envision continuing to add new overseas market ahead of getting the entire international business to profitability? Meaning should we expect overall international losses to continue for years to come in aggregate?","David Wells","Well, we\u2019ve said in past that what\u2019s our -- been our approach with international that we\u2019ll take a measured approach dated by global profitability and our overall confidence in the growth of the existing market that we have today and that hasn\u2019t changed. So, I think, it is safe to say that you will see another couple of years of international losses as those markets mature and grow towards profitability, and as we launch additional markets.","And as for going forward, we will continue to take that measured approach. We will have to gain confidence in the new markets as we address new opportunities and go from there.","Erin Kasenchak","Sort of a follow up, any update on the profitability timeline for individual international markets like Latin America or U.K. specifically?","David Wells","We don\u2019t give specifics. We\u2019ve given some directions in the past in terms of those markets being competitive and taking longer than Canada and I\u2019d say that\u2019s the lag here.","Reed Hastings","And we said specifically that all of the markets are growing and that\u2019s we are profitable in Canada.","Erin Kasenchak","Would consider setting down the higher loss territories like Latin America?","David Wells","Well, we are still making very good progress. Again, we said that we are growing and we are reducing losses in those markets. We are not losing out to any competitors and so if we get into a situation where we thought we are losing to competition we have to consider that but that\u2019s not where we see ourselves today.","Reed Hastings","So the simple answer is, no, we wouldn\u2019t.","Erin Kasenchak","Should we model the initial spend for the European launch to be comparable to other international launches, will this be Q3 or Q4?","Reed Hastings","We said second half, we\u2019ll stick with that articulation and sure, you could model at about like other launches.","Erin Kasenchak","Turning to a few questions on DVD, do you believe that you have less visibility into the subscriber and revenue elements of DVD business? Is that the factor in reducing the guidance disclosure?","David Wells","No. We don\u2019t, in fact, we probably have more visibility into that and we did say year to 18 months ago. The reason we dropped the guidance was because profit is what matters and that really is the only thing that matters at this point. We\u2019ll continue to report subscribers and revenue, but we\u2019ll only give guidance on the profit.","Erin Kasenchak","Great. Have you\u2019ve been able to relatively maintain -- you have been able to relatively maintain strong DVD contribution margins even with declining subscriber level. At what level of DVD sub would that ability to leverage fixed costs breakdown and lead to a meaningful step down in overall profit margins?","David Wells","Well, we took the DVD business profitable at around million subscribers and given that we\u2019ve got a large investment in equipment that we won\u2019t have to continue to invest in our content library and our DVD content library, we feel pretty good about our ability to maintain those margins going forward.","Erin Kasenchak","Great. Let\u2019s turn to some questions on product improvement. ISPs up here increasingly open to the idea of offering promotions incorporating Netflix as a benefit to their own subscribers for paying us the premium service higher speed tiers, how do you think about this opportunity?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think, ISP business is turning out to be extremely profitable because ISPs don\u2019t have content costs and if they can get their customers to purchase higher bandwidth packages that almost pure additional margin for the ISP. And one of the major reasons that our customer might do a higher bandwidth package is to use video from us, from Google, from Amazon and others.","And so the more that our network integration is highly effective that they are integrated with Open Connect then more their customers will actually get the benefit of our faster less mile. So there is a nice synergy there us together providing a better and better experience for their end-users.","Erin Kasenchak","Great. A question social. While you succeeded in wining a change in DPPA there does not appear to be a meaningful amount of Netflix subscribers choosing to share their streaming activity within their friends on Facebook. Do you think consumers simply are not interested in being that open with their social network?","Reed Hastings","I think it will evolve overtime, the core focus right now is not so much sharing on Facebook the viewing history, in fact that\u2019s not the default, the default is that it shared within the Netflix interface, so if you get the permission, the default permissions, you and your friend share within the Netflix user interface, what your friends are viewing and get ideas but not in the Facebook ticker and feed?","Erin Kasenchak","How does the profile feature work for household with the Netflix subscription. And what was the early response from the testing?","Reed Hastings","It\u2019s been positive. The key use case is between kids and parents. Right now, parents will say that the experience is suboptimal because the kid\u2019s viewing is also their profile. And the kid\u2019s similarly don\u2019t necessarily want to see what their parents are viewing. So that\u2019s the biggest use case. And so it will be really be targeted at families.","Erin Kasenchak","Great. Let\u2019s look at a few questions on financials. Could the company please quantify its off balance sheet content liability, specifically interested in those the total amount of obligation is outstanding, as well as the amount currently outstanding that is not on the balance sheet.","Reed Hastings","So I\u2019ll answer this in total to because usually how we get this question. We had $5.6 billion liability -- $5.6 billion in commitment as of the end of December. That moved to $5.7 billion in commitments as of the end of March, $2.4 billion being part of liabilities on the balance sheet and $3.3 bill not on the balance sheet.","Erin Kasenchak","Great. Do you believe the company can fund it\u2019s liabilities without an additional debt raise. Would you consider raising capital given the low-rate environment?","Reed Hastings","Well, we just did raise capitals. So yeah, we would consider it. And I would say that we are fine on capital at this point.","Erin Kasenchak","Great. You had anticipated that free cash flow in the quarter would be more negative than the prior quarter. And it ended up more favorable than the prior quarter. You acquired less than $600 million of streaming content this quarter less than your quarterly run rate last year despite the payment for House Of Cards. For any content acquisitions deferred to the June quarter, is this a good run rate for content acquisition or was it a low quarter?","Reed Hastings","So no content payments were deferred. I would say that we anticipated a bunch of small items stocking on each other in the first quarter that didn\u2019t happen. So we\u2019ll be less lumpy than we previously anticipated. And then the second part of that question was\u2026","Erin Kasenchak","Is this a good run-rate for content acquisitions?","Reed Hastings","I\u2019m not sure how to answer a good run rate on content acquisition. I would say that we continue to expand our content. And you\u2019ll see that expansion has declined over the last year and two years. So the rate of expansion has started to slow but we\u2019ll continue to invest in content.","Erin Kasenchak","What was your effective Q1 tax rate? What\u2019s the tax rate that we should use for the second quarter and the balance of the year?","Reed Hastings","The balance of the year should be between 34% and 35%. We had a very strange tax rate in the first quarter. Because of the retroactive reinstatement after Federal R&D tax credit. So I think it was over 100% in terms of, sort of, strange rate. But that will flip back to us, sort of, normal rate going forward.","Erin Kasenchak","Great. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the operator and began taking questions from the phone.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. Thank you very much. Just couple of questions, please. You guys spent a little more on DVD content this quarter than we were expecting and you also lost a fewer DVD subscribes than we thought. So was there a correlation between the two. I\u2019m assuming there was but we got something that you guys are now kind of baking into your business going forward.","And second, can you extend on the profile function -- profile function, you guy spoke about in the letter. Vendors that launch and what efforts would -- what effects would you like to see from it?","Reed Hastings","Youssef, its Reed. I\u2019ll hit the profile. It will be sometime this year. And if not second with effect to financials, it\u2019s example. One more product feature that\u2019s useful. But there is -- nothing going to be nothing material to affect the business about it off itself.","David Wells","And then Youssef, this is David. On your DVD context question, I wouldn\u2019t draw a direct correlation. The first quarter is always the high-release quarter from new releases. And typically, it depends on the release dates with studios in terms of what they put out. And we sort of set those amounts well ahead of the quarter. And so I wouldn\u2019t draw direct correlation. I would say that in general, we were pleased as well that DVD subscribers declined at a slower rate than we anticipated and we continued to work hard to make sure that those folks who continued to choose physical have a very good service.","Erin Kasenchak","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Carlos Kirjner - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. Have you deployed Open Connect to major domestic ISPs such as Comcast and on a cable, charger and if not, why do you think that\u2019s the case and how do you describe that, which are of view that Netflix is good for them because it helps them differentiate their offer? Thank you.","Reed Hastings","Carlos, I\u2019m not going to comment on the specific deals but we are making progress with ISPs. We started mostly in Europe first because we were just ramping, so that helped with the capacity we could handle the capacity and we\u2019ve got the majority, or the vast majority of Europe traffic is now in Open Connect and growing percentage of that traffic is in United States. We certainly think that over the next year or two, we will be able to work with all the major ISPs to get the benefits to both of us and Open Connect.","Carlos Kirjner - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is open.","Mark Mahaney - RBC","Great. Thanks. On the new customers to domestic streaming customers, is there anything you can tell about their usage patterns versus customers you brought in the past that they seem to be consuming content similarly to similar cohorts in the past? And in terms of international marketing costs, is there a way to strip out the new country launch cost from the other marketing costs? Once if you take those out, is it that international marketing costs are kind of a steady ramp, is there something to suggest that they could flat line or is that way too early in each of those countries experienced for that to happen? Thank you.","Reed Hastings","Mark, on the domestic side, the new members were performing consistent with the historical trends, which is we\u2019ve steadily been able to increase viewing as the content and product improves. And so P1s today are little better in usage than P1s a year ago, that kind of things.","And then second on the international marketing, yeah, there is a launch marketing and then a run rate marketing just as you would expect. But since we\u2019ve got and you will see that a little bit when we have launched quarters, you will see the marketing be larger than you might otherwise have thought.","David Wells","It\u2019s a little too early to tell if that run rate marketing is going to go up down or flat. I would say flat is a safe assumption at this point.","Erin Kasenchak","Next question","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Thanks. You were talking in the shareholder letter about a decline in your willingness to pay for non-exclusive, bulk deals. And now you have an increasingly diverse content portfolio between TV movie kids and originals and your sub base is much larger than competitor. So, theoretically, you would think that you have the ability to amortize the content that you spend over a larger base of sub. You mentioned earlier in the call that it\u2019s not been the case yet that you\u2019ve been able to get favorable negotiations based on this diversity of content now. I just wonder if you can talk a little bit about the future to the extent that that could change over time.","And then secondly on an associated topic. Ted has been quoted recently in the media discussing extending the original portfolios of levels of north of 20 per year, which is quite a bit higher than where you are now. I\u2019m just wondering if you could clarify that comment to the extent that you think this 20 plus is a reasonable level and if so what type of timeframe of getting there? Thanks.","Reed Hastings","Starting on the second part, it all depends on the timeframes. So in the next two years, it modestly increases if that it will widely successful for us as the first three shows have been, we could continue to expand to 20 or north. But that would be dependent on all of the -- what happens rest of this year. What we don\u2019t want to do is on the back of three shows, one of which has only been out for four days suddenly take our commitments up to that kind of 20 plus level.","So that\u2019s in a longer term and I think it\u2019s appropriately ambitious.","In terms to the first question, I think we are focused on moving towards more and more exclusive content, which reinforces a reason to join Netflix, a reason to subscribe to the degree the content not exclusive and it\u2019s on cable and on other services than it might be pleasant to watch on Netflix. But it\u2019s not really reinforce of why stay with Netflix or reinforce what you would loss if you were not on Netflix. And so we\u2019ve been, I think, over the last two or three years evolving towards more and more exclusivity in that content.","Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG. Your line is open.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG","Hi. Could you give us more info on kind of why the Open Connect initiative is so positive for Netflix? And then, just kind of tied to that, cable operators that showing you like within their actual commercials now in marketing you in their mailers, is there a way that they could basically promote Netflix or give away Netflix or passthrough cost of Netflix, the way they do and give like each six or 12 months of HBO or Showtime, how could that work, and is that something we might see in the next year?","Reed Hastings","See Open Connect is one of our investment to improve the Netflix member experience, long form content has some unique aspects that you can tailor at low costs on the CDN it do not also serving short form content like the general commercial CDNs are optimized for. But in this scheme I think it\u2019s pretty modest relative to our P&L, it\u2019s not particularly significant.","In terms of the second question which is kind of commercial integration with ISPs and broadband. We haven\u2019t seen a lot that is particularly effective. We\u2019ve seen somethings where some companies will purchase gift certificates for Netflix and then advertise that if a person signs up for service or buy the device, they also get three or six months of Netflix which is a gift certificate that they bought. And some of those are working quite well. But I doubt that you will see anything in the way that you typically would have seen for HBO or Showtime marketing with cable where you get those up big free period in exchange for signing up.","The business model we have now works very well for us and since its working very well we are more likely just to focus on executing it extremely well rather than making it say more complicated with those types of interaction.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks. I was -- if you could give us a sense even if it just sort of high level what share of the current subscriber base you feel like will be impacted or interested in the multi-tier subscriber or multi-stream subscription plan in order to -- would need those in order to maintain their current level of usage?","Reed Hastings","Do you mean the four out 1199 plan Heath?","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs","Right. Right.","Reed Hastings","Less than 1% of our members.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Mike Olson - Piper Jaffray","Hey. Good afternoon. It looks like originals are having success out of the gate and as your library of exclusive content grows? You could argue that subs will perceive higher value in the subscription. So under that assumption as we get further from the PR issues over a couple years ago, will you look more seriously tweaking up pricing?","David Wells","I think we are pretty clear in our letter about that.","Reed Hastings","So we are pretty happy with current $7.99 price.","Mike Olson - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","John Blackledge - Cowen & Co.","Great. Thank you. Two questions. If you could just provide an update on the brand, is it recovering more quickly than you anticipated since the brand hit following the split of the streaming and DVD service in 2011? And then secondly, the 2Q \u201913 you assuming net add guidance at the midpoint is bit above 2Q \u201912 net adds. So that appears moderately more positive than commentary from the 4Q '12 letter which suggested 2Q ' 13 net ads will be below our 2Q\u2019.12 levels. So, was original programming I\u2019m driving moderately better guidance or are there other factors involved? Thanks.","David Wells","John, I think the second part of that question which is our 2Q net ads guidance. I would say that ordinarily we would expect because of seasonality to have a lower Q2 than prior year but we\u2019ve seen a lot of improvements.","We talked about that in the letter. We\u2019ve seen a lot of improvements in our product, in our content and the interface and in the brand recovery. And I think those are carrying through. So we're anticipating being slightly up year-over-year. And I\u2019ll let Reed comment for the brand recovery as to whether that\u2019s a head on tracker about as expected.","Reed Hastings","And on the guidance, we have arrested development in the end of May, which will be in absolutely spectacular phenomenon, where we've got an established brand. That\u2019s a cult favorite and off the air for seven years. And Mitch Hurwitz and the cast have done just a remark able job. So we\u2019re likely to have that again in Q2 a year from now. And I think we\u2019ll return to the seasonal pattern where Q2 is less than the prior year","In terms of brand recovery, it\u2019s been just as we had hoped and thought and expected, which is sort of over three years, where you get the bulk of that in the first part and were making steady progress and we\u2019ll continue to work hard to make steady progress going forward.","John Blackledge - Cowen & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Doug Anmuth - J.P. Morgan","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask two things, first how do you compare Netflix's ability to curate and influence original content relative to other pay TV networks. How important is that to producers when you\u2019re talking to them about originals? And do you think that\u2019s an area where you would expect Netflix to bulk up in order to work more closely with creators on content.","And then secondly just a question on mobile. Any color on a percentage of usage coming from tablets and smartphones? Do you think there's any chance here going forward that we could see mobile smooth out some of the seasonality that you typically see during the summer months? Thanks.","Reed Hastings","In terms of mobile and tablets, it\u2019s continuing to grow whether it smooth outs seasonality, I\u2019m not sure. Most of the quote mobile use is on Wi-Fi. It\u2019s sort of home use and rather than over to say, the networks which have fairly low data cap. And then, what was the first part?","How we work while we are up? With producers, yeah, we are getting I think more sophisticated in terms of working with producers and the creative community. I think we\u2019ve got a great start, what we\u2019ve done obviously and we well continue to learn as we do more. And as we bring great success to the creators then certainly that increases our reputation in the creative community.","Erin Kasenchak","Great. That\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. Reed, would you like to me some closing remarks?","Reed Hastings","Thank you all for your support. And I hope everyone gets a chance to see Hemlock Grove.","Reed Hastings","Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today\u2019s program. This concludes the program.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Ellie Mertz, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Ellie Mertz","Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to the Netflix Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Q&A Session. I am joined here by Reed Hastings, CEO; and David Wells, CFO.","We announced our financial results for the fourth quarter at approximately 1 p.m. Pacific Time today. The shareholder letter and the Q4 financial results and the webcast of this Q&A session are all available at the company's Investor Relations website at ir.netflix.com.","As is our standard practice, we will begin the call with questions received via email. Please email your questions to ir@netflix.com. In the time remaining after email Q&A, we will also open up the lines to take live follow-up questions. The dial-in number is within our investor letter, but let me repeat it now. Please call (760) 666-3613 if you would like to get in the queue.","We may make forward-looking statements during this call regarding the company's future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to risks and uncertainties related to the business.

So we're going to start with general content questions. First question. Can you help us better understand the fixed versus variable components in the content deals you are signing, or how the industry is maybe moving more towards variable mechanisms as content owners better understand digital?","David Wells","This is David. We have been bidding in an industry that was set up before us by the cable, satellite and paid television world. So all of our deals are fixed. And that reflects the nature of the market that we're competing in. It's been like that for 10-plus years.","Ellie Mertz","What is your appetite for bidding against HBO for film studio content in the pay TV window when the pay TV studio deals come up for renewal? Assuming linear and over-the-top rights for those deals are decoupled, would you attempt to acquire both as you did in the case of DreamWorks?","Reed Hastings","I don't think it's likely that those rights will be decoupled. So we'd be bidding for the -- and that's because HBO, as an example, would certainly want both. So if we are to win the bidding, we have to really be willing to bid for both as we did in DreamWorks, Relativity. And yes, we will continue to be an active bidder in that market.","Ellie Mertz","Are you relatively comfortable with your current levels of content, or is Netflix still on the market for Blockbuster-size content deals? Do you anticipate that a potential slowdown in content acquisitions will have a meaningful impact on new subscriber acquisitions?","Reed Hastings","We're rapidly increasing the amount of money that we spend on content domestically and internationally. The only thing that's slightly different is this quarter, we're increasing our spend over a year ago over 100%. So it's more than double one year ago. And that year-over-year increase is declining. But it's still a substantial increase on a year-over-year basis all through this year. And the question is are we comfortable with the content? We always want to get more content. That's the virtuous cycle, which is as we get more subscribers; we're able to get more content, which then helps us get more subscribers. So we'll continue to invest in improving the service by adding more content for a very long time.","David Wells","And just to add on to that, it's not just about adding new content. As we discussed in the letter, that increase in expense is somewhat a small portion for renewals that actually is for new content to the service. So it's going to be exciting as we add new titles to the service through 2012.","Ellie Mertz","How should we think about subscription costs as a percent of revenue for 2012 and longer term?","Reed Hastings","Well, that will vary by market and maturity. What we think about it as, as contribution margin and contribution profit. And as we talked about, we did better in Q4 than we expected, and so we're taking up our target for 11% for Q1 for contribution margin in the U.S. In our different international markets, we're still contribution margin negative. And that's -- the losses will abate in each market as it grows and breaking into contribution margin positive.","David Wells","And I think for longer term, we'll -- there's only 2 buckets. There's content expense and marketing. And so if we're going to expand our contribution margin, our profitability long term, we'd be looking to leverage some of that content long term as well.","Ellie Mertz","Would Netflix work with the virtual MVPD, adding a premium layer of content the way HBO offers content as tier on traditional MVPDs?","Reed Hastings","I'm not sure what's meant by virtual MVPD. If it means like what was reputed that some of the Internet firms we're working on, which is sort of a national footprint over-the-top MVPD, I don't think that's going to come into existence. Several large firms have tried to put that package together and backed off. I think what we'll see is a continuation of the current localized \u201cover your own pipe\u201d model.","Ellie Mertz","What's driving the change in tone and\/or practice in terms of importance around exclusivity of content?","Reed Hastings","So the more that we bid against other cable networks. So there were many bidders for Mad Men, and there's many bidders for the movies. Those other bidders are cable networks that demand full exclusivity against us. And so we're essentially pushed into bidding exclusive to succeed in this industry. And so what's driving it is that we're in the first leagues of cable network-buying now in syndication, and that's always been done exclusively.","Ellie Mertz","Even with Netflix's growing movie streaming library, one of the biggest appeal seems to be TV series episodes. Do you have any plans to offer current season episodes of shows after they air on traditional television instead waiting for their DVD release as Breaking Bad fans are dying to find out what happens next?","Reed Hastings","Catch-up TV is really a good model for authentication. To the degree that we try to be a substitute for cable networks by, for example, having current day and date content, then we get into a cord-cutting kind of battle that's not really in our interest. And our view is to be complementary by having complete prior season, and that we think authentication TV Everywhere interfaces like Fox is doing is the way to go for the broadcast networks and cable networks to maximize their opportunity. And we're comfortable with that partitioning because we feel like our segment is very broad and big at a low price point of $7.99. And so that's why we're partitioning ourselves to be prior season. And so no, we're not bidding on any current season, and we don't have any current season.","Ellie Mertz","How will you measure whether your original programming has a positive ROI and a success? If you believe original programming can start to drive incremental subs, will you commit significantly more capital to this?","Reed Hastings","Well, HBO spends about 1\/3 or 40% of their budget on original and the rest on already produced movie content. So that would be the high watermark. And they do a great job on those originals. We're starting much more modestly with our originals. Some of it will judge by how much it gets viewed by the -- and how much it costs. Is it an efficient source of programming? And some others in terms of does it attract and build -- attract new subscribers and build the reputation for Netflix? And today, it's a modest part of our budget, and we'll keep it as a modest part of our budget until we learn more as we go year-by-year.","Ellie Mertz","Can you talk about -- can you talk through the rationale of making all the episodes of an original series available at the same time, like you're doing with Lilyhammer, instead of spreading them out a bit more?","Reed Hastings","Yes. Netflix's brand for TV shows is really about binge viewing. It's the ability to just get hooked and watch episode after episode. It's addictive. It's exciting. It's different. And our release strategy for original content emphasizes that brand strength, which is to be able to get hooked and pour through those episodes rather than get strung out. And we're not particularly focused on a single show for driving retention. It's the expectation of more and more shows that really drives retention.","Ellie Mertz","Final question on originals. Can you please talk about how accounting for these series will work? And under what scenarios are write-downs possible?","David Wells","The accounting for them will be straight-line. We always monitor the content in terms of the engagement or hours viewed. And unless proven differently in the usage and watch patterns, it'll be straight-line. Now I'll point out, as Reed discussed, that for 2012, it's a very modest portion of our budget. So I really think this is more of an issue for 2013 and going forward. Unless you see us announce some other large originals, it's going to come out this year.","Ellie Mertz","Do exclusive contracts only differentiate you from other web-only players or also the TV Everywhere players? For example, could Xfinity show some of the TV catalog that is exclusive to you either via the set-top box or Xfinity app; or the contracts like Epix, where authenticated pay-TV subscribers can watch the movies online?","Reed Hastings","It varies. We have different types of exclusivity in different contracts. In the strongest form, it's like DreamWorks or Relativity. And then it's in all forms other than DVD. In sum, it's just exclusive in the Internet SVODs, some in all SVOD with different carve-outs. So there's quite a mix there.","Ellie Mertz","Given that your content purchase deals are based on assumptions of subscribers, did you experience with the price increase and subsequent slowdown in net ads that you have spent more on content than you would have, given all the information you have now? In other words, do you feel like you're in an overbought position now?","Reed Hastings","We feel great about the content we've got. We don't feel great about the profit stream we have for this quarter. And the impact of the relatively lower subscriber than we thought we would be at is not showing up in the quality of our service, which has continued to be excellent. And for the content to grow, it shows up in our profit stream. We hope to mitigate that obviously as we grow the subscriber base over this year and return back to breakeven and continued rapid international expansion.","David Wells","And as Reed said, we've been really pleased with the engagement of the content that we added through Q4. So I don't think that we've bought a group of content or a block of titles that we\u2019re unhappy with.","Ellie Mertz","What is the balance of purchase commitments for content as of 12\/31\/2011?","David Wells","So I think this is referring to the contractual obligations footnote, and they're probably asking before we file the K. It was $3.5 billion at the end of Q3. That goes up to $3.9 billion at the end of this quarter, Q4, that we're reporting on.","Ellie Mertz","What percentage of streaming is occurring on TVs versus mobile or smartphones, versus tablets versus PC\/Macs?","Reed Hastings","We don't break it out publicly. All of those platforms are very successful for us, an important part of the mix.","Ellie Mertz","If the goal of Netflix is to provide consumers with a convenient place to watch TV shows and movies, a subscription can only allow for a partial library of what a consumer wants to view. Why doesn't it make sense to add the ability to rent \u00e0 la carte new-release films? In other words, what's wrong with being everything to everyone and providing a one-stop shop for digital movies through Netflix?","Reed Hastings","I don't think there's a lot of brand strength in being -- to use the \"everything for everyone.\" You gain profit and brand strength from being something important and precise. And we believe that unlimited for a low fee in the USD $7.99 a month is the core of our brand proposition and that if we were to add pay-per-view, it would be at a negative. It would confuse the brand. And there is a number of providers, Wal-mart's Vudu, Apple's iTunes, Amazon Unbox, Best Buy's CinemaNow, Blockbuster, the list just goes on and on of providers who already offer pay-per-view. And we have no way to do it better that we know of. So what we're focused on is instead working with all of those partners and keeping the clarity of our brand. So our strategy is to -- essentially, you can think of it like Dolby Digital is, be in every platform and get along with everyone. And we believe that there's a large enough market at a $8 unlimited subscription to have us grow very large. So to some degree, it's a niche strategy, but it's a very large niche that we think we can lead. And so that's why our focus is exclusively on unlimited. And we're not at all nor have we ever been interested in pay-per-view.","Ellie Mertz","What does content underspending mean as it relates to margin impact on streaming in the fourth quarter 2011?","David Wells","It was a small underspend, and it's related to contract date shifting out by a month or so. So it's a pretty small number. And we always have contracts that are moving around up, backward, in terms of when the window availability starts. And that's what it was related to.","Ellie Mertz","All right. Let's move to questions about international. I know it's early, but what have you seen so far from international? Is there a case that can be made one way or the other about the relative profitability long term for a U.S. versus a non-U.S. subscriber?","David Wells","I'm sorry, repeat that one more time.","Reed Hastings","I'll take it. The profitability of a subscriber is based upon the barriers, competitive barriers on a relatively scale. So in any market in which we have very strong scale advantage, we'll have higher profitability. In any market where, for example, there's 3 roughly equal-sized firms, then we would have less profitability. So it's not so much U.S. versus non-U.S. It's relative scale in each of the markets. And that's part of why we're investing so aggressively to be early and to lead this market in as many markets as we can.","David Wells","And the only thing I'd add to that is it's also about relative consumer offerings in that market or competition. So between the scale and the available consumer offerings, it would be those 2 things.","Ellie Mertz","How do you determined that your initial launch offering has the right ingredients for a successful launch and positive word-of-mouth?","Reed Hastings","We focus on a front of the research in terms of consumer preferences, look at Nielsen-type data in terms of what people are viewing. We do in-market research. And all of that informs our intuition. Then we launch, and then we start to really learn what people are viewing. What they like in terms of, say, subtitles. What they like in terms of how much of it is high-def, how important is that, what platforms. And there's considerable variation between markets. So think of it as, we do a bunch of effort upfront but it doesn't matter much. It just gets us started. And then we rapidly iterate and learn as to what are the important preferences in each market.","Ellie Mertz","Looking at Latin America, there are some key differences in terms of income levels and broadband penetration rates. Is there anything about Latin America that indicates the region may achieve profitability faster or slower than a region like Canada? How should we think about the cost of content deals in Latin America compared to the U.S. and Canada?","David Wells","So Latin America, you can infer from our discussion in the earnings letter, both from our net additions in this Q4 for international versus last year, is growing slower than Canada did in its first quarter launch. I'd say that we're building a new brand in Latin America where we had much more of a U.S. halo brand effect in Canada. And device penetration in Canada was higher than it is in Latin America. Those 2 things are turning out to be important. So I think Latin America is a good and perspectively a great market for us going forward, but it does look like it's going to be on a path slower to profitably than Canada. And then the second part of your question dealt with -- can you ask that one more time?","Ellie Mertz","How do you think about content deals and the cost in Latin America relative to Canada and the U.S.?","David Wells","Sure. So content pricing is related to the value that the owner of that content and the producer of that content can monetize in each different market. It's more specific than even Latin America. It's within a country market. And so relative to Canada, it's hard to answer that question in terms of the content. It would be less if that content owner has fewer monetization options in, say, Brazil or Mexico than they do in Canada.","Ellie Mertz","So given the situation you're describing in Latin America, is it going to take you longer than you have anticipated to reach profitability in that market?","Reed Hastings","It's early to say. But on balance, I guess, yes, that it will take us longer than 2 years. So we're working hard on all of our payment issues and subtitling issues, rapidly improving them, and then we'll be able to see what's the underlying growth trajectory. So it's not out of the question, but I would say the odds are it will take longer than 2 years. And I'll point out that the 2 years is a bit of a aspirational arbitrary benchmark. If you look at DIRECTV, it took them a number of years to gain their market position, and now they have an extremely valuable franchise. So mostly, the 2-year goal is a great internal goal because we want to turn around that money and invest in the next market. But the fundamental -- really get a return on it is we feel very strongly about where the growing economies in Latin America and our strong relative competitive position that we can build a very valuable franchise in Latin America.","Ellie Mertz","In examining your Latin American product, would you say that most of the streaming activity is in the Televisa novelas or Hollywood programming \u201cout of the studio\u201d system? Also, what are your feelings about how the Latin American streaming product is priced versus the competition? And do you think any pricing tweaks are necessary?","Reed Hastings","Well, definitely, pricing is not an issue. We're very aggressively priced. For example, MXN 99 in Mexico. Most of the content viewing is Hollywood content, and that's how we've programmed. And then we complement that with the telenovelas.","Ellie Mertz","When negotiating with the studios, how does the prevalence of piracy in Latin America impact the deals in terms of pricing and\/or release schedules?","David Wells","So I think it's back to my earlier comment about the available monetization channels that the content owner has and if piracy depresses those,  then the cost of the content is lower because their ability to monetize the content in-market is lower.","Ellie Mertz","Why do you dismiss Web film [ph] so quickly as DVD-only?","Let me take this one. Historically, Web film [ph] has been predominantly focused on DVD. Streaming is really something that they're only in the early stage of, whereas we've been focused on streaming for 5 years now. And so if you look at the services, we're better, faster and easier to use in the U.K. So we expect they'll likely be -- continue to be successful in the DVD-by-mail and the hybrid segment of the market, which for us domestically is about 40%. And if you just look at how they're offering the service today, they came out with a strong streaming-only offering around the time of our launch, and yet it's still very difficult to find on their website. So we'll continue to monitor them. But I think we have a leg up in terms of our streaming experience.","Now that you're operating in 4 distinct regions: U.S., Canada, Latin America and U.K.\/Ireland, is there a need to favor one specific region over another in terms of allocating the content spend?","David Wells","No, there's no such need.","Ellie Mertz","Why did international freeze subs decline quarter-over-quarter? Is it normal seasonality?","David Wells","So I think the reference in terms of international freeze, if you take the total less...","Reed Hastings","That would be Lat Am. We launched Latin America mid-September. And so there was a big burst of trial subs, and there was no market that we launched in December.","David Wells","Right. So seasonal with the launch.","Ellie Mertz","Do you expect international quarterly losses to begin to decline in the second quarter of 2012?","David Wells","What we said in the letter was that the losses would moderate. So yes, I think that implies that they would go down in moderation from Q1 to Q2.","Ellie Mertz","I think it's safe to say that our losses will obviously be dependent on subscriber growth and the revenue that we generate from that growth.","Let's move to questions about DVD. If the DVD business continues to decline, would you look to consolidate warehouses? How do you expect closing of post offices to impact shipment time?","Reed Hastings","The closing of post offices has been put off probably post the election. So I don't see a big threat on that this year. And then in terms of closing our distribution centers, there's no practical savings to closing those. Most of the costs are the discs and the postage. So very little of it is our own processing centers. So it's just not material.","Ellie Mertz","How do you think consumers will react to a 56-day new release window? Do you expect that to drive more consumers away from DVD subscription?","David Wells","Well, our DVD consumers, including hybrid and DVD-only, continue to be weighted towards catalog. It's less than 30% in terms of the shipment mix that are new-release oriented. When we went to 28-day, we didn't see a big shift because, again, that mix was about the same then. And it's actually gone slightly down. It hasn't gone slightly up as you might surmise from more concentration to DVD subscribers.","Ellie Mertz","Will you be adding video games or 3D movies to your product offering, especially if subscribers are willing to pay a premium like they do for Blu-ray discs?","Reed Hastings","3D movies, we already have. We have a lot of Blu-ray that's 3D. And on streaming, that's definitely something we can do and we'll be looking at. In terms of video games, we have no plans to enter video games.","Ellie Mertz","Looking at your Q1 guidance and utilizing the midpoint, it seems that your guidance is suggesting that a DVD subscriber is contributing about 6x more to profits than a streaming subscriber, or around $15 per DVD customer but only $2.50 for a streaming customer. Do you still feel it is a wise strategy to push customers towards the streaming service? And if so, what effects do you anticipate on long-term margins?","David Wells","The analysis is well intentioned, I'm sure, but it's looking -- not looking at the marginal cost and the marginal increment, which is the important one. So a marginal streaming subscriber is almost pure contribution margin. There's a little bit for credit cards, CS and CDMCs [ph], but it's pretty modest. A marginal DVD subscriber has a number of variable costs, the postage and DVD fees in particular. So actually, it's the opposite, which is the profitability of a new streaming subscriber, the contribution margin is almost twice what it is for a DVD subscriber. So that's the way we think about it. And we're -- we\u2019d like to have someone use both services because obviously, that's both more revenue and more profit. But if they were only going to use one, we'd much prefer them use the streaming service.","Ellie Mertz","Why the reduced expectation for Q1 DVD contribution profit margin? Are content costs going up? Or you expect to market the service more?","David Wells","The reduced margin is related to the reduced revenue that we discussed in the letter. I don't think -- it's not going down too much other than the fact that there's a seasonal increase in usage in the DVD business. So Q4 to Q1, we usually see a margin reduction in the DVD business.","Ellie Mertz","In terms of retention initiatives are being done in the DVD segment, will Netflix be marketing the DVD service in 2012?","Reed Hastings","There are no specific retention efforts, and we don't plan on marketing the DVD service. Our primary goal is to keep it stable, very high functioning to keep our operational metrics in terms of top of queue fulfillment; in terms of one-day turnaround, very, very high, and not to otherwise to start -- keep it running very well.","David Wells","And when we've tested DVD plans and putting more emphasis on DVD plans, there hasn't been a great take rate. So I think we get that question a lot and we have looked at it through AV testing. And there's not a large consumer adoption of those plans.","Ellie Mertz","Moving to questions about our consolidated results and outlook. With the stated goal of returning to profitability before launching new markets, is it fair to expect that you'll be basically -- you'll basically be matching the rollout of new markets to profitability for the foreseeable future, meaning that once margins go above breakeven, new markets will be launched but bring them back down until that profitability is reached again and the cycle repeated until you reach a global or near-global offering?","Reed Hastings","Yes. That's a very articulate description.","Ellie Mertz","Let\u2019s move to questions about competition. Looking at competition for streaming rights domestically, we agree the breadth of content on Hulu and Amazon does not appear to match Netflix today, but you see that changing. Are you seeing them or potentially other players bid more aggressively for broader rights analogous to yours? In other words, is the bidding activity for streaming rights picking up?","Reed Hastings","There's very little market just for streaming rights. It's mostly for generalized exploitation rights. And so actually, Hulu Plus and Amazon are quite small bidders compared to the cable networks that we bid against. So no material change from them.","Ellie Mertz","You talked about Amazon getting into the stand-alone subscription market at a lower price. Would you expect them to do that with their current offering? Or would they need to acquire more content and more aggressive movies?","Reed Hastings","Not sure on their content strategy, depends on how much they want to spend.","David Wells","Today, they've taken a measured approach, but we'll see.","Ellie Mertz","What do you think the implications of the future Apple TV that is reported in the works might mean for your business's strategy?","Reed Hastings","I don't have any insight on an Apple TV. But there is a small 3 inch by 3 inch box called Apple TV that Apple invited us on about 2 years ago, and it's been very successful for us. We've just updated that application, making it even better, adding a great Netflix for Kids interface on it. It's now throughout Latin America, and we expanded the agreement with Apple for the U.K. and Ireland. So we're working really well with the current and existing Apple TV.","Ellie Mertz","Moving to questions on the financials and other metrics. In early January, Netflix announced that it streamed 2 billion hours of content in Q4. Can you explain why hours streamed is a relevant metric? If subscribers stream more hours, what impact does this have on Netflix's subscription cost? Will you be reporting hours streamed on a regular basis?","David Wells","I would liken that to a -- in 2007 when we announced the milestone 1 billionth DVD shipment. It's a measure of engagement and scale in terms of the widespread adoption of our service and the use of our service. So I wouldn't expect us to regularly update that on a quarterly basis but on a milestone basis. And it's a great milestone for us to have hit and, like I said, shows widespread adoption and usage of our service.","Reed Hastings","And there's very little margin impact for more usage. It's only in the CDM [ph] fees, is the only place where that exists.","Ellie Mertz","Could you update us on the percentage of subscribers who are both DVD and streaming?","I can take this. At the end of the year, we had about 8.4 million subscribers who were on both of the services. So about 40% of our total streaming subscribers domestically.","Reed Hastings","And it's continuing to fall.","Ellie Mertz","Any impact to cost from the Durbin Amendment?","I can take this as well. Durbin Amendment as related to our business basically caps the interchange fee charged to merchants when transacting even with debit cards. And so as can be expected, we have a high percentage of our transactions that are indeed conducted through debit cards. And so we will see a decrease in the percent of revenue paid towards credit card use this year and is incorporated into our guidance.","David Wells","It's buried in the cost of revenues, though. Streaming content expenses obviously are much bigger than our transaction fees on debit and credit card.","Ellie Mertz","Going forward with international mix, what are your assumptions on the blended tax rate for Q1 and all of 2012?","David Wells","Q1 will be 39%. We continue to be pretty close to a full tax rate payer. It's unknown whether the R&D tax credit will be renewed this year. My guess will punted through until the end of the election. And if it behaves similarly to 2010, if it isn't adopted, they'll probably make it retroactive, and we might have a similar tax pattern to 2010. Which means that we'll have 38%, 39%, and then there'll be a low rate catch-up in Q4.","Ellie Mertz","Right. Let's move to questions on Facebook. How has the Facebook integration impacted subscriber growth in Canada and Latin America?","Reed Hastings","There's no direct measurement that we're able to do on our success in all of our international markets, how much of that is due to Facebook and social integration. So instead, what we look at is engagement: how do we get people to enjoy it more, use it more, click on more of the stories, watch movies from The Social Rose. So our driving and focusing each of our updates is just increasing engagement, and that's been going very well. And we're excited about the possibilities of social TV as we continue to figure out how to evolve it and improve it.","Ellie Mertz","Is there an update on when you expect the app to be available to U.S. members?","Reed Hastings","I think we covered that in the investor letter under the BPPA [ph] section.","Ellie Mertz","Do the international test to date provide meaningful data in terms of the average boost to new subs, increased fees ensuing from existing subs, et cetera?","Reed Hastings","I don't think we covered that, which is we don't have a clean A\/B. So we can't tell if this success is because of our brilliant advertising or because of our Facebook integration.","Ellie Mertz","Move to questions on devices. Apple sold 16 million iPads last quarter. But in the past, you have said you don't believe that tablets are a subscriber acquisition channel for Netflix streaming. Do you think that the faster, out-of-home bandwidth speeds would possibly convert tablets into bigger subscription -- into a bigger subscription acquisition channel?","Reed Hastings","Not particularly. Tablets are very successful, and people are watching Netflix on lots of tablets. That doesn't make it an acquisition vehicle. It's a great consumption vehicle. And tablets as opposed to phones tend to be Wi-Fi and tend to be used then without data caps. Whereas phones tend to be used on mobile plans, cellular plans that have data caps in the U.S. generally. So we're very bullish on tablets. We're investing heavily in it. We updated our iPad interface and made them much better, and we\u2019re continuing to invest in that. So it's a key part of our strategy.","David Wells","We said earlier that we don't comment on the relative usage across devices, but one of the reasons that we're investing in tablets is because we do see people enjoying a lot more of their viewing on tablets relative to the PC.","Ellie Mertz","Have you seen any impact from Smart TV sales during the quarter?","Reed Hastings","Yes, absolutely. Smart TV is one of our fastest-growing device categories. It's just beginning obviously. But as consumers set up and buy, or buy and set up Internet TVs, they certainly want to be able to use Netflix. And in many of them, we've got a great red Netflix button right on the remote control, so it makes it very easy. So the long-term trend for us on Smart TV is very exciting and positive.","Ellie Mertz","So one question on the Q4 financing. In hindsight, do you wish you waited on the secondary given the quarter and guide for Q1 was better than original guidance? Why did you not just wait until Q1 to do the raise?","Reed Hastings","It's always fun to pick stock prices in hindsight. You could have great returns when you do that.","David Wells","Yes. I'd say that hindsight's easy. Given the same facts, I'd make the same decision. And the relative dilution is unfortunate. We'll work a little harder. But otherwise, we're in a much stronger position.","Ellie Mertz","Great. That's the end of the email -- submitted email questions. At this time, I'll turn it over to our operator and we'll begin taking live follow-up call-in questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich [ph] Greenfield from BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","A couple of follow-ups. One, Reed, when you initially were going to separate the 2 plans with Qwikster, you had talked about investing in the DVD business, and that's part of the reason you were doing it, was to invest in that business because you thought it had a long life. And it seemed like -- the comment you made earlier, you made it seem like the DVD business is something you're not going to put a whole lot more emphasis on from an investment standpoint. I'm just -- does this all relate back to the fact that the DVD business is actually now declining? I mean, do you expect stand-alone DVD subs to be down each of the quarters throughout 2012?","Reed Hastings","Yes, Rich ]ph]. We expect DVD subscribers to decline steadily every quarter forever.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","But even -- because the stand-alone subscribers I think actually we're up in Q4. And so now you actually think that now that the shift from hybrid to stand-alone DVD had subsided, the net effect will be stand-alone DVD-only subscribers going down quarter after quarter?","Reed Hastings","No. We don't think about it as stand-alone versus hybrid. There's just DVD subscription to DVD subscriptions, which are 11 million at the end of last year, are going to decline steadily essentially forever.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","And then if I could just -- one last question on viewership. The 2 billion hours I think was a real surprise to most people in the industry. And I think one of the things that is talked a lot about by investors is that people say the content is not that great, there isn't that much to watch. And yet when you see 2 billion hours, or people watching an hour a day, there seems to be a real disconnect between what people are doing with Netflix or even what some of the other media executives in the industry think people are doing on Netflix than what they're actually doing. What do you think the biggest reason for this disconnect is?","Reed Hastings","The average American household watches 8 hours of TV a day. And the average investor does not watch 8 hours of TV a day. So there's -- when one looks at one's own personal behavior, there is a big disconnect, I would say, relative to median or typical Americans which is, at over 20 million subscribers, is most of our market. And so if there is a disconnect, that might be the reason why.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.","Jason S. Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Two questions. First, not sure if you want to comment. In the last filing, you guys talked about expecting an EPS loss for the year. That was around your offering. Wondering how the near term results in your outlook for the first quarter affect that outlook and if that's still a current number? And secondly, can you just update us what share count was at the end of the quarter?","Reed Hastings","On the first part, I'll refer you to the investor letter, which addresses that precisely. And then the share count?","David Wells","55.4 million was the diluted share count at the end of the quarter. And I'll just...","Reed Hastings","And that's in the letter -- investor letter, obviously.","David Wells","Yes. It's on the first page of the letter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays Capital.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the Warner Home Entertainment moving its window to 56 days from 28, you'd mentioned in the letter that, that improves your relationship with Warner. And I know that is relevant to the DVD side. But I guess there's -- some investors out there are wondering if there's a possibility that you licensed more of the Warner Bros.' TV studios content going forward? I just wonder, is your relationship with Time Warner and Warner Bros. improved such that it's any more likely incrementally that you can secure Warner Bros.' TV content from here? And do you think expanding window relate to that in any way?","Reed Hastings","Just to correct you, I don't believe that we said it improved the relationship. And...","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It can maintain a direct relationship with Warner.","Reed Hastings","Yes, as opposed to going to Wal-Mart and buying the DVD sideways. So that's what that's a reference to. So it's a perfectly healthy, respectful relationship and one with a top bidder. And we make them more money than everybody else, we get the content. And when we're not the top bidder, we don't get the content. So we don't do them favors, they don't do us favors, but there's trust and respect. And when there's an overlap, then we're able to do good business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Citi.","Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The comment about underspending in marketing in Q4, could you just provide a little more color around that with our new found efficiencies? Or was that just a timing issue?","David Wells","That wasn't timing, Mark. This is David. It was related to the fact that we had to make some estimates on Netflix button payments for CE manufacturers. And our estimates were too high.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So you said in the letter that you won't add new geographies until you return to profitability. Is that global profitability on a quarterly basis or full year? So I guess in other words, if you [indiscernible].","David Wells","Quarterly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley.","Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The first read on the DVD business has this inherent upsell capability given the multi-disc and the Blu-ray premium as well. And so for streaming, it's less clear. You've talked historically about the possibility of things like family plans. And I'm just wondering if you can speak to those opportunities to the extent that you think that they do exist and whether you think the $7.99 is the right long-term price for the U.S. streaming product?","Reed Hastings","I think $7.99 is the right price for streaming. We\u2019re -- feel great about the price. We're succeeding at that price. We've got a growing contribution margin, growing market share at that price. So we don't have any plans to change that. We will be adding various kinds of multi-account options over the year that our Product Officer, Neil Hunt, has talked about. And those are aimed at providing a better experience so that, for example, not all of your kids' content shows up for you, and not all of your content shows up on your kids' accounts. So we'll continue to improve the experience in that way.","Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And separately, you've also mentioned that the streaming business has a higher incremental contribution margin profit. And so I understand it's early and subscribers are a key ingredient, I suppose, to the margin profile of the streaming business overtime. But how do you think about the margin profile of that business given that on one hand, your retail price is lower than premium TV providers. On the other hand, if you take the premium TV providers such as HBO, and even if you gross their business up for the MSO [ph] rupture, they have operating margins in the mid-20s.","Reed Hastings","I agree with your facts, Scott, but I'm not sure what the question was.","Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The question is how do you -- as you position your streaming business and you're thinking about understanding that it's very early, what do you think the margin profile of the domestic streaming business is?","Reed Hastings","Well, let\u2019s see -- so HBO gets round numbers, around $7 or $8 per sub from the MSOs [ph]. We hope that we can have a much larger subscriber base than them. And that will allow us to spend even more on content and have an even better service. Then you've got, obviously, the on-demand aspect of Netflix and all the work that we do to make it personalized and even more useful. So we should be able to, in the long term, have an even better margin position than HBO, but it really depends on a relative scale. So if we're twice as large as the nearest competitor, it would tend to lead to large margins. If it's neck-and-neck of us and HBO in terms of subscriber size, then there would be tighter margins for both of us.","David Wells","And if there's more substitution between those 2 rather than complement.","Reed Hastings","Exactly.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Schechter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.",".","Matt Schechter - Center for Financial Research & Analysis, Inc.","In the past, you have said that you have seen, at least initially, that there was a kind of a shorter duration or lighter connection with streaming subscribers leading to [indiscernible] versus streaming subscribers on a cohort -- same cohort basis? Are you continuing this? And where do you think streaming churn will end up relative to your historical near 4%?","Reed Hastings","Matt, you're on a mobile phone and it was cutting out while you spoke. The question I got was kind of long-term churn. It's not something that we really focus on. We make it easy for subscribers to get in and get out. And one of the aspects of the membership change that we referred to, definitional change, for example, is that if we go to your credit card and the charge doesn't go through, you're essentially instantly canceled. For membership purposes, you no longer count as a paid member. And then when the credit card clears, you become a member again. And so you could imagine that if you treat it that way, that wreaks havoc with -- or makes churn numbers not really that sensible. So that's some of the reasons that we've really been focusing on net additions and total subscriber growth and not churn.","David Wells","Actually, the other thing I'd add to that is just like the DVD business, our subscribers that higher in retention, the longer they are with us. So I think you're referring that to the relative statements we made about streaming retention, early subscribers versus streaming retention, hybrid or DVD subscribers. But that retention does get better the longer the sub remains with us, just like it has before. So the more the base -- the subscriber base ages, the better our retention overall.","Matt Schechter - Center for Financial Research & Analysis, Inc.","David, just a quick follow-up. Does that equal out to very similar on DVD versus streaming on a same cohort basis in time, the age of subscriber?","David Wells","So if the retention pattern starts a little bit lower, our retention pattern is not going to equal. Because -- I see what you're asking. You're asking if someone who's been with us for a year, streaming subscriber, is equivalent to someone who's been with us with a year on the hybrid or DVD in it? It's roughly in line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of things. So first, just on the 1Q streaming guidance. Can you just clarify; you mentioned the 200,000 fewer domestic streaming subs potentially in 1Q, based on the change on payment hold. So you're suggesting that, that guidance would be 200,000 higher if it weren't for that change? And then also, any commentary on what you'd expect for streaming sub growth in 2012?","Reed Hastings","Correct on your first one and nothing more than the letter on the second.","Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And if I could just follow up with one more. Could you just clarify why there's no deleveraging the DVD business if you have to continue to operate the warehouses around the country?","Reed Hastings","Because the warehouses are -- I shouldn't say no deleverage. But the warehouses are such a tiny percent of the total cost, and most of the equipment or a lot of it has depreciated that there's only very modest deleveraging.","David Wells","So if you think about the DVD cost, postage and the cost of the content are more variable. And those are the bigger pieces than the cost of the fulfillment. That's one of the reasons you see that our fulfillment as a percent of revenue is going down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Hargreaves from Pacific Crest.","Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Can you give us a sense for how you think about the mix of marketing versus content spend as you're entering new markets?","Reed Hastings","Andy, I can't really help you on that for competitive reasons. We enter big on both to create both a lot of brand awareness and to have it be a good experience. So each country, we're learning more and more. Or each market, we're learning more and more. We started in Canada. We've adjusted that mix a little bit for Lat Am. We adjusted it again for U.K. and Ireland, and we're continuing to improve in terms of that mix. But we view it as a good proprietary advantage.","Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then just a model question. Is there early conversion on the PTV convert so that you would have to count those shares in the diluted share count at the current price?","David Wells","The forced conversion price is 111.54, and it has to be at a sustained level for a number of days. So it's possible, but the conditions are somewhat public in terms of...","Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And when does it become eligible for that, David?","David Wells","When it's -- in 6 months.","Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","So 6 months from issuance? Mid-November?","David Wells","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Blackledge from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John R. Blackledge - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. The 4Q '11 subs, in particular the net unique sub apps are a little better than what you guided too. Just wondering what drove that? Was December better? And then if you can give us a sense of what the net uniques sub losses and\/or additions by month were in the fourth quarter, that would be helpful.","Reed Hastings","John, it was better as we said in letter that October and November matched what we had expected and December was stronger. And that was a combination of more growth adds around the holiday period, integration into all the devices and fewer cancels than we had expected.","Ellie Mertz","Okay. That's going to be the last question for today. We'd like to thank everyone for your time and look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Reed Hastings","And I feel obliged, since I just got back from Sundance, to give you 2 movie recommendations to end the call on a light note. Both The Surrogate and Beasts of the Southern Wild hopefully will get picked up and distributed and everyone will be able to see them. They're fantastic movies. And I'll try to make sure they're on Netflix for all of you, too. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) Q1 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call April 15, 2015  6:00 PM ET","Executives","David Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Reed Hastings - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer","Ted Sarandos - Chief Content Officer, Vice President of Content","Analysts","Mark Mahaney - RBC","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","David Wells","Welcome to the Q1 2015 Netflix earnings call. I am David Wells, CFO. Today, I will be joined on the company side by Reed Hastings, our CEO and Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer. Interviewing us will be Mark Mahaney from RBC and Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.","I think Mark has the first questions. So over to you Mark.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q -Mark Mahaney","Okay. Thanks, David. First question is for Reed. This was maybe an inflection point quarter in terms of the domestic streaming sub adds. They came in materially ahead of your guidance. They were actually up a little bit year-over-year, which is a bit of a surprise. In the press release you talked about both getting more subs in and retaining them better, maybe than you had expected. Could you provide a little bit more color? And is this something that you think is happening across the industry, the greater focus on streaming offerings is just helping the leader in the market? Or is there something specific that you are doing on both of those ends, the gross sub adds and the churn?","Reed Hastings","We have continued the focus on the same things over the last couple of years, improving the content, improving the streaming, improving the user interface. And we have seen the rewards of that in continued growth. I think this quarter in particular, we had some amazing original content with Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, with House of Cards, with Bloodline. And so all of that compounded to really push us forward and certainly what you are seeing is all of Internet TV growing. The attention of the new launches of the competitors is only creating a bigger ecosystem, drawing more and more people into thinking, hey I have got a check that out and try this Internet TV thing.","Mark Mahaney","And Reed, for some time you have talked about a long-term goal of 60 to 90 million subs. At this pace, sooner or later the financial markets might actually agree with you. Any updated thinking on where we could fall in that range and when we could get to that?","Reed Hastings","Well, I would say they agree with us already. I mean at a $25 billion to $30 billion market cap, there is a lot of growth pressed into it, I think you would agree. And so yes, 60 to 90 million feels great for us. We are continuing to grow. That's the 60 to 90 million in the U.S. market. Of course, the really big upside beyond that is in international. For most global Internet firms, the U.S. is 20% to 35% of usage and revenue. We are not anywhere close to that yet, but we are continuing to invest in international.","Michael Nathanson","Reed in the past quarter, we have seen new entrants like HBO NOW and Sony Vue come out with pricing, it looks pretty expensive relative to Netflix. I wonder, do you think you have a pricing umbrella, given where they have launched their products relative to where you guys have price today?","Reed Hastings","Well, no. I think HBO at $15 is a great value. I mean I have traditionally paid more than $15 for my cable company for it. So I think they are doing great work with their premium content. It does create obvious underline of just how great the value is of Netflix with prices ranging from $7.99 to $11.99. But we are really comfortable with that strategy. We are continuing to grow with this strategy and it is an incredible value. But I think we you should really think about it is all the Internet services HBO Now, Netflix and Hulu are great values in comparison to the big bundle.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. And David for the current quarter, you talk about the trend on churn. I know you guys don't give out churn numbers, but what was the impact of original content on churn this year versus a year ago?","David Wells","Well, as Reed said, just picking up on those comments, you really do see the improvements in the service, both on the content, the interface, the payments across the globe really move together. So you see that with acquisition and churn improving, but we did see improving churn. So we are saying that we saw improving retention through the quarter and that contributed to that net add performance and growth that we saw in Q1.","Mark Mahaney","Great. And David, if I could stick on the U.S. business, last quarter you talked about 30%-ish margins, 90 days later we are already materially above that and you are telling people to expect your business to be above that. So just, I know there are some stuff in the press release on it, but any more color on why there is such a pretty material shift in the margins and to what extent should we just be concerned that you are just pushing content cost in international markets, so really there is not an improvement in the leverage here in the U.S. business?","David Wells","Well, it's both, Mark. So there is absolutely an improvement driven by the growth. We are growing revenue faster than we are growing our expenses. But in terms of the outperformance relative to our target of where we would want to be in terms of U.S. margin growth, it's a couple of the things that we have talked about in the letter. One of them is, we are shifting marketing from the U.S. to international. We think we can grow a little bit faster on international. It's more efficient to do that.","And the second thing is a little bit of just the mechanics of how we allocate content cost by geography. So by growing faster internationally and putting that allocation more towards international, it's going to provide some relief to those global originals in the global projects that we do have that are allocated to the U.S. and we intend to continue to invest in that. That's also why we put in the letter that our target remains the same, 40% in 2020.","So we want to continue to balance the growth of profit with the growth and the competitiveness of our service. We want to reinvest in the service prudently along the way.","Mark Mahaney","So let me ask a two part follow-on question to that, one for David and one for Ted. David, coming back, marketing spend in the U.S. in an increasingly competitive market, some level that feels a little extra risky than you should be doing. So can you just talk through why you are so confident you don't need, you can cut back on those marketing dollars in the U.S. beyond just one quarter of better-than-expected results?","And then Ted, last quarter in the letter, there was this bolded section, therefore it caught my eye, about content spend being more efficient with original content than with licensed content. Do you feel like you have really reached a point that that's what we are seeing in the business model today that you are continuing to see more leverage just with that original content purchase?","Ted Sarandos","Yes. I will take the last question first there. What we are seeing is the dollars invested in our original programming are more efficient, in that for every dollar spent, we get more bang for the buck in terms of hours viewed. And hours viewed leads to higher retention, more word-of-mouth and more brand halo. So that why we say that it turned out to be not just an important strategic investment but also an efficient one.","David Wells","And Mark, on your first question about our relative comfort with moving dollars out of the U.S. and in to international, which is one quarter. I would say we have had multiple quarters of strong growth. Marketing dollars have been up, they have been down. I don't think there is a direct connection within one quarter in terms of the level of marketing spend and the level of growth that we see. We have migrated over the last two to three years to be more content forward in our marketing, more digital in our marketing. We are getting smarter and more efficient about how we put those dollars to use. And so right now we think there is a greater opportunity with international and that's what we are doing, we are moving to international spending.","Michael Nathanson","Ted, in the past six months, we have seen Viacom and Turner write down the value of acquired syndicated content. Truly the value of the content wasn't worth what they were paying. Can you talk a bit about your own usage trends on acquired content? And whether or not you think the long-term trend for what you are acquiring will be declining on a per hour basis?","Ted Sarandos","Look, as we continue to grow, the thing that's most encouraging is that the content we are licensing around the world has got equal and sometimes even disproportionate value to us outside of the U.S. So what we are seeing real global value from licensing shows in multiple territories. And as we are continuing to grow domestically, we are seeing those viewing hours on licensed content, even older licensed content as we saw with Friends last quarter where the viewing continues to grow. So we are still seeing a lot of value from that programming, both our original and our licensed programming from all those sources.","Michael Nathanson","And you expect the price paid going forward will be trending up or down for the acquired?","Ted Sarandos","It's tough to say. Mostly it's a reflection of how many buyers are in the market. So we have got a few other people into the market, there is some value in having a larger footprint and being able to bring more value to the franchise, what for being on Netflix that we get to realize in our negotiations. But I think most of those prices, up and down, is driven by the number of competitive buyers in the marketplace.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. Then let me ask one more for David. You mentioned before on the content spend shift between U.S. and international. Can you remind us again how you amortized content between domestic and international markets? How do you decide what the allocation rates are between the two geographies?","David Wells","Sure, Michael. In terms of how we amortize is straight line for originals, there is accelerated. How we allocate across countries or territories between the operating segment of domestic and international is based on the relative value of that content. So we use the PwC media survey to help validate what that content would be worth in that market. And there's pluses and minuses to various types of allocation. We have looked at many types. So we think that's the most accurate in terms of ascribing the relative value of content within each market.","Reed Hastings","And David Wells, if we have a global content, where does the allocation for Poland show up today?","David Wells","Today, the allocation for Poland is going to be spread across because we haven't yet launched that market. So what's little bit new for us is we now have clear line of sight that we are launching the rest of the world, which is new relative to the last six to nine months. So we shifted a bit and you are seeing part of that Poland, if we sign a global right for Poland, distributed across our current territories. A year ago you would have seen us, if it was going to be launched in the next year park that on the balance sheet and then start amortizing it once we launched Poland. And if we prospectively signed up for a Poland right and we just didn't have line of sight to the next year whether we were going to launch the territory, that would be spread across the existing territories that we were in, which is what we would do today.","Ted Sarandos","If we back it up a few years, we would have sold off Poland, not knowing what to do with it and look for it later.","Reed Hastings","That's right.","Mark Mahaney","Okay. If I can get back to Reed on a question I came up really about pricing and maybe tearing power. So Reed, your latest thinking, given the momentum in the business and the ability to raise fees or raise ARPU over time and particularly via tearing either be it service and number of lines or content, your latest thoughts on your pricing and tearing power today?","Reed Hastings","Well, Mark, we are super happy right where we are. We have got a great mix of pricing plans and options and for those who get a new 4K television and they are excited about 4K content, we are the leading service in the world for 4K and that plan is a little more expensive at $11.99. So as more 4K TV is sold, we will get people to upgrade to the $11.99 plan.","In terms of the total pricing structure, we couldn't be happier with the way it creates an incredible value for the consumers. It feels fair to them and it's propelling our growth.","Mark Mahaney","Okay. Now let me pivot over to the international markets. So we also had subs upside in the U.S., we had subs upside internationally. Could you talk about where that came from? What wasn't mentioned in the letter was Germany and France, those are obviously major markets. Maybe they are growing in line or little less than you thought? What was mentioned is Australia, New Zealand. So any particular color there on which countries are performing in line, better and worse than expectations?","Reed Hastings","Sure. That's somewhat of a recency bias. We launched France and Germany six or eight months ago and we talked about it in the immediate aftermath also that they were successful launches. Now we have added Australia, New Zealand. And all of these markets, the Internet and Internet television is catching on and we are leading relative to competitors and we have got competitors all around the world. In each market, there is a series of competitors. So we are feeling very bullish on the long-term in all of these markets. We have seeing when we entered in Latin America three or four years ago that it takes us a year or two to build the brand and get awareness. But think of it as every country in the world are and consumers in every country in the world want the benefits of Internet television choice and selection and price. So absent severe piracy that might be in some of the newer countries, I think we are going to see large commercial success.","David Wells","And Mark, this is David. There was no one particular market that drove that. So there were multiple markets that drove that outperformance relative to what we thought to our forecast.","Michael Nathanson","And in Reed's tweet a couple days ago, you mentioned 10 billion hours consumed in the quarter. Could you us give a sense of consumption rates domestically and internationally? Are there any international markets that jump out to be above normal consumers?","Reed Hastings","There is variation between countries. Some countries are amazing. And U.S. is one of them. But it's not the biggest. So for competitive reasons, I am not going to give your precise color. But there is variations. And what's great about the viewing is if you look two years ago in this call, we said it was 4 billion hours in the Q1 and over those two years, we have gone from 4 billion to 10 billion hours of viewing. And so you can see along with our membership growth, we are also having engagement growth, which given all the new competitors, improving television, is really impressive that Netflix is growing not only the subs but engagement also.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. And then Ted, you recently mentioned that in China, it sounds like you have a go alone strategy. So what is your timing on China's launch and how does that strategy impact your actual launch in China?","Ted Sarandos","Well, Michael, a bit of that press was lost in translation a bit. I was explaining to the questioner why we have not taken up partners in the past. But it's not a reflection of whether we want to or what we are willing to do in China. We are anxious and open to all forms of doing business in China. So the press was a little bit out of context there.","Mark Mahaney","Okay. David last quarter in your script press release, you bolded one of those things was the expansion to all global market by the end of 2016. Is there an update on that given what's happened in the half of the year? Are you accelerating that timeline?","David Wells","There is no update other than the expectation for us to launch in 2016 was as an acceleration of our earlier stated objective. So no further update.","Mark Mahaney","And then for the June quarter, you talk about an increase in the operating loss to $101 million. You have got bigger launches in the back half of the year. Help us think about when the peak operating loss quarter is in international and what the size of that be? Could that be, if it's $100 million in the June quarter, what's the worst-case scenario? Are you willing to run it to $200 million loss in anyone quarter?","David Wells","Well, I don't provide specific guidance four or five quarters out for our operating loss. But we have said that we are committed to running the business at global breakeven and we have ambitious plans to launch international. So this quarter, what you have you see our guide with the full sort of Australia, New Zealand, you see our guide with additional investments in marketing and some content. We will have some bigger launches and we described as a meaningful and significant in the back half of this year. So you should expect those losses to trend upward and into 2016 and then to improve from there.","Michael Nathanson","Recently Reed, you changed your terms and conditions to alert people who use VPNs that they can be shut down from usage. We have heard a lot from our clients who are outside the U.S. as they do use VPNs to watch U.S. content. Why did you change the terms and conditions?","And for Ted, are studios asking you about VPN usage? Is that part of the reason?","Reed Hastings","So with VPN usage, that's where someone, to bring up Poland again where we are not yet operating, has the money to pay for content they want to access content, they want to pay for that content. Netflix is not yet in Poland. And so they will use the VPN to come to the U.S. virtually over the Internet, pay for content. So it's certainly less bad than piracy, it's not something we encourage. It's actually very hard to detect because VPN gets every good at covering their tracks for all the obvious reasons. And because we are focused on getting global very quickly, I think we will see this issue disappear and it will disappear because we will be able to meet the demand directly in all the countries.","Ted, anything on the studios as our partners?","Ted Sarandos","Yes. It's one of the many things that we have discussions with the studios about an ongoing basis and we do continue to work with them and work with these VPN. But to be honest with you, it's kind of a whack-a-mole to get ahead of the different usage of VPNs become kind a lifestyle thing for a very small segment of the population. The real great news is, in the piracy capitals of the world Netflix is winning. We are pushing down piracy in those markets by getting the access. So the best way to really make the VPN issue a completely nonissue is through global licensing that we are continuing to pursue with our partners.","David Wells","And Mark, to add to Ted, the only comments that I would add to Reed's earlier pricing comments were, piracy is a governor in terms of our price in high piracy markets outside the U.S. So we wouldn't want to come out with a high price because there is a lot of piracy. So we have to compete with that. So there is a little bit a governor on our price outside the U.S.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. And David, one question we get a lot of, that your content obligations they grew in this quarter. Can you talk a bit about your comfort of meeting those obligations? And when do you think you see a peak of your obligations on the balance sheet?","David Wells","Well, so I am comfortable with the level of content commitments we have. And there is a couple of reasons that I am comfortable with that, one is that the content is working. So we see engagement, we see value for the content. So it makes me more comfortable and confident that we are investing in something that has lasting value. Two is that we really are scaling along with the business. So we have grown from $9.5 billion in streaming content commitments in the table to $9.8 billion. That's about a 31% year-over-year growth rate and our streaming revenue has grown at 31% year-over-year as well. So that makes me a little bit more comfortable.","Now that includes what we know in terms of licensing commitments. It doesn't include things like Disney output. So let's take that as an example. That is for future film output at a future box office. So we are unable to know the licensing amount on those films, but we do have to factor that into our forecast as we have from the very beginning. So if we look ahead and we factor that in, we think it's an additional $3 billion to $5 billion of content commitments over the next three years and that's already baked into our forecast and we have been doing this from the very beginning. So we have got a little bit better at making sure that we waterfall deals, we have the flexibility we need to balance those commitments and that expense level over time.","Ted Sarandos","Michael, if I could interrupt for a second, I would also add that you should look at that as a signal of future access to content, because as we identify the high value content, we seek to lock them up in long-term deals. So that does increase our long-term obligation, but for things that we want and to attract revenue and viewing.","Mark Mahaney","Ted, could you stick on that topic on the content and especially the Disney output that's coming onboard next year, just to remind us of some of the details on that? And when you think about the white spaces of Netflix, the content areas that you would really like to most fill out, how important is Disney as part of those white spaces?","Ted Sarandos","Our Disney partnership is phenomenal. We have the output deal coming up that we just last week we launched our Defenders series for Marvel, with our first series Daredevil, it's been a huge success. Disney is the licensing partner with us around the planet. And we are really excited about the output deal coming on. It's probably one of the few output deals that I am enthusiastic about because the Disney content is global. It's tentpole. It's family. It's a lot of co-viewing among families for the content that gets watched. And it is a great brand to bring comfort to families who subscribe to Netflix. So it's a bit of a play between movies and kids programming that I think is successful for us.","The white space you refer to is, with all the excitement about the golden age of television and all the excitement about our own series, about a third of the viewing hours on Netflix today are still movies. So when we see something like we did early in the year with The Interview, we were able to close that window to 30 days, we had a phenomenal reaction in the U.S. and Canada for that movie. I want to keep pushing on behalf of consumers to get those windows narrower and narrower, including premiering original movies on Netflix which is why we are doing that to fill some of that white space.","Mark Mahaney","A two-part follow-on on that. Are there direct outputs from that Interview deal whereby you can actually do this much more often in the future? And then Reed, can I swing it back to you afterwards and ask you about products and major product pipelines in the next 24 months. I know you mentioned in the letter the enhancement of bringing video playback forward into the browse experience. I am not sure I actually understand what that means. Could you explain it? And then help us think about how material that can be to the user experience?","Ted Sarandos","I would say you should look at The Interview as a beautiful one-off. I say beautiful because bypassing the theaters and premiering on-demand, Sony managed to raise about $45 million in revenue from between a modest theatrical and primarily from digital on-demand and then a very strong fee for Netflix for the our license 30 days following that, what could have been a financial disaster and turned it into a financial win for the studio. So if anything you want to look at that and say, well, it's a beautiful possibility for future disruption in release patterns.","Reed Hastings","And as Ted said Mark, we are really sorry on the circumstances for Sony in the case of The Interview. We certainly wouldn't want to see more of that. But we are focused with our original new movies trying to push those windows up so early.","Then you asked about the product enhancements. We are doing so much. We tried to sample a little bit in the earnings letter. The particular improvement that we are talking about there written today when you browse for movies, it's a bunch of stills and then you say play, you wait a couple of seconds and then it plays the content. And what we are learning is how to use real-time video as you browse so that things are auto starting making that easier on the display pages, on the detail pages. So I think you will be really impressed.","But think of it as symbolic of a whole long series of hundred improvements per quarter that we are always working on in accumulation continue to make our experience better which pushes up the satisfaction, which helps retention to grow.","Michael Nathanson","Ted and Reed, when you first started building your streaming product, Ted would be in Beverly Hills giving people checks for content and all my content companies would say, this is incremental to the pie. We are happy that Netflix is a buyer. In the past nine months, we have seen ratings for cable and broadcast tumble to levels that I never thought was possible. So I wonder, do you worry that as our industry traditional media worries about ratings trends, they become less likely to sell you content and therefore it becomes harder to source really good second or original content? So I wonder how you feel about that?","Ted Sarandos","I am not seeing any actual evidence at the table in terms of that there is any reluctance to continue to sell. They are definitely trying to juggle the terms of their core business versus the license business, but that's true not just of us, but they are also seating these opportunities for themselves where you see the networks launching their own on-demand services. So I think they really are trying to find the right balance. And that generally I think we are still very healthy for the business in terms of both in terms of our licensing dollars and in terms of the audience generation that we are able to build for the shows on broadcast. And it's very encouraging that even with all of the disarray to you spoke about, that Fox can have a phenomenal cultural hit like Empire in the middle of all that. So I do think that there is obviously plenty of concern about the old way of doing business, but there is lots of action going into how do we do it going forward as well.","Reed Hastings","And you know, Michael, it is pretty naturally you have got to linear TV has been an amazing fifty-year run, Internet TV is starting to grow. Clearly over the next 20 years Internet TV is going to replace linear TV. And so I think everyone is scrambling to figure out how do they do great apps, how do they things like noggin are fantastic and that will just keep getting built up and so it's a transition into figuring out the Internet. And the way people do that is to get involved with us, with our competitors to try to start to learn what are the new patterns and modalities because Internet TV is the way that people will consume video in the future.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. And David, can you just talk a bit about your cash spend versus your P&L spend? I think this quarter was a 30% higher cash spend than P&L. Is that the right way to think about this year and even next year as well?","David Wells","Yes. Michael, we have been pretty consistently telling people that prior to the buildout of originals, it was 20% over the expense. Now it's drifting up to 30%. It could drift up to 40% and peak around there in certain quarters, especially if we take delivery of a lot of original product. But in general, we are building out our content investments, our original content investment and that is cash intensive as we put in the letter and we have been pretty consistent about this. I think what you are going to see now is several persistent quarters and going forward of negative free cash flow while we build this out.","Mark Mahaney","On that, David, you did this $1.5 billion debt offering in March quarter. Should the expectation on the market's part be that you won't need to come back to the markets for the next year-and-a-half? Or do you want to have the flexibility to, if international launches really do even better than you think, to come back for even more?","David Wells","Well, if we are successful in building out the content and if we want to get to ever-increasing mix of original content, meaning that up to 50% of our business is really our own owned content, then we are going to continue to invest in that content and that will require more and more cash. So I don't think we are saying no, that we are good now for the future. I don't think we are saying we are definite. But likely we will need, if we are successful to go back to the market at some point to continue to build that investment.","Mark Mahaney","And I want to ask a net neutrality regulatory question to Reed. This actually came from Rich Greenfield. With the FCC laying out this clear oversight of interconnection in that newly filed net neutrality order, do you think if that had been around before, that Netflix would have had to pay for the interconnections? If those rules had been in place, would they have had to pay for interconnections as they have been for whatever the last year or so?","Reed Hastings","It is awfully hard to tell going forward as we think about interconnection. It's a new climate with the FCC Title II in place and we will try to figure that out. We have a number of contracts that are in place already. So there is no immediate actions. But we are very encouraged by the general consumer perspective and political perspective that broadband access is so important that it is a utility. It is like power distribution where it's a natural monopoly in the last mile. There should be one fiber or one cable going to a home with super high speed and that's the architecture of the future. So everything around it being a utility is great for Internet companies like ourselves and it's great for consumers.","Michael Nathanson","Reed and Ted, in the past couple of weeks we have seen the NFL of all people explore Internet TV when they are announcing they are going to stream the game over the Internet. We have asked you in the past, but given the changes in the model, do you think you can add sports as a category to Netflix at this point?","Ted Sarandos","Michael, I think the part of our core consumer proposition is on-demand. We make viewing certain kinds of content better because they are on-demand. I don't know that on-demand sports is remarkably better than live sports. So that's why we haven't been that excited about why we haven't chased it. There is economic reasons as well. But I think in general that sports is great for live television.","Reed Hastings","And the great thing, Michael, about the emergence of sports online, is it frees people up to be more \u00e0 la carte which gives us more money to be able to spend on Netflix. So if we can anchor the entertainment side for movies and TV shows for every consumer and somebody else or other set of leagues anchor the sports part, which is still over the Internet, then the Internet TV proposition is even more powerful for consumers.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. Over the past year, we have asked you about the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger. You said, we would love to see deal conditions put on that in order to protect the Internet. You have gone above and beyond with the FCC Title II support. But one of the questions we have at our firm is price regulation Title II. So where do you come down on the FCC's ability to regulate pricing? Is that a good or a bad thing for the development of Internet TV?","Reed Hastings","I will have to say, it's very clear that broadband is a necessary utility across the land. I don't think anyone is a fan of price controls. So our main goal at this point is to get the government to block the Comcast-Time Warner merger. We think, were that merger to come together and as DSL fades, that company combined would have over 50% of U.S. residential Internet homes. And frankly that's just too much in one company.","Mark Mahaney","I wanted to ask a question on marketing to either David or Reed. You talked about maybe shifting more of your marketing budget online. Any more color beyond that? There is a lot of different places and ways to spend money online including via Facebook, et cetera. So any more color on that? And then why the switch to online? Is there something that's made the offline marketing channels less efficient for you?","David Wells","Well, it depends on the market, Mark. So in places where our brand is really well-known, we have noted that we are much more efficient being very targeted with that and being very specific around content marketing. Outside the U.S. in markets where we are building a brand, you should see a mixture of that. So you should see some offline and some online in terms of our spend. But every year we get more efficient and more knowledgeable about where that money is best spent. So we are an experimental company. You know that. You followed us. So you should see us continue to test around the edges of where things are better spent.","Mark Mahaney","Okay. And then a question on the actual end usage of Netflix, so maybe a broad question for Reed. When you think about the different use cases in the living room TV, on the go with mobile devices, et cetera, have you seen over the last two or three years a dramatic shift in how people are consuming Netflix content? And particularly as you go into international markets, which may be more mobile-oriented, particularly in Asia, are you set up the way that you want to be set up on devices in the formats to work that mobile trend?","Reed Hastings","We are feeling really good about our preparation for continuing to expand around the world over the next two years in terms of devices, in terms of networks, in terms of content. So yes, we have fought through a lot and studied the patterns of consumption and we are ready to at least begin that journey by launching around the world. And then what we will be able to do is learn from there, frankly as we did in Latin America three or four years ago.","Michael Nathanson","Reed, following on that question, has there been a handoff on tablets versus smart TVs? A couple of years ago we kept thinking smart TVs will be the device that drives Internet TV, but have you seen a difference on consumption by tablets versus smart TVs, the past couple of years?","Reed Hastings","Now we have seen smart TVs just continuing to grow and grow in usage and sales. Virtually every new TV sold now is a smart TV, at least at the middle and high-end and it's natural for people to use. Now, do they also watch on tablets? Yes and on phones. So really all those categories are experiencing absolute hours growth, but on a percentage basis, smart TV is one of our fastest-growing categories.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. And David, you called out the impact of foreign exchange in the first quarter. Could you give us a sense as to what the year is going to be on foreign-exchange? And then when do you expect to break out revenues by region so we can get more details on the regional and international?","David Wells","Well, if I knew what was going to happen with foreign-exchange, I would probably quit and then run a hedge fund.","Michael Nathanson","No, but what about for today. As of today? Okay.","David Wells","I would say, in Q1, most of that below the operating income foreign translation loss was unrealized, right. So we did have a change in our functional currency for our European entity. So when we first launched into Europe, we were very U.K. centric. So most of our operating cash flows were in British Pounds, which leads you to an accounting decision to a functional currency accounts. Since we have expanded in Europe and particularly into mainland Europe with more and more of our operating cash flow switched to the Euros, we switched it over. So there is some impact of that in that translation adjustment.","Going forward, it really does depend on what happens in terms of the Dollar strengthening further into the Euro. We are about 25% in terms of revenues exposed to foreign currency and that's growing. If we are successful, that will grow to 50%, but we also are pretty transparent that we don't hedge. And so we are not really concerned with those accounting translation adjustments.","We are pretty transparent to you as an investor that we don't hedge. You have the option to go out and hedge if you feel like you are exposed with your Netflix investment and we are watching in terms of our opportunities for natural hedging, but with the move to a global license, we may see more and more of those be dollar-denominated. So I will have to update you along the way in terms of our foreign currency exposure.","Reed Hastings","And why don't we hit it with one more question each guys and then we will wrap up.","Mark Mahaney","Okay. Let me, David, just check off real quickly, ARPU in both international and in the U.S. market, in international markets assuming currencies stay where they are, does ARPU stabilize where you guided to implicitly in Q2 and where it came out in Q1 and then start moving back up as price increases go into effect? Or should we just straight line it? And then in the U.S., ARPU has been rising. Is any of that caused by tiering of services? Are you getting a lot more people signing up for the $11.99 plans? Or is that just the impact of the price increases?","David Wells","It's both, Mark. So just to answer your question, on both domestic and international we are seeing ARPU progression because of people taking the higher tiers and the higher value plans and we are also seeing the expiration of people sort of coming off, grandfather rejoining or joining the service new at the higher price point. And obviously, we have a lot more subscribers in the U.S. So you are seeing that ARPU increase disproportionately rise internationally versus the U.S. just because we are building from a base of much fewer grandfathered subscribers outside the U.S. So you see both.","But your very first question was, should we see that progress? Yes, but we have a large body of U.S. subscribers that come off grandfather next year. So you can waterfall your churn models and you would expect that the U.S. has a much larger base of folks at the older price point.","Michael Nathanson","Reed, over the past 10 years, you guys have a pivoted perfectly from selling DVDs, to streaming, to making old content, to going overseas. So I wonder when you look at your business plan, what gives you worry? When you look at the challenges ahead, what's the thing that worries you?","Reed Hastings","Well, you are nice to say we pivoted perfectly, but I think you are forgetting about certain incidents four years ago. But we have succeeded in getting through them and the key thing is that the company is very agile. We are just a learning machine. When you think about how Ted has grown our original content muscle is just so impressive. How are continuing to expand to international, it's just like were learning country by country. We don't get everything right upfront, but we fix that. So I think the fundamental is, we are just open-minded, curious, we are learning and then frankly it's that Internet TV is growing around the world at incredible rates. And so were really propelled by that big macro trend.","And to wrap up here, Ted's producing so much content. I though Ted, maybe you could share a little bit of this quarter's highlights like Chef's Table, Sense8 and Orange is the New Black and just the amazing things that Netflix is debuting.","Ted Sarandos","Well, you definitely get a sense of the diversity of the programming that we are going to be offering up, just if you look at just what's coming up next quarter with our first original documentary series called Chef's Table from the director of Jiro Dreams of Sushi. We have got a third season of Orange is the New Black which is a global sensation that will break in June, of our comedy with Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda called Grace and Frankie that we are really excited to show to the world. Sense8, I think will show everybody what global TV series can really be like, filmed on location in nine cities around the world, spectacular scale and scope of a theatrical film, directed and created by Wachowski siblings and even original series for kids with How to Train Your Dragon 2. So we are super excited about both the volume and the quality and the diversity of everything we are doing in our original programming next quarter.","Reed Hastings","And Ted, are those series is globally available on Netflix?","Ted Sarandos","Globally available on Netflix in 4K.","Reed Hastings","I love that and in 4K. Thank you so much everyone for your support and I look forward to talking you over the next quarter."],"15783":["Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call April 16, 2018  6:00 PM ET","Executives","David Wells - CFO","Spencer Wang - VP, Finance & IR","Gregory Peters - Chief Product Officer","Wilmot Hastings - Co-Founder , Chairman, President & CEO","Theodore Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Analysts","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Spencer Wang","Good afternoon, and welcome to the Netflix Q1 2018 earnings interview. I'm Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are CEO Reed Hastings; CFO David Wells; Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; and Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters. Our interviewer this quarter is Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Before we begin, a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary.","With that, let me turn it over to Ben for his first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you. Reed, I want to ask you, given the strong results again this quarter, talk a little bit about what the company is doing today that may be different to what it did 1, two years ago. You can hit a scale of the business, particularly as you're moving into markets that are maybe quite a bit different from the developed markets that you've scaled already.","Wilmot Hastings","It's a lot more similar than it is different. We're continuing to invest in content, marketing, product, all of the things we've been doing. There's certainly some secular shift towards Internet viewing. And then we're seeing just the breadth of content that we've got going is really remarkable. And maybe, Ted, you want to talk about some of the local shows that we've been doing around the world that our U.S. investor base may know less of.","Theodore Sarandos","Yes. We've been able to launch original series in local language with local producers all over the world who've shot in 17 different countries original programming to date, and we expect that to continue to grow. And it's content that is for the country or for the region, but we've actually found great global success. This quarter, we have a new season of 3% coming up, by way of example, which is a Brazilian sci-fi show that really scored well around the world for us, and people are super excited about the new season even though we've made it in Portuguese for Brazil, and maybe one of the first examples of local-language Brazilian television working around the world. So it's -- we're really thrilled to be part of that.","Benjamin Swinburne","And Reed, how might the go-to-market strategy look in a market like India or some of these emerging markets where you might partner earlier in the life cycle of Netflix than, say, what we've seen in other markets where, you look at the U.S., you're now really working with Comcast quite a bit but you've scaled this market. Could you move towards a distribution model with partners faster in emerging markets? And what does that mean, maybe for David, financially for the numbers we look at?","Wilmot Hastings","Greg, I'll let you take that.","Gregory Peters","Sure. Our partnering strategy, I'd say, is on an evolving trajectory across all the markets that we serve in. And it started with rich history with television manufacturers, CE manufacturers where we've integrated on their products, and that's been hugely successful for us. But a new wave that you've started to see over the last several years is starting to partner up now with operators, sort of MVPDs, Internet service providers, mobile operators, and we've evolved those partnerships. And based on what we've seen with these new bundle models that we referred to with both Comcast and Sky announcing in the last quarter, we've seen the economics of those, if you take in the retention, the acquisition characteristics to be very, very beneficial. And we love the fact that we can work with these partners to access whole new groups of consumers, make it easy for them to find out about Netflix, to sign up and have a great way to access the service and watch more and more. So you'll see us leverage that sort of evolving strategy not only in the markets that we've been in for many years, but also in these new markets. But it's a consistent shift across all of our markets.","David Wells","And then, Ben, financially or economically for Netflix, we wrote in the letter about international ASP prospectively that might actually start occurring, where this is affecting where we're adding subscribers on a net revenue basis. I would say that's all about perspective growth forward. To date, Netflix has always -- outside of gift cards, has added always on a gross revenue basis. And I would say, a technical point for investors just around GAAP revenue accounting, is we're always in the principal position versus the agent position. But for some of these deals prospectively going forward where there's not a price visible to the consumer discreetly on Netflix and it meets a couple of other conditions, we may book these on a net revenue basis. But they're very immaterial today. If they grow, we'll call these out for you going forward.","Spencer Wang","And maybe, Ben, if I could just add on that front. In terms of the underlying economics, they're pretty consistent with our past partnerships. And obviously, what David is talking about is really more of a financial presentation difference. So from an operating income perspective, it's really quite similar, the impact.","Benjamin Swinburne","Yes. What about taking a more aggressive approach in emerging markets with lower price points, either on a retail level or with wholesale partners? If you think about the mobile opportunity in a market like India, again, it's a lot larger than perhaps the pay-TV TAMs. So if you think about attacking that market differently from a pricing and distribution perspective. And then, for Greg, what do you do from a product perspective to make sure mobile is a place that Netflix can really thrive on?","Wilmot Hastings","On pricing, we've been very happy with the results on our INR 500 to INR 800 in India, our pricing in the different countries. So no near-term plans. Of course, we are always trying to learn more over time. And Greg, over to you on mobile.","Gregory Peters","Yes, and then we definitely want to have a mobile experience which allows us to access more of that market and access a group of consumers who basically only want to have their relationship with Netflix on a mobile device. And so whether that is making sure that our apps are lightweight enough so they load really quickly and have a great experience there, to making sure that our encoding is very, very efficient, so that even if you have a less-than-great network connection, you can still get a really incredible video experience on that mobile phone. And it's something that we have been able to drive down to, in my mind, remarkable efficiency where you can stream incredible video quality on even very, very suboptimal network connections. But ultimately, even -- we want to do things like the download capability that we launched, where if you have no connection or it's a spotty connection or you just want to save your data plan, save that -- those -- that data bits for something else, we allow you to download some shows and enjoy that even when you're offline. And I think it's a great example of, we're investing in a feature which is used differentially more in these emerging markets that you've mentioned, but it also fits our global product model, where our members around the world are getting a benefit, whether that's hopping on the plane or in other various ways.","Benjamin Swinburne","And what's next, Greg, on the top product pipeline that we should be excited about?","Gregory Peters","There's a bunch of different stuff that we're working on, but maybe a few to call out. One is -- relatively new area for investment for us is building technology to support our content side. So the programming choices that we make, how we can produce content efficiently. And obviously, as that amount grows and grows and grows, that's a super high leverage point for us to bring and relatively, I think, a greenfield opportunity for us to bring technology to influence those outcomes even more. But then we bring this amazing library of content. And what we think almost every day about is, how do we do an even better job innovating so that we can bring our members the perfect piece of content to watch whenever they access Netflix? And so you're going to see us do a lot more to innovate around that. How do we launch new shows? How do we make them accessible to our members around the world, whatever language they're speaking, whatever territory they're in? And we're excited about all of those components.","David Wells","And Ben, before you go. Greg, you'd say the third area that is related to some of the G&A growth that investors see is our investments in studios as well, Ben. So it's -- we're saying, calling out that we're also investing on the technical side in our studio buildout.","Benjamin Swinburne","Let me come back to the quarter and the sort of financial commentary in the letter. David, for you, you've taken up the OI guidance a little bit for the year. Maybe you could just talk about what's changed in the budget or -- and what you're thinking about presenting to us relative to where we were, say, in January.","David Wells","Well, really, what's changed is we've outperformed the business in a way that we didn't predict. So if you look at sort of our outperformance over the last 3 quarters, the business has grown faster than we've expected. We're able to redeploy that and reinvest some of that in content, but there's a long lead time to that and, to some degree, some of that goes into marketing of that associated content. But I think investors are benefiting from just the overall growth of the business. We're able to redeploy some of that towards it, and some of it, it just shows up in higher operating margin. So I think we posted 12%, and 12%, and we've got a lot of content and marketing sort of back-end-loaded to this second half of this year, but it's somewhat the acknowledgment that the business is growing so well.","Benjamin Swinburne","Marketing in the back half of the year, or back-half weighting, I guess a better way to put it, is that just a function of the timing of content? Why is marketing particularly back-end-weighted?","David Wells","It's mostly just the timing of content. So we've got a lot of great releases that I'm sure Ted can talk about coming up in Q3 and Q4.","Benjamin Swinburne","Yes, let's move to Ted, then. Talk about what is ahead of you from a content perspective that you think we should be focused on. And also, I'd love to hear how you think sort of the news category or news-like programming may be impacting either the business today or your strategy going forward, because it just seems like you guys are actually spending a little more time thinking about and executing on some of those type programs.","Theodore Sarandos","Well, as you know, we've been pretty successful with documentary -- feature-length documentaries, both with great (inaudible) audiences. But our move into news has been misreported for -- over and over again, and we're not looking to expand into news beyond the work that we're doing in short-form and long-form feature documentary. The upcoming things that I think are particularly exciting in the quarter, we have a new season of 13 Reasons Why coming out this quarter. The first season of 13 Reasons Why was one of the most watched television shows of the year last year around the world, so we're really thrilled about that. And new season -- returning seasons of our hits like Luke Cage and GLOW, Dear White People, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. We have a great comedy feature film coming up with Adam Sandler and Chris Rock, called The Week Of. And we've already started this quarter with new seasons of Santa Clarita Diet, Series of Unfortunate Events and a lot of real fan favorites. And then we've got 3%, which I mentioned earlier from Brazil, for a new season, but also a brand-new, original series from Denmark, called The Rain, that we think is going to play really well all over the world.","Benjamin Swinburne","And Ted, there's been some discussion about Netflix and the Obamas working together on a product that maybe is not real live news, [possibly] topical. I look at the Letterman programming also as an example of stuff that's sort of moving in that direction. Do you see that playing a bigger role in the content slate over time?","Theodore Sarandos","The topical interview shows like that are -- absolutely, but mostly, you keep in mind that they're entertainment. Those are a form of entertainment. David Letterman is a great talk show host, not a newscaster. So we'll definitely do more of that. And I can't comment on the Obamas or any other deals that would be in various states of negotiations right now.","Benjamin Swinburne","Okay. I've got to ask you also about some of the controversy on the film festival side. You've been pretty outspoken as it relates to the Cannes situation. Can you talk about where this is all headed? Do you think it impacts Netflix's ability to attract talent, source, film, content, given there seems to be some industry pushback around the lack of theatrical releases in awards?","Theodore Sarandos","Well, we've addressed Cannes in the letter, so that kind of speaks for itself. And I'd say, generally, we are -- we released 33 films in theaters last year, just we released them day in day with Netflix. And I think it's be -- become more and more accepted and -- as part of the distribution norm. And defining distribution by what room you see it in is not the business we want to be in. We want to be about making great films that people love.","Benjamin Swinburne","So no thought about wider releases in order to make sure that your talent gets a shot at an -- awards that might be important to them?","Theodore Sarandos","Well, keep in mind we had five projects nominated for the Oscars last year. We all released in this model, so.","Benjamin Swinburne","Okay. David, back to you, just coming back to the financials. I think the cash burn in the first quarter was, what, maybe $250 million, something along those lines. You're still guiding to $3 billion to $4 billion. Is that something that you still think is the right range? Could you come in at the lower end of that?","David Wells","Of course, we could. We're not projecting that we are, and I think it is related to the back-end content loading that we just talked about. So cash was modest in terms of relative to the content in Q1, but we anticipate the timing to be a little heavier in the back end, and that shows you -- or points to the range still being $3 billion to $3.5 billion to $4 billion.","Benjamin Swinburne","Okay. And on the content obligations front, or contractual obligation, I think it was 17, I believe, nine at the end of the quarter. So we are seeing a little bit of a second derivative slowdown there. As you move towards more original as a percentage of the total spend, that number, I believe, should start to plateau, maybe even decline. Are we there yet? Is that what we're starting to see in the numbers when you look at that obligations off balance sheet liability?","David Wells","Well, I think most people, Ben, I think, want to incorporate the component that we're shifting our mix to more produced assets or [owned] assets for Netflix. I look at 2 components -- or 2 easily externally verifiable components. One is that streaming content obligation, but the other is the film assets, the produced asset value on our balance sheet. And so even though -- even taking both into account on a per-member basis, what you saw is a lower per-member year-over-year. And I think that you are starting to see some of the second derivative take hold, but I don't want to hold us to that. It's not like we aim the business towards that or we try to grow the business towards that.","Spencer Wang","And just to add, Ben, to narrowly answer your question. The shift to self-produced will likely result in slower growth in the total obligations. However, there are components of self-produced content that also impact the content obligations [like] participation.","Theodore Sarandos","Multiple-season commitments in [inaudible], yes.","Spencer Wang","Sure.","David Wells","It's a technical point, Ben. I would just annotate Spencer, meaning that those are modest relative to the whole and some of the other bigger components. But that's right.","Benjamin Swinburne","Makes sense. Reed, any updates on your thinking on the China opportunity? I know you have a partner there, but that market is evolving rapidly. It's quite a dynamic market. Have you thought about shifting strategies at all in that -- in China?","Wilmot Hastings","You mean, now that IT is public, we should enter late? No. We're very comfortable with our China strategy of licensing our shows in the way HBO does, and so that's the strategy.","Benjamin Swinburne","Okay. Makes sense. Coming back to the market like the U.S., just to take it as an example, the market's pretty far along the OTT path, to some extent. Roku's got 5000 channels on the platform. OTT is not new, Internet TV is not new here. Reed, do you have a view on sort of how many OTT services or television services these consumers are going to have as this spot business starts to mature? Do you think we have this -- sort of the equivalent of a fully distributed Internet TV network long term, the way we've had in the pay-TV model? Or do you think fragmentation and choice will lead to a much more sort of fragmented marketplace?","Wilmot Hastings","Well, the great thing now is it's easier to create a television network called an app, and I think they'll be as -- think of all apps on your phone will have some form of video, or most apps will. And so you just see a very wide spread of entertainment options, some of which are movies and TV shows, some are more interactive. And all of that mobile phone energy will spread to the television with operating systems like Rokus. So I think you'll see a very long tail. And of course, we want to be one of the apps that nearly everybody has on their home screen, whether that's on the phone or on the television. But again, if you look at the mobile phone ecosystem, it's very rich, and we see television getting close to that.","Benjamin Swinburne","And what happens to engagement over the longer term in that scenario? Because what we saw on TV, you started with 3 large broadcast networks pre-pay-TV, and then we just sort of fragmented our way through over the next kind of 40 to 50 years. Is Netflix sort of the NBC or CBS in 2017 of those networks in 1950 before the market started to evolve? Or do you think engagement continues to grow and it consolidates around the bigger players?","Wilmot Hastings","Well, it's all up to us and execution. You're right that there are so many competitors, especially around the world, some of which are really focused on a particular culture. Others are, like Sky or in many different cultures. So the consumer has a lot of entertainment options. And then whether our share of that grows or shrinks is really up to, do we produce great content, market it well, serve it up beautifully? And if we do that really well, if we earn more of consumers' time, then we continue to grow. And if we get lazy or slow, we'll be run over, just like anybody else.","Benjamin Swinburne","So what is the biggest challenge ahead for the company, Reed? I think you look at the stock, up 60% year-to-date, and I'm sure and then some as we speak, there's probably a view out there that you guys have got it all figured out. What -- how do you keep the organization from getting complacent, staying motivated, and maybe throwing over to Ted, for managing the size of the output?","Wilmot Hastings","We're a fraction of the hours of viewing of YouTube. We're a fraction of the hours of viewing of linear TV. We've got some great momentum, and we're very excited about that, but we have a long way to go in terms of earning all of the viewing that we want to.","Theodore Sarandos","Yes. And I think, in terms of scaling the original production and the licensing of content around the world, it's mostly about picking great people, giving them a great place to work, trusting their -- trusting them and empowering them to continue to make great choices, which we've really been focused on, both producing original content in the U.S. and in, like I've mentioned earlier, 17 countries around the world. And just figuring out what people like, and really, at the end of the day, I think the winners will be those who pick up their shows that people can't live without, and they become associated with that kind of intense fandom that we can keep bringing to them day in and day out.","Benjamin Swinburne","And then, Greg, when you look at the $1.3 billion or so in tech and dev book spend that you guys have this year, where is that money going from a priority perspective to make the product the best it can be for members around the world?","Gregory Peters","Again, as I mentioned before, we're looking at it from a global product perspective. So we think that there's significant leverage that we get by trying to provide one solution against what we see as a pretty consistent set of consumer needs around the world. Now we're obviously trying to be mindful to these different use cases, how consumers in different markets react to our product, and learn things like downloads that we say, how there's a specific need in those markets but they prompt, in many cases, a general solution that we, again, get that high leverage. So we're really looking at the opportunity globally. The world is a place to learn, to understand from consumers, listen to them, but then react in a way that's scalable.","Benjamin Swinburne","Maybe going over to Spencer. There's been a lot of press reports, anyway, about potential M&A, variety of areas and studio assets, I think, over in Europe, Outdoor's assets here in the States. I'm sure you can't comment specifically, but it does seem like Netflix may be more acquisitive looking forward than it's been in the past. Can you just talk about your philosophy on M&A and what might make sense, what might not, as you guys think about growing the company?","Spencer Wang","Sure. So if we look at the path, that bar is quite low since we've done very few transactions. We've only done one in our 20-year history. So based on that track record, I think the takeaway for investors is that we have a strong bias to build over buy. That being said, we do see M&A as a perfectly fine tool for us to help find interesting assets to help grow the business. So from our perspective, we continue to be on the lookout for new IP or other related assets that can help improve the service and help us grow faster.","Theodore Sarandos","Right. And Spencer, I'd just add by way of example, that the Millarworld acquisition, we're already in production on our first production with Umbrella Academy and we just released our first comic book. So in terms of using M&A to acquire a meaningful IP, this could be a very useful tool.","Benjamin Swinburne","Maybe sticking with you, Ted, can you talk a little bit about the market for licensed product, and whether as Disney and others move closer to bringing their own product to market, the supply is drying up or you're thinking differently about acquiring third-party content?","Theodore Sarandos","Well, you've seen us move pretty aggressively into our own original programming, which means we're doing less licensing in that same way. It's -- we're moving both dollars up as -- in absolute, but as a percentage of our investment, we're investing more and more in original. And that's both a product of it's been working for us, it's been helping us grow the business, grow view hours, but also the ecosystem that produces that content that we're buying in second windows and sometimes third windows isn't producing content at the level of demand and quality that it had been over the years. So the things that we're engaged in bidding on are more selective, and there's less of them. So we are -- when there's -- when something shows up, though, that is great, like The People v. O.J., by way of example, we're in the mix and still licensing a lot of that content and certainly license a lot of great movies around the world and television content from around the world for the -- our other territories. You should expect us to be moving more and more into license and produced original programming versus fishing in the secondary market.","Benjamin Swinburne","And I think you guys just renewed or ordered a new season of Jessica Jones from Marvel. Is there any change in how you think about continuing the sourced content on the Marvel side, given all the changes that are happening and their strategy at Disney?","Theodore Sarandos","No. We're thrilled with The Defenders universe and Jessica and, I said we have Luke Cage coming up this quarter for a new season. And those will continue as long as we want to keep making them, and it could be a quite wonderfully expanding universe and we would try not to let the business models get in the way of great -- making great programming for our customers.","Benjamin Swinburne","Any impact from Hulu, which has been more and more aggressive acquiring prior-season content? I don't know if you're getting a look at that stuff or if it's just being kind of kept away from you for maybe obvious reasons?","Theodore Sarandos","No, I mean, we've been in the mix on some of them. Not many, but the ones that -- where there has been -- they've been in the mix, too, and I think that's closer to what they're doing on their business model, going after the broadcast with a select few originals, where we've gone much more the other way.","Benjamin Swinburne","Yes. And for you, and also for David, you guys are continuing to push into local originals. I think you had 30 on this slate for this year, I believe, local originals. Talk about where you source all that from locally. Is it hard to find local talent to develop that content? And from an efficiency perspective, for you and\/or David, how do you think about the financial returns of those shows which are obviously not -- typically not an English native?","Theodore Sarandos","What's been really great is the things that we'll -- we can bring our technology know-how to bring a great story from anywhere in the world to the rest of the world. And using our ability to subtitle and dub, and getting better and better at doing that quickly and accurately and artfully, has -- can make a very local show at least pan-regional and, at best, global. And we've seen that, like I mentioned, with 3% earlier. We just saw it with Dark from Germany, which played really well. I mean, those numbers -- those U.S. numbers for us on those foreign-language shows would be big hits on cable with those numbers in the U.S. We've been particularly pleased to see a show like Casa De Papel or Money Heist, as those were released in the U.S., so successful for us all around the word that we've bought the series IP, and we'll be producing sequels and spinoffs of Casa De Papel as original content for years to come. So it's -- the scale on it has been, if it connects in the country, that's what it's built for it. And if it gets viewing outside of the country, that's great. And if it's a global viewing, like we've seen with Dark and 3% recently and Chicas del Cable from Spain, we're thrilled and it scales wonderfully.","Wilmot Hastings","And Ben, we're also investing to support that work on the dubbing and subtitling quality. So investors should check out The Rain, which is our Swedish, Danish film coming out -- sorry, series coming out in a few weeks, and just to look at the quality of what the dubbing could be, because we're really making a big investment there that we think will pay off in approachability of all these titles from the world to the world.","Theodore Sarandos","Yes, and I think, too, if you see it, one of the nice things is we're not trading off -- we're not watering down the local aspect of the show at all to make it travel. These are local storytellers telling stories for local audiences that are so good, they travel globally. So there's nothing less German about Dark, and there's nothing less Danish about Rain. And Brazil, like I said, in Portuguese, with a full Brazilian cast. And these are, you mentioned earlier, is not hard to find. I mean, there's incredible storytellers and producers around the world that just have not had access to a global audience before, and we've been able to find them pretty effectively.","David Wells","So Ben, just to connect on that last one for financially. Like just what Ted and Reed have teed up is, we're drafting off a world that's becoming more global and more connected. And so we're able to tell stories in non-English from local storytellers that are gripping for audiences outside their local market. And in many ways, we're elevating the storytelling which translates to increased cost but still, relative to a TV production in the U.S. or some other expensive developed market, it's quite a -- it's a fraction of the cost. And so it doesn't necessarily translate that more local television for Netflix equal lower margin for Netflix. We've made that point a couple of times, but I'll make it again in the sense that we're really excited about the transportability of some of this content because it's really opening up new stories across the world and in a way that doesn't sacrifice margin.","Benjamin Swinburne","And maybe connecting those two points again. Ted, if the local original does connect locally, is popular locally, is that a fairly high correlation that it's going to connect globally?","Theodore Sarandos","Not particularly, not particularly. It's interesting some shows, because they're just -- they're hyper-local in the topic that don't travel but do incredibly well, 40%, 50% penetration in a market that don't particularly travel. But for the most part, what we found is, on the large-scale production shows, that they do travel quite well.","Benjamin Swinburne","David, how are you thinking about marketing versus content spend in terms of the incremental dollar? You guys have clearly pivoted -- not pivoted, that's not right, but you've leaned in to the marketing budget this year. There's a phrase in the letter, density of viewing, which I think is new for you. What does that mean and how are you thinking about marketing -- investing behind your marketing ahead -- relative to your content spend over the next couple of years?","David Wells","Well, I think that, in relation to density, I'll let Reed speak to it because I think it equates to public joy, but it's -- may be a little bit more of a precise term, in terms of you don't need a title that 75% of the world is watching. You may love a title that 75% of a particular population of people is watching, and that speaks to density. But you're correct. We have definitely leaned more into marketing, and I think some of it is very sort of common sense, in the sense of, as we create more and more of these titles that no one has heard of, we're going to need to lean a little bit more on promotion, and the website can't do it all. So I think you're seeing some of that in terms of a nod towards maybe increasing that ratio of marketing spend to content spend. We don't know where the perfect point is, in that we're a company that leans on experimentation. We try things. We turn them over, and then we'll increase or decrease based on the results as we see going forward, and I think that's the approach that you should expect from us.","Benjamin Swinburne","Does that lead maybe to a slower growth in content spend? Because if you're throwing a lot of marketing, there's only so much that you could really support for a given population. I would assume we all have this idea of a somewhat limited attention span.","David Wells","Well, you're definitely seeing revenue grow faster than content already, and that's where operating margin is coming from. I can't say for sure where -- does it mean that marketing will go faster than content or content faster than marketing? I'm not sure. I think we're trying to feel our way along to the right point going forward. But I don't know if, Ted or Reed, if you have a sort of annotation on that or not.","Wilmot Hastings","We have big plans for content growth, and you should expect that to continue. We're also, as David said, trying to learn, hey, if we put in more marketing versus less in different countries, what are the results? And so that's part of what you're seeing is this realization, this new opening, and how it increases the value and the viewing of our new original franchises.","Benjamin Swinburne","And David, do you have a view -- I mean, now that your -- the business has over 100 million members, the -- your contribution profit positive internationally and in the U.S., we already talked about marketing, do you have a view as to where long-term margins shake out for this business as you think about a \"steady state\"?","David Wells","Well, I think we're -- you asked a question earlier about our only opportunities being in Asia. That presupposes and sort of puts in the bag all this other growth in Latin America and Europe that, I can -- I could speak confidently on behalf of the team, that we don't take for granted. So we have a lot of opportunity and growth still in our core markets. The markets that we've been in for 5, 6, 7 years. I would say we're targeting 10 to 11 this year. We've been putting on a pace of about 300 basis points. It's hard to know for sure where that goes. It really depends on the scale of the business that we are in 5 or 10 years. We think we're after a big opportunity, and the bigger the business we are, the higher that margin could be. We're certainly not down. You've heard me say in the past that we're not bound by international growth being at a lower margin. It's somewhat dependent on the competition within that territory. It's somewhat dependent on the size and scale of the business as we grow, and we think we've got a big market opportunity. So I would leave it there.","Benjamin Swinburne","Makes sense. And Reed, how do you think about ASP growth over time? You guys have implemented a number of, what I would call, successful price adjustments or price increases. Is the way to think about ASP growth going forward sort of what we've seen over the last several years?","Wilmot Hastings","Well, it really depends on the offering, the quality of our offering relative to others. So you have to earn it first by doing spectacular content that everybody wants to see. But if you do that, you can get people to pay a little bit more because then we're able to invest more and further improve. But we always approach it on a \"have we earned more viewing from people\" basis first rather than a price-first basis.","Benjamin Swinburne","The letter talks about the strength in the quarter coming from, I think, higher additions or gross adds. So maybe, David, just coming back to the business on churn, is there an opportunity you can hit to work churn lower from here? Or do you think you guys have hit, at least in some of your older markets, a retention level that's probably going to be tough to materially change?","David Wells","Well, it's hard. Again, we've made this point before, but the noise in terms of who comes in and who stays and all that, we're mostly focused on having a member that we -- that pays us or feels good about paying us over time. We break it out in order to give some color commentary. I would say, in these established markets, we're getting pretty close to asymptotic churn. We think we've got mild improvements, but we're so big that even a 10 or 20 basis point improvement can be meaningful. In the newer markets, it's really about increasing engagement because we do feel like that there is a tight relationship between engagement and churn up to a certain point, obviously with diminishing marginal return, but we're still young enough in many of the newer markets that we're focused on that and growing that engagement to improve retention.","Spencer Wang","Ben, I think we have about time for one last question.","Benjamin Swinburne","Sure. I didn't want to let this end, Reed, without going back to you. And given what's happened over the last couple of months in the tech industry, just get a sense from you and how you think -- what you think the implications are for Netflix, if any, from all of the focus by regulators, by consumers on data, privacy, the use of data to drive your business, GDPR. What does this all mean for Netflix? If anything are you making any changes?","Wilmot Hastings","Well, I'm very glad that we built the business not to be ad-supported but to be subscription. We're very different from the ad-supported businesses, and we've always been very big on protecting all of our members' viewing. We don't sell advertising. So I think we're substantially inoculated from the other issues that are happening in the industry, and that's great. And then, second, I'd point out that we'll spend over $10 billion on content and marketing and $1.3 billion on tech. So just objectively, we're much more of a media company in that way than pure tech. Now of course, we want to be great at both, but again, we're really pretty different from the pure tech companies.","Benjamin Swinburne","Great. Well thank you, everybody.","Wilmot Hastings","Great. Thanks, Ben. Thanks to all our investors."],"15786":["Netflix, Inc.

I\u2019m Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are CEO, Reed Hastings; our new CFO, Spence Neumann; Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; and our Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters. Our interviewer this quarter is Eric Sheridan from UBS. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary.","With that, let me turn it over to you, Eric, for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Eric Sheridan","Thanks so much Spencer. And since, Spence, you are new to the Netflix earnings call, I\u2019m going to turn the first question over to you. First, congratulations on the role as the new CFO of Netflix. Maybe give us your perception of why the role intrigued you in terms of moving to Netflix? What your first perceptions are? And some of the things you plan on making a focus for your tenure as the CFO at Netflix?","Spence Neumann","Sure. Thanks, Eric. Well first, I\u2019m super excited to be here. A part of what attracted me is just what Netflix is trying to build. I\u2019ve always been attracted to the high ended product quality and ambition, and Netflix has all of that and what we\u2019re creating. First impressions this is day nine. So, I haven\u2019t been here for long. I\u2019m trying to really immerse myself in the business to a lot of listening and learning, really planning to do that for probably the first 60 days or so for sure.","And I\u2019ve already been struck by first just the level of integration and collaboration across this company, all aspects of the company, combined with speed of decision-making and moving forward has been really unique to see. So, also I\u2019ve been really impressed with just the team, the quality of the team, not just my direct team, but across the board again, and their passion and commitment to continue to innovate and improve, improving the content offering, elevating the level of the \u2013 and quality of service we deliver to our members and not just our existing members, but our new members and really driving that positive flywheel for our members and ultimately for our business.","So, it\u2019s really been great. I\u2019ve got a lot to learn. I want to thank everyone, all of the folks around the company for being patient and helping me with my onboarding. And really one just a quick special shout out to David Wells. He has been unbelievably gracious with his time, with his insights. And I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll always be at Netflix, but I hope for a long time to come, he\u2019ll be a friend, a colleague and a resource for me.","Eric Sheridan","Great. Maybe since we are at the end of one year and the beginning of another, I\u2019d love to turn to Reed and maybe, Reed, ask you to set the table. What were the big learnings of 2018? What were the things that that you felt the company really attacked in the marketplace in 2018? And as you look out to 2019 and beyond, what are those big opportunities? What are those big challenges? What are you trying to focus the entire management team around in terms of executing against the plan looking forward for Netflix?","Reed Hastings","For 20 years, we\u2019ve been trying to please our members and it\u2019s really the same focus year-after-year. We\u2019ve got all these ways to try to figure out, which shows work best, which product features work best, we\u2019re a learning organization and it\u2019s the same virtuous cycle, improve the service for our members. We grow. That gives us more money to invest. So, it\u2019s the same things we\u2019ve always been doing at just greater scale.","Eric Sheridan","Fair enough. Obviously, I think almost every conversation each quarter starts with performance of the business. We saw strong subscribers in the quarter, strong comments about the way subscribers should continue to start the year in 2019. Throwing and open to the broader team maybe starting with Reed, but what did you see on the subscriber landscape as you look down to what \u2013 the way the business performed in Q4, and what kind of confidence that\u2019s giving you in the growth opportunities looking out to early 2019?","Reed Hastings","When you look at the chart we put in our earnings letter, which has the weekly growth rate, you can just see how steady it is. And we\u2019re just continuing to work away on all the things that we\u2019ve always done. And what\u2019s wonderful is the Internet entertainment market is just growing, so we\u2019re continuing to fulfill a need that we see.","Spence Neumann ","And Eric\u2026","Reed Hastings","Do you want add anything?","Spence Neumann ","And Eric, if I could just add a little bit more color to Reed\u2019s comments. I would say the other facet I would highlight is that the strength in membership growth was really broad based geographically. So, really thrilled with the progress we\u2019re seeing in the international segment. And again, that\u2019s not one \u2013 any one single territory or any one single country, but really broad based and I think that reflects the global nature of the secular drivers that we have, which is adoption of broadband globally and the adoption of on-demand entertainment globally.","Eric Sheridan","And maybe following up on that is there anything, and maybe this is for a combination of Reed and Ted, was there anything on the local language front? I know that is a piece that we\u2019ve talked about on prior earnings videos about how local language content is driving adoption of the product on a global scale. Anything to call out there you saw in the quarter that should portend well for 2019?","Ted Sarandos ","Well, I\u2019d say one thing, this quarter has been incredibly exciting and the things that are playing out and you see the numbers of \u2013you see a big number like Bird Box and You, these shows are playing incredibly globally. So, it\u2019s an interesting thing when you can tap into the global zeitgeist, which is something, which gets me very excited about the potential scale of the content business when the world is excited about something.","And then on the local language side, it shows like Elite that can play very, very strong in their home country, like in Spain, but also play \u2013 play really well throughout the Spanish speaking world and ultimately through the entire world. And it\u2019s our ability to create hits and create movie stars and TV stars from anywhere in the world for the rest of the world is something that we\u2019ve really been working hard at it and have been incredibly enthused by the results in Q4 and how it\u2019s looking in Q1.","Eric Sheridan","Maybe going back to something that\u2019s in the release that was also talked about in the press earlier this week that you\u2019re going to be raising price in Q1 in the U.S. market. Always curious what goes into the thought process around raising price on the service, how confident you are that customers are ready to absorb a higher price for the service when you look out? So, maybe, Reed, I could start with your perspective on how you think about pricing the product in the marketplace and what it means for subscriber momentum going forward?","Reed Hastings","Greg, I\u2019ll punt to you.","Greg Peters","Sure. I think the model we\u2019ve got is a fairly simplistic one, where we think our job is to effectively invest the money that our subscribers give us every month, so that we can give them incredible content in a better and better product experience. And if we do that well, we create more value for our subscribers and then occasionally, we\u2019ll come to them and we\u2019ll ask for a little bit more money, so that we can actually start that next cycle of investment.","And so that\u2019s the overarching framework. And then we look at the engagement levels and a bunch of other things to try and understand what our pricing should be and generally we\u2019ve seen that those are pretty accurate and the price changes that we\u2019ve done are rolling out as expected.","Eric Sheridan","Well, I want to follow up with you Greg on this, because if you look versus a year ago, tremendous level of push on the personalization side and the service, more focus on mobile on the product side as you\u2019ve looked out over the last 12 months. Were those some of the things you saw that that allowed you to see either higher engagement, new use cases emerging along the subscriber base? What did you see in some of those product developments that that fed into maybe a pricing discussion?","Greg Peters","I would say that I wouldn\u2019t tie them so directly. I mean we\u2019re generally trying to think about every way we can make the product experience better for our members around the world and that\u2019s mobile changes, where we give them a higher quality experience. We also do things like we give them previews and the ability to sort of like do some sampling of content ahead of time to understand what\u2019s coming to the service as well as things that you mentioned like increasing. Well, we think about is more like how do we tell a story about each of the story.","So when we have a new show coming on how do we effectively communicate what we think is going to be relevant to each of our subscribers in a strong way. So, they can get excited about those shows as well. So, those dimensions and really many, many others, where we just constantly invest in, we don\u2019t really think about it, we\u2019re doing those things, so we can increase price. Within those things, we can just create more fun and excitement for our members. And if they have a great time, then we\u2019ll be able to invest more in content and making more product experience benefits.","Eric Sheridan","Maybe just one more for you, Greg, before moving on, one of the things we noticed in the quarter was Netflix moved up the app download charts with respect to mobile smartphones in the iOS world. Always been a very downloaded app on the iPad front and the tablet front and smart TVs. Was there anything you guys did in terms of either pivoting the business more towards phone in the quarter and to start 2019? Is there anything on the product side you want to call out, because it seems like a pretty pronounced change in some of the data we\u2019re trying to analyze?","Greg Peters","Yes. nothing really specific and I think it really speaks more to just the general relevance that the application has and as you see us sort of accelerate in terms of subscriber additions and more members around the worlds using the service. Those members are using it on mobile in large part as well. And so we just see an increased rate of download and that\u2019s what we think is happening there.","Eric Sheridan","Okay, Ted, following up on what Greg just said there, with the price increase going through and there has been other jurisdictions when you put price increases through and talking around similar frameworks, margins and free cash flow than you had talked about previously. I think the natural conclusion some of us have is the incremental investment dollar is going into content. So, Ted, help us to understand what is an incremental dollar that\u2019s being generated by the business going into on the content side, and how should we think about content investments in 2019 versus 2018?","Ted Sarandos","I think Reed said it right. It\u2019s more of the same, but on a continued larger scale. So the level of investment that we\u2019re doing in our original film space, it definitely changes the economics in terms of licensing films and later windows versus producing films, which is a more kind of front-loaded cash activity, but has a much better payback for us. And when you have something like Bird Box, the ability to invest in the next one is just all about \u2013 all the greater. And I think in local language content investments improved \u2013 continuing to improve the markets that are emerging for us both in the markets at scale around everyone kind of like some of the same things and other markets that are more unique content tastes like in Korea and Japan and India, where we\u2019re able to be much more fine-tuned about what we\u2019re offering those markets as well.","Greg Peters","And Eric, just to add on specifically to narrowly answer your question on content spend for 2019, we\u2019re not giving individual expense item \u2013 expense line item guidance, but I will say that it was $7.5 billion in content amortization in 2018. And I think you can obviously expect that to grow and the trajectory should be pretty similar. But the other thing to bear in mind is that we\u2019ve also committed to growing the operating margin as well in 2019 by about 300 basis points year-over-year to 13%. So, those will work together, so you\u2019ll see improved margin, but also higher content spend as well.","Reed Hastings","And then we do see that payback Eric, as Greg mentioned earlier, an increased engagement, so which again continuing the virtuous cycle, where you\u2019ve got more \u2013 the more investment you\u2019re putting in, the more people are finding content that they love and the more they have value in the service.","Eric Sheridan","Well, speaking to higher engagement, I think in reading the release, I was legitimately stunned that there was more viewership data in this release, then I\u2019d see it in the Netflix release in a while, I guess obviously, probably, a lot of content that outperformed maybe expectations, but what drove some of the new sort of qualitative and quantitative commentary in this shareholder letter around engagement and viewership around key pieces of property?","Spence Neumann","I would look at it like these are less financial metrics as they are cultural metric. So that what does it mean when 80 million households watch Bird Box? Well, culturally it means exactly the same thing as 80 million plus people buying a movie ticket to seeing it or 80 million households watching a TV show. So culturally, it\u2019s meaningfully out there. People talking about it, tweeting about it, posting about it, challenging each other, do different things, which we want people to be very careful when they do. But really what\u2019s important is that for part of your Netflix subscription, you\u2019re in the Zeitgeists, you\u2019re \u2013 you get \u2013 you\u2019re watching the programming that the rest of the world is loving at the same time. So that\u2019s a \u2013 so we gave you some numbers out to give you some sense of the scale and the scope of it. I think it\u2019s important for artists to understand \u2013 to have the audience also understand the size of the reach of their work. So that\u2019s why you\u2019ll see us ramping up a little bit more and more and giving out, sharing a little more of that information.","Reed Hastings","And then, Eric, we also included this analysis of the total TV entertainment market in the United States. Just to point out how large a market that is about a billion hours a day enjoying television, against gaming platforms, linear, DVD, Netflix, everything. And we\u2019re running about 10% of that. So it\u2019s just a very large and fragmented market. There is an incredible set of broad uses. And we did it on television, because television is 100% entertainment time, whereas mobile phones and laptops are some percent entertainment and some percent work and communication activities. So that \u2013 that\u2019s just \u2013 it sets a broad contest. In other nations, we\u2019re a smaller percentage of the total TV viewing, because we\u2019re less penetrated, but 10% is a great mark for us.","Greg Peters","Eric, I also think it\u2019s a good data point around the fact that we are growing the entertainment business. So, the idea that it\u2019s good for the industry to know, it\u2019s good for the creative community to know, it\u2019s good for fans to know that we\u2019re \u2013 at a time when we\u2019re growing big audience films like that, the box office by way of example, the North American box office has grown in the fourth quarter. So \u2013 and in fact had some records. So I think it\u2019s a very exciting time. And we thought it\u2019d be a good idea to give you some idea of the scale of that and how to put it in context.","Reed Hastings","No doubt driven by the theatrical revisions of ROMA.","Greg Peters","Yes, yes.","Eric Sheridan","Maybe going back to the product side and Greg, when you hear about the engagement you\u2019re seeing and the content success of the platform, help us understand a little bit of how the product might evolve. I mean, I think, one of the most unique things in the quarter was the interactivity of the Black Mirror product. Would love to talk about both the product side within Netflix and then on the content creation side as Ted talks to content partners about how that interactivity is something new, interesting and might spur engagement, product development and content relationships.","Greg Peters","Yes. I think, it\u2019s a great example of us trying to take a technical capability and the flexibility of our distribution platform and trying to figure out how do we use those things to innovate on storytelling in a storytelling format. And it\u2019s super exciting to be able to do that in a way, which to your point drives more engagement. We\u2019re definitely seeing that with Black Mirror and Bandersnatch. But also sort of extends the pallet and the portfolio, the toolset that the storytellers that we\u2019re going to be working with in the years to come have to tell their stories in the most compelling way. So, we\u2019ve been super excited about it. And you should anticipate we\u2019ll do more of those as we start to explore that format. And then I\u2019ll turn it over to Ted to talk about from a content perspective.","Ted Sarandos","Yes. I would just say there\u2019s been a few false starts on interactive storytelling in the last couple of decades. And I would tell you that this one has got storyteller salivating about the possibilities. So we\u2019ve been talking to a lot of folks about it and we\u2019re trying to figure it out too meaning is it novel, does it fit so perfectly in the Black Mirror world that it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it isn\u2019t a great indicator for how to do it, but we\u2019ve got a hunch that it works across all kinds of storytelling and some of the greatest storytellers in the world are excited to dig into it. To give you some sense that\u2019s over five hours of content that\u2019s produced for that episode for people to choose their own paths, and there\u2019s countless ways that they could go and end up with. And that is an incredible challenge and of usually exciting thing that differentiates Netflix for creators.","Greg Peters","And I think in that challenge is also an opportunity, right. It\u2019s an opportunity to bring technology to bear, to create a toolset for creators to make that process easier and more effective.","Ted Sarandos","Right.","Reed Hastings","Eric, there is one piece of data that didn\u2019t make the release and that\u2019s what percentage of people chose Frosties versus Sugar Puffs. The answer is 73% for Frosties.","Greg Peters","That\u2019s a level of data transparency. We have not seen our content yet\u2026","Ted Sarandos","It was critical data point of the quarter.","Eric Sheridan","Completely anecdotal, but the Sheridan House picked Frosties multiple times. So we fed into those numbers, my wife and I. Let\u2019s bring it all together. Now that we\u2019ve talked a little bit about a price increase subscriber trends, how money gets reinvested back into content. Spence, I\u2019d love to turn to you when say, when you think about the free cash flow profile of the business, some of the commentary in the letter around improving free cash flow from 2019 and beyond, how do you think about funding the business, the approach the business has always taken to the capital markets? Any perspective you have that you think might be different than in the past? Or do you think it\u2019s going to be steady as it goes? How are you thinking about sort of the funding in the capital structure side of the equation albeit new to the role?","Spence Neumann","Sure. So, well, first, we feel great about our content investment. It really is investment that is as even as you \u2013 as we talked about those viewing numbers and characteristics that speaks to at some degree the return on those content investments, the return on that capital. We feel really good about that as obviously the move to more owned content and production has pulled forward some of that spend relative to the former operating model or predominantly licensed model.","So that has put pressure on the cash flows of the business and cash needs of the business over the past few years, but when you saw on the letters that we \u2013 the negative cash flow in the business of roughly $3 billion in 2018, we\u2019re predicting sort of similar levels in 2019 and then to meaningfully improve that trajectory going forward. So that comes with driving the subscribers in the business, driving the revenues, driving the \u2013 scaling the margins in the business as we\u2019ve committed to from just 4% a couple of years ago to 10% last year and committing to 13% operating margins in 2019 and beyond.","So, this is a business with characteristics that that certainly allow for very healthy operating margins going forward. You can look at almost any benchmark of a comparable type of company. And so, we feel very good about the operating leverage in the business long-term, ultimately turning that into a much more positive contributor and conversion into cash flow. And ultimately, our aspiration is to be self-funding. And we believe we will do that over time with these content investments.","In the interim, as we continue to need to access the markets, I don\u2019t foresee any change to our approach. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that we\u2019ve accessed the debt markets to do that and we\u2019ll continue to do so. We think that that is the optimal cost of financing and funding to-date and we\u2019ll continue to pursue that path.","Eric Sheridan","Great. too back on the price increase and the subscriber forecast for Q1, just want to make sure there is a clarification point. Number one, in the shareholder letter, you talked about the price increase going into effect during Q1 and Q2, if I remember correctly, the last time there was a price increase, it went into effect over a 12-month period. Maybe just to understand a little bit, what the mechanics are of the price increase, so people can understand some of the decision process behind that, maybe how it flows through the numbers in the first half of 2019?","Reed Hastings","Sure. I can take that Eric. So, with respect to the price changes, in the U.S., the new pricing goes into effect for new members, existing members will be phased in over the next several months. So, you\u2019ll see that impact over the course of the year and what that means is that will obviously impact the rate of net addition growth in the first half of the year. But commensurately, you also see ASP domestically improve over the course of the year and that\u2019s what we think will drive an acceleration in revenue growth over the course of 2019. And that\u2019s what also we believe drive operating margin higher sequentially over the course of the year to enable us to hit that 13% target for the full year.","Eric Sheridan","Maybe one followup that that came through from investors just thinking through the price increases, it was reported in \u2013 or speculated in the press over the last couple of days was how it might inform forward subscriber guidance, it looks like you\u2019re talking about U.S. paid net additions at a pretty similar level in Q1 versus Q4 and yet you are putting a price increase in place. The last time you did that, there was a fair bit of conservatism in the forward guide. How should we reconcile maybe the framework for guidance versus the price increase going into the marketplace? How should investors interpret that?","Reed Hastings","Sure, Eric. I would say there\u2019s no change in terms of the guidance philosophy. And as we write every quarter, our approach is to strive for accuracy and our guidance forecast. And to do that, we take into account all the known variables that we\u2019re aware of when we set guidance. So, really it is our best guess and we\u2019re not by design trying to be overly conservative or overly aggressive, and we\u2019re really trying to be accurate with it. So that\u2019s the color I provide you with respect to that question.","Eric Sheridan","Great. 2018, which we talked about in the last interview and it has been a topic through the year was the year you framed as a company of testing and learning on the marketing front, possibly pivoting away from fewer subscriber acquisition, pivoting more towards spending money on the marketing side against your brand, individual pieces of content. What did you, as a company, learned this year as you went through that process about the way to allocate marketing dollars on a global scale to arrive at the most optimum outcome of subscriber additions, promoting brand, promoting content, driving engagement, and how should we apply those lessons as we think out to the way marketing might be a sort of trajectory through 2019 and beyond?","Reed Hastings","Almost all of our investments are promoting these incredible new titles we have like Bird Box. So that\u2019s our primary focus, at least on the paid marketing side. On the earned media side, it\u2019s broad. And then we have some straight acquisition targeted marketing that we also spend, but the bulk of it is around promoting the incredible new titles and getting them broadly launched.","Eric Sheridan","Great. And Greg maybe following up with you when not just when you think about marketing dollars, but also when you think about distributing the product broadly, I think this was a year 2018, where you struck a lot of partnerships to help on the distribution front, love to start with Greg, but love to have anyone chime in that feels they should on what some of those partnerships brought to the platform in 2018. How you think some of those partnerships are set up to aid platform awareness and distribution in 2019 and beyond, and how you think about the scalability for more of those partnerships when you look out over the next couple of years?","Greg Peters","Sure. And I think some has been here for a decade plus. it\u2019s sort of pulling that long thread of increasingly using partners in different ways to promote the service and to make it easier for members and members to be to sign up. So, we\u2019ve been doing partners for a long, long time. It\u2019s sort of been this March from integration on devices and just makes that a point to engage with the service to doing things like billing, on behalf of or we do billing integration. And now the latest sort of iteration that we\u2019re working with is, is bundling model, right. And so we\u2019re early on in that process, but I would say we\u2019re quite excited by the results that we\u2019re seeing. And I think mostly, it\u2019s because we believe it allows us to access a segment of consumers, who are big entertainment fans, but maybe, they\u2019re not as sort of technology forward or early adopters.","And so, they haven\u2019t signed up with us directly. And so by putting Netflix on a set-top box, which are using to access a bunch of other video content and by including the Netflix subscription in a package of either their mobile subscription or pay-TV subscription, we can make it just super, super simple for those folks to get to know Netflix and to enjoy the kind of big shows that we\u2019re seeing like Bird Box, et cetera.","So, I would anticipate we\u2019ll do more of those. We rolled out sky and free in Europe this quarter and we\u2019ve got more to come. but also worth noting that, we\u2019re going to grow that segment of the business, but it\u2019s small in terms of acquisition impact. It\u2019s nice supplemental channel, but it\u2019s smaller relative to the total organic subscriber acquisition that we have.","Reed Hastings","I could add back to your last question, Eric. Those distribution partners turned out to be great promoters of our content brands as well.","Eric Sheridan","And maybe, one followup, when you do those partnerships, has there been one avenue that\u2019s moved its needle more than another, whether it\u2019s in the home broadband space, partnering with infrastructure companies or on the multiple telephony front in promoting mobile usage and mobile engagement on the platform? Or have you\u2019ve seen roughly similar results irrespective of the type of partner?","Reed Hastings","I would say every market is different and every partner is different in terms of their goals and what they\u2019re \u2013 the message that they\u2019re communicating to their subscribers and how we can link that message with the Netflix message as well. but so nothing stands out thematically or sort of a general trend that I would say, but each one is incremental and so we look to do more of all kinds.","Eric Sheridan","Maybe going back to the shareholder letter, one phrase in the shareholder letter that Ted, I wanted to ask you about, the phrase less focused on second run programming. I think one of the big investor debates and questions around Netflix becomes what happens to licensed content that may come off the platform in 2019 and beyond. How you plan for that content coming off the platform? What it means for investments? What it means for engagement? Maybe reflect upon that statement in the shareholder letter and how it informs maybe the mix shift or the planning process for content as you look out to 2019 and beyond.","Ted Sarandos","Well, most of those licensing deals are multiyear. So, it gets \u2013 that gets caught up in our long-term content commitments. That\u2019s all part of those that content. remember our early investment in doing original content more than six years ago was betting that this would be, there would come a day when the studios and networks may opt not to license us content in favor of maybe creating their own services, which was \u2013 that\u2019s a corner that I\u2019m glad we saw around a few years ago.","And today, I\u2019d say the vast majority of the content that is watched on Netflix are our original content brands. We do license a lot of second run content and in that we have a lot of episodes. So we have shows like Grey\u2019s Anatomy or Friends, we have hundreds of episodes. It\u2019s a lot of hours of watching, but that if you stack all those, all of that viewing, sort of like a top 50 or top 25 most watched shows by seasons or by series, that\u2019s dominated primarily by our original content brands. We are still a buyer in that second run market. We both are pre-buyer, been buying it before the shows come out and sometimes an aftermarket buyer, but it really is up to the sellers whether or not they want to continue to sell.","Reed Hastings","And adding to Ted\u2019s comments, the top brands that we have, being originals like Bird Box are phenomenal and an unscripted now, it\u2019s our first category, where a majority of the viewing is a branded original, in the other categories we\u2019re climbing, not yet at a majority, but on track for it.","Ted Sarandos","And two years ago, we didn\u2019t have any original unscripted content at all. So that\u2019s how fast that that those moves can take place.","Reed Hastings","And Eric, we\u2019ve also said we\u2019re not overly dependent on any one single piece of content as well. So, the viewing is quite diverse and as\u2026","Ted Sarandos","Next, through our originals as well.","Spence Neumann","That\u2019s right. And as Ted mentioned, all of these licensed deals are staggered in sort of waterfall in over a period of time. So, there\u2019s no sort of cliff there.","Eric Sheridan","Waterfall and cliff, right?","Ted Sarandos","I am on a roll.","Spencer Neumann","Go ahead.","Eric Sheridan","Maybe following up one more piece of the content side, one question that came into me as the moderator of this quarter in a couple of different ways was how to think about ownership of content versus co-production of content, what the right mix shift of that is medium-to-longer term, what\u2019s some of the pros or cons are of the approach of either doing co-production versus outright ownership and how we should think about that developing over the next couple of years?","Reed Hastings","Well, the one thing is our main goal is to make the best content. And we\u2019ve said \u2013 we\u2019ve said in previous quarters that that is a combination of several different business models depending on who owns the IP. So, what we\u2019re going to do is make the best show and not be stuck on the business model, because the consumer really doesn\u2019t understand that or we even want to spend any time thinking about it.","So by way of example, last year, we had 140 different shows around the world that premiered on A network somewhere and on Netflix everywhere else in the world. next year, it\u2019s more to closer to 180. And these are combination of co-producing with local producers in other countries; it shows that then air on a network in that country and then premier on Netflix. But when I say co-production, I mean, we come in at the script stage, we come in at the first money stage, we\u2019re involved creatively with the production of that show.","Bodyguard is a good example of that, that we produced with ITV that the BBC premiered in the UK and that at the same time. we released it on Netflix around the world, and we produced it together at the script stage. We\u2019re involved in the production to that show and outside of the UK, it is a netflix original show and in the UK, we follow a broadcast window from the BBC. And again, we\u2019ve had a great success with the show around the world. One additional data point, we have over 23 million households have watched bodyguard in Netflix in the first four weeks and it\u2019s a good example of taking a show from anywhere in the world to the rest of the world. And we do other ones where we just are whereby territories. There use to be a tradition in television, where the network would make one show and then the \u2013 they take it to MACE \u2013 to the MACE screenings and try to sell market after market after market, that\u2019s less and less the case while we\u2019re working with producers and networks now to pre-buy or co-produce for the rest of the world. A similar evolution to the old studio film business, where the studios used to carry the international rights until they sold them and then they more frequently now go out and do international co-productions.","Spence Neumann","Eric, I think we have time for one more question please.","Eric Sheridan","Sure. And maybe turning it back to Reed, I think one of the more interesting sections in the shareholder letter, Reed, was you talked about the competitive landscape, big question, big debate. We get a lot from investors. You talked about it a lot of ways all ships rising, but talk a little bit about the landscape. What do you see out there on the landscape to attract user retention, user engagement, monetization, attract content creators, and how you think that competitive landscape will evolve and how do you think about navigating it from not only just 2019, but for the longer-term, Reed?","Reed Hastings","All ships rising as a little Pollyanna, optimistic, I think about it really is as winning time away, entertainment time from other activities. So, instead of doing Xbox or Fortnite or youTube or HBO or a long list, we want to win and provide a better experience. No advertising on demand. Incredible content. And so when you think of just the U.S. terms as an example. There\u2019s a billion hours of television content being consumed today, we\u2019re winning about 10% of it.","And so that\u2019s why like Disney, they have great content, we\u2019re excited for their launch and maybe they grow over a couple of years to 50 million hours a day, but that\u2019s out of the billion. And so we compete so broadly with all of these different providers that any one provider entering, only makes a difference on the margin. And so again, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t get so focused on any one competitor and really think our best way is to win more time by having the best experiences, all the things we do. And that\u2019s helped us a lot. Another thing that\u2019s helped us a lot is having David Wells as our CFO for the last 10 years. It\u2019s been an incredible joyous partnership. And so to wrap up this call, I\u2019m going to turn it over to David Wells to come say goodbye.","David Wells","Surprise guest. So, Reed and the group was great to give me this sort of last word. Thank you. A giant thank you to our investors. I\u2019ve been here nearly 15 years. That\u2019s 51 quarters including this one with 32 as the CFO, a 1000% plus growth in the value of the company and I\u2019ve been a big part of that and I\u2019m really thankful and respectful for that. And I\u2019ve got just super high confidence in Spence. We spent a lot of time together. I think he\u2019s going be great for the next phase of Netflix growth so \u2013 and just really thanks. Thanks to all the investors. Thank you."],"15470":["Netflix, Inc.

Welcome to this live video interview for our 2013 second quarter earnings results. We may make forward-looking statements during today's interview and results may differ from those statements. Now I would like to turn it over to Reed Hastings, our CEO.","Reed Hastings","Thanks, Erin. We focused on efficient and effective investor communication for a long time. We worked through our shareholder letter, our long-term view. In terms of the Q&A, we have always admired the fire side chat format at investor conferences as being the most dynamic and interesting. And this is our attempt to bring that value to the broad online public. Now we are on our webcams on our laptops and on YouTube, so I hope the quality is acceptable. And we look forward to any suggestions from you afterwards.","With me today from Beverly Hills is Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer.","Ted Sarandos","Thanks, Reed. I am glad to be here today.","Reed Hastings","Thanks, Ted. And also with me is David Wells, our CFO.","David Wells","Thanks, Reed. I think at this point we will start the questions. I am going to turn it over to our first interviewer, Rich Greenfield from BTIG.","Question-and-Answer Session","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","I think we will have Julia start off. Julia, why don\u2019t you kick off?","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","Thanks, so much. Julia Boorstin here from CNBC. I just wanted to say that Rich I have been emailed and tweeted a wide range of questions from a range of institutional investors, individual shareholders, sell-side analysts, and also other companies in the media industry. Now because there was a lot of over allotment of questions, we are not going to be attributing individual questions but rather trying to compile them all and get through as many as possible. We have received emails of a very wide range and a lot of questions. So we going to get right into it.","And the first question is about the format of the call. Reed, this question is for you. You alluded to it a little bit but there has been a lot of criticism by your decision to format the call this way. How do you address concerns that it actually minimizes the ability of investors to communicate directly with you?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think we should process that after the interview and let's see if it's productive and useful for investors and see what they think.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","Rich?","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","Reed, why did you not reach the top end of your domestic sub guidance? We talked about where you have seen the success of your original programming. You have been Emmy nominated. You have gotten a lot of free marketing in the quarter and yet you did not get up to the top end of your sub guidance. Could you give us a sense of why that didn\u2019t happen?","Reed Hastings","Yeah, when we do our forecasting in the beginning of the quarter, when we know all of the factors going into that, we try to set the range so that we come in in the middle of the range as we did. So we are really happy with the progress in the business. We are happy that net adds were higher than a year ago in our domestic business, and much higher on the international business. And so we are feeling quite good about the business.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","You alluded to the impact of Arrested Development in the quarter but you didn\u2019t actually specify how much it had? Could you give us a sense of how many of your subscribers came from adding that programming?","Reed Hastings","When we look at original content, whether it's House of Cards or Arrested Development, we are just in a very early innings of this. We are figuring out how to promote them, what the ongoing value is. And what we see is, if we do it right these will turn into real franchises. That is House of Cards Season 2, Orange Season 2, Season 3, Season 4, will be just tremendous assets to the company. Arrested was a unique look forward because it already had a developed brand and we were bringing out Season 4. And what we did see was a little rise in gross additions which translated to net additions, more than the weekly pattern would have suggested. But it was not, particularly it was enough to move our net adds higher than last year, but it was not tremendously significant in the short-term.","And in general remember that people subscribe and retain with us for a variety of content, not just a single show. So they might be become that Arrested Development was the excuse to join but then they start watching all of our great content. So think of it as just part of the content mix. And I don\u2019t know, Ted, do you want to add to that all?","Ted Sarandos","I would just point out that with every series that we have launched, both the viewing audience and the total hours viewed has grown sequentially with every single -- with every series that we have launched. So remember we launched from kind of ground zero with the first, both in the concept and in the show itself, and then continued to grow it and grow it and grow it. So I agree with Reed that these are going to have very long term implications. And we have been saying from the beginning that they have subtle impact on subscribers over time because you are realizing it with things like brand halo and reductions in churn that happens certainly and over time.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","But you chose to single out Arrested Development. Does that mean Arrested Development is responsible for say 15% of the subscriber growth this quarter? Can you give us any number to actually quantify what you indicated in the letter?","Ted Sarandos","I believe we just pointed it out because it breaks the seasonal pattern in a way that can be attributed more directly to that.","Reed Hastings","Julia, when a subscriber or a new member joins, they don\u2019t say it\u2019s because of Arrested. There\u2019s a whole wide variety of reasons, and Arrested again is unique because we\u2019re starting with already created brand. The general case with Hemlock, with Orange, with House of Cards is for us to be the first season in debut. So think of Arrested as an unusual nice opportunity, but the general case for Netflix\u2019s original programing is more like House of Cards, Hemlock and Orange.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","So does that indicate that you expect to see an uptick for House of Cards second season for example?","Reed Hastings","Yeah. I think we would probably see a little bump there in our numbers. That would make sense and hopefully by the time we get to Season 3, 4, or 5, if we\u2019re fortunate enough to get there, then we turned it into a Harry Potter-esque global massive phenomenon, when is the next season coming and then we certainly would. Again we\u2019ve only made some progress on that. We\u2019ve got to see \u2013 we\u2019ve got to make Season 2 as great as Season 1.","Ted Sarandos","May I even point out that even the most iconic TV brands like the Sopranos and Seinfeld took several years before they became brands.","David Wells","If I could just add to the comments. This is David. We\u2019ve said consistently and I say consistently that it will take several shows for folks to be engaged in Arrested Development and other types of our originals. It\u2019s not going to be one show. If you think about whether you join HBO or Showtime because of one or two shows, Game of Thrones is the only example where people have thrown out that it\u2019s a single show. Otherwise it\u2019s multiple shows. It will take us a while for our originals to get there.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","Moving on to some more questions about the most recent quarterly report, your investor letter indicates that Q4 margins will decline dramatically despite the fact that you project margins to improve 400 basis points for the whole year. Is this is the beginning of a problematic trend in the fourth quarter?","David Wells","I don\u2019t think that we put in the letter any implication that our margins would decline. What we\u2019re talking about is our progression, our expansion of margin and the fact that over the last six quarters we\u2019ve actually over delivered on our target of about 100 basis points a quarter. And so content deals are lumpy and it\u2019s hard to predict that and also plan to that gradual expansion. So there are quarters where we\u2019re going to be over. There\u2019ll be quarters we\u2019re under but on average we\u2019ll deliver about 400 basis points a year as long as we\u2019re able to continue to grow at the rates that we\u2019ve seen.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","But adding up the math, the fourth quarter does show -- is going to show a decline in margins. I guess my question is, how much of that is due to an increase in additional content spending compared to an anticipation that you\u2019re going to have to accelerate the amortization of the originals in the fourth quarter.","Reed Hastings","Julia, for the fourth quarter, we\u2019re targeting a little over 400 basis points over the fourth quarter a year ago. And that doesn\u2019t apply a reduction and certainly not a dramatic reduction of the margin. So there\u2019s just math there in the question.","Rich Greenfield \u2013 BTIG","Reed, just to be clear, we\u2019ve got a lot of investor questions who though the 400 was 400 for the full year, not 400 in the fourth quarter as they were looking at your out performance in the first three quarters and assuming that meant a very large fall off in Q4 to stick to the 400 for the full year.","Reed Hastings","I see. Well, that\u2019s where a good Q&A session like this is useful. So let us disambiguate that and we\u2019re looking at it quarter over quarter. So our target for the fourth quarter this year is 400 basis points ahead of the fourth quarter last year.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","So that 400 is not for the full year, just to clarify because there\u2019s a lot of confusion among the analysts questions and investor questions.","Reed Hastings","Correct. Apparently we accidentally created that misunderstanding with per year, but meaning quarterly year over year.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","Got it. Thank you. Rich?","Rich Greenfield \u2013 BTIG","So when you look at originals, you\u2019ve called out a couple of them in terms of House of Cards and Arrested Development. You\u2019ve got a bunch of those still sitting around in the pipeline and now you\u2019ve got Orange is the New Black. When you look at the Q3 guidance for subscribers, is there a benefit from originals because you seem very excited about Orange is the New Black. How do we think about that?","Reed Hastings","Ted, why don\u2019t you take this one?","Ted Sarandos","Sure. Rich, like I mentioned I think that we\u2019ve had this compounding positive effect. They are subtle effects, but they\u2019re compounding, meaning that when we launched Orange is the New Black, surprisingly it drew as big a first seven day viewing as any of the other original series and actually had been growing every time, which we have to leave you to believe that people are taking more confidence of the idea of Netflix Originals which is creating some excitement for upcoming seasons as well and upcoming new series as well. So the brand is starting to mean something to viewers already, even though we only started doing this in February. That's what we're enthusiastic about.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","Now, obviously, Netflix is proud of its Emmy nominations. Why don't you tell us how much -- how many people watch those shows that were nominated.","Reed Hastings","We said publicly, well we continue to say publicly that we are not releasing viewing numbers. Our actual ratings would be apples and oranges comparison to what happens on a network. We view the viewing over a very long period of time. We'll tell you though, that you should look at our renewal of a show to a second season as a very positive sign. Because if we're renewing shows that people aren't watching in big numbers then we're creating a huge opportunity cost in our content spend. In other words, we won't have money to spend on things that people watch. So these shows are performing really well for us. They are hitting our numbers with remarkable precision in terms of what we forecasted enough, so that we had confidence to renew Orange Is the New Black, based on our viewing models even a few days before we launched the show.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","Final question on Q1, and this is for David specifically. There is a footnote one that talks to a restatement of your contribution margins related to an SG&A shift. Could you explain why that was made and what happened?","David Wells","Sure. That's related to our global spending on marketing overheads of people. It's really marketing folks. They are working on projects, on branding projects that are for the Netflix brand, a brand across the globe. So they're not working on things that are specific to a particular territory or operating segment. So we felt like we wanted to treat them like we do our other content folks that are making our content deals and we treat them as a global cost and that those costs were moved down from the marketing line which was a cost of revenue down into a G&A line.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","Now just moving on to actual questions in categories. We're going to try to break these up into big topic categories. The investor letter starts off by talking about a saturation based on competition. And I wonder, since Reed you've talked about this 60 million to 90 million potential for Netflix, why are you even talking about saturation given where Netflix is today?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think we never know when and how saturation will hit, and what we are trying to be clear on is there is a couple of different forces. One is that our content is getting better, our service is getting better. And the other is that the larger we get, of course the harder it is to grow and also the longer time goes by the better competitors are. So those are the opposing forces. And given those forces, we're extremely excited to have our net adds be at the same level as last year because that implies that there is no near term saturation.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","And are you still comfortable with the 60 million to 90 million ultimate market potential?","Reed Hastings","We are. We're feeling very good about that. Because what happens is, by the time we get to 40 million and 50 million, we get the content better and the service better. And so it's not 60 million or 90 million for the current service, it's 60 million or 90 million for the future service that's much improved. That maybe a lot more originals and just incredible streaming.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","Many investors have shared a concern that virtually every one in your potential market has already tried Netflix at least once so you have very few actually new customers. What is your level of churn?","Reed Hastings","You know what we really focus on is the net adds. Because someone has tried Netflix before, they're probably more interested in trying us again as the content gets better, as the streaming gets better, as the play back software and the devices gets better. And so there is lots of people who tried us and then they will try us again to see if we meet their future needs. So we're feeling very comfortable about that.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","I understand you stopped reporting churn but can you tell us anything about the churn and what that might reveal about future growth?","Reed Hastings","I can tell you that as the CEO of Netflix, I focus myself. I don't even look at the churn numbers. Essentially, I'm looking at net adds all the time, because you get various trade-offs, and really what we care about is total growth. And so it's bringing the world in line with how management looks at it, which is in terms of net additions which we do check every week, every day.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","And -- no, go ahead.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","If consumers are now watching over 90 minutes of Netflix a day, why is that household churning. Like what else do you need to do if you're already at 90 minutes of household viewing per subscriber in the U.S.?","Reed Hastings","Well, let's say, if that household that's watching 90 minutes a day probably isn't cancelling. But that's an average, so I think of it as a bell curve of usage. And the people at the lighter end that are not using Netflix much then they're more prone to cancel it than someone who is watching a lot. So we constantly just try to make the service better which is what we've been doing over the last five years.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","We received a number of questions and concerns about your free cash flow. Over the last few quarters you've had a disparity between net income and free cash flow suggesting that you're really making an investment in your streaming migrate content. But the question then is, what is the duration of the content that you're investing in and when should we expect it to run through the income statement?","David Wells","I'll probably take this one. This is David. So we've been very, very clear and very transparent about the fact that our content investments are going to run ahead of our P&L expense and weigh on our free cash flow. And we were pleased this quarter to actually flip to positive. Likely we'll continue to make investments in originals and other content that will continue to weigh on our free cash flow. But we're very comfortable with where we are today. We think that the viewing that follows from those content investments, our accounting has to follow from that viewing. So to the extent that the industry is set up that more of the money is paid upfront in order to fund production, that's something that we can only affect a little bit. We have to be competitive buyers in the industry. So we have to meet those payment terms and a lot of these deals are more cash upfront loaded.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","Well certainly, but some investors who we've spoken to calculate disparity between that income and free cash flow at over $2 per share. Will we see that pressure EPS?","David Wells","I am not sure about the $2 per share. What we've said is that our free cash flow runs ahead of our P&L expense, about 20%. So the ratio of cash out to P&L expense can run 20% above that P&L. And that's typically holding, even with some of our more cash upfront originals deals. You'll see some of that start to unwind as we get older and a lot of the deals start to mature down the road. But while we're expanding content, you should expect and investors should expect that to continue to weigh on our free cash flow.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","But David, when you look at the original programming, the amount of spend versus the amortization, your website spends a lot of detail going into how that's amortized. But what is the actual cash outlay? You talked about it being higher. How should we think about how the cash for these originals and even some of your new deals like DreamWorks, how does that actually flow into your actual cash position as we think about your balance sheet?","David Wells","They\u2019re a little bit different. So generally we take -- we make payment partially upon delivery, and then another section it depends on the deal. And we don't talk about deals specifics, but illustratively it could be 18 months, it could be 3 years. It depends on the license period. So again it really depends on the delivery of that content and when it comes in. And for output style deals, that really depends on the size of the box office card that we're paying. So, again it depends on the content as it comes through, but we've been fairly conservative I'd say in terms of preparing for this. We raised debt earlier in the year. We restructured some debt. We feel pretty good about our cash position. And we put in our long-term letter, depending on the expansion of originals, we may need more capital down the road, but right now we're fine.","Ted Sarandos","And Rich I'd say too that we've been able to get very favorable cash terms from our suppliers or most of our deals. And I'd say that the more high profile the programming is the more likely it is original and exclusive, the cash outlay has accelerated versus some of the very deep catalog that pays out very smoothly over several quarters.","Rich Greenfield \u2013 BTIG","When you drive more subscribers at a lower price, or generate a higher profit margin at a higher price, it basically -- why is $7.99 the right price?","Reed Hastings","I would say $7.99 is pretty close to the right price. I don't think we could be certain that at $6.99 or $8.99 it would be a little bit better or a little bit worse. But once you've picked a price, there is a tremendous value in consumer stability. And we're growing very strongly at the current price. And so we feel great about that situation.","Rich Greenfield \u2013 BTIG","But there is an overwhelming number of questions from investors and other analysts of are you going to be forced to raise price? Because you literally can't afford your content commitments, so either you need to raise equity or you need to raise the price of your service.","Reed Hastings","Well, if you look over the past three years, we've raised the contribution margin in the United States business from sub 10% to over 20%. And so I think there is plenty of evidence that we can grow revenue faster than we're growing content costs.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","But a specific question that was asked by a number of people is, given the negative operating cash flow trend, obviously our cash flow is positive this quarter, but given those trends and the high costs for original content and also exclusive content, what is the probability that you'd either be forced to raise debt or subscription prices in the next 12 months?","Reed Hastings","Well, let's see. Let's separate the two factors. One is domestic, where we're hugely profitable in growing very well. And the other is international, where we're growing extremely strongly. Revenue was up 155% over a year ago but it has negative P&L, we're in investment mode. So we've got the strong U.S. business supporting the investment in international. In terms of the likelihood of raising debt or prices, I wouldn\u2019t have anything more to add to that then what we said which is we're very comfortable where we are in the $7.99 price point, and we're growing very strongly. And in terms of debt, it would be pretty unlikely in the next 12 months.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","But I guess looking beyond that, beyond the next 12 months, over the next couple of years, many investors and analysts who you know, said they believe you will need to execute as stock sales to pay for content obligations. What is your outlook in terms of your plans for potentially a secondary stock offering in the next three years to four years?","David Wells","It's too far off to speculate on. At this point what we can say is what we've said.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","Would a price increase be a way to avoid a capital raise?","David Wells","We're very comfortable with our $7.99 price point and with the growth that it generates.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","Schwartz believe that your stock is exceedingly expensive. When you look at the valuation of where you are now, how do you get comfortable with the growth potential of your stock from these levels?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think management is probably not the greatest judge of their own stock price and so we try not to comment specifically on that. We try to provide lots of information to investors and then there is a natural process through that of the price getting set. What we focus on is how to grow the subscriber base, how to expand internationally, how to improve the content. Those are all the things that we're focusing on.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","For investors who've been on a roller coaster ride with Netflix over the past two years, what would you say to tell them or reassure them that what happened two years ago is not going to happen again?","Reed Hastings","Stocks go up and down, our stock has been so volatile. I mean a year ago we were at $80 now we're over $200. Five years ago we were at $30, we went public at $7.50. So the general trend is quite positive but there are a lot of ups and downs. And it's been a very volatile stock because we're growing so aggressively. We're choosing a business strategy which has a split essentially all of our domestic profits into international expansion. And that's the right move, but it definitely takes a strong stomach on the part of investors.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","So, Reed, really following up on that international point. What is the strategy? I mean do you want to essentially grab as much market share over the next five years as you can without regard to profitability or do you think you are actually going to start showing meaningful international profitability before going to too many more markets?","Reed Hastings","Now what I said is the statements we have put in the long term letter, which is we are investing substantially all domestic profits in international expansion. And we think that's very smart. If you look at our international growth, it's tremendous. We think there is a huge opportunity around the internet in the international markets and we're investing for the long term in that. And I think we've been very clear in that for almost three years now.","David Wells","Yes. And the only thing I'd add to that, Rich, is that we have demonstrated good progression in terms of operating losses, reductions in international. We're 25% down year-over-year and we're very pleased, as Reed said, with the growth in those international markets. So it's more about the progression of our existing markets and the path we're on than it is about an overall line.","Ted Sarandos","If I could also add too, the success we're seeing with our original programming we're seeing in throughout our international markets as well. That proportionally to our sub base, our subs overseas are excited about these shows roughly the same level as they are in the U.S.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","Shifting gears over to your license content spending. With two of the last three DreamWorks Animation films disappointing at the Box Office, underperforming DreamWorks Animations average. Do you have an [out] of the big deal that you announced with DreamWorks Animation.","Ted Sarandos","I am sorry Julia, you're talking about the series deal or the film output.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","The series deal and the -- I mean the larger deals.","Ted Sarandos","Look I am very comfortable with DreamWorks performance at the Box Office even this weekend. Yes, Turbo opened a little soft but it came out with CinemaScore ratings of A, with very good word of mouth. Likely to hold up -- likely to continue to expand the box office. Cruise was a nice a little hit actually at the end of day for DreamWorks. And there is a rate card that regulates the fee for those shows relative to their box office performance. So we're thrilled with DreamWorks and the performance of their films and the quality of their films. And they translate to very high viewing on Netflix, even in movies that don't perform as well at the box office.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","But the fact that Turbo has been such a box office disappointment, specially compared to all the other DreamWorks animation movies, doesn't that diminish the value of that DreamWorks animation content on your platform? You said that it would be a game changer, that this additional content is a game changer. Doesn't this diminish that?","Ted Sarandos","Julie, if it does, it\u2019s reflected in the rate card. So the rate card adjusts up and down with the performance of the films. And as far as the series deal is concerned, these are very iconic characters that tend to last a long time, way beyond opening weekend performance. Our series will launch post the DVD release of these films so they get a whole second wave of marketing out of them too.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","I am sorry, go ahead Rich.","Rich Greenfield \u2013 BTIG","I was going to just say, Ted, when you buy content, do you see a point where you\u2019re going to be buying globally versus having to buy in the U.S., buying in the UK, in every single market? When can you scale buy globally?","Ted Sarandos","Well, increasingly all of our original deals we're doing globally. We have been doing all of our independent, non-studio deals globally. And we're doing a much more multi-territory licensing as well. So, sometimes global plays out to our favor, and sometimes you don't really achieve the scale of it. So right now we're trying to weigh through that and see where we can pick up global efficiencies.","Rich Greenfield \u2013 BTIG","Can you give us an example of where you\u2019re seeing the benefit?","Reed Hastings","Rich, even when we're global, for example in Asia where we're not currently, we\u2019ll generally sell off the rights there. So even when you talk about global, if not exploiting it globally, it's really multi-regional.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","Moving on to -- quickly before we move on to original programming spending, can you tell us how many subscribers quit Netflix after you chose not to renew Dora the Explorer and the other Viacom content?","David Wells","Ted Sarandos","You saw it in the net adds. We grew.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","So moving on to the original programming spending, Netflix and Reed often draw the comparison to HBO. But unlike HBO, Netflix does not own the content. It doesn\u2019t profit from licensing it to other outlets. It also doesn't have exclusive rights. For instance House of Cards you can buy elsewhere, though Netflix does have the streaming rights. How do you justify reinforcing this parallel to HBO when HBO does have a different business model?","Ted Sarandos","Julie most original programming originates in this way, which is you want to hedge your bets a little bit on building the confidence and building up before you build out the infrastructure. So you step in and do more licensing deals, which is how Showtime does most of their deals, which is how HBO did in their earliest days, how AMC did in their earliest expansions. So this is not unusual at all. And the more confidence we build, the more likely we are to take a full ownership stake and to take -- and to build out more infrastructure around it.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","So, does that mean --","Rich Greenfield \u2013 BTIG","Starting to? Have you started to build out infrastructure that is?","Ted Sarandos","Well, we are managing a broader set of rights today than we used to for sure.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","Does that mean --","Reed Hastings","Sorry. It's Reed here. Think of it as a broad expansion, which is HBO has a lot of licensed content, for example all the movies. So it's only the originals and only some of their originals that they own. It's natural for us to grow into that over the next couple of years. So it's part of our long-term view.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","So do you have specific plans to move into full ownership in the near term?","Reed Hastings","Absolutely. It's something we're looking at and there are so many gradations between what full ownership is in every territory. But think of it as over time we\u2019ll do more and more of that and the content will be more and more exclusive to Netflix. But while we were getting started, it was really smart for us to work with Media Rights Capital and Lionsgate and others to be able to leverage their skills and competencies.","Rich Greenfield \u2013 BTIG","Reed, do you think that you have a structural advantage in creating original programming versus your peers, whether that's the releasing pattern, whether it's the data, or whether it's the fact that you're commercial free?","Reed Hastings","We have some advantage in creating it, but I think the biggest advantage we have is in matching with the content and distributing it, essentially monetizing the content. And you can see that with the breadth of our success. So, one view of our four for four and are starting our five for five, if you include Lillehammer is Ted's God's gift to programming. And I think that's probably true. But the second part of it is also that we've got this online performance matching where the content is selectively promoted to each subscriber appropriately and that helps tremendously. And it's not really important for us to tease apart which is more true. We want both excellent, excellent programming and we want to do amazing promotion and we get stronger from that without worrying too much about which side is contributing more or less. You do see that Ted has an Emmy next to him in the frame, and it's got a little story for you in that.","Ted Sarandos","Yeah. The Emmy we brought along today. I think it's a great example of Netflix to strive to be excellent as both a technology company and an entertainment company. And fitting to that, this Emmy was actually awarded to Netflix on the technology side last year for the advancement of television. And so actually the first Emmy came from the tech side of Netflix.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","But I guess I don't understand, how do you define a hit? You said Ted's five for five, Reed. How do you know Ted's five for five?","Reed Hastings","Well. The easy one is, a hit is something we want to renew. And, thus, five for five is we want to renew because the economics for us are good.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","A question about your content cost, just to follow-up on that. How do you know you want to renew it? Is it the percentage of your subscribers who are watching? Is it subscriber bump (inaudible) slightly inflated. So how you know that you want to renew?","David Wells","Relative to how else we would have spent the money. Relative to spending it on license content, did we get an increase in viewership, did we get an increase in some of the intangibles like brand halo publicity, and the bring the brand more in focus with our consumers. So, relative to how else we would have spend the money on other programming, we think it was a big hit. And by the way without giving total, without giving ratings numbers, I would tell you every one of these shows are drawing TV size audiences. So you know that House of Cards is a hit because when you walk in to Starbucks people are talking about it. You know when the show is being spoofed at the White House Correspondents' Dinner and 3,000 people are laughing at the slightest references to the show, you know that people are watching it and you know people are talking about it. So without the precision of a number, you know that these shows are hit too.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","Okay. Well we're going to keep on asking for a number and it's (inaudible) you will give one to me.","David Wells","Fair enough.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","So a question about content cost. Seemingly every network, cable, and broadcast and all of these new digital channels, are all spending aggressively on original programming. Doesn't that threaten to drive your content costs spiraling higher and what kind of threat is that to you margins?","David Wells","How would it drive them higher?","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","If there are so many people competing for content. There are new buyers for content.","Ted Sarandos","(Inaudible) over license content.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","(Inaudible) Yeah.","Ted Sarandos","With so many people producing original programming, it creates a lot of competition in the market for license programming in their season after model. And in terms of competing for original programming, I am much more comfortable, to Rich's earlier question, around some of our structural advantage about not having to have a bunch, a lot of performance pressure on a show on its first week, which actually drives the ability for consumers to find the show overtime before we have to pull the plug on it, the way many other broadcasters force do in your television.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","But to raise the question about competition you have Amazon which is investing $1 billion in licensing content. You have Hulu which has got $750 million from its parent companies to spend on content. The influx of all this cash for content both licensed and original, doesn't that threaten to push up prices?","David Wells","Yeah, maybe. And I could tell you that in the more exclusive deals that we've been negotiating, the one thing that's nice about that is you get to know what the walk away prices are. And I can tell you in everyone of those cases we've been comfortable at the prices we walked away from and comfortable at that level -- at the pricing that our competitors are paying for that content. So, yeah, there is definitely some competition in the marketplace which does raise the prices, which is good for the producers and eventually good for consumers too.","Reed Hastings","I'll add to that, that it's great for content owners and it's great for creators. That there is renaissance particularly in serialized TV. So on one hand, it's top on us that Amazon and Hulu and others are bidding. But there are so many great stories to be told that it's exciting. And if the prices are going to go up, than we as one of the major scale players have a big advantage. And so, it's good for the creators, it's acceptable for us and we're seeing this total renaissance in television. Unfortunately, I have to tell you we're down about two minutes left. I did set this up as a 30 minute view. If it's very successful and investors like it, we will try to do a longer session next time. But let me hand it back to you for the closing two minutes.","Julia Boorstin - CNBC","Okay. I hate to say it. We were emailed so many questions by investors and analysts, I wish we had a little bit more time. But I'm going to ask a quick question about competition. You mentioned Amazon and Hulu, both of them are stepping up their investment spending. What kind of threat do they pose to you in the next, I would say starting in 2014 once we start seeing impact of that?","Reed Hastings","Well, we don't really know. We always take them very seriously. They're very successful. But if you look at Showtime in HBO, when Showtime does great work it doesn't take away from HBO. And we think that Hulu and Amazon will do great originals, it will grow the whole internet TV market. And then what controls our destiny is, do we do great programming? Do we have a great user interface? Do we have incredible streaming? And so we really just focus on maximizing that opportunity by making our service the best it can be.","Rich Greenfield \u2013 BTIG","We were just talking about incredible streaming quality, but the issue really is most of your viewing occurs on fixed line connections because that's where the quality of the experience is good. International -- I\u2019m sorry, wireless isn't that good. Do you think that over the next few years we're going to see a sea change in the wireless industry? Softbank\u2019s Masayoshi Son is putting a tremendous amount of capital just buying Sprint. Do you think you're going to see a big shift in your business towards wireless over the next few years?","Reed Hastings","Think a bit like tablets. As tablets have come about they\u2019ve been a growing proportion of our viewing and that helps the ecosystem. Better and cheaper connectivity, more competition for broadband, that's all very positive. But these are gradual multi-year effects. Five or 10 years from now consumers will have incredible devices, incredible broadband at low prices and that's very favorable in the long-term. But I don't think it's a short term catalyst.","Rich Greenfield \u2013 BTIG","Is tablets even 5% of your viewing today?","Reed Hastings","We don't disclose the specifics.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","Reed, a question about the business that you are starting off with, DVDs. Many investors have pointed out that you seem to be allowing your DVD business to atrophy. Do you plan to shut down that legacy DVD business?","Reed Hastings","No. We've got over 7 million members who love the service. It's got incredible selection, every movie and TV show ever made. So it's got a great part of the value equation for over 7 million members and that will go on for a very long time.","Rich Greenfield \u2013 BTIG","Reed, one last content question.","Reed Hastings","Go ahead.","Rich Greenfield \u2013 BTIG","One last content question. We\u2019ve got it from a lot of people. You've gone into original TV series. A lot of people are asking would you go into the movie business and create movies? Would you create talk shows in the evening like a Jay Leno type show? Would you do a news program like the evening news that people could watch for 24 hours on the subscription service? Like what other content makes sense for Netflix?","Ted Sarandos","Rich, in the letter we mentioned that we're going to expand in the coming months into original standup comedy specials and documentaries that will premiere on Netflix to be exclusive to Netflix. There is no reason we wouldn't do some of those other -- those things that you've listed, including movies. If we can bring too it something like we did with original series, change the distribution model in the favor of the consumers with things like launching the whole season at one time and things that give us advantages over other forms of distribution.","Reed Hastings","If you look at HBO and Showtime, they also do quite a bit of sports programming and live sports. So they\u2019re basically in the membership happiness business. Now, we don't anticipate getting that far from our core brand, but it's a very flexible relationship, where we can have lots of types of content over the next 5 or 10 years if it makes our subscribers happy. We're fundamentally in the membership happiness business as opposed to in the TV show business. And so we do have a lot of flexibility. But in the next -- in the short term we're focused on learning this craft bit by bit and having our current shows be wildly successful.","Julia Boorstin \u2013 CNBC","Can you tell us how many more originals you plan to launch over the next two years and how much you plan to spend on them?","Reed Hastings","Not, precisely but we can say we're continuing to expand that. And it's a great wrap-up question. I want to thank all our investors for participating in this. We look forward to your feedback on the format. And we'll try to just keep on improving it to make it efficient and effective for all of you. Thank you very much."],"15467":["Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 23, 2012  6:00 PM ET","Executives","Ellie Mertz","Reed Hastings - Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Member of Stock Option Committee","David Wells - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer","Analysts","Mark S.

[Operator Instructions] Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce the host for today's conference, Ellie Mertz, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellie Mertz","Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to the Netflix Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Q&A Session. I'm joined here by Reed Hastings, CEO; and David Wells, CFO. We announced our financial results for the third quarter at approximately 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.

Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to risks and uncertainties related to the business. A detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission on February 10, 2012. A rebroadcast of this Q&A session will be available at the Netflix website after 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.","Now, let's move directly to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Ellie Mertz","As is our standard practice, we've organized the email questions by topic after we received them this afternoon. So let's start with questions on domestic subscribers.","Question one. Your original thesis was 3 years for full brand recovery. Is this still the case? Can you recover faster?","Reed Hastings","It's Reed here. I'd say the 3-year model is consistent with what we're seeing. We've made substantial progress. As you can see, in the engagement metrics, we feel really good about the originals, particularly Arrested Development, because of its broad existing reputation in terms of burnishing our reputation. But 3 years is still the right timeframe.","David Wells","And this is David. I would add, like I've said before, that we are seeing recovery in our brand reputation metrics the likelihood to recommend, but it's not at the level that it was pre-price change in July of last year. So there's still some room for recovery, but we've seen it trend in the right direction.","Ellie Mertz","What changed, as you move through this year, that has caused you to miss your earlier guidance of 7 million net domestic streaming guidance by so much?","Reed Hastings","Well, we were within the range of our guidance from 90 days ago, but not within the annual guidance that we gave at the end of Q1. And roughly, I think we're feeling our way along as the streaming market grows, and we miss-predicted, but I would call that more of a forecasting error than anything else. When we think about growing 5 million net additions in this year, if we had predicted 5 million, I think we'd all be feeling good, that that's great growth. So we own it in terms of a bad forecast. But in terms of actual performance of the business to grow 5 million net adds, domestic, is substantial, and we feel good about that and about the growth next year.","Ellie Mertz","Follow-on question. What does the new subscriber guidance of 5 million compared to the prior guidance of 7 million suggest about the addressable market opportunity you have?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think it makes it all a little bit harder. We think harder about the 60 million to 90 million, and we'll approach it not as fast as we would have if we had done 7 million this year. But the long term of every household becoming an Internet video household, I mean, that's definitely happening and going to happen. People are using Internet video in huge numbers, and that's only spreading. And we continue to lead the market in a big way. So I'd look at the long-term picture as very strong and not changed.","Ellie Mertz","You predicted that the London Olympics might dampen subscriber additions and\/or engagement in the third quarter. Did that play out in your actual data?","David Wells","Yes, it did. We had a strong July, a soft August, and then a slower bounce back in September.","Ellie Mertz","How can you improve involuntary churn rates in more mainstream, lower income households? Why don't I take this one?","Some of the color that we've seen in terms of trends over the last couple of years is an increased use of debit cards and prepaid cards over credit cards. And the unfortunate thing about these different payment methods is that they have lower approval rates. And so what we've been doing is looking at a host of different things to improve those approval rates, and, in particular, looking to recover as many sale transactions as we can. So we're hopeful that there's a little bit of room that we have there to improve the overall involved churn rates.","Let's move to questions about content. You have the advantage of perfect information on what your consumers watch. You have licensed a wide range of content, some of which is not viewed all that much. With this information, how do you intend to handle negotiations when deals come up for renewal? Would you pay less for a certain content or pay the same or more but require programmers to provide you with newer, fresher or better content?","Reed Hastings","We don't get the luxury of requiring programmers to do anything. We certainly look at the viewing as an indicator, and that limits what we're willing to pay for certain content. And if it doesn't present a clearing price and there's someone else willing to pay that much for the content, then the programmer will go to someone else. So I would say it's an informed auction market. We do have a lot of data that's very helpful in our overall programming. But it's a pretty straightforward auction, highest bidder gets the contents kind of market.","Ellie Mertz","Question on the streaming hours. You have not talked about monthly or quarterly streaming hours since your comment about June 2012. Could you update us on recent activity?","Reed Hastings","Yes, sure. We were over 3 billion hours in Q3, which we feel great about, and it's continuing to grow.","Ellie Mertz","With 2\/3 of viewing now television, are you limiting the size of the audience that you appeal to by not having the more in-demand or on-demand film content that help build your DVD and then streaming businesses? How would that impact your cost of content?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think we're expanding our market with our TV series. If you look on cable or satellite, what gets watched more -- I mean, TV shows get watched a lot more than movies. So I think there's a big expansion in addressable market, both in the sense for any consumer's time and in terms of people who are interested in the Netflix service. And we're trying to be very strong both in movies and in TV shows, and we're only getting stronger as we grow.","David Wells","Just a reminder here, too, that even in our DVD business, about 1\/3 of the DVD shipments were new releases and 2\/3 were things that didn't fall into any release category or older content. So many subscribers just want something good to watch, and they're less engaged in terms of caring about the freshness of the data or the content.","Ellie Mertz","Next, a question on fixed versus variable licensing. [indiscernible] some of its recent deals a ethic [ph] to have a variable component on pricing based on subscribers. Given the lack of visibility you now have on future subs, is this something you would be willing to do? You've always resisted and it has worked to your advantage as you grew faster than content providers anticipated.","Reed Hastings","Now we're very happy with knowing exactly what our commitments are, and we don't have any plans to change our licensing structure. And the people that we generally bid against other networks are in the same model, where they're bidding fixed fee.","Ellie Mertz","In terms of the goal to focus on licensing, only the contents of viewers, when you negotiate with these videos to license content, their goal is to bundle together as much as they can to maximize the value of the deal. How do you balance your desire for more efficient spend with the studios' desire to bundle more content?","Reed Hastings","We really look at packages as a whole, so we'll estimate for a given package how much viewing it will generate, which includes the stuff that's most appropriate for our members and the stuff that's less appropriate, and then try to figure out a clearing price for that set of content. And then, there's a back-and-forth of how well if you added this or took out this, depending on are they revenue-motivated or packaged-motivated, and that's all part of the give-and-take across the hundreds of different agreements that we have.","Ellie Mertz","Disney's current output deal with Starz ends in 2015 with the [indiscernible] through Starz until the end of 2016. Why should Disney choose Netflix versus renewing with Starz or starting their own streaming movie service?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think in each market and country, there's a different set of content at a different time. But in the U.S. context, the Disney deal comes up in 2015, so it's a little premature. But we would certainly be bidders for that or other pay one deals as we have been in the past.","Ellie Mertz","Can you discuss the device mix of content consumption? How are tablets and smartphones faring in terms of consumer hour streams?","Reed Hastings","Tablets are growing. And the smartphones are growing, you probably would expect that. Tablets are a little bigger than smartphones for us. But the big viewing is really on the television, smart TVs, game consoles, Apple TV, Heroku, Blu-ray players, all the things that bring Netflix to the big screen.","Ellie Mertz","Moving to questions about original content. How do you quantify the success of proprietary content in terms of consumption and financial investment?","David Wells","Well, we look at originals like we do third-party license content in terms of how much it's going to be viewed or how much it is viewed relative to its cost. So that's the primary measure. And then outside of that, we do expect some ancillary PR value, public relations value, and subscriber excitement around the originals, but we don't rely on that in terms of the primary relative measure.","Reed Hastings","Yes, so I think that's right. The base case is that it's good content that we're producing, and the upside is that it transforms the consumers' relationship with Netflix because it's only available on Netflix, it's not also on cable and also on DVD and also on pay-per-view. It's really, fully, totally unique only on Netflix within our territories.","Ellie Mertz","Investors are quite surprised that you're releasing all the episodes of House of Cards at once, ensuring they will watch all the episodes over a weekend or 2 and then churn off. We're excited that Netflix is the first TV producer to put the consumer first and give them the content the way they want to consume it. How do you look at the trade-off between churn and hooking people on Netflix's other content if you're willing to bomb through 13 hours of House of Cards?","Reed Hastings","Well, we do want to hook people, but we want to hook them for the long-term, and we hook them for the long-term by treating them right and making all those episodes available at once. And obviously, there's later Arrested Development and Hemlock and Orange is the New Black and then a season 2 of House of Cards. So if we do our job right, there's always a reason to be a Netflix member on the original side in addition to the license side. So I don't think that it will be material, they join only for House of Cards and then exit. And so that makes us comfortable with this very consumer first trade-off.","Ellie Mertz","The original content efforts, to what extent you have ownership rights that could generate additional revenues, syndication, DVD, licensing, et cetera?","Reed Hastings","It's a great discussion item for us over time. But on this first round, we're a licensee in a certain window and so we're not essentially a producer that then manages and profits from those ancillary rights.","Ellie Mertz","Moving to questions about international. Recently, you commented that the Nordics have the most content of any international launch. Can you quantify the level of content and\/or magnitude of that spend versus other regional launches?","Reed Hastings","No. We've been very successful in the Nordics. We're very happy with that, but I don't have any specific quantification in terms of dollars or title count that would be helpful. We do feel like, market by market, we are learning and getting better at the right content mix, both to attract the subscribers and economically, and we look forward to having a fuller update for you on Nordics once we're a quarter in, in January.","David Wells","And I'd say that the basis for making those statements is an amalgam of metrics, it's not any one particular title count or dollar spend. Our experience has been, when we look at box office or Nielsen ratings or other types of metrics, that it's a combination of all of those in terms of the subscriber perception of content quality.","Ellie Mertz","In its early years, Netflix incurred significant losses in starting up its DVD-by-mail service. As you look at international streaming, do you see parallels to the startup of DVD, or are you encountering significantly more challenges?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think it parallels with DVD or parallels with any successful business, which is you establish a new market and there's losses for some time period. And then, the key thing is the durability of the profit stream after that. We never invested in having DVD expand around the world because, number one, of the mail system's difficulty; but two is the profit stream wasn't going to be that long. In contrast with streaming, if we're able to establish a significant market share and franchise in a market and we manage that well, that should be a multi-decade profit stream, and so the DCF on that is enormous, which is why it gives us the confidence to make these big and aggressive investments in establishing our leadership in these markets.","Ellie Mertz","Have you considered taking on partners and structuring JVs in certain countries? It appears like it could have 3 benefits: gain traction in countries where you have no brand equity; minimize the level of investment; and could accelerate Netflix's global ambition.","Reed Hastings","Well, it's definitely a factor, for example, when we look at Asia and some of the more challenging markets where U.S. firms have had a tough time and had progress in that. In Europe, most of the consumer firms have really been able to execute much better, faster, by keeping those wholly-owned, and that's our model for now.","Ellie Mertz","Assuming that you are able to maintain positive consolidated earnings in 2013, what would be the maximum number of countries or regions you would consider launching them to?","David Wells","I'm not sure I would approach that in terms of a maximum number. I mean, we look at a territory launch, it could have 4 countries in the case of the Nordics, but it's sold as a content block. So I think what we've said is we're focused on global profitability, but also on a path to profitability for our large existing markets. And so those are the 2 gating conditions that we'll be looking for in terms of finding that next market.","Ellie Mertz","With regards to Latin America, what steps are you taking to improve payments? Have you considered withdrawing from any markets within Latin America? Have you considered bundling your offerings other than that market to improve your ability to collect?","Second answer, on the payment side: On the payment side, we've been looking across a host of options to expand our ability to collect payments from subscribers, so let me we give you some examples of things that we're doing. In Mexico, what we found is that not all debit cards are accepted for e-commerce, and so we've been working directly with the banks to allow them to, at the -- I should say, allow us to accept debit cards online. And in Brazil, what we're looking to do this current quarter is to expand the payment methods that we offer, including things like direct debit [indiscernible] expand the addressable market of folks who have the ability to pay for our service.","Reed Hastings","And then in terms of bundling, that's not something that we're actively engaged in. We are looking at payment with other subscription services and trying to think that through. And then in terms of withdrawing, we're not thinking about that. All of our content agreements cover the entire region and are long-term in nature. So we're making great progress on the revenue side. So we're continuing to invest on that basis.","Ellie Mertz","If you return to profitability for the overall -- if the return to profitability for the overall business takes 3 quarters or more, is there a risk that you'll miss an opportunity to have first mover advantage in continental Europe? Or does first mover advantage not matter since [indiscernible] had first mover advantage in the U.K. and you came later and surpassed them?","Reed Hastings","It's a matter of debate for us. Certainly, first mover helps, but it really depends on how big a scale you get. So if a competitor gets to great scale in one of those markets before we do, we would tend probably to focus on other markets. So it's -- there's no easy answer to that one. It's something we try to balance, which is our rate of investments on the current business versus the risk of competitors getting ahead. So far, we'd like the set of trade-offs that we've made.","Ellie Mertz","Moving to questions about the product. How do you think about improving the platform from here to stay ahead of where the competition is going?","Reed Hastings","We're making a great progress on the algorithms that drive the merchandising, and I know they're invisible to all of you just like the Google Search algorithms are invisible. The UI is not the main focus because it's pretty easy to copy, and our main focus is showing the right content to the right person. When you turn on Netflix, whether that's on an iPad or a PS3, you could see 15 or 20 block shots, and if those are the right 15 or 20 block shots for you, for your mood for the time of the day, we're very likely to get a play. If those aren't the right block shots, then we're much less likely to get a play. And then that builds our engagement, and the more people watch, the more they retain. And so that's really the importance of the algorithm development and testing that we do.","David Wells","I would also say that, for some subscribers, we're constantly testing user interfaces. There's a lot of exciting user interfaces coming up enabled by devices that enable gesturings, voice and other things. You'll see us continue to experiment and play with those types of interfaces in tests. And if we find one, then we'll continue to innovate in those areas.","Ellie Mertz","Amazon's Web Services had another significant outage this week. Did this impact Netflix in any way? If not, was that due to Netflix's planning for random outages or due to not using effective services in the first place? Do these events affect your confidence in using services like Amazon's AWS for critical infrastructure and customer-facing functions?","Reed Hastings","Okay. AWS has done a great job for us as they have for other customers by having an architecture that isolates faults, and so it's built upon the notion that occasionally data centers will go down, and they give you the components to build around that. That would be true if they were our own data centers or if they were AWS. And in recent outage that they had, our customers were not materially affected. The traffic switched over smoothly, as it's designed to, to other Amazon data centers. So we're extremely happy with the decision to expand within the Amazon Web Service's footprint.","Ellie Mertz","Next, some questions on competition. Can you compare the value proposition of your streaming offering to that of Amazon today? Is the gap closing?","Reed Hastings","Well, Amazon as Prime is 2 different markets that we compete with Amazon in, and one is in the U.K. and there are -- there's almost no content that's on both services. So think of it as 2 really different services in terms of content. And we believe our viewing is higher. We think our content is better. We're growing faster, but it's a real head-to-head battle. We're both at the same price point, roughly speaking, within 20% of the -- in standalone services. In the U.S., Amazon is bundled with Prime and it's got a subset of our content. And then depending on how you want to think about the price of Prime as an annual $79 payment or free, with free shipping, you get 2 different views on it. But as we said on the letter, most of our subscribers want us to have more content. They're not particularly motivated by a service that has a significant subset of our content. So at this point, it's not in anything that we can measure affecting us directly.","Ellie Mertz","Somewhat a related question. Reed Hastings recently stated in an interview that Amazon had thus far not had much of an impact on Netflix's growth trajectory. Yet given what we're seeing now, in terms of slowing subscriber growth and lower guidance, does this change Netflix's view at all in terms of how many customers may be choosing alternative providers?","Reed Hastings","Well, we ask ourselves the same question, obviously. But in every data source that we look at, unrelated. I think as Amazon builds out their original content, which they're very actively engaged in and they'll get exclusive deals against us, they'll more and more be a different service than ours. And then, many subscribers, potentially, will subscribe to both. So I think that's the way that it evolves over time, like it has in the U.K.","Ellie Mertz","Now a few questions on the financials. Will the company be disclosing its obligations related to original content production costs?","David Wells","Well, yes, we are in the sense that the obligations that we've signed up for on originals are included in our streaming obligation tables. So they are already in there. We don't break them out. We'll provide more color as they get more and more material.","Ellie Mertz","You talked about your expectations for negative free cash flow for the next several quarters as you ramp spending on originals. But eventually, you expect to return positive -- return to positive free cash flow. What gives you the confidence that you'll be able to return to positive free cash flow? Is it a slowdown in content spend or an acceleration in subscriber growth, or both?","David Wells","Well, I wouldn't characterize either of those that way. I would say that we're focused on 3 things from a cash flow perspective: One is our growth in profitability in the U.S. and what that looks like; the second is our international investments and the losses related to those and how they play out over time; and then, the third is our growth in originals, which takes more cash than ordinary types of content deals. So we put all 3 of those together, and we want to maintain a comfortable margin. And I think those statements are based on the fact that I think that we were in a position where we can grow next year under various scenarios and expand our content expense, not slow it down, but just slow down the acceleration of the content expense in addition to funding our international investment in originals.","Ellie Mertz","Can you help us quantify the original content cash outlays in 2013, understanding that they will be higher than the P&L expense?","David Wells","Well, what we said about those before is we do have some output style deals that have more cash than expense, and those are -- have been about 10% in terms of content cash relative to the expense. Originals only need that, that ratio goes up anywhere from 10% to 20%, but probably not more than 20%.","Ellie Mertz","20% in excess of the P&L?","David Wells","Correct.","David Wells","How might we think of content spend growing year-over-year in 2013?","Reed Hastings","Hopefully, content spend will grow substantially as we continue to make our service better, and that's built into our plan, but we don't believe that we're overcommitted. We have some flexibility, though, depending on what the growth is because we're very conscious of the variability in our growth outcomes. And you can see that in the fact that while we're short on total subscriber growth this year, we are hitting our contribution margin targets. And so that's a demonstration of the flexibility that we have on the cost side.","Ellie Mertz","On CapEx, what was the driver of the uptick in the acquisition of PCNEs [ph]?","Reed Hastings","It's cash boxes related to our Open Connect program.","Ellie Mertz","And finally, there has been increasing talk that Netflix will eventually have to raise prices to increase ARPU. We've heard from management that this option is off the table, with the brand seemingly recovering from 2011's event. Is this something that is being discussed? Would it be unrealistic to expect an increase before 2014? Obviously, it cannot stay $7.99 forever.","Reed Hastings","Well, we're very excited about the $7.99 price point, and we have no plans to change that. Consumers valued the incredible bargain that, that is and that helps our growth. So we see increased monetization from increased growth rather than any change in price.","Ellie Mertz","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator, and we'll begin taking live call-in questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Mahaney from Citi.","Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","As the usage model switches more and more towards TV viewing, could you talk about the impact that could have on the business model in terms of margins, visibility into revenue and into profits, and maybe any pricing options that, that would give you?","Reed Hastings","Mark, there's no fundamental difference in the way that we license TV shows from the way that we license movies. In other words, it's a fixed payment per year or per time period. The only difference, I suppose, is we'll do a contract that will have, if there's a Season 3, Season 4, Season 5 that's built in. So I suppose there's a little bit of difference there. But fundamentally, it's content over some time period. And -- but the great experience about the TV shows in discovering them is being able to go all the way back to the pilot and really get a lot of fantastic viewing out of it, which creates a differentially better experience than any other provider. So that's the big asset of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley.","Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I had a couple. First on the domestic streaming subs. You mentioned the Olympics as a factor. You also mentioned the change in seasonality earlier in the years, so I was just wondering, given the way that you exited 3Q and the very back-end loaded nature of 4Q, how you approach the fourth quarter guide for streaming subs? And on that topic, as it relates to early 2013 as well as more of the originals in the U.S. market, House of Cards and Arrested Development start to flow through potentially. Do you anticipate that, that drives subs above seasonal trends or is content and original content not necessarily a direct driver of subs? And then secondly, Fox I think recently opted to renew with HBO with an exclusive long-term deal. I don't know, it's like 2 to 3 years ahead of the renewal. Just wondering why you think they would opt to do that rather than giving Netflix a chance to bid for the rights?","David Wells","Scott, I can -- this is David. I can take sort of Part A and B, and I'll let Reed take the Part C. Part A, the seasonal pattern is still in place. That is that we still see greater sub additions in the fourth quarter and first quarter than in the second quarter and the third quarter. So I think even our midpoint of our guide implies that seasonal pattern will still be in place. The Olympics sort of affected the monthly progression of the acquisitions through Q3, but overall, seasonality of net additions is still in place. And then your Part B on originals and content, the originals we're very excited about we think that they will drive a lot of consumer excitement in it. But on a grand scheme, it's likely to be less than -- certainly less than 10% of hours viewed next year and maybe even less than 5% of viewed. So in terms of our planning, I don't expect that to drive a ton of additional adoption.","Reed Hastings","Scott, it's Reed here. You're very gracious because I imagine what you really feel is why do we make seasonality excuses and not Olympics excuses and aren't you getting tired of it. We are tired of making those excuses as opposed to getting back to our track record. On the seasonality -- or the originals, like David said, we may have upside from it, but we're not going to bake that into our spending plans. We're getting into unknown territory in terms of how many people come to us for House of Cards or Arrested or others. So we'll gain some experience in that, and then that will help us understand how much more investment we should do in originals after that. But at this point and in Q1, we will think of it just as upside. And then in Fox and HBO, I'm not sure. Maybe the deal from HBO is good enough, but I think you'd really have to ask them or Fox, and we'll take it from there.","Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If I could squeeze one last one. The social integration update, and talked about historically there are restrictions in the U.S. Is there any update to that?","Reed Hastings","No, there's a bill in Congress now that is pending before the Congress, and it's anybody's guess if they're going to pass it in a lame duck session. And then that would enable all different types of consumer permissions for sharing, which would be useful in a Facebook context but also useful in any kind of meta-browse various types of scenarios where people want to allow a feed to go to a service to help them. So we're optimistic, but when we come to the Congress, it's hard to predict. And then in terms of outside the U.S., we're continuing to learn on our international markets. We've seen some nice take-up in Brazil, which is a very social place, obviously, as well as in the U.K. So we're continuing to work on it, but no one yet has correct formula, us or anyone else, in terms of real explosive generator. So it's in the category of a little bit positive, and we're continuing to work on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","A couple of questions. The -- I want to go back to the one of the first questions that was asked about the 3 years needed to restore your image. How did you get to that determination that it should take you guys about 3 years? And why isn't it taking shorter since you guys have basically, arguably after a year, I think people start forgetting, and to the extent that the quality of content keeps improving, it would kind of get restored faster than that. And then I have a follow-up.","Reed Hastings","Let's -- Youssef, let's hope you're right, but it's not something we wanted to count on. 3 years was something we felt comfortable we could deliver on in terms of our reputation. And some people do forget in 1 year, other people take a longer time. We're just going to have to work really hard on providing a great value and stick to our knitting, and then the brand will steadily recover. And if it's sooner than 3 years, that's great.","Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","But you don't think that's an indication rather of just maybe perceived lower quality of content?","Reed Hastings","No. The best indicator of our perceived quality of content is how much we're getting viewed, how often -- you go home, it's Wednesday night, and you want to pick something to watch and you have to decide whether you're going to pick up your cable or satellite remote or you're going to put on a DVD or you're going to watch Netflix. And the more of those moments of truth that we win, the more people are engaged with our service and the more they retain and the more they tell their friends about Netflix. And so our primary driver is winning those moments of truth, which, if you think about it, is based upon your expectation of finding something good. And the better that those first 20 titles are for you, the more likely you are to turn it on, Netflix first, as opposed to one of the other entertainment options first. And so because our engagement is higher than it's been in the past, we're really confident substantially up over 30%, we feel really good about that in terms of our content mix getting better and better.","Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","And, David, if I just may, can you maybe just talk about trends of usage and consumption of exclusive versus nonexclusive content, and maybe parlay that with the mix in your content cost between the 2?","David Wells","We're seeing engagement across both exclusive and nonexclusive categories. So in some cases, the exclusive content may cost more, but it's viewed more because it's worth more. The consumer doesn't -- isn't able to get that somewhere else. So you can infer from that, and some exclusive categories have higher viewing. But we're seeing user hours across nonexclusive content as well. In fact, at this point in time, there's more nonexclusive content on Netflix than there is exclusive content, and our hours continue to go up. And then your second part of your question was around cost, is that right, Youssef?","Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Right.","David Wells","In terms of -- there's an expectation that we'll move to exclusive over time, and that means that the cost will be -- will pay more for exclusive content.","Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","But you feel that you're -- basically, if you look at ROI for exclusive versus nonexclusive, you don't think the ROI on the exclusive is lower just because you're paying more for it?","David Wells","No. I mean, we look for engagement across that category of exclusive, so we look for deals and types of content that works well relative in that exclusive class. And we think that there is a point where we're not going to be 100% exclusive, but we'll move more and more towards exclusive content as a differentiator. And it is important for us.","Reed Hastings","And, Youssef, it's Reed. You really want to keep in mind how many different flavors of exclusive there are. There's exclusive for online, there's exclusive against DVD, there's exclusive against cable -- cable with TV Everywhere and without. So there's a lot of different options and degrees as opposed to a simple nonexclusive, exclusive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to ask a couple of things. In your letter, you talked about the long-term domestic market opportunity potentially being 2x to 3x that of linear HBO. And I'm just curious how you get there. So if we think about broadband households, it would seem that the number is approaching the number of cable households, but at the same time, there's still a limited amount of time in the day and a limited amount of disposable income. So I'm trying to understand how you get comfortable with that market opportunity being 2x to 3x. And then secondly, can you just update us where you are in terms of your personalized plans, what you might do around dual streaming?","Reed Hastings","Sure. In terms of the 60 million to 90 million, we've got that online strategy deck, which outlines some of this. But I'll run through it quickly, which is if you think about us versus linear HBO, we're able to be consumed on multiple platforms: laptop, tablet, phone. We're purely on demand with an on-demand brand. We have much broader content range, including a lot of kid's content, and we have a lower price than HBO. So it's extrapolating those factors that make us feel comfortable about the 2x to 3x, or 60 million to 90 million. In terms of broadband households, we do have the assumption that all households become broadband households, and that, that will happen over the next 5 or 10 years. And so that doesn't become a practical limiter in the same way that cable is in every household. And so that we'll equal, essentially, HBO in terms of addressable market, but because of lower price and the other factors have a larger actual market. And then on the personal stream plans, that's still something that's in development. We've been prioritizing some other things because it's a fairly minor issue, so maybe sometime this quarter and next quarter.","David Wells","I think you'll see some testing this quarter, and then depending on the actual performance of that, we'll role that out accordingly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, just the explosion of tablets. Reed, you talked before about how TV is still the primary viewing place that you need to get to, to drive your business. But we just with such -- we're seeing so many different companies launch ever cheaper and smaller tablets to get them into more people's hands across the globe. I'm just wondering how you think that tablet rollout impacts Netflix's subscriber growth over the course of the next couple of years relative to the importance you've place historically on the TV? And then just, too, somewhat related, you resigned from the Microsoft board. I just guess it would be -- a lot of people are curious what should we read into that, if anything?","Reed Hastings","Sure. On the Microsoft board, I'm on 6 different boards, and I felt like this is a good time, because Microsoft is strong coming out with Windows 8, for me to trim that back and to focus more on Netflix. So that's the story there. In terms of the tablet question, it's definitely growing for us. The question is, is it a straight substitute for a laptop as it grows, in which case it doesn't particularly affect us, or is it a net addition because it's a better consumption device than a typical laptop? We think there's some truth to the latter. The other scenario where tablets are really interesting are choosing on the tablet and then consuming on a TV. So one-second screen scenario that people talk about is you watch on the TV and then all the supplemental information, the history, the actors, et cetera, is on your tablet. And that's nice. But what we see is a big opportunity in using the power of touch to really choose what you want to watch, and then to be able to select it and then it's automatically playing on your TV. We've got a demonstration of that now on iPad and Android with the PS3, and then that's something we're working with all the CE ecosystem to build in so that over the next several years, this becomes a general capability for Netflix's choosing, which is to be able to get used to the power of touch in intimacy but then be able to enjoy the large-screen audio and video experience.","Operator","The next question comes from Andy Hargreaves from Pacific Crest.","Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask on the international stuff. How long would you stay in the market before you decided the profit potential wasn't worth the ongoing investment if things aren't going the way you thought?","Reed Hastings","Andy, there's very little chance of that happening because we've got long-term content deals that we pay on, so it's not an active topic. As long as the revenue growth is good and there's no competitor ahead of us where we have to face a decision of doubling down or not, it's clearly the right economic course to push forward and to derive the benefit. And we look at Latin America will be an awesome profit source for us with a great service over time, like it is for DirecTV today. And then in the U.K., you know it's a more competitive dynamic, but we're really making great progress. And so both are really important to us. And of course, Canada, already, is very successful.","Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And on the U.S. marketing expense, it looks that's come down through the year just on a run-rate basis from where you were in Q1. Is that accurate, and can you just walk us through how you're thinking about your marketing domestically?","Reed Hastings","Well, in markets that we've already got a very large share, there's less need to spend in marketing on the margin than in new markets where we're just getting established. So you're seeing a little bit of that.","David Wells","Yes, we're just gaining in efficiency in terms of word of mouth being more and more effective.","Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then just last clarification. Was that 3 billion number you guys gave in terms of hours viewed, that was -- is that global or just U.S.?","Reed Hastings","All the numbers that we've been talking about are global, so the 1 billion for June, the over 3 billion for the quarter, Q3, are global.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Question about your comments about Hulu and the release, talked about it being a wildcard. And you said in terms of U.S. viewing, Hulu is your closest competitor. And so I just wanted to ask a little more about that. Is there anything that you can add as to why Hulu's programming is more substitutable for Netflix than, let's say, Amazon or HBO? And what makes them a global wildcard?","Reed Hastings","What makes them the wildcard is the ownership owned by 3 of the largest content companies in the world. And in terms of their viewing, I think they're closest to us because they focus on television like we do now, so they've got a good match in that way. And then they have the -- in addition to some of the TV shows, they have some current seasons in sort of catch-up mode, where they have last 5 episodes and then it falls off the service. But -- so they kind of have all -- you can think of it as almost 2 different markets or segments, but they get a lot of viewing on that new TV.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then one more. Just back to, I guess, one of the earlier questions about the studio output deals. It does just seem as though, with Epix and Starz and Fox and Warner, that many of the majors are spoken for. And so is there anything you can add to the comment that you plan to bid for further deals? Is it -- can you talk about other deals that could be coming up? Are they more so smaller studio output deals? Is it -- are we talking, I guess, Universal could be coming up? Can you just give us a little more in terms of elaboration on that comment that you wrote?","Reed Hastings","Sure. There's small ones potentially. Again, if we're -- I think you're probably asking U.S. because that's our biggest market. In the U.S., there's some smaller ones that we can work on. And then there's Universal, Disney, Sony, all of which come up over the next 5 years. But none of them are going to change, they wouldn't be live for us on the new movies in the next 2 years. So I don't think it's probably hugely material to your -- for this, for the long-term, good for us to be a bidder there.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And Dreamworks Animation movies go live soon, is that right? Could you just remind us on that one?","David Wells","It's in 2013, Anthony, so we've got -- it comes up in 2013. So as soon as -- it depends on what your definition of soon...","Reed Hastings","We can find [indiscernible] what's the first one coming through on that deal.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. But it's for any movies released in 2013 as opposed to just starting in 2013. So, right, so it wouldn't actually be -- it would be any theatrical film released in 2013 be eligible for the subsequent Pay TV output window, is that correct?","Reed Hastings","That's correct.","David Wells","Yes, that's right. Anthony, just one final comment. We do have existing deals that have plenty of film output coming through. But you guys focused on additional things that we could add. But there's deals with FilmDistrict, Open Road, Relativity and others that are flowing film to the site now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer & Co.","Jason S. Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Most of the questions have been answered. Just a quick one. So in the release, you do give some color about you don't see voluntary churn as an issue, and you continue to see gross acquisition up on a year-over-year basis. Do you have any regrets, just given the volatility in the stocks, for not putting out gross ads and churn anymore, just given that it would seem like additional metrics might help reduce the volatility in the stock and help people understand? And alternatively, how about providing churn kind of on a trailing 12-month basis or something, just to kind of get your thoughts about that.","David Wells","I don't have any regrets in providing it, Jason. I think the volatility was introduced in the 7 million and not meeting the 7 million, so I don't think that would have helped.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tony Wible from Janney.","Anthony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","In the past, you guys have given penetration of the service in the San Francisco Bay Area. Can you guys give what that adoption number is today for just the streaming component? And the second question is, have you guys seen any change in attitudes on the content producers in light of some of the recent ratings weakness? Have they been more eager to cut digital deals to kind of fiddle what may be a revenue shortfall, or are they becoming a little bit more weary? Any color would be helpful.","Reed Hastings","Tony, in terms of the regional penetration, we used to do that because on the DVD side, we had several years of overnight delivery in the San Francisco Bay Area but not the rest of the country, so it was several years ahead. There's not an equivalent market where we had streaming before another market. So we don't, internally nor externally, focus on a sort of market-level prediction. In terms of the content producers, you got a wide mix. You get -- some of you are concerned for all the reasons that you addressed, and some that are more interested in the digital revenue. So the great news for us is there's no single producer that's a material part of our content. There's many different producers for many different companies. And so that helps us, and they're all looking for the best dollar, and then we're a bidder for that content.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.","Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wondering if you could give us a bit of an update in terms of what you're seeing in the device ecosystem going into the holiday season. What kind of device penetration you're expecting, both television and as well as -- as well as to the extent that there's a mobile metric that you could provide, as well, relative to what we saw last holiday season, particularly for the remote Netflix buttons?","Reed Hastings","Heath, it's Reed. I mean, we'll have more Netflix buttons on more Smart TVs than we've ever had. Smart TVs, as you know, are becoming a larger percentage of all TVs. It's becoming pretty standard and built-in, so that's a significant positive. There's the Wii U releasing shortly, that's a new game console. And so we'll see if that takes off and provides us a special lift. And then mobile is -- been very strong for several years and continues to be strong. I don't see a huge, like, CE-related hockey stick to that part of the business.","Ellie Mertz","Okay, that's going to be the last question for today. Reed, would you like to provide any closing remark?","Reed Hastings","I just want to thank you all for the questions. We're continuing to work very hard and look forward to being in a better place relative to our guidance a quarter from now. We certainly try very hard every quarter, and it doesn't feel great to come in, in the lower half. But it is what it is, and we're moving forward.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today's program. This concludes the program.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) Q3 2016 Results Earnings Conference Call October 17, 2016  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Reed Hastings - Founder and Chief Executive Officer","David Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Ted Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Analysts","Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley","Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus","Operator","David Wells","Welcome to the Netflix Q3 2016 Earnings Call. I am David Wells, CFO and joining me on the company side today is, Reed Hastings, our CEO and Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer. Interviewing us will be Scott Devitt from Stifel, sorry Scott Devitt from Stifel and Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Ben is in his fourth interview before he passes the baton.","Before we get started, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may vary. Ben, I think you have the first question, over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Ben Swinburne","Thank you very much. Maybe we could start by focusing in on the international strength this quarter. Typically, I think you and your colleagues have downplayed the impact of originals, but in the letter you really called out the benefit on acquisitions from your original content, you noted Stranger Things and Narcos. Can you just shed some light on that? Why do you think those are having such an impact on gross adds today and any particular color on markets that might surprise us about where those originals are really driving the business?","Reed Hastings","Sure. If you look over the whole year we've generated 12 million net adds this year. Last year we generated 12 million net adds. So there's been remarkable steadiness measured over the three-quarter period. But if you look at any single quarter, were high, were low and I think what's happening is that when we have some big originals it indefinitely grows the business, but some of that is a pull forward from the natural underlying growth rate.","And so, like if in hindsight if we look back in Q1 we over interpreted that. In Q2 that we over interpreted a low, but it is actually quite steady over the midterm which is basically a fundamental organic growth of this on-demand Internet television. So think of it as it can affect the quarter a lot, it affects the year only a little that is as the total programming is better.","Ben Swinburne","Yes, and you mentioned that the churn I think globally was roughly in line with your expectations as you moved through the quarter. As we just think about the longer-term particularly next year there's probably some logic to say that your net adds could improve next year overall given you are not going to have this elevated, so how do you think about the impact of churn as we move into 2017 and do you have any expectations for price increases at this point?","Reed Hastings","Well, we definitely want to increase net adds, but when I look over the last three or four years at how steady they've been, how hard they've been to move up and similarly that they've been very steady, we're only probably going to be able to make a little progress on increasing year-over-year net adds next year. So, we're fundamentally in this growth cycle that's to do with the Internet, smart TV, people getting used to on-demand, all of those aspects. So we're continuing to make progress. I wouldn't get to the micro variables about this churn or that churn or this show. It's much more of a deep force that's changing the market as more and more people are getting used to Internet television.","David Wells","Yes Ben, if I might add, it's probably useful to talk about U.S. and international a little bit differently. The U.S. is a much older market in terms of our ability to improve that product and have more time. We've kind of settled into a rate of churn that's lower than some of our international markets. They get there over time, but I would say and this in terms of that conversation, we think that there's room left to improve the U.S. as we is that sort of un-grandfathering effect fades out over time. But outside the U.S. we will definitely have more opportunity to improve churn turnover time as we improved these products outside the U.S.","Ben Swinburne","And not to do my Lester Holt impression, but Reed to make you answer the question, do you have any expectation for price increases at this point that you could talk about?","Reed Hastings","No, we have no plans on price increases outside of an inflation adjustment that we do in Brazil on an annual which is the law there.","Ben Swinburne","Okay, thank you.","David Wells","Then to just followup on another part of Ben's question which was international over performance which markets actually ever performed to the extent that you can identify specific markets or even that it was some of the older markets that were over performing relative to new or otherwise.","Reed Hastings","For competitive reasons we're really not going to break out per country markets and results. I would say we're having broad success around international. We're continuing to make those investments. We've got a lot of room to go to improve the service. We mentioned the letter that we've only just now localized Poland and Turkey. That brings us up to 22 languages. YouTube is at 50. So we've got a long way to go in that localization effort.","David Wells","I'll just add on quick, the one of the really encouraging points was our big series that we had going on in the quarter, Luke Cage, Stranger Things, The Get Down, Narcos of course. The great thing is they performed proportionally well globally. So the content is traveling in a way that we\u2019d hoped. Scott and Ben I would say it wasn't any one market, it's okay to talk about the fact that it was a very broad-based performance across multiple international markets so very broad.","Ben Swinburne","And then secondly, the quarterly volatility in the stock and the performance relative to your visibility three months out domestically and internationally, it certainly does seem to accelerate the growing process for folks like me that watch the business on a quarterly basis. And I was just wondering to the extent that Reed you just mentioned that the visibility into the business and the linearity and progression of subscriber growth on an annual basis seems to be more predictable. Is there any thought in terms of providing annual guidance as it relates to subscriber growth instead of quarterly guidance?","Reed Hastings","I'm not particularly, I think we can all see that it's time for me to apologize for the volatility again, this time it's in a good direction, but I think more and more investors are able to look at the multiyear picture and they see the patterns emerging and so then it will be less and less about our guidance.","I think the main thing about one year guidance is we probably don't have any more insights than investors do, whereas in the current quarter when we're two or three weeks into it we do have a little bit of an advantage, so that's why we do the current quarter guidance.","Ben Swinburne","Let me ask you Reed, or David about the X1 integration. Brian demoed it recently at a conference. It looks quite elegant. Do you expect this to be a meaningful contributor in the fourth quarter when you look at your domestic net adds and maybe stepping back Reed do you think these partnerships play a larger role over time in driving your business than they have may be historically?","Reed Hastings","Yes we sure hope so. I mean, it is rolling out this quarter. It's a really nice integration. Comcast users tend to be pretty advanced high income households, so many of them already have Netflix. But having it integrated to X1 will make it easier to use. Our increase is the word-of-mouth and all of these MVPD integrations they help just like being integrated in smart televisions. So think of it as the more devices we're in the easier it is to use, but there's no step function here because again most of those homes probably have Netflix already.","Ben Swinburne","And do you have any concerns at all that the consumer who accesses it through the X1 is not as deep in the Netflix universe from an experience perspective as they might be using it in the smart TV or an app because they are sort of navigating through the XFINITY guide that you, how do you get comfortable that that wasn't going to be a negative, net negative, we felt like it was offset by other positives?","Reed Hastings","Well, there are definitely concerns like that and on the same side and MVPD has concerns about putting on Netflix. You know they'll build more Netflix awareness and we have concerns that the UI, but ultimately where we get together is let's try to learn together what the customer really wants. And if we're thoughtful with each other and we're focused on the customer together, we're both going to be able to prosper. And then on the X1 specifically, when you click on say it's in the guide to the show it brings you into the Netflix user interface for showing you the show and then the post play kicks in where you've got the different followup shows that you could watch on Netflix.","David Wells","And Scott and Ben we have other partners that we've launched with Virgin and others that we've gotten sort of an early preview in terms of how the consumer interacts with the application and as long as we're able to continue to improve the attractiveness and the compellingness of the content and the experience of Netflix we feel like we're \u2013 it's a good partnership.","Reed Hastings","And the X1 is the most powerful CPU box we've ever seen in the MVPD space and so the percentage of streams that are HD and the UI is really spectacular. It's the best that we've ever seen.","Scott Devitt","Reed you mentioned no plans for pricing increasing in the near term, now that you've gone through the un-grandfathering which has created a level of consistency and pricing across the customer base, I'm wondering how you think about pricing increases in the future. It seems like with where the product is priced in the U.S. and internationally today that there's still quite a bit of room and just wondering philosophically how you think about acting on that over time?","Reed Hastings","Well, look we've had a great couple of years at these price points and there's a lot of competition entering the market. What we're focused on is just how do we increase value to the consumer by having more spectacular shows, so that people watch more of Netflix. And over time, that will take care of itself, but we don't want to get overconfident just because we've had a good couple of years here.","David Wells","And there's a small technical carve-out on Reed's answer in terms of we do have some territories in the world, countries of the world, changing their VAT or their GST laws and to the extent that we feel like that's a territory or a country-level response and we can pass that to the consumer, we may do that. It's just, we have a lot of different price points across the world at this point. So it's just a technical addition to Reed's answer.","Scott Devitt","And then David, back to you. In terms of the commentary about material profits, we're now closing in on 2017. You added some language in the shareholder letter about mature process, again, in 2017 and continuing to grow from there. Could you add any numbers to that in terms of what material profits actually means? How we should think about that next year and in coming years?","David Wells","Well, we added some numbers in Q3 and in our guide for Q4, so you're starting to see that operating margin grow and the operating profit and we're growing both revenue and operating margin. So you're starting to see that grow already, but it will grow more and more materially next year and forward.","So I think as we are able to reduce our international losses, we don't have another set of territories that we're launching next year. And as we're able to grow both margin and revenue in the U.S., you're seeing that lift out, but we'll have more specifics to say in Q1 in terms of providing some more guidance on that.","Ben Swinburne","Dave, let me just pick up on that since we're talking about sort of the financial outlook. It looks like this year I think you guys are guiding to about $1.5 billion of free cash burn, which is higher than we were before. I mean, we could talk about what's driving that variance?","And then as you look to next year, $6 billion of content amortization is a 20% growth rate year-on-year versus 50% this year. So we're seeing the content cost grow slow, yet if we look at content obligation, which are over a billion sequentially or your free cash flow guidance, I think it used to be similar next year to this year. The gap seems to be widening between amortization and cash, so maybe just talk about what's driving that, if I have that right?","David Wells","Yes a little bit right, correct, a few points in there, but I would say our former sort of guidance for free cash flow was around a negative $1 billion, $1.2 billion. Now we're saying $1.5 billion for this year. It's a little -it's uncertain next year what that number might be. But I'd be surprised if it grows on a quarterly basis. So I would say as we're able to raise operating income, we'll be able to fund more of that organically.","So we should be able to take more of that inside in terms of - and reduce our free cash flow. But I want to give some level room for the scale of the business. If we're successful and if we grow faster than we expect, then we could expand our content even more than what we consider we would do today. So there's a little bit of matching that to the scale growth of the business.","How successful we are, how big the business we are growing internationally. And I would say in terms of the commitment number that number is up to 14.2 from the 13s before. And that has a lot to do with the expansion of our originals, our licensed originals and our international. So we launched the Rest of the World in January this year.","e continue to add content to all of our international markets as well, so we're seeing that grow. I would expect that to somewhat moderate in the 18- to 24-month period as we go forward. We don't have another international launch to layer on to that. But we are expanding the business so you've got two forces that are sort of counteracting each other. But in terms of our\u2026","Reed Hastings","Ted May be you can go through it a little bit when we do the self-produced content like Stranger Things, all the advantages to it for the business, despite the increased use of cash.","Ted Sarandos","Yes, absolutely. I think when we see something like Stranger Things come across, there's the Simple One, which is it doesn't come with the studio markup it's attached to it. That is just purely expenses not on screen and the other is much, much more flexibility in terms of the rights that we have and the rights \u2013 and how we contain to exploit and how we continue to maintain exclusivity, but we're not seeing the content against our wishes going to other markets in the syndication, in DVD and others.","And we're able to produce it at a very high-quality and also much more efficiently. So to the extent that we can do that, while it does require more cash up front to fund the development process versus a studio who'd take that on, we find it's a great trade-off for cash.","Reed Hastings","And to reconcile back to your question, some of that was already reflected in our forecasting and in our guidance. But I would say, as we get better and we sort of exercise that muscle of our own production, more of that is reflected in our pipeline. So you're seeing that number, that 1.2 number float up to up to 1.5.","Ben Swinburne","And Ted, there was a comment in the letter where you were talking about your recent acquisitions like Quantico and Designated Survivor. We've talked about ensuring early financing. So just kind of connect David's point, are you talking about providing early financing to studio partners in exchange for better windowing globally? Was that what that comment's related to that's impacting the free cash flow timing?","Ted Sarandos","Nothing that has been done to date. It's basically just setting the table, there's a bunch of other different ways that you can get involved as a production partner with our studio partners versus a second window buyer. And some of that would include securing financing rather than having the studios continue to pursue deficit finance models.","Scott Devitt","Got it. 600 hours of original content in 2016 is going through 1,000 hours in 2017. I think David, you recently said at a conference, that you're about 1\/3 to 1\/2 of the way to the 50-50 split between original and third-party content. Where would that 1,000 hours put you in 2017.","David Wells","Well, it's a combination of Ted and I, so I'll pass it to Ted in a second, but I would say, we don't have a target. The 50 - my comment about 50% was more sort of grounding people towards the earlier comments that we made about 20% or 30%. So I'd say we like what we see in terms of the engagement on our originals so we're continuing to expand them. And so we're going to keep growing that. We don't have a magic target there that we're trying to hit. It's more about continued expansion and that mix of our content, being more of originals and less of licensing, but we're still expanding both licensing content is still expanding. Ted, if you want to add to that?","Ted Sarandos","I will say, I would just say, to your point, the licensed business, while as a percentage of business will shrink as an absolute number it will continue to grow for the next couple of years. And there isn't a magic target to David's point. What we want to do this, have really great compelling and differentiated programming for our members and we there through original programming when we do it successfully. So we just want to keep steering the business that way.","Scott Devitt","And do you have any targets for the original content that is produced by your own studio in terms of the ratio that is ultimately produced by your own studio versus licensed originals?","Ted Sarandos","No, similarly, what we're trying not to do is get trapped in the business model to making creative choices, meaning that sometimes someone else owns the IP, and you want to do it right by the viewer by giving them great things to watch, and the only way to do that is do it through a third-party licensed deal. Our financial preference of course, is to produce it through our studios, and when that opportunity will continue to present itself, we're going to increasingly do that as well. But we're not locking into a formula of how much of the programming should be self-produced versus third-party license.","David Wells","Exactly.","Ben Swinburne","Ted, let's just stick with you here for a minute on the content side. Stranger Things and the Get Down, interesting content examples over the summer that got a lot of attention. I believe the Get Down was quite expensive. Didn't seem to get the same size audience as Stranger Things, which I believe was less expensive and attractive economics. Why when you look at the Get Down, is that a good investment for you given the ticket size? And I think you've renewed it for a second season, what is that doing for your business that people might be saying oh the popular price is missing?","Ted Sarandos","Well, it's still to come. It's the second half of the first season, so that's still coming up. We're excited about how it got started. Yes, it's an expensive piece of television, mostly because it's a very large-scale cinematic. The reason why films work around the world is that a kind of attractiveness. So we're still seeing how it's going to unfold for first season, and all of the shows land at a different level of noise in the press and probably depending on what circles you run in, whether or not your friends are talking about it. But we're really very excited about how the show's been performing, particularly in the quarter where we had four shows that turned out to be kind of big event programs for us.","Ben Swinburne","And you've commented before that sort of output deals and Pay 1 deals from a timing perspective are suboptimal, but at the same time, you said really nice things about Disney's product over the years and how they work on your platform. How is the Pay 1 deal performing versus expectations? Are you happy with it? I believe it is a relatively short term deals? You'd like to do more of over time with Disney?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, look I think it's - we expected it to be very popular content and it's turning out to be. So Zootopia was the first really high profile film to come through, and it's performing in huge numbers because it's great kids viewing, beyond being great movie viewing. And the Disney brand are different from any other studio can deliver that kind of tentpole kids programming that the family loves and as long as it continues to perform at those levels, we'd look to expand it with Disney. But I don't think any other studio really can match that output and match those economics and therefore deliver that viewing. So we're going to still look opportunistically. Our films are available for that window. But really continue to put energy behind our original film initiative as well.","Reed Hastings","And in some countries, we have the Disney movie output, Australia, Canada, U.S., but in other countries like in the U.K. we lost the bidding to Sky about two years ago. So it really varies by market. We're one of the bidders and we hope to over time, be one of the biggest bidders so they choose us, but it really does vary by market.","Ted Sarandos","Thank you.","Scott Devitt","Reed, it's been speculated in the media that downloading off-line viewing may become available on Netflix by the end of 2016. Can you provide any insights or clarity on that speculation?","Reed Hastings","Yes, well we said this year is we're open to it. It's something we're looking at. But we have nothing more specific to offer.","Scott Devitt","And then secondly, password sharing in the U.S., you have plans in place that limit that. Just interested still in the enforcement of password sharing in the U.S. in terms of limiting that currently and in the future and then similarly with VPN networks within the international business, your views of that in terms of accessing content outside of countries that have certain geographic rights?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think we've been very successful at finding technological ways of inhibiting the cross-border VPNs, which is roughly like I had mentioned, we didn't win the bidding for the Disney movies in the U.K. so it's clearly not fair to rule out our U.K. subscribers to watch the Disney movies from Canada to the U.S. And so we found with the help of the studio, some more technology that enforced their rights. We tried to get global rights for everything, like How To Get Away With Murder from ABC, because then it's available to everyone, which is clearly what consumers want. In terms of the - what was the other question you had?","Scott Devitt","Password sharing.","Reed Hastings","No plans on making any changes there. Password sharing is something you have to learn to live with because there's so much legitimate password sharing, like with sharing with your spouse, with your kids. So there's no bright line and we're doing fine as is.","Ben Swinburne","Reed, just sticking with the theme of Disney, Bob Iger made some interesting comments a couple of weeks ago, talking about how his bountiful group list of brands ABC, Pixar, Marvel, may not be enough in the future and that distribution, figuring out distribution was important. Do you have any reaction to that? Because it seemed to be aimed at over the top and he does have a relationship with Hulu, which is a potential \u2013 a competitor or may be a bigger competitor over time, but do you have any reactions to those comments?","Reed Hastings","No, I mean they have a great strategy. They've got Hulu. They've got the Major League Baseball initiative and they bought some of that. And then of course, they've got Disney Life, which they operate in a number of countries. So it makes a ton of sense for them to be growing on the OTT side and to figure that out as it does for us to do content. And I think you'll see more - you saw CBS All Access in the last two years, really become a big focus for CBS. So it's just a continuation of that theme.","Ben Swinburne","And Ted, just somewhat related here, I realize this is a hypothetical, but access to content is a big debate for Netflix. And I'm curious if you thought being part of a larger media company would inhibit your ability to acquire content from others in the industry who are competitors to that kind of a company?","Ted Sarandos","Like I said in previous quarters, this kind of frenemy model has existed for decades in television where competing studios produce for one another constantly. And it's really the question I think that our suppliers want to make when they're making decisions around their expansion over the top is, can they make better returns selling to Netflix or building their own thing? And that's both a long-term and a short-term question and currently hypothetical.","Ben Swinburne","Right, thank you.","Scott Devitt","Reed, just following up on competitor comments, Jeff Bezos recently made a comment that possibly Amazon video could be the fourth pillar of Amazon's business and I was just wondering how you think about, you have such an extensive lead in this global build out. How do you think about Amazon long-term as a competitor and Mr. Bezos' comments there?","Reed Hastings","Well, we think about it as share of screen time. And when people are doing other things with their screens be they mobile or television screens, they're not doing Netflix. So Snapchat, YouTube, Facebook video, all of that is it takes a lot of hours, probably much more so than Amazon. But there are so many competitors out there for screen time than we win today. Such a small percentage of total screen time bit moves by specific competitors are unlikely to have a material effect.","What affects us is, can we continue to win affection? And that's through doing all of this incredible content through expanding globally, having all those rights be global eventually, so those are the things we're focused on.","Scott Devitt","Okay and David, you commented in the letter about going to market for acquiring more debt in the coming weeks. You also mentioned at a conference recently that you thought the business was under levered. You mentioned a 5%, I think debt to cap ratio. How do you think about debt longer-term in terms of what that looks like and how you think about it is it net debt-to-EBITDA or otherwise?","David Wells","Yes, my comments at the Goldman Sachs conference about a 20% debt rate or a long-term optimization and cost to capital. I don't think we're talking about by the end of the year, getting to a 20% leverage ratio. So just to talk about sort of a shorter term or a medium-term, we would be looking to raise as needed in terms of funding our content expansion. So we've been pretty clear along the year that we would go-to-market sometime this year to add a modest amount of debt to the balance sheet. And then do that on a recurring basis as needed to fund our content expansion.","So, over time though, we anticipate that we could get and would optimize our cost of capital up to a 20% leverage ratio. And we're talking about a debt to market cap at that point, but I think we will be closer to an EBITDA basis as well because the business is growing and operating income and EBITDA.","Ben Swinburne","David, you guys recently localized your first batch of Rest of World markets. I believe it was Poland and Turkey and it sounds like it's been successful in driving growth in those markets. I guess the obvious question would be, why not move faster on localization? You've got a lot of recent Rest of World launches. Is that a cost benefit analysis or human bandwidth sort of throttle? What is keeping you from moving quicker? And what's the right pace for us to think about 2017?","David Wells","Damn it, move faster, I think it's a quality abstract right? In terms of we want to make sure that we have an eye towards quality as well. We had a couple of rough blog entries about some of our localization and subtitling in some markets and we pay attention to those. So we're moving as quickly as we can, being methodical and thoughtful about those opportunities to localize. And yes, we are pleased with both Poland and Turkey in terms of those impacts.","It makes sense that people want to consume in their language and so it's not going to make sense to localize in a super small territory. But for the larger territories, it's going to make sense and then even for the medium-sized territories. We'll get there eventually. I think it's just a matter of sequencing.","Ben Swinburne","And just to come back to maybe more of the short-term. You had talked earlier this year, about Australia and New Zealand being a difficult comp, I do believe in Q2. You've called out in letter Q4 comp of Spain, Portugal, Italy. Is there any way to kind of put that fourth quarter comp and the second quarter comp in some kind of context, just maybe a thing in the order of magnitude?","David Wells","Well again, back to Reed's earlier comments about for competitive reasons we don't talk specifics about our markets and I probably wouldn't. But I would say that there is a harvesting of the NAND initially when we launched in the market. It is that first launch quarter that we tend to have higher net additions and then that moderates over time and just sort of a run rate that's a little bit more normalized. We have the same thing going on that we highlighted in Q1 where we have Rest of World in the first quarter of this year, was a large number. And when I look at Wall Street's estimates for Q1, they're higher I think they're not taking that into account, so we wanted to call that out so that folks had the benefit of anticipating that.","Ben Swinburne","Any other Wall Street estimates that you'd like to call out?","David Wells","Just growing operating income and just the fact that I think Q1 was a little high relative to our expectations.","Ben Swinburne","Got you, thank you.","Scott Devitt","Ted, as you look at localized content and new markets how easy or difficult is it to find the talent in those markets to produce the content? How successful have you been there? And along that same topic, how do you think about some of these newer markets in terms of how much of that content ultimately, will need to be localized to create that S-curve inflection in some of the markets that were launched in 2016?","Ted Sarandos","So, in terms of successes to date, Club de Cuervos our first Mexican original was quite successful and we're getting ready to bring out the second season. Marseille for our French customers, not only successful in France but successful throughout Europe and got a significant amount of watching in the United States subtitled and dubbed in English.","So we're continuing to push. It's not degrees of difficulty it is just a matter of understanding the production community and the local tastes and who's working and making great films in those markets in some cases and are anxious to make the migration to television that they've been seeing happening in the U.S. So it's difficult in terms of not being on the ground they're usually. But I think we're making trade-offs in terms of the company culture to travel our folks into territory, get to know the folks in the markets, work with the best and brightest filmmakers and television creators, and bring their shows to the global markets through Netflix.","And in terms of localizing for taste, in many parts of the world, U.S. content or English-speaking content localized into local languages has been incredibly successful. In some places where tastes run much more local like Japan, like India, we're certain that will take more of a local approach in terms of licensing and producing more local language content there as well. But I think over time that the taste will fall into line with the kind of desire to see the big spectacular shows that people are talking about around the world no matter where you are.","Scott Devitt","And maybe you can give us some color on [indiscernible] Cable Girls, in terms of being content that may spread beyond their home market?","Ted Sarandos","Yes absolutely, what we tried to do, we're producing, as to Reed's point, we're producing showing now, that are just going into production literally today called Dark in Germany. It is with quite a successful filmmaker whose films have traveled around the world. We've been in the business of buying though films from those filmmakers and making them travel around the world for years. So I think that will continue with the move into multi-episodic series as well.","So we get that scale advantage of being able to take a German show that the German audiences will be very excited about and we know that, that will expand throughout Europe and that we've been really great at finding audiences even in the U.S. in subtitles and dubs, which has been really a niche business for most people, but very mainstream numbers for us.","Scott Devitt","Going back to David's comment about the difficult first quarter comp internationally. You had 130 markets that launched at the beginning of 2016, so it's obvious what the comp issue is. But also in your business, you have that initial wave, but then you have things like localized content, awareness and other factors that actually drive as an example in the Latin American market that inflection that happened two to three years after the initial launch.","So as we look at 1Q 2017, and then think about the 130 new markets, how do we think about that initial bump relative to the potential of these new markets actually beginning to really kick in throughout the year in 2017?","David Wells","Well, as you say, they do - one is going positive in terms of growth and one is negative in terms of initial launch. And what I was trying to call out without actually providing our Q1 guidance in January was back in January of this year, which I tried to moderate the estimates or the expectations coming out of our global launch, we had a very successful launch. In Q1, we had a lot of demand associated with that launch that started moderating into Q2.","And I think people saw the success of Q1, and really raised their numbers in Q2and trying to get a little bit ahead of that in the sense that we had a very successful launch in Q1 of this year that is going to be very difficult to replicate. Some of that was pent-up demand and we're not going to be able to do that.","That's not to say that many of our other markets are growing in terms of growth. It's just right now, in terms of what we see that large launch is going to overwhelm some of the growth of the other markets. So we still like what we're seeing in those markets. We're growing year-on-year in some moderate.","We've had very different, a wide variety of results across markets. We've had markets that slowed down and then accelerate in growth. So if you abstract that I think the general trend is the world is embracing Internet television and we're riding on a very strong kind of tailwind of technological change. And that is definitely intact.","Scott Devitt","Thank you.","Ben Swinburne","David, any color on how the 2014 markets are ramping or at least France and Germany in particular, I think there has been some concern in the marketplace that France isn't going well, I think you closed an office there and in Germany Amazon seems to be doing quite well? So can you just talk about how the model may or may not be working in those 2014 markets?","David Wells","Let me disconnect one thing there, in terms that we did choose to consolidate some of our French staff into our Amsterdam staff, but that had nothing to do with the market whether the market was growing or not. That had everything to do with the synergy of communication and how the teams are working together.","And then in terms of the other markets gain we don\u2019t say much specifically about our markets for competitive reasons, but you would have to take my earlier comment about the fact that we saw very broad sort of outperformance relative to expectations in this quarter or in Q3, that would be inclusive of those markets. So I think we're pleased with how things are going.","Ben Swinburne","Great, shifting gears back to you Ted, you hired, hope I am pronouncing this right, Bela Bajaria from NBC recently and one of her mandates is unscripted. So I'm just wondering is unscripted going from something that you have a couple of bets in, which is something more strategic for you when you think about 600 hours to 1,000, how much is unscripted driving growth? Is it a material part of the plan for next year, and why?","Ted Sarandos","It is not a material part for next year, but I imagine it could be a growth \u2013 it will be growing over the next several years. It's been \u2013 it's an area viewing that people around the world in joy. The content travels well. It is efficient to produce. The current sources of second window unscripted programming are under a great deal of pressure from the cable operators not to sell their content off of their own universe because many of the episodes seemed to be interchangeable.","So being able to have a good steady flow of high-quality unscripted program is something we want to focus on because I think we can do it well and efficiently and may be elevated in a way that it would travel even more than it does today.","Ben Swinburne","And just if I can follow up quickly on unscripted. It would seem to be not obvious for the on-demand binging consumption model. But maybe you've had some experience so far with some your talk stuff or your comedies that maybe suggested is, I don\u2019t know what can you tell us about that?","Ted Sarandos","There is certainly some benefits from the scale off of those shows, but our ability to producing maybe we have a lot of data and a lot of not a lot of data and a lot of content that gets watched and what travels and what doesn't, what gets repeated and what doesn't and it gives us a higher degree of confidence today than we had a couple of years ago and our ability or even desire to produce at the space, but it is a segmented programming.","We keep opening up new segments of programming, the way we did with talk shows last year. The way we will in the first quarter with Ultimate BeastMaster, our first competition show. So we're pressing into some new areas of the business all the time to bring new, unique, elevated and differentiated program into our members.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you.","Scott Devitt","Reed, investors get caught up a lot in the 60 million to 90 million household number in the U.S. and as an indicator or predictor for success in international markets, overtime, if you can do it in the U.S., you can do it internationally, and if you can't, you can't. You're running a little north of 4 million subscribers in 2016 from 5 million in 2015. How do you think about that business in terms of the trajectory in over say, the next 1, 3, 5 years in terms of how many subs that you can put on the business in the U.S. on an annual basis?","Reed Hastings","You know we have to take it year-by-year. It depends on how well we execute. Do we have more Stranger Things where it breaks through and everyone feels like they got to get in, Luke Cage, Get Down, Narcos. We have a show coming The Crown that some of our most impressive television I have ever seen and so I think November 4, when you ask yourself about 60 million to 90 million, when you watch that show, it's going to seem quite achievable. But it's all hangs on how well we execute and we're just going to work really hard on that front.","Scott Devitt","And following along those lines in terms of the relevance of content to drive subscribers given that that's why subscribers watch the shows on Netflix, on a P&L basis anyway, the growth in content spend has begun to very much leverage relative to the growth in the digital revenue stream. And I\u2019m just wondering, as we look at that in 2017 over 2016, and then 2018, 2019 and 2020, is that something that we can expect to continue into the future? Is there a point in time at some level of spend at which you think you've built a complete enough portfolio that, that leverage actually significantly accelerates?","Reed Hastings","No, we'll keep investing in growing the content spend even domestically for quite a long time. We see an ability to continue to please consumers with a wide range of content. And so I think if you're trying to model the business long-term, you should think of content and how it's viewed and brand love always continuing up in the U.S. and internationally for a long time. I mean, I'll take two more questions, one from each of you.","Ben Swinburne","Great, I know we beat un-grandfathering to death last quarter, but if I can come back one more time before I sign off. David, you had talked last quarter about elevated churn even among members that were not seeing a price increase. And I think this quarter you talked about churn being generally in line with expectations. I just want to see if you had any color on that piece the un-grandfathering noise continued to elevate churn?","And then I'll just ask my followup. On the fourth quarter, just want to confirm the only un-grandfathering that we have left is the $1cohort is that \u2013 is that accurate?","David Wells","It's accurate on the last one. We have some sort of older generation devices that are difficult to message as well, so I think that defines sort of the last few cohorts the people left. And then back to your sort of primarily question in terms of what did we see in the quarter relative to our expectations and relative to prior quarters and actuals? I would say, I mentioned earlier in the interview, that we still see some effect from the un-grandfathering. So there is a bit of an overhang from the price change. It's starting to fade, and we expect that to continue to fade but we do think there's opportunity to improve that going forward in terms of next year.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you.","Scott Devitt","Reed, last one an open-ended question. You've talked a lot historically about the opportunities in Internet TV and have been very right in terms of the direction that the industry has gone with where you're business is now, I was wondering if you can just share some updated views in terms of the way you think the industry progresses over the next 5, 10, 20 years in terms of what wins and what loses?","Reed Hastings","Well we generally think of the growth of Internet TV like the growth of the mobile phone, that is fixed line telephony was an amazing invention, 100 years of development and brought incredible benefits to society and the same thing is true with linear TV. It's been an amazing innovation, but the age of linear is starting to fade and it's going to be replaced by Internet. And those firms like the BBC or CBS, that's doing all access that's invest heavily, I think will move into the future on Internet consumption. I think you'll see Internet growth generally more broadband kind of fiber optic to every village and town.","Those general trend lines, the growth both of YouTube-type advertising supported services, Facebook video, Snapchat. So you're just going to see these new scenarios everywhere. And eventually, movies and TV shows will be global, ubiquitous, some amazing budgets. So I think you have to think big about the future. We're closing in on 100 million members, but I remind everyone at Netflix that Facebook and YouTube have 1 billion daily actives. And so, in many parts, we are just so small compared to those other Internet video firms and we have a lot of catch-up to do and that's again investing in our content and making it globally interesting and compelling which we're working on.","So there's a lot out there. But we only just have to take it year by year, and it's tremendous fun inventing the future.","Operator","Scott Devitt","Thank you.","David Wells","Thank you, gentlemen."],"15632":["Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call July 21, 2014  5:00 PM ET","Executives","David Wells - CFO","Reed Hastings - CEO ","Ted Sarandos - CCO","","Analysts","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","","David Wells","Welcome to the Netflix Q2 2014 Earnings Interview. I am David Wells, CFO. I am joined today on the Company side by Reed Hastings, our CEO; and Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer. Interviewing us today will once again be Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan and joining us today for the first time will be Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson who receives the baton from Rich Greenfield.","We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may vary. ","Our first question comes from Doug. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Doug.","Question-And-Answer Session","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Great, thanks, David. Welcome, everybody, and thank you to Netflix for having Michael and me host today's conference call. So our first question, just on international strength, Reed, if you could talk about what drove the international strength in subscribers in Q2? You called out a couple things in particular, in terms of the Virgin deal, in terms of a set top box integration, and then also smart TV viewing in Latin America, so was hoping you could add a little bit more color on those, as well.","Reed Hastings","What we\u2019ve seen really is just tremendous adoption of on-demand viewing consumers around the world whether it\u2019s Argentina, Brazil, Finland, the UK it\u2019s been really quite consistent. So there are some accelerators that we talked about with the Smart TV. But there is probably no better symbol of how strong is on-demand phenomena that to tell you that during the World Cup we were concerned that we would see a drop off around the world, particularly in Brazil and that we didn\u2019t want to over read it. If we saw a drop off in net adds and growth and what was incredible is just how straight our line of net addictions were in Brazil during the World Cup. And that\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re specifically doing, it\u2019s really this growing demand for control and for the consumer be able to click and watch what they want. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019re stepping up on the international expansion just because we really see that this is an enormous moment in history as on-demand Internet services are coming to the floor around the world.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","David, can I ask you one on incremental margins. If we look at your margins in the first half of the year, you\u2019re growing your margins incrementally 45%, dropping down from revenues to margin to profits. Why don\u2019t you think margins can continue growing at the 400 basis point range that you saw and why did you identify different levels the 100, 200 and 400 basis point level of improvement. What control those potential margin levels?","David Wells","Well, Michael I don\u2019t know if I agree with your premise I don\u2019t think we said that margins will stop growing or will shift to 200. What we said is when we get to 30% we want to give ourselves a little bit of leeway to reevaluate. There is a number of things that we\u2019ll weigh and balance and that is the competitive set what we want to spend on content, how we want to grow that, how our average subscription price is growing with the recent price changes, it\u2019s still very early on those. So there are a number of things that will balance out. And we want to give ourselves a leeway to back-off a little bit if we think that\u2019s the right trade-off to make in terms of spinning more on content. It doesn\u2019t mean that we will, it just means that we\u2019re trying to create a little bit of room for ourselves especially with all of these unknowns as we get closer to next year.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Okay, thanks. And Reed, in the letter, you talked about the price changes having a minimal impact on growth overall, but can you just provide a little bit more color? Do you think, in terms of the nuances, did it impact churn, or help reduce churn in any way during the quarter? And what's your view on the way the price change could impact going forward?","Reed Hastings","I think we\u2019ve seen really the impact of the price change go through already so it\u2019s pretty nominal, both in terms of acquisition which in principle becomes a little bit harder because of the roughly $1 higher prices, or in retention which could be a hair better from the grandfather subs. But it\u2019s only $1 difference. So, I really think it\u2019s background noise which is what we want it to be as we want to think of what we do is we\u2019re steadily improving the content and the growth in the word of mouth and that when we make a small change in price and handle it appropriately it really makes no noticeable effect in the business. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re thrilled with that outcome.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","Okay. David, I wondered if looking your guidance for 3Q, would you have gotten to breakeven internationally in the third quarter if it wasn\u2019t for the new market launches and as we think about the growth rate and cost in the third quarter as sustainable into the fourth quarter internationally.","David Wells","So in terms of our international guide I think you can see that most of that is our new markets. So yes we would be pretty close to breakeven if not a breakeven for Q3 in our existing markets. And then the second part of your question was again, could you repeat that?","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","Well if you look at inflation in Q3 from let\u2019s say breakeven to where you\u2019re guiding to. Should we assume that continues to the fourth quarter, it seems a logical assumption that won\u2019t be a lot of change?","David Wells","I see what you mean. Well just to remind you that our launch is that we\u2019re saying are in the back half of the third quarter, so they are not a full quarter of content spending. Let me get that full quarter of content spending for the first time in Q4. So our typical pattern has been to grow content spend from the launch quarter. Marketing, it balloons a little bit in that first quarter of growth as we launch a brand new brand in those markets. Then it tends to settle down into a run rate and that should give you some trending on our international costs.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Great, and Ted, just perhaps one more question just related to Q2, and then we'll move on. Can you comment on Orange Is the New Black? You talked about in the letter how it became the most watched show in every country during Q2. Are there any other updates that you can provide around usage metrics, and then maybe talk about what you saw in Orange in Q2 perhaps versus the second season of House of Cards a quarter earlier?","Ted Sarandos","Well I think it continued the positive that we saw from House Of Cards, meaning that the excitement from the second season is amplified from like this show that people don\u2019t really know a lot about yet or in the case of House of Cards before we launched that no one even knew what a Netflix original series was going to be like. So here you have had a large pool of people around the world anxious for that second season. It starred in the Social Media Buzz that was really phenomenal for that launch. It gives us a lot of confidence for the outline seasons, the original series as well.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","I have one for Ted and for Reed together. So last week FOX announced interest in acquiring Time Warner, two companies you know a lot about. If a merger were to occur, I think that would affect your negotiating leverage to get acquired and original programming. And this is a deal that you would block, Reed given the scale of the TV and film output from both companies.","Ted Sarandos ","Michael I\u2019d say that FOX and Warner are both pretty powerful companies today, particularly in the area of original production for television and film. So I don\u2019t know how that changes much in terms of coming together. Wouldn\u2019t want to make a lot of speculation about what\u2019s driving it. Probably there is a lot more to do with cable negotiations in sports than consolidating power reproduction. This is very difficult to corner the market on creativity or ideas. So I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s effecting too dramatically in these early days.","David Wells","And Michael I don\u2019t have any speculations for you on what we would do, there is not even a deal between those companies. So we\u2019ll take it as it comes, but as Ted said the more that we\u2019re working directly with producers the less vulnerable we are to aggregation in the big content suppliers.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","And just following up there in terms of content and on studio related. Do you feel like you have the need to own your own studio production capabilities to protect yourself from some of the risks potentially associated with fewer production houses to buy from? Would you create your own studio from scratch perhaps would have made sense to the acquisitive in this area?","Ted Sarandos ","I think a lot of it is tactical in terms of how you go about the production cost. Do you want to own the infrastructure versus hire it or rent it and you\u2019ll make those decisions as you go. There are probably some advantages, the intermodal and we\u2019ll keep exploring them as we own more and more of our production as we go forward. But think about it as the difference between renting sound stage time or owning the stage itself, it really depends on the volume of production you\u2019re planning to ramp up.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","Reed can I shift you to the net new debate which I know you shared a lot already. But in your opinion what\u2019s the right regulatory approach for the U.S.? And should the FCC regulate the broadband industry as entitled to service. So I want to know if you could effect change of regulatory view, how would you do it.","David Wells","Well I think the most practical thing would be for the FCC to make it a merger condition policy of strong net new trial including no fee interconnect, so that\u2019s our main focus is around the merger acquisitions. In terms of the broad policy framework, it\u2019s tough in the U.S. because there doesn\u2019t seem to be much chance that the Congress will pass a new law and so then you\u2019ve got some imperfect instruments in title 2 and section 706. So the fundamentals though is really for the FCC has the power in merger conditions and clearly there are going to be a lot of mergers to be able to institute our strong net trial. So we think that\u2019s the most pragmatic approach.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","And just following up there Reed, last week in your comment letter to the FCC. You said that the Internet has had a cross roads and there is a risk of going down the path toward cable TV. Can you talk about what you mean there and a little bit more detail then and why you think the other road is better for the industry.","Reed Hastings","Sure in cable industry there has been constant conflict between the networks and the cable distributors leading to black outs and brown outs trying to figure out pricing. And we would hate to see ISPs brownout or blackout certain Internet sites in while they tried to extract payments. That just ruins the consumer experience this idea that when you sign up the Internet you can get everywhere. So, it\u2019s finding an industry structure that works for everybody, that allow there to be great investment and super high speed broadband but also a stable understood interconnect structure that then makes it able so that consumers can get all the services they want and those doing content services like ourselves and Hulu and others can innovate without the fear of being taxed, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re so big on the no fee interconnect.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","Reed, its Michael. Following up on that is the media analyst here. I would say if you look at the power retrans is the content owner that has the power over the dump high. When I look at we are growing as a company, we\u2019re making more investments in original content and exclusive content you are the content owner. So why do you think you won\u2019t be able to, why don\u2019t you think you only have the power to force the pipes into putting the line wherever you want because you are the content to what I am subscribing to?","Reed Hastings","Sure. There is a lot of ways to think about and we do get asked in the cable business so for example HBO is our peer in the cable business they actually charge the distributor rather than pay the distributor. And so the question comes up, should we over time be charging ISVs for the privilege of carrying our data to their customers and charging for that. And again I don\u2019t think so, I think the Internet really has this different much more open architecture than classic cable where we need in the middle we bring the bits to where they want, we don\u2019t charge them, they don\u2019t charge us, both sides base very open structure and I think then you get more competitors for Netflix frankly. But what you get is this open vibrant system. The Internet has been so famous while metro is the tradition that we grow up in and that we\u2019re trying to see carry forward. And I am optimistic about it frankly.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And Reed, actually for David let me switch gears a little bit, but sticking with net neutrality. If the condition in the case arises where we don't have strong net neutrality going forward, how do investors get assurances that the business is protected, in terms of cost, perhaps interconnection costs over time? And really thinking about it both on a short-term basis, and then over the long term.","David Wells","On a short term basis I think there is great assurances in the sense that we\u2019ve been able to sign these immediate interconnect deals and still able to achieve our margin targets. And when our guidance implies these costs are embedded. So I do think it\u2019s about a long term cost and we\u2019ll see where we go from here in terms of years. I think for Netflix content is our largest cost. It dwarfs all the other costs so it think it\u2019s really about profit margin at that point and in terms of how much margin goes to a delivery cost versus other cost in our business, we would rather spend it on content.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","Reed just to be our last unless my after net neutrality, you referenced the Virgin relationship in the UK as being helpful. Can you give us any more specifics on the rates of growth you get when you become closer to the distributor or the MSO? So anything you could talk about maybe growth rates in UK pre and post the Virgin relationship.","Reed Hastings","Well, we\u2019re going to get live on Virgin for about six months. So what we can say is the initial reaction has been positive. It\u2019s not transformative to ballpark and I don\u2019t think for either of us. But it\u2019s great for consumers on input number one that\u2019s their default input to be able to use Netflix on the device, the Virgin set top that they use most of the time. So I would say it\u2019s an incremental positive. When you look, there is so many new smart TVs coming that have Netflix built in. There is going to be lots ways access Netflix, the Chromecast, Apple TV, Smart TV, NBPD Set Top. So, it\u2019s a nice positive but it\u2019s not transformative.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","David, a question just around free cash flow. As you're ramping up originals here fairly aggressively, and you obviously mention a number of titles that are in production, and as that ramps up into 2015, can you just help us understand how we should think about the impact in terms of working capital around originals, and how we should think about that future trajectory of free cash flow versus EPS going forward? Thanks.","David Wells","Sure. It\u2019s no different than we\u2019ve said before, which is the two main things that are pressuring cash use, our content expansion predominantly our produced content as well as our international expansion. So Doug I don\u2019t think anything has changed, I will say that we\u2019ve been able to bubble on sort of at flat to slightly up in terms of free cash flow if we expand more aggressively internationally obviously that will pressure a little bit. And as we continue to expand original content and produced content, that will expand. So investors should expect to see a little bit of dip in Q4 and Q1, and it will be tied to that expansion of content. And in the future it really depends on how fast we expand internationally.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","Ted, following on that answer how does the content offerings defer domestically and internationally, how is the local language factor play in due to source more locally than we probably would expecting France and Germany versus Canada and the UK, so any update on your strategies about sourcing content internationally.","Ted Sarandos","Michael, what\u2019s been really great is how much the content travels. So, in all of the international territories and France and Germany, appear to be that much different. It\u2019s somewhere between 10% and 20% local and mostly the rest of the international product, mostly Hollywood product that people want to see around world.","So we do have a heavy focus on accessing the local content that matters, and establishing local relationships with local producers. In every market we imagine when we get out to some more exotic parts of the world that that may skew a little more local but today it has been well within that 20% local range.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","So a question on international expansion, perhaps for Reed. So if we think about the six markets that are coming here over the next few months, it feels like there are some specific nuances to some of them, perhaps Germany, which is more of a debit card than a credit card market for example, France, which has some protections around its own local content. Can you talk about some of those nuances, and how they are likely to impact your business?","Reed Hastings","","Well I think Doug in every market around the world there are new answers. Just to give you an example in Brazil there is a tremendous payment complexity plus the leadership of TV Global. In Canada, there is the CRTC; in the UK the BBC is quite unique in its role in society. So think of us as adapting to the local conditions in each case. As you point out in Germany there is a number of aspects that are unique as well as in France and we\u2019re going to see this as we continue to expand beyond France and Germany and other countries that their unique conditions in every market. And our challenge and excitement around company is becoming a great global company where we really understand the new each of these markets and do a great job for consumers around the world. So there are some challenges there, there is no question I am sure we\u2019ll stop our toes on something and pick up the pieces. Like with payments in the beginning of Lat-Am three years ago.","We\u2019ve had a lot of confidence about being able to figure out the issues once we get started. So that\u2019s why our view is we should get in the market we should get in the market, we should figure things out and then figure out those issues again around payments or other things in Germany and France.","David Wells ","Following on the answer to France for Reed. There is a government policy in France called perceptions and you\u2019re familiar with it. Where you have to fund a certain number first local productions and also pay taxes to authority. So how did you get around that issue, where in France is very protectionist about the content that could be shown in?","Reed Hastings","","We\u2019re not really trying to get around anything, we want to invest in French society and French contact. And we want to give an avenue for French content to get out around world. There is some amazing French story tellers as a great French movie business, TV shows are growing. We\u2019re looking to do some investments in France with production that we can do, we could joke about it the House of Cards House of their Side, that\u2019s not literally the kind of thing that would be. But something like that where it\u2019s a big French production but it\u2019s not just for France it\u2019s for the whole world. We\u2019re actively licensing again fresh content.","Thinking what we\u2019re trying to do is connecting the world as some of the world\u2019s best content brought to the world\u2019s Citizens. And that\u2019s really motivating for Ted for me for all the people at Netflix. And so we definitely got to work with French society and with the assumptions and beliefs that they have and we want to be loved in France by French consumers because we understand French content because we give it a bigger home and because we\u2019re bringing some variety, like U.S. television shows, things that historically have been under distributed. Ted do you want to add to that?","Ted Sarandos","","Yes I would just say for all of that protectionism and all of the cultural favors that the Mentalist is the most popular television show in France. So the taste don\u2019t run that far off when you get down to the consumer. But I am really excited to have France look at us as somebody who brings opportunity to the market not there to harm the market in anyway. And that we will employ French production employees and create great content in France but as Reed said for around the world. And we currently even have Gaumont is a French company that produces Hemlock Grove 1 now and is about to go into production with Narcos. A lot of our animation projects are co-productions with French production companies. So this is not new ground for us. We\u2019re really excited about it.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Ted, just following up there, can you give us an update on certain content that you have as originals in the US and other parts of the world, but that you don't currently own on a first run basis in Germany and France? I believe such as House of Cards and your thoughts just on how material that is to the service?","Ted Sarandos","Well Doug because we\u2019re expanding our original so rapidly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily detrimental, we love to have House of Cards in the first window France and Germany but it\u2019s been very successful for others there. But Orange is the new Black we\u2019ll be launching in for the first time in those territories and all of our going forward series will also be there. And we\u2019re back filling by having some other first run content like from From Dusk Till Dawn and other series that will premier in France and Germany for the first time on Netflix as well.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","Ted do you have to change the way you source content? Would it be more efficient for the company to buy media going forward? So do you think about that and what\u2019s the impact to the business model by doing that?","Ted Sarandos","The more we expend the more that you reach those tipping points of the economics makes sense to buy out the rest of the world for different projects. When we first got in remember we were taking a pretty big bet on House of Cards right up the bet, so we\u2019re kind of hedging it a bit by leaving some of those other territories on the table and as we have gotten more and more international and more and more original, we are picking up those territories today.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","","David, a question just about the overall addressable market internationally, and I think you go into a little bit of detail in the letter, but you mentioned 700 million broadband households, I believe, globally. We know the 90 million or so in the US, and adding -- expanding international here to 180 million. How are you thinking basically about the rest of the TAM, and the ability for that to grow here over time?","David Wells ","","Those numbers 730 is Kagan\u2019s number there is another number that 800 that\u2019s Price Waterhouse\u2019s, so around that range of 700 million to 800 million are today is broadband households. In all of these territories, mainly outside the U.S. in most of the develop markets in Europe are growing at a much faster pace. So those numbers are going to grow and grow. For us if you look at China about a quarter of that 730, we\u2019re addressing a large swap in Europe and we would look to further that in Europe later if we\u2019re successful.","And so we like what we see as Reed said earlier we\u2019re really do see widespread adoption and join in Netflix as a product, beyond demand and aspects the great content that\u2019s produce in any market and the exiting aspects of us as a global distribution platform are being able to bring great content to markets in the U.S. to markets in Europe and Asia we like the prospects of our opportunities there.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","","David just mentioned China is a large source potential broadband household, how do you get into China, what you\u2019re thinking about potential timing of the China expansion.","Reed Hastings","","Well, let David address that.","David Wells","","I think it\u2019s early. It\u2019s fair to tennis match that right back at me, Michael, but I think it\u2019s pretty early, I think my reason that I would say it\u2019s the quarter is it's conspicuously large, and it's conspicuously a growing and very strong economy. So look for the future, in terms of an answer from us in China.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","","Great, just shifting gears into the US streaming business. As you approach 40 million streaming subs in the US toward the end of this year, and you're looking toward that lower end of 60 million to 90 million that you talk about, how do you think the mix of net adds changes between gross adds and churn going forward, and does lower churn really become an even stronger driver of the business?","David Wells","","I think that obviously we do think that we\u2019ve got growth in both so it would be growth in reducing term or improving our retention and in bringing more and more people into the market I mean all originals have the potential as we produce more and more contact to sort of bring more people into Netflix and new types of subscribers into Netflix.","So I think overtime Netflix will set more and more to people who are coming back and people who are staying longer just as we penetrate deeper into the U.S. but we still think we got some room to grow on both side.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","","Ted when you figure that your U.S. mix what you think the mix of expenses would be between originals, acquired, TV acquired film and what the right balance of spending across three buckets.","Ted Sarandos ","","Overtime Michael I love if you think about it most of that because we have a lot of programming like Breaking Bad that in the UK it\u2019s a Netflix\u2019s original show and in other territories it\u2019s a license. And we move pretty firmly in and out of that so big into our margin guidance is our content spend and we want to move a lot of it to originals most of because we have founded it\u2019s given us new brand strength as those shows have been successful and they continue to prove to be successful and let them move down that further.","But there is a lot of times where we will premiere the sequel to Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul; we're going to premiere that everywhere outside the North America Netflix. So that\u2019s kind of the reasonable ratio and kind of not for us in terms of how we treat it.","So really if you want to think about it is total content expense and we want to get the content to consumers love and right now we\u2019re having success in that area and we want to keep pushing down that path. So there is no optimal mix in that way.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","","Ted, can you walk us through what the release schedule looks like for originals just through the rest of 2014 and then into 2015? And I realize it's tough maybe to choose between your kids here, but what new shows are you particularly excited about?","Ted Sarandos ","","Well we\u2019ve listed out all the premiere dates. The ones coming up in August, where we have BoJack Horseman, which is our first foray into adult animated comedy. It has Will Arnett and Aaron Paul voicing it, it\u2019s very funny, and it\u2019s again it\u2019s a new broadening of what we\u2019re doing on originals that\u2019s pretty exciting. And then we have the fourth season of the Killing also coming out in the couple of weeks and we're also really excited about in August.","The one that\u2019s very ambitious on the large scale and we\u2019ve been really thrilled with how it\u2019s been coming in is Marco Polo that we\u2019re filming in Malaysia right now. It\u2019s a very large scale show we filmed in Venice, in Malaysia, in Kazakhstan like we\u2019re trying to do things that would be very difficult to do on conventional television Marco Polo is a very ambitious project that\u2019s coming together really beautifully we\u2019re really excited about that for Q4.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","","I wonder from when you first started you basically built a service on library acquired content. You've evolved to exclusives and originals. I wonder when you look at usage trends today. How important are the library achieve shows that you have won the first round of negotiations with studios persons I thinks are buying out so to talk a bit about the heavy usage trends among your consumers as you\u2019ve gotten longer to the process?","Ted Sarandos ","","The great thing about this time that we are in right now Michael is that content is still great and there is so much are being produced you can barely watch it all in our lifetime. So, the library becomes important because most people have never seen it, so it\u2019s new to them. We are producing and bringing out original programming and about as fastest basis we can and maintain in the kind of quality that we have been able to. So, we are going to continue pushing on that path and originals is going to be a important component of that all the time but we will also I think we would always be a very valuable ultimate buyer for networks because so much of that content is never been seen by the public.","So we are excited that we will to continue to play in that space where pretty popular at May screenings, we commit when they are showing those projects for us to potentially be a first window partner for those shows outside of the U.S. and because we are not lead to we are only going to put on the shows that we produce that gives us the opportunity to put a lot of content part of consumers that they love regardless of the business model.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","","Ted, I just wanted to follow-up on a point that you said earlier, just around contracts. And I guess I'm curious how the initial kind of contracts around House of Cards and Orange may differ from what you're signing for new original series now, and is it fair to think that you are getting all of the international or global rights basically for these new originals that are coming out?","Ted Sarandos ","The key for us that is we are trying to make sure we have we can control the exploitation in those territories particularly the ones that we are heading to. So, you can either get through that by owning the show outright or by negotiating to control of those rights with the content owners and have them as partners and I\u2019m open to either one of those that give us those kind of controls to that when we open a new markets we can launch those titles with us, if they are coming up at a time that makes sense, given them that we put so much branding power behind those shows leading up to the launch.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","Reed, can I ask you about international competition? You really enjoyed a first mover advantage in your first markets you went in to but now you see a lot of European markets where this two or three services outside UK, let\u2019s say in Germany and France, trying to do what you are doing, how do you think you would be able to differentiate yourself in the competition levels in terms of those markets where someone like a Sky, Sky Deutschland is already trying to achieve the same type of service?","David Wells","","Well, it\u2019s a bit revisionist history, Michael because to say that we were first mover, because if you think about the UK, LOVEFiLM had been there for seven years, developed 2 million subscriber base, bought by Amazon infused with sustaining content was a tremendous significant competitor to us two and a half years ago when we launched. But what we did is we focused on television content, they focused on movies, we focused on incredible streaming performance that you never got buffering, working with all the integrators. And fundamentally it\u2019s a focus thing, which is, it\u2019s everything for us whereas this was a project for someone within a larger company and then now two and a half years later of course LOVEFiLM has folded up as a brand so we are tremendously excited about the opportunity to continue to move forward.","We have also had Sky from the beginning in the U.K. we are very aggressive competitors, lots of different aspects of their service. But what it\u2019s turned out is that we can grow very substantially in the U.K. and Sky is untouched similar to here in the U.S. how we are growing rapidly but MVPD as a total is untouched. So I think, the big MVPD is recognizing them you know Netflix is one more network just like YouTube it doesn\u2019t change our outcomes in any material way and we have again great focus, global R&D and those are the things that we look forward to. But in the end of the day there may well be room for several of these services in the market with different types of content that each have a exclusive content, if you think historically in the U.S. like HBO and Showtime, they are not really competing against each other except for content they are competing to get part of someone\u2019s entertainment budget and in the same way we are like that in the new markets. So, we don\u2019t need to beat some new competitors, we just need to create an incredible service that all of that all of the citizens in each country that we serve want to be part of Netflix.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","","Great. Ted, can you talk more about your plans for Chelsea Handler's new show coming up, and does this signal more of a move into live streaming, and now that you're moving more into late night talk, is there more of a strategy potentially around sports content over the long term?","Ted Sarandos ","I think Chelsea is going to be a kind of great representative of the kind of concept the programming on Netflix because her show is a lot about the entertainment world, movies and television and culture and we think that it will be a great addition to Netflix in 2016. We just filmed her comedy special in Chicago and as you are going to do four more in 2015 and the show itself you should think about it is the way that people are not watching scripted programming the way they used to but also not watching these late night talk shows the way they used to. I mean they are not watching them at 11:30 they are watching in days, weeks sometimes in months later online or on stacked episodes on DVR. So what we are hoping to do with Chelsea and her team is to create a show that\u2019s built closer to the way people are going to watch it, the way we have done with serialized dramas where we to took out the commercial breaks and the cliffhangers and really produce it the way people watch. And we have got a lot of time between now and then to work through all the format details and Chelsea is incredibly excited and we are really excited about her brand and we think it\u2019s going to be great for us. And in terms of your other question, I think about it as more of a continuum that this is not that instantly perishable content by any stretch but it\u2019s to your point it\u2019s more perishable than a movie but the economics kind of level that out for us.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","","David and Reed, this question on international margins, do you think that international margins in their end state will look like U.S. margins or anything structurally different about your international businesses or the scale versus the U.S. activities?","David Wells ","","This is, David, I will take that one. No, there isn\u2019t. We have gotten this question before. There is nothing really different about our international businesses that we can\u2019t achieve U.S. like margins or better in some of our markets. It really is about the competition in those markets and in terms of what consumer alternatives are there and how much we are able to charge and the value that deliver to these consumers but there is nothing structurally challenging about those markets that we can\u2019t achieve equal or better.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","","David, just a question on the balance sheet. Can you help us understand how you think about the right amount of cash to have on the balance sheet, just given international expansion and then current free cash flow generation? And as part of that, we see the streaming content obligations move from $7.1 billion to $7.7 billion, which I think is one of the more significant moves that we've seen in recent quarters. And just how we should interpret that?","David Wells","","The content obligations are a little bit lumpy, depending upon what we do on produced contents, so I would look at it sort of over a year-on-basis basis rather than a sequential basis. But you are right, they have gone up some, they will continue to go up as we expand and grow our produced content line and to some extent our international expenses as well as we signed up for multi-year deals, those obligations roll-on to the table as well. So, the right amount of cash, cash is not an inoculator in terms a prolonged competitive battle. It does help in terms of short-term that does help the business in terms of making producers and others feel good about our balance sheet position. I would say in general, I was a bit worried earlier on say two, three years ago when we\u2019re going through 2011 that we\u2019re little thin and I thought we will be burning at faster than we actually did.","So, for a while there I was a bit of little in terms of saying, telling investors, we are going to start burning, we are going to start burning and we really didn\u2019t. We grew it a little bit. We stayed flat for a while, so I think I am pretty solid on telling folks, look in Q4 and in Q1, we are going to start using cash a little bit more as we expand internationally and as we grow our content spend. And in the future, it will really depend on our international, on the pace of our international expansion, so I think I feel good about the level we are at now and it will really depend on our future plans.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","","Ted, just recently this week, I think you announced the pay one deal in Canada for Disney and I know you have done a couple of pay one deals elsewhere. Where do you think the potential is to really break the pay one window outside the U.S., so is that to know we can see more deals like that going forward?","Ted Sarandos ","","I made a distinction before around the Disney relative to the other studios in that, for us the Disney output deal represents a pretty big chunk of kids viewing in general, so I think of it more like a kids programming move that also has a lot of movie component, so it\u2019s a really great movie components with the Marvel Films and certainly the upcoming Star Wars movies. What\u2019s really interesting about the Canadian deal is that Disney is now going to move that deal in U.S. and Canada to one supplier which has not been the historic norm and we are also going to line up the window, so our Canadian subscribers can be seeing movies at the exact same time as U.S. subscribers. And we do have other pay one deals around the world including a Warner Brothers in the Nordic as an example and a few others. ","But for us it\u2019s getting access to films, try to continue to narrow that window, so we can get them to consumers sooner and sooner. To kind of deliver on the expectation that the Internet has set-up for what I want, when I want, where I want.","Reed Hastings","Doug and Michael, why don\u2019t we do one question each for you guys and then we will wrap it up.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","","Okay, great. So I wanted to go back to something we touched on earlier, and I guess it's primarily for David. Just trying to understand better, and hope you can drill down more on the 30%, why that's the right level to go to and then reassess the domestic streaming margins, and help us understand better how you think about these tradeoffs that you mentioned in the letter, the 400, 200, and then 100 basis points of margin improvement on an annual basis?","David Wells","","Doug, there is nothing magical about the 30% number. It\u2019s convenient level for us to reassess and we think we will get there next year, so there is nothing magical about that one 30% number. And then in terms of how we think about the next target whether we leave that at 400 basis point year-on-year growth or whether it goes to 200 or 100, it\u2019s really about do we think that we can continue to expand our market and solidify our competitive position with investments in content or do we think that we can continue to grow content at a moderate, slightly less aggressive pace and put more to margin. As we grow what we have explained in terms of that margin number getting bigger and bigger, it just gets harder to deliver 400 basis points of growth on a higher and higher margin, it\u2019s just the math behind it. So it may not be the right thing to do to continue to press forward as aggressively on content or on profit growth versus other things that we could spend money with content being the largest one.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson","I would say following on that is for anything that you know today on the content cost side like the Disney deal that coming June 17 that makes you say that, do you, have you looked at your -- is there something you\u2019re looking forward and say hey, that is a hurdle that could change it?","Reed Hastings","No, Michael, this is more about perspective opportunities spend on the content line. We forward plan our business, we foreword plan our content spending fully, knowing fully well that that Disney deal has been done over a year then we have projections, Disney could have 20 releases at $400 million plus box office, but that\u2019s not likely to happen. So I think what we\u2019ve done is taken a bunch of different median scenarios and say, look we\u2019ve got that planned out. It\u2019s really about what else can we do with it, can we do more experiments in Ted\u2019s world in the produced content? Can we license for content is that the right decision versus profit growth and making a very smart decision as business owner long-term about the competitiveness and setting ourselves up competitively through the long-term.","David Wells","Thank you everyone for joining us for the call and that we look forward in October to be able to report to you on our initial success with our French and German launches. Thanks you very much. "],"15472":["Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q4 2013 Earnings Conference Call January 22, 2014  5:00 PM ET","","Executives","Erin Kasenchak - Director, Investor Relations","Reed Hastings - Chief Executive Officer","David Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Ted Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","","Analysts","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","","","Erin Kasenchak","Good afternoon. I am Erin Kasenchak, Director of Investor Relations at Netflix. And I would like to welcome you to our Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Interview. During today\u2019s discussion, we may make forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s performance and actual results may differ.","Joining me today is Reed Hastings, our CEO; David Wells, CFO; Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer and helping to facilitate is Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research and Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan.","Let me turn it over to Doug for first question.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Okay, thanks Erin. Thanks everybody for being here with us today. So the first question I wanted to ask about the fourth quarter and guidance, you guided to 2.25 million subs for 1Q and that\u2019s 11% above 1Q \u201813 net adds, you noted that you are in the middle of the S curve. Can you give us some color on the seasonal trajectory of 1Q? What percentage of your subs typically come in very early in the quarter? And also can you talk about your conviction in \u201814 in delivering more U.S. net adds than you did in \u201813?","","Reed Hastings","Sure, Doug. It\u2019s Reed here. The seasonal pattern is the same as it typically is or at least it is the same seasonal pattern so far in the quarter, which is it\u2019s relatively front-loaded compared to other quarters. And then your second question was on conviction of net adds for all of 2014. And we haven\u2019t given guidance for the year, we try to avoid that. So I will just say it\u2019s a great start for the year and then that pretends very well for us and we are excited about what\u2019s unfolding.","","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","When you wrote your last quarterly letter, Reed, you talked about the \u2013 what kind of the stock price volatility you referenced you would actually broke it out in the letter, you said some of the deals like the euphoria back from 2003, your stock I think that evening was at $354 a share. That section was removed from the quarterly letter this quarter. I think your stock right now was trading at about $393, curious is the euphoria now gone given your business conditions or do you still feel like there is euphoria built into the stock?","","Reed Hastings","Well at least, I was clearly right about the volatility, Rich. I mean, we have been all over the math here. And I think we will just stay focused on doing the best we can on improving the service, growing the membership and I don\u2019t know that\u2019s I think, I have any differential insight into the right price of the stocks.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","In your long-term view, you asked about \u2013 you talked about apps replacing channels, screens proliferating, just wanted to ask you more specifically on the last point here, we frequently ask about mobile. Sometimes, I feel like you may downplay it a little bit in terms of impact, because this user base continues to grow and the viewing takes place across more screens, what\u2019s your current thinking on how material mobile is to your business now and going forward?","","Reed Hastings","Well, it\u2019s continuing to grow tablets in particular, phones some, but so much of our viewing is on smart TVs or TVs connected to a Blu-ray player or a game console. For a lot of our entertainment, we are really pretty large screen centric. And so we are less driven by mobile trends than say a music service would be.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Do you feel like that difference at all for newer subscribers?","","Reed Hastings","It\u2019s a little different in younger subscribers, but again, we are not trying to be any one screen. So we were great on a tablet both Android and iOS and we were great on the TV. And so we are not trying to pick and choose. And in fact in any time period say a month many subscribers will use us on multiple screens, so watch some on the smart TV, some on their laptop and some on the tablet. And that\u2019s fine for us.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","That\u2019s even true of watching a specific show you may started on one device and ended on another.","","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","David, you talked about wanting to have increased transparency for the reason for shifting to a single point estimate for guidance. Is there also a part of that that\u2019s driven by better visibility in Q1 now?","","David Wells","I don\u2019t think it was related, the timings are related to the quarter that we sort of made the shift. I think for you guys, you are always trying to figure out if our guidance ranges also include modest conservatism on top of an internal forecast and I think for us it was an attempt to just remove that one marginal layer. You already had the midpoint of our ranges. We wanted to simplify our message and the transparency of our guidance and just moving to our straight internal forecast does that.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","And two quarters ago. Sorry go ahead.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Sorry Rich. David would you agree we had the same visibility we have every Q1 at this period? There is nothing special about this Q1?","","David Wells","Yes that was the intent of my first statement which is there is nothing special about this quarter.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","But there is something special about this quarter that you highlighted a couple of years ago which is the Olympics and there is a Winter Olympics and curious to what extent having the Olympics impacts your guidance and whether you can read through anything towards the World Cup this summer and maybe just one other factor to throw in there as well, you got Season 2 of House of Cards, is that playing into the increased confidence in Q1 as well?","","David Wells","I will take the craft [ph] and then I will go to Reed. I would say Rich that you correctly articulated that that there is factors on both sides. The Olympics for us are generally are negative because people are focused on watching something else rather than signing up for Netflix. We feel like the social [ph] games are small factor in that and might be disproportionate in sort of the territories that are really excited about the Winter Olympics. The U.S. is excited generally, watches it but it's not a large factor and then House of Cards will be on the other side of that which will be a positive. So our guidance numbers reflect all of those pluses and minus but again there is nothing particularly special about this quarter. You have articulated one or two swing factors, every quarter we usually have one or two swing factors in terms of influencing our guide.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And I know it will be in the filing soon, but if you could give us an update on off balance sheet obligation talk about the U.S. and international businesses.","","David Wells","Sure Doug. So usually when people are asking this or asking about that content obligations or the overall obligations filed in our financials and those rose from 6.5 to 7.3. There is a little bit of rounding. So it was a 700 million increase largely driven by some of the deals that you\u2019ve already heard about and we have announced. So the Marvel deal and some of the originals, the Universal deal and the Sony deal that we have done in terms of extending some existing deals.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And then maybe another balance sheet question to stay on this topic. Can you provide some background as to what content assets or prepaid content assets were rolled into other current assets during the most recent quarter\u2019s presentation of the balance sheet?","","David Wells","Sure because it has gotten so small that it's immaterial in terms of those changes. So our team felt like it was not needed to break it out anymore but there wasn\u2019t anything more than that.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And perhaps just lastly in terms of 1Q. A strong guide here but looks like the EPS is perhaps a little bit lighter for 1Q. Can you just talk a little bit more about where you\u2019re expecting to be incremental spending to come in, in the quarter?","","David Wells","Well I\u2019m not sure about the EPS being a little bit lighter. I mean our DVD business does see a decrease in profitability because of increased usage and a sort of continued small decline of the subscriber base. Our international is going to see a pretty good improvement, you see not in our guide. We will see a step-up a little bit in our G&A cost as those are reflected in sort of mark to market employee compensation but those would be the big factors involved in that but I don\u2019t think it is material sort of step change.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Can we move over to pricing? When you look at your long term view statement you actually removed the phrase I believe at some point over the last several months simplicity is at our core and there seems to be a change in your philosophy surrounding pricing and I think review it for a long time talked about the importance of keeping it simple with one price point Wondering what\u2019s changed and how does that now play into the various tiers of Netflix that you\u2019re now testing and playing with?","","Reed Hastings","It's an interesting story, a friend of mine I was preaching about simplicity and a friend of mine pointed out that the simplest iPhone would have no applications but it wouldn\u2019t be a better iPhone. In fact that was the iPhone I, had no App Store and that in fact great product is a combination of functionality and ease of use and that simplicity wasn\u2019t always the best choice and so it's through the conversations over the last year I think I\u2019ve shifted away from simplicity to an end goal to simplicity as an input towards ease of use and towards matching functionality that people want and so we have slightly are more focused on best functionality independent of it's simplicity and of course try to make it as easy to use and we try to make our pricing as straightforward as possible, but it\u2019s not clear that one price fits all. We added the four-screen program almost a year ago back in April of last year and that\u2019s met our expectations in terms of the family take rate. So I think we are justified we are willing to take a slightly richer offering and realizing that that\u2019s might be better for consumers and for us.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Reed, can you also comment on the $6.99 plan who you are targeting with that offering? And does it say anything in your view in terms of penetration and maturity in the U.S.?","","Reed Hastings","We are testing lots of things. Some of it\u2019s been reported on, some of it\u2019s not. One of the things this is $6.99 one stream. I don\u2019t think you should read too much into that other than we are probing around the edges. There is no definite plan to do that. I would say generally as we put in the letter, we are trying to figure out some models of good, better, best price tiering that makes sense and provide some flexibility for our customers at least for our new customers, our existing customers of course we would grandfather very generously.","","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","When you look at the $6.99 plan, why does somebody who is willing to spend $7.99, why does a dollar make a difference, I mean do you really think that there is that much impact from that $1?","","Reed Hastings","Well, Rich of course at your income level, not to be too personal, it doesn\u2019t. But and going from 33 million U.S. members who hopefully more than twice that, every bit of savings is important to people. And so we definitely look at those kind of factors, but again, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the $6.99 other than we are testing some things. And we are continuing to try to figure out how to evolve to a good, better, best plan that makes sense to consumers and feels fair.","","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Any early elasticity learnings though you can talk to directly?","","Reed Hastings","No. Once we figure out what we think the best plan and we will talk about that and why we think it is, but we are not specifically taking a part at each option that we are testing.","","David Wells","The only thing I would add, this is David \u2013 the only thing I would add on that conversation is just it\u2019s not only the question of elasticity and sort of income levels, but in pricing period, there is also a sense that consumers make choices around heuristics. And so a dollar rich might not sound like a lot on a logical basis, but consumers may have shortcuts that they make, they take the middle or the upper or the low and so that factors into the right course as well.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And then if we think about it on the other extreme, there is likely a large percentage of subscribers that would perhaps pay dramatically more for Netflix service that had even more content on it. How does the company address how they might reach that subset of members without risking the growth at lower prices?","","Reed Hastings","Yes. It\u2019s unlikely for us to be able to do that, Doug, because if we license the content, it\u2019s almost always exclusive, because the other licensors don\u2019t want us to have it in addition to that. So we have to pay the full not of getting an exclusive license and so then that\u2019s tricky to say also buildup $30 a month program that\u2019s they have all the new releases or something like that. So I think we will stick at what we are doing now and just continue to do it a little better year after year after year. And that\u2019s worked pretty well for us over the last eight quarters.","","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","You referenced before the iPod or the iPhone, when you think about ways to tier obviously there is things like WiFi or Mini and not Mini for an iPad and iPhone, are there more ways to tier for Netflix than simultaneous streams and SD-HD what other things should we be thinking about?","","Reed Hastings","Well, I\u2019ll let you know when we figure out what works best in our testing and research with consumers, but sure there is a dozen type of things that you could tier on in principle, but the trick is not having too many factors, keeping it understandable and then really that it feels fair and resonates with consumers.","","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Last week, HBO commented that shared passwords are not a big issue for HBO Go, because those users eventually will have enough money to subscribe on their own. What\u2019s your view around shared passwords?","","Reed Hastings","That was an interesting comment I suppose. So, I guess Plepler is the CEO of HBO, doesn\u2019t mind me then sharing his account information. So, it\u2019s plepler@hbo.com and his password is Netflix.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","When you think about advertising I think that there is a lot of people who now believe investors that believe that your services has gotten to the point where it's sticky enough but people would tolerate preroll ads such as when they go to the movie theater and they are forced to tolerate several minutes of preroll ads. Is that something that you would ever envision doing?","","Reed Hastings","We have no play on to go towards advertising based models. Our grand at least over the next couple of years and at this point really stands for that commercial free experience that we have where the consumer is in control of the experience. They get to watch when they want, they get to pause it when they want. They can play it when they want, watch it how and where they want. So it's fundamental to that control orientation that we don\u2019t cram advertisements on people\u2019s throats. So I really don\u2019t see that.","","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Do your contracts even allow it though?","","Reed Hastings","At a certain price anything is allowable but I\u2019m sure Ted could talk of it, it would take a lot more money but it's not something we\u2019re contemplating.","","Ted Sarandos","Yeah it tends to be a separate set of rights and to your point we have got a go to grade extremes [ph] to give consumers control of the content you know going all the way to the extreme of putting the entire season out at one time so the notion of frustrating for the first or the last couple of minutes seems a little out of step at that.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","I will shift gears and talk about net neutrality a little bit. What is the impact of the net neutrality rolling last week and what is your expectation for how the ISPs little act in the near term?","","Ted Sarandos","Well as we put in letter Doug there are some draconian scenarios where some ISPs block Netflix but we think it's very unlikely and the most likely scenario at least in the near term is that there is no real change and the reason is if ISP especially major ISPs were to contemplate blocking Netflix or other services it will significantly fuel the fire for more regulation which is not something they are interested in. So the long term we still need to figure out what it means and how that works out but I think in short term it's very likely that there is no change.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","You lobbied pretty hard though against the court overturning the net neutrality rules. Verizon obviously lobbied very hard to have the rules overturned, I guess there is a lot of investments who fear that this is kind of a zero sum game and even if there isn't a notable attack from Verizon or other ISPs I think the fear is it's a little bit like boiling a frog. Does this turn it up and tweak it little bit each year just to disadvantage you versus themselves. So it may not be overly noticeable, how much of an issue is little bits of bad behavior?","","Reed Hastings","Well it's a legitimate fear I suppose but we operate in 41 countries that have quite of a variety of states of net neutrality and we never had a significant problem to-date, it doesn\u2019t mean we won't or we haven't to-date and I think what it is ISPs have a very profitable business and they want to expand that business and part of delivering and expanding for consumers is having a good Netflix experience and good YouTube experience, things like that, that\u2019s why people get higher speed broadband. And so I think actually our economic interests are pretty coaligned which is how it's worked so far.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And can you comment on Open Connect and does it mitigate some of the impact here and perhaps can you talk about how deeply penetrated you\u2019re now with Open Connect?","","Reed Hastings","Sure Open Connect is a pretty independent issue. We could be delivering through Akamai and an ISP could block Netflix vid, so they are really not closely associated other than they are both on vid delivery. And then Open Connect is making great progress. We\u2019re continuing to work with more and more ISPs, higher percentage of the traffic but think of that as a cost savings and improvement as opposed to say fundamental to these net neutrality issues.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","You\u2019re already at 30% of peak downstream bandwidth if you listened to the Sandvine studies. I was I think when we were looking at the fourth quarter statement it showed I think 16 megs was their stream necessary for a 4k stream and kind of your eyes pop-out when you see the amounts of data that a 4k stream call it a two hour movie if we think about streaming all of Breaking Bad over the course of the next few weeks given how many seasons you have. How does 4k going to impact the net neutrality debate? Just given how much data, I assume that 30% surges be you will have 4k content before a lot of others. So your 30% would really surge over the next couple of years?","","Reed Hastings","If you are on the cost side than ISP, then you may be affected by that and think about that, but if you are on the revenue side, you are celebrating, because now there is a real need to get a 40 or 50 megabit plan. So you could support two streams and you have got something to get people to upgrade to the faster plans. And so as long as the fast plans are priced appropriately for the ISP, it\u2019s a great interplay. For 20 years, we saw PCs get faster, applications get richer, which was a reason to get faster PCs, which then enabled richer applications. And that ecosystem really grew. Now of course in the short-term, there is not many people who own a 4K TV. So the 4K is going to come about as a percentage of all viewing fairly slowly, because you got to get a 4K TV and then only a percentage of our content is available in 4K. So there is no tidal wave coming in the next 18 months. But it is a great way to work with ISPs so that their higher speed plans have more merit in the consumer size.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Great. Let\u2019s shift gears and move over to international, you talked about a more expensive European rollout coming in 2014. There is clearly a lot of speculation on you entering France and Germany in particular. But can you talk a little bit about maybe those countries specifically the over the top players they are currently state of broadband and the interest in U.S. content there?","","Reed Hastings","Yes. We haven\u2019t been specific about what country or countries we are going to expand to. So there is a number of players in all the major markets and then the smaller markets. They are all doing good work. I think what we have seen with our success in the UK is that there can be very strong players like the BBC iPlayer, (indiscernible) and Sky. And we can still build a very successful business. And so I think the key is having unique content, a great reputation, a good value proposition and we can succeed and in many cases, that competitors can also. So we mostly focus on finding good markets that love content and that will steadily expand in Europe.","","David Wells","And to your second part of your question, the appetite for U.S. content around the world still remains very, very high throughout Europe, particularly. And you think and there are some pockets of the world where local content is now outpacing U.S. programming on the movie side, but that doesn\u2019t really \u2013 is that necessarily a reflection of the desire for the content itself as much as it is to specific distribution models in those countries.","","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","So you think content like House of Cards or Breaking Bad, those series work well in or would work well in markets like France or Germany specifically.","","Reed Hastings","House of Cards and Orange is the New Black is a hit for us in every territory I preyed in and is a hit for others in territories where we don\u2019t today. So it travels incredibly well those shows too. And Breaking Bad is an enormous show for us in every one of our territories.","","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","And just because you brought it up when you have sold shows like Orange is the New Black into France, because you weren\u2019t there yet. What happens when you launch in those markets? Do those write back to you if you chose to launch in France or are you added to market with some of your key originals to the length of the series?","","Reed Hastings","It depends. There is multiple windows and we will continue to have those negotiations as we get close to those launches.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Can you give us some color on how international subs breakout by market? Have you crossed the 2 million sub number in the UK? And then perhaps also a comment on profitability in the UK and Canada if you are there yet or how far away?","","David Wells","We really don\u2019t breakout by country for competitive reasons either the profitability or the number of subs. We have said in the past in there or probably two years ago that Canada broke even within two years, but beyond that, we are really treating international as the segment again for competitive reasons.","","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","You might have ended up\u2026.","","David Wells","Sorry Rich. Doug, this is David. I would just say that for those that have been following us for a while. I mean, we have been making consistent statements about improvements in every market. So we have given some color in terms of if you have tracked the history from launch, where we might be along the way and you should get some confidence that there is improvements in every market we made that comment in several quarters.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","So there is no way to read into the UK since you haven\u2019t broken or since you are not giving any detail. We shouldn\u2019t assume that, that market has not broken even already, because you are just no longer ever going to comment on individual market profitability outside of Canada?","David Wells","We\u2019re going to think about it which is you don\u2019t really care if we\u2019re profitable in London but not in England, but not in Scotland or vice a versa. In other words what we care about is the total P&L and much of the licensing is either when we think of originals you know we\u2019re really multi-territory. So what we\u2019re managing to is the overall P&L and then with international you can see just incredible progress we have made over this last year in terms of lowering the, improving essentially the contribution margin and we will continue to make progress on that. So we\u2019re making good progress there.","","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Can you talk about the sort of early returns on the set top box integrations in Europe particular through the middle partnerships? How those are working so far? If you could comment a little bit on the economics and then also what you think the potential is for future deals that are similar going forward?","","David Wells","Sure Doug, I\u2019m not going to comment on the economics but our big first one was with Virgin. Virgin has always been an innovator in the UK market. They are really strong cable company. Lots of fiber, they have done lots of investment to have some of the highest speed broadbands in Europe and in the world. We\u2019re thrilled to be working with them, it's on the TiVo platform. It's been a really great reception. It's just very convenient for people use Netflix right on the same input and the same device that they are used to using it on and of course we have had several years of history of working with TiVo so the application works very well. So we\u2019re excited by that, we\u2019re open to doing more. We\u2019re definitely talking to a lots of people throughout the world and I think what an MVPD sees is that people are going to use Netflix anyway and I as an MVPD would rather have the music on my remote control in my box than get used to the Smart TV, the Apple TV, the Roku. So they see that these things are going to exist anyway so they might as well have Netflix right on their box integrated, better consumer experience and the consumer stays within my remote control say if I\u2019m an MVPD. So I think it's a win-win all around and we will see it start to expand.","","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","When you look at the MVPD you know the cable companies that I cover and look at it seems like a no brainer, this is clearly positive for them. It simplifies the user experience which is what everybody is looking for but a big piece of this is the programmer and the programmers try to differentiate where they make content available and the more of that I can easily choose watching Netflix in the evening, easier and easier versus watching CBS\u2019s new programming in the evening. That would seem like a meaningful threat if I were an executive at one of these big content programmers in the U.S. How do you address that?","","Ted Sarandos","It's a stroke of the remote control Rich. So the idea that like Reed said most of those viewers are doing it now and they are exiting the cable eco-system to do it which I think is much more disruptive than the idea of giving ease of use to the consumers switch back and forth but yet stay within their eco-system. So right now I think when you look at the numbers of a cable show people are tuning on a Sunday night often the number, a single show on Netflix could dwarf that number. So I think it's already being kind of changed in that way and the way people get there. I think it's in everyone\u2019s best interest to keep in mind consumer convenience. So staying within the eco-system with an easy push of the button, I think it's great for everybody.","","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","So you talked a lot about personalized merchandising and these two [ph] to back it up as well. Can you talk a little bit about how much better your predictability algorithms are becoming, can you quantify the improvement over the past year and how much room there is to go? What this means for the business going forward?","","Reed Hastings","Well if you think talk about how much better has Google search gotten over the last 10 years? It's pretty hard to quantify. Would you say it's twice as good, three times as good? It certainly is a lot better and I think it's like that for us which is it's tremendously better than 2 \u2013 3 years ago. It's continuing to get better. We can measure it in the narrow when we do an A\/B tests. So everything we will have several tests running, we will figure out which style [ph] actually works better for consumers. But then that means to an accumulation of improvement and then it's anybody\u2019s guess if in total that\u2019s twice as good or three times as good as a couple of years ago, but it\u2019s continuing to improve where our guys are coming up with new ideas all the time about how to improve it. So that the effect of it is that when you turn on Netflix on your tablet or on your TV that shows on the initial screen are almost always like three of them, you are like oh, I want to watch that. That\u2019s what we are looking for is that sense that you turn on Netflix and there is just already, you got a couple of shows right away that you want to watch.","","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","With net adds accelerating year-over-year, how do you \u2013 despite the size of your subscriber base, how do you think about the total addressable market in the U.S.? Are you starting to rethink what the upper boundary is or I may use to put a pretty wide range on it? Are you getting more comfortable with the upper end of the range and I guess just to frame that a little bit larger, when you look at you versus\u2026"],"15637":["Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q3 2015 Earnings Conference Call October 14, 2015  5:00 PM ET","Executives","David Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Reed Hastings - Founder and Chief Executive Officer","Theodore Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Analysts","Peter Kafka - Re\/code","Mark Mahaney - RBC","David Wells","Welcome to the Netflix Q3 2015 earnings call. I am David Wells, CFO. Joining me today from the company is Reed Hastings, our CEO; and Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer.","Interviewing us today will be Peter Kafka of Re\/code; and Mark Mahaney of RBC.","Now, today we will be making forward-looking statements, so actual results may vary.","I think I am turning it over to you Mark for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Mark Mahaney","Thanks, David. First question has to do with domestic streaming market for Netflix. Sub numbers for the second September quarter in a row came in light, you talked about involuntary churn. Could you give a little bit more color around the source of that sub add weakness? Is this a temporary problem and then just delay concerns that it could be due to greater increased competitive pressure or due to pushback against some of the recently disclosed price increases?","David Wells","Sure, I could take this one Mark. I would say that in terms of additions they were pretty strong through the quarter in terms of flat year-over-year. In net additions they were down year-over-year, and that we explained and attributed to our involuntary churn or payments-related churn. We think partially that was due to the transition to the chip cards, which is still ongoing. And we've reflected that trend going forward into Q4 in our guidance.","We don't think though that it really affects our addressable market size of 60 million to 90 million. I would say last year we had a little bit of concern at the same time, when we over-forecasted Q3 and we ended up in Q4 delivering up to 6 million subscribers for that year. We've done about 5 million to 6 million for the last four years.","So I would say our thesis on the addressable market isn't really changed, isn't changed. And in terms of the involuntary churn, we've been improving that. It's better year-on-year, but it has impacted at our levels even on a small basis, 10 basis points, 20 basis points.","Reed Hastings","So next Q3, Mark, you could be sure that we're definitely going to have low guidance in July. So we think it's just the summer part.","Mark Mahaney","And then, Reed, you've added 6 million net subs for the last four years in the U.S., at some point you can't sustain that, your level. As you look forward to next year and what kind of keeps you in that 5 million to 6 million range, so just address issues like your confidence that the marketplace will accept the price increases. Is it that we should expect a greater amount of original content coming up to help keep that sub add level that 5 million to 6 million. Just address how the consistency of that growth going forward?","Reed Hastings","When we look at the last couple of years, where we've been -- last four years, we've been about 6 million net adds in the U.S., and then accelerating number of new members internationally. But restricting the comments to the U.S., it's fundamentally that internet TV is better than linear TV. The consumers can watch when they want, on what type of device they want, and the content has just got better and better.","So the fundamental confidence about the large scale is because on-demand is a better experience than linear, and the entire market is going to move from linear to on-demand internet television over the next 10 to 20 years. In terms of the specific, when we look at the shows that we have coming out next year, that gives us a lot of confidence. We have the Disney pay-one deal coming in the U.S. in the third quarter. Third, fourth quarter next year?","Theodore Sarandos","Fourth of next year.","Reed Hastings","Fourth quarter next year. And so we got just a tremendous content coming in. I am sure there is a lot of competitors, but there always have been. I mean we've competed against cable and satellite, and we've competed against YouTube and all kinds of pay-per-view and DVD. So there is a lot of ways to consume entertainment. And despite all of those, Netflix keeps growing, because we keep improving. So that's why we feel good about next year, both domestic and especially international.","David Wells","And then just a narrow point, Mark, on the pricing. I mean, we changed the price in the U.S. last Q2. Q3 came in less than expected, but then we delivered in Q4, and then substantially Q1, Q2 of this year with a higher price. So I don't think you can ascribe that to a price for the U.S. in terms of growth.","Peter Kafka","Hey, guys, I want to ask an international question. But first, can you just go back and explain a little more about the involuntary churn and what it was with the credit cards that caused people to be unable to pay? I've got the same account number, what happens when my card type changes, it prevents me from paying. And what didn't you see that happened in Q3?","David Wells","Peter, this is David. It's not consistently the case that people don't have the same account number and some issuers are going to replace that number when they issue that. And for us as a recurring merchant, where we really want to reduce the friction of renewal and reduce the friction of having any sort of interaction where we have to update your payment method and present an opportunity not to do that, it just means that there is more noise introduced into that. And we think it's a contributor.","Like I said, it's likely multifactor. There may be other things going on here, but certainly the transition to the chip cards is not helping, and that has to be a factor in it. And we're only partially the way through, so the U.S. issuers are going to continue that in Q4. They were supposed to be done in October, and they're not. They're about a-third of the way through. So we'll continue to see that in the U.S., as we go along.","Reed Hastings","And gross additions were above forecast, right?","David Wells","Correct.","Reed Hastings","That's why we're attributing it to the misforecast, which is quite modest, because this is the most accurate forecast we've ever had on an overall basis to this slight change, relative to our forecast in the involuntary churn.","Peter Kafka","And you said the international numbers came in where you expected, but you didn't provide any color on sort of which territories are doing better or worse than others. Are there surprises by territory that something do particularly well or particularly underperform?","Reed Hastings","They're all doing really well, but some are bigger than others. But for competitive reasons, we don't give per country color. So we are continuing to learn in every market and improving every market. Every market is growing. But some are doing better than others, which you would expect, and that's up to us to manage to get the total portfolio to be as fast growing as they are.","Mark Mahaney","It's Mark again. So Reed let me ask you one question and then Ted a question to you. Reed, I know in the last earnings call, I think, you cautioned people not to get too robust in the Japan launch. And then also argued there or made the comment that Brazil was like a rocket ship. So at least could you just update maybe a little commentary on those two markets? Our survey work indicated that Brazil was in fact a rocket ship, is that continuing? And then Japan, should we continue to be mellow in terms of modest in terms of the ramp up there?","Reed Hastings","It's clearly, clearly undisciplined, my no commentary on countries. So if I said it was a rocket ship that has continued. Brazil what we're seeing is this with a tough economy, a value-based product like Netflix, that's very inexpensive is really appreciated. And so even though there's tight economic times currently, that has not held back our growth. And we were definitely pleased with the content and with the offering that we had. And maybe Ted you can talk a little bit about the Japanese content offering.","Theodore Sarandos","Yes. I'd say, even back to Brazil, I mean one of the great upsides, and this was our Global Original series Narcos. The star of Narcos and the Director and Creator of Narcos are both Brazilian superstars. So Brazil has received Narcos particularly well as it's been well-received around the world.","In Japan, I think what's been really great too is the local acceptance of our Global Originals. So we're seeing them perform as a percentage of watching, about the same, as they are in other territories, which again defies conventional wisdom that Japan is primarily a local territory.","And we hedged a little bit too and had some local Netflix original content in Japan, including a show called Terrace House is doing particularly well too. So I think it's been a great success in being able to make shows for the globe and extend to places as diverse as Brazil and Japan.","Reed Hastings","And Narcos is really just such an incredible story, because it's two-thirds in Spanish, and that was a huge success for us around the world, including France and Norway. And so it really speaks a lot to our ability to connect the world to do amazing shows around the world that are great stories for everyone.","Theodore Sarandos","And great stories travel.","Mark Mahaney","Ted on the original content launches, as you're thinking about next year, can you help us think about whether the original content launches as a whole are going to be as impactful, less impactful or more or so than what we're seeing in 2015?","Theodore Sarandos","Well, I can tell you that I would say as impactful. I don't know if that'd be more or less. But certainly as we continue to expand into second, third and four seasons of our original shows, what you see there is the franchise value grows dramatically. So as this initiative is aging, the desire to see the new seasons builds up more and more excitement.","And we're not waiting for next year for that, we have an amazing launch scheduled for Q4. In the Marvel Defender series, we're bringing out the second show, Jessica Jones in Q4 as an example, which I think is going to spark a lot more interest in the entire Daredevil run, and the next one is coming up after that.","Reed Hastings","When we talked about the $5 billion content budget for next year, you said for sure, it was going to have more impact.","Peter Kafka","On license content, there's a lot of chatter about some of the studios, networks pulling back for stuff they're licensing to you folks. You guys addressed that in your shareholder letter. You said some content providers may choose to license to you, some may not. Have you seen evidence that people are actively steering content away from Netflix in particular?","Theodore Sarandos","The media business is absolutely influx. As Reed said, you've had this growing move away from linear and towards on-demand, both watching and spending. So the future of how the networks and studios deal with Netflix, and Hulu, and Amazon Prime Instant Video, is certainly going to determine their future.","So there is a lot of caution. And you see how volatile the market can be just with a turn of a phrase last quarter. So I think what's happening is, is that you're hearing a lot of chatter, but you see in our earnings letter, we detailed some major global television deals we've signed across the board with our suppliers.","You should keep in mind that those particular deals are big rocks to move with our suppliers. Buying and selling global television is a brand new behavior to the industry. So whatever you're seeing is more chatter, but roughly business as usual. But of course, some caution, caution that's been around since we've been licensing streaming content.","Reed Hastings","Peter, the caution it's SVOD wide. So when you think about new content on Hulu, I mean Hulu is even more of our cord-cutter's dream than Netflix is, because it's got the network shows day after. So you really want to read it. A lot of the concern is about SVOD generally, which is to be understood.","Peter Kafka","But Hulu is owned by three of the major networks, James Murdoch at Fox said he'll be working with you differently. A show like Empire, the biggest show last year is going to Hulu and not to Netflix. Are you seeing any of the Hulu studios in particular steer content away from you and towards Hulu?","Theodore Sarandos","Remember we're buying show by show. So what happens is happening on the show level not the supplier level. As Reed said it's particularly puzzling that considering that it's much more disruptive to give commercial free options the day after broadcast and it is the year after broadcast.","David Wells","It doesn't address the strategic issue that is supposedly causing the anger with a backlash or the choice not -- ","Theodore Sarandos","For accelerating cord cutting in that case.","Reed Hastings","And the thing to tease out here is, let's say, the Empire creators, they get paid based upon how the show monetizes. So the studio is under an obligation to monetize that as fully as they can. So Hulu can outbid us, as they did on Empire, and that's fair game. But they can't win it at half the bid, because then the participants don't get paid the right amount.","Theodore Sarandos","And I think participants are well in tune with that as well.","Mark Mahaney","It's Mark. Let me ask two questions. One on the Epix deal and one on some of the background to the price increase you just announced. On the Epix deal maybe, Ted, could you comment on this. So the decision to not renew it, could you just kind of explain that? Was that due to the economics that you thought were going to be part of the deal really didn't come through for you? The cost per viewing hour is too high? Was it that there's a broader movement at Netflix away from feature films? Were there too many restrictions on a renewal? Just kind of explain to us why that deal didn't get renewed?","Theodore Sarandos","So some of our core initiatives around our content are around exclusivity, and accelerating windows and giving consumer access to content earlier and earlier, so the pay TV window has been particularly out of step with consumer desire to watch content when they wanted. And exclusivity, obviously, when we entered into our agreement with Epix, we were kind of de facto exclusive, and since then they dramatically expanded their cable distribution, which is great for them.","They did a deal with Amazon. They were about to do a deal with Hulu when our deal was coming up for renewal. So what we said was that if we were going to do a non-exclusive deal for Epix, that would put the content on Netflix several months after pay television and they are completely non-exclusive. It wasn't a very strategic investment and therefore it would be very small relative to what we had been paying. And so we agreed that were -- our strategic initiative and theirs were diverging, and we just went our separate ways.","We do a great deal of business with Lions Gate. We're continuing to expand our business Paramount and MGM around the world, so this isn't a studio problem, it's just really was the Epix product was less and less in tune with what we're doing at Netflix around exclusivity and windows acceleration.","Reed Hastings","And while the movies on Epix are quite good, we found that there is more awareness on the original side and what we're hoping for over this next two year as we launch, so really incredible movies that are highly original and premier on Netflix as well as in the movie theater simultaneously that we can do better putting the money into those kind of spectacles that we create more consumer desire and awareness through that vehicle than through this additional pay-one licensing.","Theodore Sarandos","And I think that some of the economics match the success of original program, original series programming, which is for the cost of production. You have full exclusivity and global rights in perpetuity versus a very narrow window a year after it's released in the theater in one territory. So a $1 billion of output spending versus a $1 billion in for original spending and they turn out to the right strategy.","Mark Mahaney","And then, a follow-up question on the price increase. So this is the second dollar price increase, I think, in about a 15 month, 18 month timeframe. How do you think about pricing going forwards? Is this now the Netflix norm about once a year $1 price increase? I think long-term you believe you've got a lot of ARPU power. Is there any change in thinking about whether that's due to tiering as opposed to just straight up price increases?","Reed Hastings","So Mark, Netflix is $7.99 for our standard -def offering. It was $7.99 last year, it was $7.99 two years ago, three years ago, so yes it is due to the tiering. And what we're trying to do is spread out the tiers, so that now we've got the $7.99 standard-def, but $9.99 high-definition, and $11.99 ultra-high definition. So think of it is related to putting in a good tiering mechanism as opposed to anything else, and really Netflix is highly available. And standard-def is DVD quality, its not bad quality at all. So that $7.99 for DVD quality, unlimited streaming video, it's an incredible value.","Mark Mahaney","So a follow-up on that, does that mean that we should expect those three price points to stay the same for the next three to five years. Do you have the tiering that you want right now?","Reed Hastings","We're not making any prognostications about the future on the pricing, but it is related to the value. And the more that we have incredible value, the more that we have amazing originals, then over time we're going to be able to ask consumers for more to be able to invest more. And that's been the rhythm we've been on as we did the tearing and introduced that, if you look at how much broader and bigger our content is now than two years ago, I think we fairly delivered on that promise.","David Hyman","And I think, it's worth saying that consumers have acknowledged that I think, that with the combination of grandfathering and the content additions that we've been able to make in the terms of the reactions, I think people are acknowledging that there is real value being delivered through the service.","Peter Kafka","On the original content side, for a couple of years you guys have been making your own shows and you've never acknowledged that any show was less than successful. You never had to take a write-down. As you start spending more on original content and as you make bigger individual bets on things like movies, at what point do you think you will be able to tell or investor should be able to expect to hear from your performance of individual shows, movies or any other kind of content that -- ?","Theodore Sarandos","So Peter, you should keep in mind, that as our slate of original programming grows, the diversity, the size, the scope, the scale of those shows is different. So when we say a show is successful, it's because relative to the investment it's successful, relative to how else we would have spent that money on licensing something else, does this creation, did it attract the audience that it was built for.","So the range of budgets is very broad. The range of audiences we expect to bring to it are very broad. So that's why we've been right in so far in terms of predicting the size of the audience for these shows. Not that they don't all reach 30 million subscribers.","Peter Kafka","You haven't made any mistakes in your projections and your original content to date for the last two years.","Theodore Sarandos","Well, we've not had content write-down, so to your point. So basically we're saying is that we're investing according to the size of the show. And when we've been wrong, there's been more upside than we had forecasted. So we had got into our original programming, very conservative in terms of our modeling, relative to licensing, and have found that it's been much more impactful.","Reed Hastings","Peter, probably the best way to externally tell, is do we take on additional seasons of a show. So some shows have been so successful that we're moving on to season fours. One show had a lot of growth, it was great for what it was. The season three was the final season. And so you can say, well, therefore that was less successful, and that's true.","But so far, we haven't had any show that's performed so weakly in season one that we haven't taken it to season two. I'm sure there will be such a show eventually, but that's probably the best indicator that you or an investor could use, and it didn't really work for us. Yes, we didn't do more of it.","Theodore Sarandos","And in that case you'd say it was relative to an eight season show, it was less successful, but in its own economics were was quite successful.","Reed Hastings","Yes. Go ahead.","Peter Kafka","Recently Amazon just moved to block the sales of Apple and Google streaming devices with their competitive products. Given your dependence on Amazon's AWS, are you rethinking that relationship? Can you rethink that relationship?","Reed Hastings","AWS has been a great supplier to us. They demonstrated again and again strong market leadership, strong attentiveness to our account. We could not be happier with AWS. And they've always kept that separate from Amazon retail. So with Amazon retail, we've had up and down issues for a couple of years, we couldn't buy ads on IMDB, things like that, and that never spilled over to AWS.","Now, we have a really good relationship with Amazon retail also. But the important point to your question is they manage those separately, and we're very committed to AWS and are comfortable with that commitment.","Mark Mahaney","Let me switchback over to international markets. I think the overall sub numbers came in higher than expected and the guidance was a little bit higher than the Street at least expected. But the mix of free subs was a little bit higher than I think most people had expected. Do you have a decent read as to whether those free subs are converting like you've seen in other markets, any particular reason that there is extra risk here, because those subs may not convert as well?","Reed Hastings","No, you should see those consistent.","David Wells","Yes, there is no change in trend there, Mark.","Mark Mahaney","And then in a fourth quarter, I think your international revenue forecast implies like a trailing off in ARPU or pretty sharp sequential drop in ARPU, is there a particular reason behind that? Are you at specific price points in some of the newer markets that you're launching?","David Wells","No. It's the strong dollar, Mark. So there is a bit of a headwind there because of the strong dollar.","Peter Kafka","On the content side, HBO one of your big competitor is moving into news. A lot of that supposedly aimed at millennials, theoretically your customers as well. Is that something you guys would contemplate at all? And then some more question for sports. You guys have repeatedly said you're not interested in sports. Are you willing to serve conceded that maybe you would be a little interested at some point down the road?","Theodore Sarandos","Well, look on the news side, I think we definitely are being more adventurous in terms of the genres that we're going into. We're getting ready to launch Chelsea Handler's talk show early next year, that's our first move into talk. Kind of aimed at the same kind of thing, we have a weekly talk show, where most of our things have been very long shelf-like movies and television series. So I think it's a very kind of similar migration or certainly exploration. And in sports, I think we're in the same place. There is a lot of irrational bidders for sports. We're not anxious to become another one.","Peter Kafka","So to translate that sounds like you're saying you're not likely to move into sports, but news you're already interested in and may increase that appetite.","Theodore Sarandos","Yes, we're interested in being able to improve the viewing experience whatever kind of content people are watching. So I think in sports, sports on-demand is not as exciting as sports live, where I think everything else that we're doing that kind of freeze the viewers from the linear schedule in ways that they enjoy and more enjoy the programming, then we could bring some value to that.","David Wells","So Ted you're leaving the lead there for innovation, right. You're giving yourself a little bit room for innovating.","Theodore Sarandos","Yes, exactly.","Reed Hastings","Well, let's be clear on that room. What's the likelihood that we compete directly with VICE in the next two years?","Theodore Sarandos","Probably high.","Reed Hastings","There you go.","Peter Kafka","All, Amazon, Roku, Google, I'm missing somebody, Apple, all introduced new streaming boxes in last few weeks. Are you seeing more usages and more growth from sort of dumb TVs with smart boxes or you're seeing more usage and growth from connect TVs that have the stuff baked in?","Reed Hastings","They're both growing. They compete with each other. So those categories are growing. It's only really the game consoles that are not growing as fast for secular reasons, the early on. They were the only high-connected devices attached to the TV. And now, they are facing competition in share from smart TVs and from these attached devices.","Mark Mahaney","David, a balance sheet question for you. I think in the letter, you talk about looking to raise additional capital next year. Do you think the next year will be the last year in which you'll need to do that, as you think about the plans for the next three to five years? And then any additional color on what kind of capital or how you would raise that capital next year?","David Wells","Well, it's largely unknown, right. I mean you're asking me three or four years out. But I would say, given our plans to expand content and given the fact that we're on pace to use about $1 billion this year and no indications that that would shrink next year, we wanted to give some headway or some inside into the fact that we may be back in the market next year.","We've done that on a regular sort of cadence of about once a year. So there is no change from that. But there is still some uncertainty in terms of the pipeline, how much we would need exactly next year. But I would say, safe indications are that we will be back in the market in the next 12 to 18 months.","Reed Hastings","And then a success scenario, where Ted is able to invest the originals as well in the future as he has in the past. We would hope to be back, because we want to be funding these incredible creative productions around the world. So in a success scenario, we would do a bunch more over the next five, 10 years.","Mark Mahaney","And in terms of contribution margins maybe again David for you, I think you reiterated your goal of getting to 40% contribution margins in U.S. by 2020. Are those European countries and some of that in Canada, some of that earlier countries that you launched in. Could you just talk about what the contribution margin has been like in those markets? Has it been similar to what you did in the U.S. over the last three years?","David Wells","Well, similar to the comment of Reed, we don't give a specific, Mark, in commentary for competitive reasons. But we have said and I'll reiterate that there is nothing structural that means we can't get equal or better margins outside the U.S. that we've seen in the U.S. And we gave you a data point on Canada that that had reached U.S. margin. About 18 months ago, we gave you a point on that. So there is no reason that we couldn't do better. Largely it's determined competitively within that country or that region in terms of how well we do on the profit side.","Peter Kafka","Recently you guys agreed to sell subscriptions to Apple phone users via iOS in app purchases. For years you didn't do that. Are you paying the same 30% tax that everyone else pays, when someone gets an app subscription through Apple? And then why make that change now after years of not doing that?","Reed Hastings","It's a great opportunity to expand. So historically, we've only been on the Apple TV and that on the iPhone. And we don't comment specifically on the business terms. So I can't directly answer your question. But we're really excited about the potential, especially as we go global over the next year-and-a-half to be able to serve all of the iPhone customers around the world. So some higher motivation on our side to get access to that incredible iPhone customer base around the world.","Peter Kafka","If that does generate a lot of new subscriptions, will we see the impact of that on you financials? Will those come in significantly lower monthly revenue numbers?","Reed Hastings","No, the revenue is the same. You would see an increase in COGS to deal with the fees to Apple. That's where it would show up. But it's essentially the gross revenue the 7.99 or 9.99 that shows for us.","Peter Kafka","Curious what you guys think of new streaming offerings from Verizon and Comcast both, what you think of them as actual content? And what you think of the notion and broadband providers that you need to work with, now competing with subscription or streaming services?","Reed Hastings","We're really big and everybody has got to get into streaming. It's been our main message for several years, that what is known as channels is going to become apps. And that all of these providers need to have great apps on a phone, on a tablet, on a TV, so it's completely consistent with all of that.","And what we see is if we have great content, then consumers watch our service and enjoy it and tell their friends about it. And it kind of doesn't matter that there is also a great sports game on or there is also a shows on Verizon or on Comcast. So part of the reason that we may seem a little blas\u00e9 is that it really hasn't affected us. What has affected us is when we have great show like Narcos that just takes the world by storm. So that's what we're focused on, how do we have more incredible shows.","Peter Kafka","Do you think that the products of Verizon and Comcast just launched are great products?","Reed Hastings","It's early in the market. They are great companies. They will work on that. But I'm not going to critique them. They're all, they are in, they are trying, and that's a great thing. Of course, you seen Sony Vue, you've seen the Dish sling product. So people are really innovative, which is great for consumers. And not every product, when it first comes out is great, and they'll continue to work on them.","David Wells","And there are certainly better iterations than their prior versions. So they are getting better.","Theodore Sarandos","Our first streaming offering was pretty ugly.","Mark Mahaney","Ted, we got a couple of series of emails about whether Star Wars is going to be available, all the films on the Netflix next year, what's the answer?","Theodore Sarandos","They're all subject to negotiations. It's up to Disney, how they want to manage access to those assets before, during or after the release of Star Wars 7. So it's certainly an ongoing discussion.","Reed Hastings","And assuming Star Wars launches theatrically this year, then it would not come to Netflix as part of the [multiple speakers].","Theodore Sarandos","No, it would be the last title on the Starz, in the Disney output going to Starz.","Reed Hastings","So it wouldn't come to Netflix.","Theodore Sarandos","Yes, correct.","Mark Mahaney","And then there was a new user interface launched on the site about four months ago, and hoped that that would be kind of improved user retention satisfaction levels four months in, any takeaways?","Reed Hastings","Super happy with it, and we're generating new improvements already, improvements there, improvements on mobile, improvements on the TV. So thinking a product group is just an amazing learning organization. It's always pushing the balance and its steady improvement on all of those fronts, Mark. And it's the aggregate of that, which has us at so many viewing hours and so much customer satisfaction that we've been working at all of these improvements over the last seven years on streaming.","David Wells","And that's been very flattered in terms of being imitated across the world.","Peter Kafka","You guys changed your amortization schedule for your license content, just like you had for originals, you said it's because you're seeing more viewing in the first month. What does that mean are people -- does that mean people are less interested in the stuff than you thought overtime or they're more interested than you thought. Originally what does that tell us about viewing behavior?","David Wells","Presumably, Peter you're referring to that amortization change or the change in accounting estimate. And no, it doesn't. You can't conclude that nor should you conclude that from the change. What we're saying is there is more viewing in the first month not necessarily less viewing over the lifetime, it just moved up a little bit. And it could be that we view that at so much good content over the last few years that it's become -- you have to make a good choice, right. You've got 20 good choices, you're choosing.","So it could be that the merchandising system is concentrating a little bit of that when something comes in. Regardless, we try to be accurate in our accounting, and we follow the trends regularly on a quarterly basis. And this past quarter, we noted some content that was trending up, so we accelerated the amortization on that. We wanted to be upfront, even though it's relatively small based, if you look at it in comparison to the overall U.S. content spend it's relatively small.","Reed Hastings","Peter, let me give you a little example, it will help on this one. Suppose we pay $1 million dollars for a title for a four year license, and we think it's going to go 1 million hours of viewing. But the title is just incredibly popular, and instead it does 10 million hours. But many of those hours are in the first month as supposed to spread over the four years. Well, then we would accelerate the amortization of that million dollars, even though the whole thing is doing much better than we ever thought. Its relative proportion overtime is more upfront. So that's why we would front load that million dollars.","Peter Kafka","And generally what's happening, are these things over performing or is there a mix where they sometimes are performing less well than you thought?","Reed Hastings","It's not about the total performance that gets us to change the amortization, it's the relative performance overtime. And so if it performs a lot in the beginning, relative to how it does at the end. That's what gets us to accelerate.","So your earlier question about write-downs is what's missing. You're not quite getting that, let's see, if a title under performed our estimate, but was very back-loaded, then the right accounting would be to shift it out further as oppose to pull it up. And so you're thinking of it in a write-up and write-down sense, and that's not actually how it works. The schedule is based upon how it does overtime relative to the license period. Did that example help?","Peter Kafka","No, no, but in both cases you're saying look, we have these things for so long that it always worked out. That is why I was asking about the write-down part. You've never once reached a point where you missed entirely and you found something that no one wants over any more time.","David Wells","Let me take that, Peter, because I think there has been a couple of questions on that. We certainly license things that perform less well than we expected sometimes, right. There is a portfolio of content that we're licensing. We don't always get it right. But in the case if something that doesn't perform as well as we expected, we're not a producer that has ultimate revenues like a production studio that has to write that down based on a lower expectation of revenue.","We have something available on our service in broadcaster accounting. And in broadcasters, if we're deriving revenue over the life of that license period over the service, it doesn't result in a write-down. It just maybe an opportunity cost that we can license something better down the road.","Theodore Sarandos","Well, and a good recent real world example is Longmire. We just released the original fourth season of Longmire. So season one, two, and three, which we've licensed for several years on Netflix, they were at the kind of tail end of their life, actually exploded when Longmire season four launched.","So it's very unique to the behavior, like nothing actually performs like everything else. So we are trying to do is make sure the amort matches the viewing patterns.","David Wells","And it's a good lead in to remind everyone that these are dynamic, right. That's why we look at it every quarter, because things change. We see when something gets released like Longmire or we release the third season, then the first season of that particular title may see a bump. So it's something that we're constantly looking at.","Reed Hastings","And where it's ambiguous, we would tend to want to amortize it more quickly. That's advantages to us.","Theodore Sarandos","Right.","Reed Hastings","But it has to be justified by the actual viewing patterns.","Mark Mahaney","On global rights deals, Ted, just a big picture, as you see yourself, is the company able to negotiate more and more of these content deals on a global rights basis?","Theodore Sarandos","Yes, it's definitely been the drive of myself and my team all year, trying to move the sellers into a more of a global mode. Remember, they are mostly situated as regional sellers of content, sometimes the rights are fragmented in their ownership. But in the cases of the deals we did this past quarter, they were controlled by one entity and typically solved by multiple regions and we corralled the deals into the corporate offices, and were able to license the world on those titles. Titles that we think will have great global appeal.","So I think the growth, the opportunities, the challenges of Netflix are all global, so that its having a lot of regional discussions around the world isn't that efficient. And it turns out that tastes are rather global too. So it's actually really well lined up.","Mark Mahaney","And then Ted or Reed, when you think about the mix in international markets of local versus global content, any general change in your thinking on what the optimum mix is, and you find it that you're constantly toggling with depending on the market that you're in?","Theodore Sarandos","It's interesting, like you said every time we launch in a new market, we know more in that first 24 hours of viewing, than we did from a year of research. And in terms of the move, I think, we went in expecting Japan to be much more local than it turned out to be. It's more local than other territories, but not as local as conventional wisdom would have had.","And it actually moves with a global desire for some of these large shows, so that the local tastes are usually determined by what you have access to. And if we're growing the access to great content around the world, people are moving or migrating to that kind of viewing. So that's why we're able to do local language originals, our own global originals and then licensed content, not just from Hollywood to the world, but from the world to the rest of the world.","Peter Kafka","Another international question. Can you guys give us any update on China, either in terms of what you're thinking about in terms of timing or what your approach is going to be to a really regulated market there when you do show up?","Reed Hastings","We can tell you, well, we're still learning a lot. So nothing really specific our helpful, except that we're still in early stages.","Peter Kafka","And lot of you guys mentioned getting in new Pay TV Window for a specific movie, The Big Short. Are you negotiating those deals now on one-off deals for individual movies or you're doing these for whole slates?","Theodore Sarandos","There were conversations directly with producers. So a lot of times, well, if you can get to the rights before they get fragmented, that's when you could do those deals. So they tend to be more curated title-by-title in that way.","Mark Mahaney","Reed, I think I'll just ask one last question directly to you. When you think about the biggest challenges that you think Netflix faces over the next several years, three to five years, what do you think they are? What do you focus most of your time on?","Reed Hastings","Well, I would say the biggest challenge is, our being the service that people want, really feeling out more movies and more TV shows. We're working so hard to have these great original productions, and if we could have 10 more Oranges and 5 more Narcos, I know I'm putting a lot of pressure, that would be really transformative.","Especially, I'll bring up the Narcos, we've got an example, because it was filmed in Bogota, Columbia. The main company doing it, it was a French company. So it's a very international production; Brazilian cast. And we have an incredible production Marseille, which I'll give a little plug for, that's in filming now. And I think it will be a really great crossover around the world kind of crime, drama, family, politics.","And the more we do these around the world, obviously, that's great in a local market in terms of establishing our bona fides and reputation with customers. But it's also great, because there is something new, something fresh. And as long as we're continuing to push the bounds on things, like original movies or international productions, then the consumers are really embracing.","Mark Mahaney","David, help us think through and it's I guess one of same things I am sensing very strongly is just increasing appetite enthusiasm for original content. From a P&L perspective, that $5 billion next year in content spend, theoretically if that was 25% original content versus 15% or 10%, the impact of that on margins, as you mix shift more and more towards original content, is that accretive to margins?","David Wells","Well, the good news for me as a forecaster is it does take Ted a little bit of time to actually produce these shows. So anyway, we get a little bit of lead time in terms of some visibility into the production. So our targets at 40% U.S. margin already encapsulate this shift towards originals overtime.","I think we made some earlier comments about a long-term shift that could be upwards of 50% of originals, and we still anticipate being able to meet our margin targets and also shift towards originals. It's going to bring more amortization in, but we think we can do both.","Reed Hastings","And I'll use the word expansion. So think of it as our license content is growing, but our original content is growing faster. There is a mix shift, but I don't want that to get misunderstood as a reduction in license spending.","David Wells","We are still spending on licensed content.","Theodore Sarandos","And remember, between original films, original cartoons, animated shows for kids, our original scripted series, we're releasing more original titles in Q4 than we released in entire second year of original programming. So it is accelerating rather quickly and you're seeing it.","Peter Kafka","Reed, you said for a while now, the future of TV is apps, and now Tim Cook is saying the same thing, it's now the conventional wisdom. Do you think individual viewers or consumers want to pick and choose their own apps, their own shows, serving in a la carte world or do you think there's a role for someone who sort of bundle all the stuff back together.","Reed Hastings","Well, that will be a really interesting question over the next couple of years. We're going to work really hard to expand our movies and TV shows so quickly in such a compelling way, that lots of the viewing for movies and TV shows is through Netflix, which is sort of what makes us want to focus so much on that area.","But I could imagine future bundles emerging. Once there is a whole bunch of apps, and as you go through this industry change now, next probably three, five, 10 years, where there is a lot of discrete offerings, everybody is improving their brand value.","And then you get to a maturing phase of the market, and then there is some consolidation, which could be acquisitions, it could be other things or it could be bundles. But the next couple years, when you have this new phase of the market, I think everyone is just racing to make a great app like Netflix, like HBO Now, those things.","We should hit your last question here, because we're running out of time.","Peter Kafka","This will be it. It's a small one. You're seeing some folks sort of rebundle already, right. Hulu is showing Showtime together. Would you be comfortable having Netflix bundle with another service?","Reed Hastings","We don't see a lot of take rate from our consumer side on the Hulu Showtime. We think we're better focused on just establishing the Netflix brand. Again, at this phase in the market, we think the real key is focus.","At some future time the bundling may be appropriate. Of course, we'll keep an eye and watch the Hulu Showtime take rate to see, to confirm that there is very little traction of that. So we'll be open minded. But our instinct is focused on making Netflix the passion brand in this space.","End of Q&A","Theodore Sarandos","And before we sign off, we should remind everybody that Friday, tomorrow, is the premier of Beasts of No Nation on Netflix and in selected theaters around the country.","Reed Hastings","Awesome movie. I hope you guys all watch. Thank you guys.","David Wells","Thank you.","Theodore Sarandos","Thank you."],"15788":["Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call July 17, 2019  6:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Reed Hastings - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO","Spencer Neumann - CFO","Gregory Peters - Chief Product Officer","Theodore Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Spencer Wang - VP, Finance & IR","Conference Call Participants","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities","Spencer Wang","Good afternoon, and welcome to the Netflix Q2 2019 Earnings Interview. I'm Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, Spence Neumann; Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; and Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters. Our interviewer this quarter is Mike Morris from Guggenheim.","As a reminder we'll be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary.","With that, let me turn it over to Mike for his first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Michael Morris","Thank you, Spencer. Good afternoon. Let's jump right into the results and the member variance from guidance in particular. What changed during the quarter versus the outlook that you provided that made such a significant impact this quarter? And you didn't mention the content being perhaps a factor. I think that's really something we haven't focused on in the past in terms of driving the cyclicality, so maybe if could you talk about those things.","Reed Hastings","When we're forecasting, Mike, in the beginning of the quarter, we make our best estimate. And as you can see over the past 3 years, sometimes we're forecast high, sometimes we forecast low. This is one where we forecasted high. There was no one thing.","And if I think about three years ago, we were also light, and we never really were confident of the explanation. Then, we were $2 billion in quarterly revenue. Now, we're going $5 billion. And so it's easy to over-interpret the quarter membership adds, which are a bit noisy. So for the most part, we're just executing forward and trying to do the best forecast we can. Do you want to add anything to that, Spence?","Spencer Neumann","Yes. Thanks, Reed. Maybe I'd just add the fact that when we think about those paid net add forecasted, it's really about the marginal growth, Mike. On a subscriber base, it's over 150 million members, so we're talking about plus or minus 1%, 2%, 3% in growth rates on subscribers on an annual basis that are growing over 20%. So if we look at the trailing 12 months, we grew our member base by over 27 million members. If you take that forward to where we think we'll be at the end of Q3, we think we'll be, on a trailing 12-month basis, over 28 million members. So we're really playing for the sustained increase in growth in our membership over time, and there'll be some quarter-by-quarter choppiness along the way based on things like seasonality and content slate and so forth.","Michael Morris","Can you provide a little more detail perhaps on the gross add versus the churn dynamic in the quarter, including -- there's the pricing dynamic I want to get to as well, but maybe if we just back up and look at gross adds versus churn and how that resulted in the net.","Spencer Neumann","Yes. Sure. I mean generally when we looked at the -- the slowdown in subscriber growth was across all of our regions. So you talk about our kind of top of funnel or gross adds, we saw that slowdown across the board, which indicates to us some level of seasonality and kind of the overall, as we say, the kind of timing of the content slate. And also, frankly, maybe a little bit more pull forward of our subscriber growth from Q2 to Q1 because we had such a strong Q1 with 9.7 million paid net adds. But we also did see in regions where we increased prices, we did see some elevated churn rates and lower retentions. So it was a combination of those 2 things. We think the primary story was around seasonality and timing and nature of our content slate, but pricing played a factor.","Now, the good news in all of that, as you saw, Mike, I think in the letter is that in the first couple of weeks of Q3, that growth has reaccelerated again. We're seeing both that top of funnel growth in acquisitions. We're also seeing improvement in those churn rates and retention back down towards those pre-price change levels. So overall, encouraged with the trends.","And with regard to that pricing piece too, it's worth kind of reminding ourselves it's all -- that's all very revenue-accretive. So while there may be some short-term slowdown in subscriber growth because of pricing, that increased revenue is very good for our business and ultimately for our members because we reinvest the bulk of that back into great content and great product experience for our members.","Michael Morris","Can we talk a little bit about that pricing cycle and where we are right now? So 2 things, I guess, specifically in the U.S. by June, the entire membership base seen a price increase such that there wouldn't be a lagging impact in the September quarter. And then internationally, obviously it's much broader. Can you highlight any particular markets, anything you can help us size the portion of your member base that is processing through those pricing increases?","Spencer Neumann","Greg, do you want to take that or do you want me to take it?","Gregory Peters","I'm happy to do that. So I mean in the U.S. situation, we're through all those notifications. Obviously in the international perspective, we've got different markets in different places. But I would say just in terms of helping you size that, I mean we've built obviously that into our forecast for our Q3, so those effects we've already tried to account for and categorize in that forecast.","Michael Morris","Okay. Great. And then, Spence, one other question with respect to the [letter in] [ph] the outlook. It's the second consecutive quarter you've come ahead in operating income relative to your guide. You're maintaining the same full year guidance. I know that you've referenced the marketing, but help us there with, again, maybe why the timing. From your perspective, forecasting hasn't been as clear given that it feels that you would know when certain marketing was coming through.","Spencer Neumann","Well, it's marketing we have -- and Ted should chime in, too -- but we have some discretion as to when we choose to support titles. And so we're really -- when you look at the back half content slate that we have, we're very excited about -- with Stranger Things 3 already launching, but then shows like Casa de Papel and Crown and big movies in the fourth quarter and money -- sorry, I already mentioned Money Heist, sorry. But there's just -- there's a lot of content to support, so I think it was just really discretion of the team to move some and shift some of that marketing spend into later -- to the latter half of the year.","Michael Morris","Okay. So with some of these pressing topics covered a bit, Reed, usually we'll start with an overview question. And so I guess, we're halfway through the year now, this dynamic perhaps aside, any change to your view of the business strategically overall? And I guess embedded in that is touching on that question of your confidence about the growth outlook going forward, and why an investor shouldn't look at this quarter and say perhaps the business is approaching maturity more quickly than we anticipated.","Reed Hastings","Yes. I mean if you look over the past 12 years that we've been streaming, in the beginning, there was Hulu and Amazon and YouTube and Netflix and we've all been growing at tremendous rates over the last 12 years. And now it's really catching on in a big way around the world and we're having a lot of new competitors enter over the next year. And I think our position is excellent. We're building amazing capacity for content. Our products have never been in better shape. Our rate of investment is extremely high. So if investors believe in Internet television, which I think is an easy one to get there, then our position in that market is very strong. And all of the key things are coming our way in terms of, again, stronger content and a stronger service.","Spencer Wang","And Mike, if I could just add on your topic of maturation, I would just also point out that revenue growth did accelerate by 400 basis points in Q2 versus Q1. If you look at our guidance as well for Q3, I think you'll see that trend continue as well. So financially, I think that's actually a sign that things are picking up or continuing to grow very steadily.","Michael Morris","Great. Thank you for that.","Theodore Sarandos","I'd also just add too, on a similar or in the same vein, is on a show-by-show or film-by-film basis, we're also seeing -- hitting new heights in terms of viewer penetration and audience reach as well.","Michael Morris","Okay. Okay. Great. Let's expand the discussion a little bit. Greg, over the past year plus, we've talked about some of the partnerships that Netflix has struck with the traditional video and wireless providers. I understand each can be different. There can be different accounting treatments. But perhaps can you give us an overview right now where we are on partnerships? Perhaps domestically in particular, how they're impacting the business? Did they have any impact during the quarter? Of course. But just in general, what do we look like in terms of those impacting and where we might go from here?","Gregory Peters","Sure. So yes, there's a long history of these partnerships starting back with sort of the simple device integrations back to the Xbox and Sony PlayStation, but the latest incarnation as we sort of added more capability to each partnership from just the simple device integrations and being able to access the experience, this sort of payment integration and things like that is this bundling that we are doing with pay-TV operators, with mobile operators. And to characterize where we are, we're still fairly early in that process, I would say, from a global perspective. But the bundles that we are doing are nice incremental accelerants to our acquisition, especially into a user population that may not be as tech-forward as the folks that sign up with us directly. They may not have a Smart TV connected to the Internet at home, they may not have an adapter product like a Roku or an Amazon Fire TV, but they do have a set-top box from their pay-TV operator, and if we can put the Netflix application in a nice seamless integration into that set-top box. If we can then include the actual subscription to Netflix as part of their pay-TV offering as a bundle, then it makes it super simple for those folks to be able to get the same kind of experience that our subscribers who sign up with us directly do and get the same benefits.","So we're going to continue to expand those. We've got tons of opportunity, I'd say, globally around the world to add more and more partnerships, so we're still fairly early stages there. But I also -- our perspective is that we anticipate that, that bundle acquisition channel is a nice supplemental incremental component, but a minority component of our overall subscriber acquisition process.","Michael Morris","Okay. Let's turn a little internationally as well, Ted. Prior to the results today, data that we had seen indicated some strength in particular markets that seems content-driven strength in France and Germany in particular in Europe; Japan, South Korea in Asia. Curious if you could characterize any particular markets that -- I realize you mentioned the relative weakness. The guide was across the board. But any particular markets seeing more of a tailwind right now, particularly a content-driven tailwind?","Theodore Sarandos","Well, one that we're going to be looking for starting this week is going to be La Casa de Papel that Spencer just mentioned. This is our largest non-English show, [indiscernible] throughout the world at a very high level. We also have Elite and Chicas del Cable from Spain that are enormously popular shows, and new seasons coming in the quarter. And Sacred Games from India, which was a big driver for us in its first season, dropping a new season this quarter as well. And in the past 3 months with the release out of Germany of How to Sell Drugs Online, The Rain season 2 from Denmark and Quicksand from Sweden, what's been amazing is they've been deeply relevant in the home country, traveled the region very, very well and it found global audiences. So the 3 shows I just mentioned from Germany, Denmark and Sweden have 12 to 15 million global watchers. So we're seeing some real locally, regionally and globally relevant content coming from all over the world.","Michael Morris","Great. And you mentioned India. It's a topic we like to dab a bit more into because of the size of the market, of course. So I guess for Ted and for Greg also, in this market in particular, as we approach the second season of Sacred Games, a bit of a milestone, where are we on the content offering? I think you've referenced some other markets where you can start with an original, it gets some traction, but you really need a certain amount of bulk to offer there. So where are we in the content offering in India? I also know you mentioned or I have seen reference that you have five other shows, particularly series or projects that we have a green light.","And then, Greg, perhaps tied in with the question about product pricing, you made a reference in the letter to some new pricing. Can you talk a little bit more about both the product and pricing in India in particular?","Theodore Sarandos","Yes. Before we get into pricing, the only thing I would like to add is that our -- we announced five new originals for India. The one we're also really excited about later on this year is Baahubali, which is our first step into a really large-scale Indian original film. It's based on a film that was hugely popular a year ago, and this is a series prequel\/sequel model that we think is going to be incredibly popular in India. And we've been seeing steady -- nice steady increases in engagement with our Indian viewers that we think we can keep building on. Growth in that country is a marathon. So we're in it for the long haul and we're seeing nice steady progress.","Gregory Peters","So as we're expanding that content offering and seeing that engagement grow, we think that there's an opportunity then to be able to broaden the access to the service and so more people can enjoy that increasingly relevant content offering. So that's clearly the motivator behind adding this mobile tier offering, which we think -- it's going to be a lower price point. In a market where the typical pay-TV package is under $5, we think we need to have a lower price offering to improve the accessibility, but also one that complements the existing tiering structure that we have. So that's the primary motivator for that move, so we can broaden the audience that can love that content, enjoy that content that Ted's team is making. And that's great because like when we launched Sacred Games season 2, when you have a bigger audience for it, that means we can create more social buzz and more excitement about that show. So we're doing that. We're also working on the partnerships we have in the market because we think there's specific opportunities to improve accessibility via those partnerships as well.","Michael Morris","Great. And Reed, broader question. How do you view your potential subscriber base globally? I think a lot of us use the sort of broadband -- connected broadband marketplace, but how do you see it? I would imagine you see it as larger than that. And historically, you've given us the 60 million to 90 million member outlook for the U.S. Would you be willing to put some parameters on what you think the global opportunity could be? Or why wouldn't you?","Reed Hastings","Well, we do wonder, in the fullness of time, can we be as big as YouTube? YouTube is 7x larger than us roughly in viewing hours, and a phenomenal service. Of course, it's free. So the real question is can we produce enough content that people are willing to pay for? If you look at benchmarks, it's about 700 million households that pay for television outside of China, so that would be kind of the equivalent of the U.S., 100 million, so that's one established market.","Now, do we have enough content in each of those countries? Most of that is local content that gets consumed. But the Internet is capable of some very large customer bases, as you I'm sure well know. So we'll just take it year-by-year and try to have our net adds continue to grow. We still think our net adds this year will be larger than last year. We'll keep pushing on that. And what we want to do is just grow the net adds every year and then the future takes care of itself.","Michael Morris","Great. I want to talk about a couple of broader strategic topics here. Reed, in the past, you've clearly stated that you view your competition for consumers' time pretty broadly, sleep, video games, et cetera. The financial press though loves this concept of streaming wars between Netflix and a number of existing and new platforms. So do you think that streaming wars is a fairer characterization of what the future holds for Netflix and for video entertainment?","Reed Hastings","Yes. I mean high level, it is. Certainly, all of Ted's world is very competitive. It's never been a better world for talent. They get to bid themselves off between us, Disney, Amazon, et cetera. So there's a real battle for who will pay for content around the world, but it's not a zero-sum competition. I think everybody gets that people will subscribe to multiple shows. Add wage -- most Netflix employees are HBO subscribers. We love the content they do and that spurs us on to want to be even better. So it's a great competition that helps grow the industry. And the advantage of having something catchy like the streaming wars is it draws more attention. And because of that, people, consumers shift more quickly from linear TV to the streaming TV.","Michael Morris","Great. Greg, over the past 12 months, you've spent -- the company spent approximately $1.5 billion on technology. I mean a couple of specific questions. First, can you help us understand sort of the scalable part of that spend versus the incremental part of that spend? And maybe to the extent you can quantify, Greg, to the extent you can perhaps talk about the types of things that would fit into 1 of those two buckets, that would be great.","And I think also a question that we get is really how your technology spend can be a competitive advantage in this competition for subscribers. So is there anything you can point to from the consumer perspective where you really feel like it's, whether we see it or we just enjoy it, that separates the Netflix platform from the competition there?","Gregory Peters","Yes. There's a lot there, so let me try and take it piecewise. I would say the majority of that spend we would say is a fixed cost investment which returns increasing benefits at scale. So as we grow our business, we get higher leverage off that fixed cost investment. There is a small portion of that, that I would say is sort of incremental to how we scale that -- you can think of that as either on the deliveries cost side. We seek to invest on the content delivery side to make that more efficient, so that's a fixed cost, but then we obviously have certain elements of that cost which just scales as we grow the business as we deliver more streams, right?","But a couple of examples on this so you can see the benefits from a consumer perspective, just to pick a few. So one is when we think about sort of our encode efficiency. And this is how we actually take the moving pictures that our creators produce and then reduce them into a digital form so that we can actually deliver them to a variety of different clients, a variety of different devices around the world in a wide, wide range of network conditions back to like gigabit-plus, constantly reliable all the way to super flaky networks that we see in markets, let's say, in a mobile environment. And so we try and make that encoding process so good that pretty much we are maximizing the capability that we have, the connection that we have to any given consumer in that wide range of environments at any point in time. So obviously, that's the consumer benefit is realizing just a good quality picture experience and more engagement, more compelling immersiveness in the content. So that would be an example on that kind of fixed cost return.","Reed Hastings","And Greg, about how many AV tests do you guys have running currently?","Gregory Peters","So let's say, in a year, we'll run, let's say, 400 is a good benchmark. And these are situations where we're -- we have a theory, a hypothesis of how do we present a better experience which is more compelling to our users which gives them a better experience, more engagement. And we'll test it out and then based on how the users actually use the service, we'll determine if that hypothesis was correct or not. And obviously, the ones that work, that are a better experience will roll out largely to our whole universe typically of users around the world.","Michael Morris","Great. A place you didn't quite mention was the user interface itself. We do get questions about discovery and particularly with all the content that's being invested in. There's a survey that I just read about from Nielsen. 2\/3 of streaming users know what they want to watch when they go to the service, but another 1\/3 look and they spend 8 to 10 minutes, according to the survey, looking for something to watch. So that's my question for you. Does that seem right based on anything you've seen? But also, is that a good thing or a bad thing? And where is the interface, from your perspective, to making that great?","Gregory Peters","Sure. I mean we obviously track those numbers. We have our own metrics that we use around how our members engage with the service, how much time they spend in the discovery process, et cetera. So we have our own view on that. And I think the Nielsen numbers are -- they're a good sound-bite, but don't reflect the typical experience. And I would say generally, I think we're doing a pretty good job as evidenced by sort of our growth and engagement and general growth in subscribers.","Now, having said that, we're bringing a tremendous number of titles to the service and many titles which people don't know. They haven't heard of it before. So we have an opportunity to continually improve and get better and better in how we present the right titles to the right audience and in a way which is meaningful to them, which explains to them why a show is relevant to them and gets them excited about watching that. And so a lot of those 400, call it, AV tests that we run in a year are around trying to figure out how do we do a better job at that. And we have a healthy road map of good ideas about how to make that better and better, and we're excited about that. We think that, that is a competitive advantage. If we do a good job there, we can deliver a better service experience that unlocks the value of our content library in a more effective way.","Michael Morris","Great. Great. Okay. So I want to talk about some key content-related items. And I think we know the well-publicized topics that I want to get to. But first, Ted, can we just talk about your current strategic point of view on investing? And I'm thinking about allocation of resources across a couple of vectors, global versus local market-focused content, films versus series, and I think Netflix-branded versus licensed. Just if you could tell a sort of from a high level where you stand on how you're splitting your resources there.","Theodore Sarandos","Well, one of those three that cut across all of them is the original branded content versus license, which is producing the kind of programming that is globally relevant and globally important. And I think we've seen shows like Stranger Things right now that plays almost completely globally, performing off the charts in every country in the world. We saw similarly last quarter with Umbrella Academy, a show that is incredibly a global show. So there's plenty of content that is global and there's a lot of content that's very, very specifically local, and we're balancing constantly between those 2. And every once in a while, you get something out of like La Casa de Papel from Spain that also becomes a global phenomenon that has nothing to do with what we've seen for -- since the beginning of film and television, that almost all content that travels the world is in English from America, and we're seeing those dynamics change pretty rapidly. But at the same time, it's a very large audience and about most of the English-speaking content travels. So we're constantly doing those trade-offs between the 2.","The overarching strategy that we're continuing to drive toward is, over 6 years ago, we got into original programming, betting that the license program would be more and more difficult to come by and that maybe the sources of original -- of license -- of content to license for will be under different levels of strain. That has paid off, we think. We think it's been very important to the business to continue pushing down that road, so the more international, more global, more original film. We also have a large investment coming up in animation that will serve us to see some of the fruits from early next year. So we think we're betting in all the areas of content that our consumers love.","Michael Morris","And just a follow-up. Film has been something where, clearly, we've seen more volume and more focus, at least on a relative basis. Can you talk about why film is incrementally important for the platform overall relative to the series? And is it fair to say that more effort is going there? Because it certainly feels like it from our perspective.","Theodore Sarandos","I would say more effort than in the past couple of years and I'd say more successful effort in the last -- than in the last couple of years. So that's what I've been most excited about. When you see a film like Murder Mystery hit an audience as large as it has, you'd start thinking, well, we really aren't benchmarking against our ability to license Pay 1 movies. We're benchmarking against the consumer perception of what movie they want to see on Friday night. So that competition is for very large-scale films, for very intimate indie films and everything in between. And I think the team has done an incredible job this year in punching those films out into the zeitgeist, becoming the most talkable moments like Bird Box, like Murder Mystery. We think in Q4, with Irishman and 6 Underground, that these are the kind of films that people just think about when they want to watch a movie and they're not -- not when they want to watch a pay-TV movie.","Michael Morris","Great. So you mentioned this, Ted, and I'm happy to ask you and open it up more broadly, but really a big question about the high-profile content coming off the service over the course of the next year or so. I think the first question is about impact, and you addressed it a bit in the letter, but when -- we have The Office, we have Friends, we have the Disney-branded content in particular coming off the platform. So again, you addressed it a bit. I'd love to hear any expansion on it. One is just how much of the viewing consumption does this make up? Either person-by-person, I think there'd be differences between the amount of viewing and the number of members that are viewing it for one day. There's also a domestic and international dynamic. And then also just the sort of historical precedent. You have had content like Family Guy, X-Files, things like that, that has come off. What -- help us with the precedent to how we should think about this.","Theodore Sarandos","Since we started streaming 12 years ago, the consistent dynamic is that content comes and goes. The licenses come on, they expire, they get competitive, they go somewhere else, that's been true. This is the kind of second round with the Pay 1 Disney films. Remember back in the day, we used to license them through Starz and had them on Netflix and it was a big swing off, along with films from Sony at the same time.","So we've seen the entire output from Fox. We've seen the entire Nickelodeon kids output come and go on the site. And we grow through that by, we believe, by making these early investments in original programming and getting our consumer and our members much more attuned to the expectation that we're going to create their next favorite show, not that we're going to be the place where you can get anything every time. And we think there's more value in that proposition than there would be in the kind of low price aggregator.","Spencer Neumann","Mike, the only thing I might add to that is just, as Ted said, we've been planning for this for a long time, but when you look at our -- we don't have any overconcentration in any single studio or any single show. We talked about it in the letter. Any single show, even the most viewed shows are single-digit -- low single-digit percentages of viewing. And there is going to be -- as content rolls off the service and when and if it rolls off the service, it's going to be over time. If you look out 3, 4, 5 years from now, that second run license content, there's still a very meaningful portion of what's on the service today that will still be on the service 4 or 5 years from today. So we're just going to continue to focus on our strategy of developing more and more original programming. And obviously, as Ted said, if there's a second round license programming that's available, then that's still part of the business.","Michael Morris","Understood. Before, we talked about that allocation of budget there. The international versus domestic dynamic for some of that specific high-profile content that's coming off, is the consumption of it and the availability of it consistent on a global basis? Or is this primarily a domestic phenomenon? How should we think about that?","Theodore Sarandos","It's primarily domestic now. Like it's -- by way of example, we just recently added Big Bang Theory to a lot of our international territory. We never had it available to our -- in the U.S. So I think it's international -- it's more of a domestic-driven initiative today that -- and success, we believe, it will be an international one, too.","Michael Morris","Okay. And then, of course, you're spending money on this content. So it's not like it's just leaving -- you have resources being freed up, if you will.","Theodore Sarandos","Absolutely.","Michael Morris","When we talk about though the availability of product, if there's one thing to take a sort of iconic piece of content off the shelf and not have to have it recreated. When we think about redeploying that money and expanding your budget even further for originals, are there constraints on whether it be talent, any types of resources available? Or do you think that there's ample opportunity to go out and redeploy that?","Theodore Sarandos","We definitely think there's ample opportunity, particularly across film and television. Like we said, a couple of years ago, we were not investing in animation at all. And today, we're investing very aggressively. I also think that the emergence of the next global storyteller being from anywhere in the world certainly opens up that opportunity, and we are becoming much more seasoned producers all over the world to do that.","Michael Morris","Okay. Great. Now, you are investing more on your own capabilities, of course. And Greg, I think that one thing that we don't talk about much is the technology side of the studio and production. Is there an opportunity for Netflix as a technology company in addition to being a media company to take advantage of some opportunities to be a more efficient studio, a better studio in terms of what you're working with Ted on?","Gregory Peters","Yes. So if you think about the number of titles that we are producing and the strength that we have in technology and analytics, we do think that there is an opportunity back to the discussion we just had around making a fixed cost investment, either in terms of efficiency benefits or outcome benefits, just the quality of the dollars that get to the screen that impact the user across the range of titles that we are producing. Now, I would say it's early days here. So we're trying now replacing a bunch of bets and we'll see sort of how those bets play out.","But just to give you a sense of -- make it a little bit less abstract and more concrete, when you think about after show or a movie has been made, you make a trailer to promote that. We use this on-service. We use this off-service, right? And typically, the first step in that process is someone goes through and they look at all of the scenes in that show, for example, and they inventory like who are the characters, what's happening there, and that sort of provides us index so that they can actually take that material and then from that, use that index to assemble, in the creative process, what's a compelling trailer. Well, we can increasingly use automation, use a technology investment to basically do that indexing process so that our trailer creators can really focus their time and energy on the creative process, taking the result of that automated process and putting together something which is super compelling, tells a story of what the show is in an authentic way and makes it more attractive to users. That's just one example of the kind of investments that we are making that we think have that kind of returning leverage against scale.","Theodore Sarandos","And I would just add that being an efficient producer is a very good thing to do obviously, but being an efficient distributor and being an efficient marketer is P&L-changing. So that's a way to think about. We're working in all 3 of those things at the same time.","Michael Morris","Great. I want to move a little bit to the reporting and the granular reporting of data that you referenced on the last call. One of the places we're seeing it more clearly is in the U.K. with the top 10 list. So my 2 questions are, #1, can you share any results from that U.K. top 10 list, #1? And #2, what can we, as consumers or members, expect going forward? And then I have one follow-up with respect to what it means for the talent, of course.","Theodore Sarandos","Well, the one thing we are -- we said this in the last call as well. We think we are being much more transparent with the creators and increasingly with the public in terms of what's being viewed on Netflix, mostly because I think people use a lot of different inputs to figure out what they want to see, and popularity is definitely one of them. And we're trying to figure out how to balance off popularity against some all the other personalization tools to get people that opportunity that if they want to see what everyone else is watching in their country, in their city, in their town, that we can present that to them in a way that helps them make better choices. But in general, I think we're still testing the best application of that and it's still very much in active testing mode.","Gregory Peters","Yes. I'd just want to comment. I think we feel like there's a great way to actually enable that personalization, but enable popularity signaling for the users that want it. It's just basically looking at the folks that use that popularity as a factor in the decision-making they take about on what to watch next and making sure that those popularity signals are available and very present for those users. And for users who don't seem to want that, then we can sort of make those less present.","Theodore Sarandos","Yes. And there -- as an example of a very granular piece of data that we shared recently was in the first 4 days of Stranger Things 3, more than 18 million people watched the entire season. And why share that number? Because the very next follow-on to that was, wow, I'm one of those 18 million. I want to tell my friends about it. Or oh my God, I want to be one of those 18 million. Or are you one of those 18 million? So it creates a lot of excitement in the fan base when you can give them some data to chew on.","Michael Morris","So from a public perspective or from a member perspective, should we expect more consistency in that type of data? Or is it going to be a one-off on selected items that you feel are valuable?","Theodore Sarandos","Yes. I think we'll be increasingly transparent with producers and then, over time, more and more. I really like that it's important for us to help condition the market to understand what the viewing data is so it's not being compared apples-to-oranges against things that are not similar. And right now, if we start publishing tomorrow, we'd be the only streaming service doing it.","Michael Morris","Right. Right. So the value of this data to your content partners, content creators, as you create more of these large-budget films, you have actors or other talent that historically perhaps were compensated on box office performance. How are you approaching that when you want to make these big-budget films and you want to incentivize talent? And maybe the flip side to that is perhaps you have a little protection if a film doesn't do as well. In the traditional model, is there a way that this data starts giving you both the incentive and the protection?","Theodore Sarandos","Yes. I think -- and what we're trying to do is it's a very new model, particularly for box office-friendly talent who want to make their next big film in Netflix. So we have to figure out a model that, in success, how would they be compensated? The fact that it's guaranteed, there's some discount applied for that. And in fact, if it's paid out over a quicker period, there will be discounts applied for that. But ultimately, we want the economics to be pretty neutral or at least are similar to what they would be if they had a big hit film in the theaters. And that's what we negotiate film-by-film, talent with -- actor-by-actor.","Michael Morris","Great. I'll open this up to anyone, Reed perhaps. Looking at the product placement or rather product partnerships for Stranger Things, certainly very high profile, a lot of buzz, very broad. In the letter, you referenced it as being more about building the product itself versus monetizing. Does it become a monetizeable part of the business at some point? Or put differently, expand a bit on the benefit of doing that and how that might be broadened to other properties.","Reed Hastings","Well, we're monetizing it today in more membership growth. The focus is get more people excited about Stranger Things. So they join Netflix. They tell their friends about it. So this year, we'll add about $5 billion of incremental subscription revenue, which is almost all of gross margin, and that's faster than any entertainment company has grown in the history of the world. So what we want to do is keep that engine going, keep that subscriber engine going and not get distracted with alternative revenue sources which just don't add up when you're growing $5 billion a year. So the core focus is create all these merchandising opportunities, tie-ins, touch points so that you feel the Stranger Things energy so that more people join. So together, as we do monetize all that, it's just we're monetizing it through our giant engine rather than through little sidecar vehicles.","Spencer Wang","Mike, I think we have one more...","Theodore Sarandos","You should think about -- particularly in the case of Stranger Things 3, you should think about all those product partnerships as a character in the film -- in the show. Remember, the show is set in 1985 and it's set in the heart of -- when the big summer blockbuster movies were jammed with product placement, and there was really a creative choice when they talked about pitching that season out more than -- almost two years ago.","Spencer Wang","Mike, we have time for one last question, please.","Michael Morris","Okay. Great. Usually, we like to do a big picture, but this is one very specific financial question that we get a lot, and it's really about the margin potential of the business over time. I think it ties together a lot of these different things that we just talked about. But Spencer, we've had the chance to hear your opinion a bit. I'd love to hear you expand on it. Because Netflix is a single revenue stream product, you are very clear in the letter that advertising is not part of your future despite what we read in the press. Can Netflix ever achieve the type of margins that we've seen historically out of cable networks, be it an HBO, which is a unique single revenue model whether -- or another network that was a dual revenue stream? Or are we inherently going to be sub-historical average margins for Netflix on a global basis?","Spencer Neumann","I mean, you take it or you, Reed? I can take it.","Reed Hastings","You got to do it.","Spencer Neumann","Okay. Well, look, yes, I think, yes, we've demonstrated over the last few years that we're focused on building a very healthy long-term business model and growing those margins roughly 300 basis points for the last few years to a target of 13% this year. When we go for -- when I look forward in terms of the margin potential and scale the business, first, Reed talked about it a bit earlier, our aspiration, for a business that's already at 150 million paying members, is to be a multiple of our current size. So that is a network with a relative scale for a premium entertainment network that really hasn't been seen before for those comparables that you mentioned in terms of those historical margins, so that works in our favor. ","And we also think about the revenue per any individual subscriber, and whether that's advantaged with a dual revenue stream or a single revenue stream. And our calculus now for building a global network is that we're best served to focus on that single revenue stream, winning those moments of truth with a great member experience and then continuing to price occasionally against that in a great value proposition when we start with great content, create experience and then offer it at a reasonable price. We think we can do that in a way that obviously continues to scale margins in a very healthy way.","We're not going to provide specific guidance. But when you look at those comparables, there are some things that work in our favor and some things that don't. So scale is in our favor. We think the subscription model is a terrific model for us. So certainly, we believe that there's going to be more margin accretion over time. And again, I'm going to kind of leave it at that, but you can assume that we have a long way to go.","Theodore Sarandos","And Mike, well, we don't want to end on something that dry. I could say two things really quickly. One would be that -- to congratulate HBO on an incredible record-breaking year at the -- for Emmy nominations. They continue to be the gold standard that we chase, and we're really thrilled for them. And also to the end of this month, in July 26, we're going to wrap up our seventh season, our seventh and final season of Orange is the New Black. And I wanted to thank Jenji Kohan for her incredible vision that helped really drive this whole idea of Internet television to new heights. And the show wraps up in a really incredible and emotional high and we hope the fans love it.","Michael Morris","Awesome. Great. Thank you for livening that up, Ted.","Reed Hastings","Thank you, Mike.","Michael Morris","Thanks."],"15784":["Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q2 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call July 16, 2018  6:00 PM ET","Executives","Spencer Wang - VP, Finance & IR","Reed Hastings - Co-Founder and CEO","David Wells - CFO","Greg Peters - Chief Product Officer","Ted Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Analysts","Todd Juenger - Bernstein","Spencer Wang","Good afternoon, and welcome to the Netflix Q2 2018 earnings interview. I'm Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are CEO Reed Hastings; CFO David Wells; Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; and Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters. Our interviewer this quarter is Todd Juenger from Bernstein.","As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary.","With that, over to you Todd, for your first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Todd Juenger","All right, thanks Spencer. So let's start with the obvious. So for the first time in I think five quarters net additions came in below your own forecast, both in U.S. and internationally, so whoever wants to, maybe you could help us walk through where was the source of that shortfall and what do you attribute it to? David, you want to hit that?","David Wells","Yes sure, Todd. So, in general I would say acquisition which is up year-on-year, but wasn\u2019t up as much as we thought it was going to be. So and it was pretty broad across multiple markets, it wasn\u2019t even one area of the world. And as you pointed out, after four consecutive quarters of under-forecasting the business we over-forecasted the business.","And you know, we strive for accuracy, we clearly didn\u2019t have the number, but we think based on the rolling 12 months of growth that we've had compared to the prior rolling 12 months of growth the U.S. up slightly, internationally up significantly that the background and underlying characteristics of the business haven\u2019t changed.","Our total addressable market is intact and hasn\u2019t really changed based on those 90 days of actuals. And in general we think that the conversion and growth to internet enabled entertainment is intact and people are loving it. People are adopting Netflix around the world increasingly more in our newer markets as well. And so I think we're still on track for a strong growth year this year and maybe it's going to come in a little bit differently than we expected and others expected.","Reed Hastings","And Todd, you noticed probably that paid net adds are up compared to year ago and forecast to be up on year-over-year in Q3. And the fundamentals have never been stronger. Our viewing is setting year-over-year records that shows that we have coming, so we are feeling very strong about the business.","Todd Juenger","Terrific, I'll stay on this for just a couple more follow-ups and then we'll move on to broader things. Just wonder over the course of the winter there were some well publicized essentially global pricing increases, I wonder if you think that had any impact on either retention or gross adds relative to your forecast?","Reed Hastings","Oh we don\u2019t think so Todd. I mean if anything we are all of 2017 we sort of had rolling increases in various different parts of the world we were able to grow continually through that and we continue to, so I don\u2019t think that is contributing to the strength.","David Wells","And Todd, we've seen this movie of Q2 shortfall before about two years ago in 2016 and we never did find the explanation of that other than there is some lumpiness in the business and continued to perform after that.","Todd Juenger","Great. Let me hit on Q3 really fast or else I wouldn't be doing my job, so you are kind enough to always give us a forecast for that and it just stood out to me that I think it's slightly below net added from year ago, I only had a quick chance, I think that's I don\u2019t know that's some paid or total or both?","David Wells","It's all total Todd. So as we pointed out, paid net adds are actually up year on year, but again we try not to focus too narrowly on like a couple of hundred thousand, right, around any one particular quarter. If you kind of look at Q2 and Q3, it's essentially kind of flat with last year and last year we had sort of 5 million, about 5 million global net adds in Q1, 5 million Q2 and 5 million Q3 and then 8 million in Q4.","Years prior we've always had very strong growth in sort of Q1 and Q4 relative to Q2 and Q3 and we think that pattern is going to happen again this year and so again we tend to focus on 12-month rolling over 12-month rolling not only in particular quarter because as we pointed out we've seen this movie before and we've been through these cycles of growth and we think the sort of background fact of people adopting internet entertainment including increasingly more international adoption is going to drive really strong year-on-year growth in international with U.S. hanging out in that 4 million to 5 million net additions band that has been for the last four to five years.","Todd Juenger","All right, one final sort of segue on to bigger things, so has the results or any learnings from this quarter caused you guys to change at all your internal forecast longer term for either sub growth or revenue growth or free cash flow?","David Wells","No, you know, as Reed indicated, I'm David, I'll take it again and others can chime in, but the business fundamentals the on track for 10% operating margin we indicated we do not support exchange headwinds, they kind of push us towards the bottom end of that range, but everything else is sort of tracking according to our target and plan. And so again we feel pretty good about it.","I mean obviously when you have sort of a million net adds we are going to manage within the band of marketing spend and other things to protect that operating margin growth in the short-term, but long-term nothing has really changed.","Todd Juenger","All right. Don\u2019t worry Greg and Ted, I've got plenty for you, but moving to the other elephants that was already in the room, and just checking a bit on the competitive landscape, obviously a lot going on between Disney and Comcast and Fox and Sky. So I need to check in and hear what you are thinking in terms of what impact on Netflix. However, that result turns out and is there any particular results better or worse for your own competitive fortunes?","Reed Hastings","Yes, there's a lot of new and strengthening competition with Disney entering the market, HBO getting additional funding, the different French broadcasters coming together, so that's all normal and expected. So it is what it is, we're not going to be able to change it and then our focus is on doing the best content we've ever done, having the best user interface, the best recommendations, the best marketing, all of the things that we've been doing for many years in the past and we'll keep doing for many years in the future.","Ted Sarandos","And the other thing I would add to that Todd is, the market for entertainment is so big that there can be multiple firms that are successful, so you've heard us talk in the past about how we've been able to grow dramatically in the U.S. in HBO and other networks have also similarly been able to growth at the same time, so it's a very large market.","Greg Peters","And in our programming we've always been focused on keeping people entertained and satisfied on an absolute basis, not relative to any consumer. So we're just trying to -- or any competitor, so really by keeping an eye on our members and our consumers we're better served than hyper focusing on competition.","Todd Juenger","So one of the most frequent sort of investor questions related to this topic is access to content, licensed content, particularly from Disney and Fox. Let me start with this very specific one, there is a wide, wide, variance in degree of opinion on how much content on Netflix comes from off network licensing of Disney and Fox content, care to narrow that down for investors and give us some sense of just both from a availability perspective and from a different viewership perspective how much is there?","Ted Sarandos","No, I don\u2019t want to narrow it down anymore than it is, but I would tell you that it's been a number that's been on the decline for several years. You should think about it the way we looked at this long-term is that our competitors will want that content on their own services. That was a bet we made a long time ago when we go into original programming and every year since that we've been doing less and less off net business with Disney and Fox. And our bet is long term, that they'll want all their content on their service. In the short to medium term, we're still licensing content off net from them and they're also producing original content for us like Nurse Ratched from Fox or the Marvel series from Disney.","Todd Juenger","I know you've answered this question Ted, I think the last two or three quarters consecutively, but I've got to ask again, any reason to expect those types of -- sort of original shows that you get from Disney and Fox to change given the new information that from what they are doing?","Ted Sarandos","No, those shows are for us to cancel and we're super happy with the performance of them so far, so and the Nurse Ratched and some other Fox original titles are still upcoming.","Todd Juenger","So speaking of your own originals, I want to touch on a couple of sort of relatively newer areas of focus for you and just check and see how it's going, so one is unscripted, right and it seems, and you talked about this last quarter, it's been a sort of recent elevated higher priority for you guys, how is that going, what's your experience been, is it being enjoyed by your members as much as you thought?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, and we're super excited about the variety of the shows and how they are landing with consumers. Similarly we thought a long time ago that the unscripted networks are also going to want to keep their own content for their own services and we started investing our own unscripted programming and have had some really great out-of-the-box hits with Nailed It and Fastest Car and Queer Eye that are doing great with our watchers relative to building an audience and also you saw Queer Eye did quite well at the Emmys, the nominations announced last week. So we're really excited with the progress and the speed to market and we've been able to do our unscripted shows at really high-quality.","Todd Juenger","On the original movie side, another not quite-so-new area of focus, but still more recent, what is your assessment of your progress versus where you'd hope to be on that front?","Ted Sarandos","We're moving as quick as we can with and still delivering what have been movies that people want to watch. So we saw on the letter, we talked a little bit about the results of our romantic comedy, Kissing Booth and there was much made in the press this summer about our romantic comedies have all been pretty successful, Set It Up just after Kissing Booth.","And so these are movies that are not really being made in the market much and we're doing and moving into those, but we're also doing a lot of the big event films with A list directors and these are long lead production times and we're really excited with the way they've been delivering in terms of viewership and we think that we'll see similar trends that we saw in television, but it will take another year or so as we get into it.","Todd Juenger","And one final one I wanted to check in on which will allow us to move forward here with what I'll call non-English language for lack of a better word. It seems like you're making more stuff in other places of the world, it seems like that's having success all around the globe. I wonder if you could confirm that and talk about your own assessment of the returns you're getting on those sorts of program investments?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, similarly fast ramp up an early success. So we've been producing shows that are incredibly relevant in their home territories and the nice windfall is they get viewed all over the world. So we saw that recently with Reign and Dark. We certainly, in India we saw great success recently with Sacred Games, that really people - really excite the market and these are places where our global business play well too.","So it's really I think accelerating the brand perception of Netflix as not just an out-of-towner, but someone who is producing content you care about in every part of the world. Upcoming this year we have new seasons of Chicas Del Cable from Spain, Ingobernable from Mexico, we have initial from Spain called Elite coming out in Q3, Ghoul in India coming out in August and these are shows that are produced at a level that are really high that consumers get really excited about and it helps them get really excited about Netflix if they are not quite sure who we are yet.","Todd Juenger","All right, so now that we've moved on outside of U.S. I think we should - Western World, can I check in just a little bit, specifically on Asia and carve out India for a second, so I'm going to come to India specifically later, but just \u2013 so Asia is a huge reason generally I think we've talked in the past how the content tastes there are a little different, the business model you are hoping to find the exact right formula. How is your growth going in Asia, generally what is driving it, is it at a similar pace at the same stage other markets in the world, any deeper info you can give us on that part of the world anybody?","David Wells","Reed, why don\u2019t you take it?","Reed Hastings","Sure, you know I'd say Todd, we're starting to turn the corner in many other nations where our viewing is climbing up as we're continuing to improve the programming and when we get high viewing in every other market that has brought in a fast growth. And so we've see that, it's varied country-by-country, I'll include India in the description and say we are really pleased with our progress and tracking we're making since we launched two and a half years ago. And we just have a lot of work and a lot of opportunity ahead.","David Wells","And Todd, the only annotation I would say is, look it's still early. We launched with a very sort of a skim model approach and we've out augmented that, right. We're adding payment methods, we're adding more content. We are working on all the playbooks that has been successful for us in other markets of the world and you see that through increased investment and so that sort of last wave of expansion for Netflix is still relatively early and that's affecting our growth numbers, it's affecting our levels of investment as well where other marketers are sort of growing in profit, that actually those markets collectively are growing in loss and we have more growth in the profitable markets than we do in the loss markets and that's what's growing the overall margin.","Greg Peters","Yes, and we've been very thrilled with our original production of anime that's being viewed quite and regionally throughout Asia and of course in Japan, our scripted series and our unscripted series like Busted! from Korea or Terrace House from Japan are viewed throughout the region which are building brands bigger and bigger.","Todd Juenger","So thank you for sort of carving out India separately only because - for a number reasons right? As such a place with huge potential, I think numerous executives have been quoted into various places recently talking about the potential there. You've got some new original shows there. So specifically in India, if you could dive a little deeper into where you are on the growth curve there. How you see the path to success and how big that could be for you in the next many years?","Greg Peters","Well Todd, we\u2019re way behind YouTube, Hotstar. Those are really the leaders on the internet. And there is so much TV viewing at Linear TV that could be internet viewing. And the advantages are tremendous in India for internet viewing because you don\u2019t get the ad load that you see that\u2019s so high in all of the other platforms.","So Netflix is having great success getting established, getting a reputation going and with this triplet of Lust Stories, Sacred Games and Ghoul, we're really getting some nice momentum in our India growth. Now it still \u2013 we\u2019re still as David said a niche product, we\u2019ve got a long way to go to expand languages and many other aspects to able to cover \u2013 be a broad Indian product. But in terms of our beachhead, I\u2019m very pleased with what we\u2019ve been doing.","Todd Juenger","Greg, there seems like there is some maybe seemingly obviously particulars about the Indian market from a product perspective that might be peculiar. How much of that is, just from the infrastructure that exists and the affordability in the marketplace. Is that true and if so what you\u2019ve got up your sleeve to try and make Netflix easy for everybody in India to enjoy it?","Greg Peters","There are definitely a few specific things that we\u2019re doing there to get payments and how sign-up has to happen. We just rolled out some improvements on the sign-up flow on TVs. So we are making that easier for non-members to become members in that dimension. But actually a lot of the work that we do that helps our members in India is actually applicable in some sense globally as well. Whether that\u2019s more efficient encodes to make the viewing process higher quality, start faster that obviously is great for our members in India but it\u2019s great for members around the world.","Downloads is another great example where now we've rolled out downloads for when you don\u2019t have great connectivity or you don\u2019t want to use the data in your data cap. Now we\u2019ve just actually rolled out the next iteration of that smart download so we can make that process even more fun and easy by having episodes you watched, automatically delete and get replaced by new episodes whenever you come back on our Wi-Fi network. So it\u2019s a mix of both India specific and just globally relevant.","Todd Juenger","Yes, I know you talked about payments and just that whole stream. It\u2019s a question that comes up a lot with me with investors is just a thought about the affordability of the products relative to relative incomes, that comes up a lot in India. I'm going to broaden the question to just various places in the emerging world. How much room do you guys feel you have there in India and other places, are you \u2013 do you sense you're reaching a limit in any sense in terms of the utility of the product compared to alternatives and customer\u2019s ability to pay that would affect retail ARPUs anytime over the near horizon?","Greg Peters","I would say we\u2019re far from reaching a limit in terms of the addressable market given the pricing structures we have right now, we've got a lot of room to grow in a reasonably affluent part of the society in India and other markets around the world. So much more runway, but having said that we\u2019re constantly testing our pricing models what pricing strategies work best for our members around the world and trying to find what features, what tiers we can add to make that \u2013 a both a revenue positive but also a consumer friendly and consumer fair kind of approach.","David Wells","And Todd just to build off that a little bit, when we\u2019re talking about India a little bit as homogenous, but breaking this apart, Reed has mentioned it, Greg has mentioned it. We may have an issue where there's three or four different sort of growth patterns within India in terms of different demographics, different segment and groups as we address one segment and then we start addressing another and so forth and so forth. And each one has a specific set of challenges with it and we\u2019re in the early days of sort of that first segment. So yes, expect more from us in terms of getting into segments two, three, and four.","Greg Peters","I don\u2019t think that the price point is mostly relevant to the value proposition. Our Indian consumer is finding a lot to watch on Netflix and having a great time doing it and if there are that price point becomes more of a value proposition than a premium proposition.","Todd Juenger","Yes, just picking up on that, once statistic that you guys sometimes mention and sometimes don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think I saw it in the press release was a notion of engagement as one good perhaps indicator of value received by your members. Any comments on where engagement I guess defined as hours streamed, hours streams per member, so this quarter, is it still growing in line with content growth any thoughts?","Ted Sarandos","It is indeed still growing Todd on a year-over-year basis our viewing and actually mostly measured by median view hours is growing. So we\u2019re super excited about that. And we\u2019re still a small fraction of as of every society\u2019s overall viewing so I think there\u2019s still room to grow there.","Todd Juenger","Got it, one more on pricing, just because I know you\u2019re always testing we all know that, but one of your tests got picked up in the press we actually stumbled across it, is this idea of an ultra plan seems to be a test for HDR viewing that you\u2019re experimenting with. Just any thoughts you want to share on the theory behind that and the marketplace acceptancy you think might exist for that type of a plan?","Greg Peters","I'd say more generally rather than speaking specifically to end results because that\u2019s still very much in progress. We want to test it both ends of the spectrum here and try and figure out ways to add more value for those members who might see that being good value while we\u2019re testing it\u2019s more accessibility how we can create a way to access Netflix for a broader group of people. But a test that\u2019s still in progress and no results to discuss at this point.","Todd Juenger","Fair enough, so another way that you\u2019ve been going to market increasingly it seems is with these partner deals and maybe there is a better internal word for them and they were mentioned again in the shareholder letter, I'd love to check in on a couple of things on that. So first of all is anybody willing to tell us roughly how important these are to your net add growth to your overall subscriber base. Any sense of proportionality there other than what you said in the letter which is basically a supplemental channel, but the majority is still direct?","Reed Hastings","I think I had to reiterate that the vast majority of our acquisitions still comes by consumer signing up directly with us. You were fairly new when it comes to these partner bundles we\u2019re excited and optimistic about it. So I think that that will grow as a percentage of our acquisition. And what we\u2019re really excited about is actually allows us to sort of more efficiently address different consumer segments.","So take the U.S. for example a market we\u2019ve been relatively well penetrated in by doing a deal like with Comcast allows us to put the application on the setup box where consumers that might be less early adopters or more late adopters are already watching traditional television by being included in a bundle we get to remove a separate purchase decision. We get to eliminate the sign-up flow which just makes it super simple and easy for consumers to sign-up via that mechanism.","David Wells","And Todd just to be consistent with what we said in prior quarters it is a growing element of our acquisition right. As Greg said, as we penetrate into demographics in established markets that may not be on the early part of that as of adoption and also our newer emerging markets where partnerships may allow us to do things like partner billing and tap into consumer trust that\u2019s a little bit earlier in the cycle that if we establish that ourselves.","Todd Juenger","Is there any feedback you\u2019re in a position to share from the partners themselves in terms of how these programs are working for them? Not a single -- T-Mobile comes to mind just because they have been added in the States the longest, but any place in the world you characterized their feedback to you?","Greg Peters","Yes I think, it is something that's very important to us because obviously we want a sustainable model around this where it's adding \u2013 it\u2019s valuable to the partners, perceived as valuable by them n supporting their business so that they want to continue to invest in it and expand it. And again market-by-market its different, but it's either a differentiation strategy where our partner is seeking to position themselves slightly differently, but oftentimes it just actually a way of them communicating to the consumer the value that they are investing in their network or the quality of service and like that and having Netflix, an amazing content that we have and having a really high quality experience with that is a great way of just telling that story to their customers and their customers to be.","Todd Juenger","It creates a great narrative that that they\u2019re a good video source because when you\u2019re talking about Netflix it becomes the symbol of a great data system right?","Greg Peters","Especially when you think about we\u2019re trying to be super innovative on the video quality and audio quality all those things that you unlock by having a great network and a great service.","David Wells","And just add on Todd, we\u2019ve been doing partnerships with other partners for many, many years and we\u2019ve had many multiyear relationships with many of our different partners. So as Greg said we want to be sustainable and because we have had these for many years, I think you can extrapolate from that that they are very successful for both parties.","Ted Sarandos","And Todd it's not a radical thing, NVPDs bundling another network, that's pretty [well tried] territory on their side.","Todd Juenger","One of the things that these partnerships gives to you is also some marketing investment which is done on your behalf by them. Coming into the year, one of the themes that seems to that I interpreted from you guys was a little bit relative increase in the emphasis of your own marketing investment behind your content and your service, just checking and had so and I guess we've see that in financials too. So just how is that going? Are you seeing the returns that you hoped for? And any specifics? Can you may be help give us some examples of specific types of marketing programs and how you measure your investment of that where you're spending these incremental dollars?","ReedHastings","We\u2019re very pleased with growth and our ability to invest. A lot of it is behind title brands and seeing how do we help title brands really maximize their potential within the overall system and we're doing lots of tests trying different methods in different countries, learning what\u2019s the most efficient ways to build demand for a title. So there's tremendous amounts of learning going on there and then we're also doing acquisition marketing and learning on that side. David, did you want to add to that?","David Wells","No, I think that's great. Just to remind Todd it's been a while we've been out of the sort of, we spend this much on marketing, we grew this much directly in a quarter. We - only a fraction of our spend is oriented around direct acquisition. What Reed is saying is like the majority of the marketing spend call it 80%, 85% is oriented around building title brands and we've got good evidence that we can do that. We're just parsing through what the most efficient mechanism is to market those titles and also where the right amount of spend is as well as we grow our content library.","Reed Hastings","And what we see a lot is that the channels themselves vary by the top - around the content itself too, so learning more about how to get more and more refined about which channel is for which content, get the best results are the things that we're learning right now.","Todd Juenger","And Ted, were you pleased with the Emmy nomination campaigns?","Ted Sarandos","I was thrilled. So we took the record obviously it was the most, but the thing I was most proud of is we had 40 different shows nominated, to kind of give you an idea of the kind of different variety of things that we're doing, scripted, unscripted, comedy, drama, talk shows, everything across the board, everyone was represented, it was 40 shows we were the very happy people last week and millions of fans around the world too.","Todd Juenger","Well, here comes the world's most inelegant segue, but being respectful to your shareholders, the single most popular question I got in prep for this, so I'm going to share it with you out of duty to that. I'm sorry was it revolving net neutrality and so I guess we have a new administration relatively here, not that new but between that and some other\u2026","Ted Sarandos","Around the world the net neutrality has won as a consumer expectation and some countries have net neutrality laws, other countries don't. But broadly around the world consumers have the expectation and ISPs are delivering it. So I would say the net neutrality advocates have won the day in terms of those expectations. So we don't see any changes of that in the U.S. or other countries. So it's quite a positive outcome for changing cultural expectations in a positive way.","Todd Juenger","Okay, flipping back in elegant way to my more core line of questioning and speaking of big investments Ted, I didn't give you a chance yet to talk -- you've got some big new partners in terms for your producers on overall deals, it caught the attention of investors obviously, your Ryan Murphys and your Shonda Rhimes and your Jenji Kohan not to leave out anybody. Can you help us think through are there more of those to come? A as one question and more deals like that and more people like that? And sort of secondly related what's the timeline, when - has development started from any of these resources and how long before we see the output of their work on -- starts to show up on Netflix?","Ted Sarandos","That's a great question and they are - you should think about it's a pretty rare creator who has an ownable sensibility who produces a lot of content prolific and successful. People like Shonda and Ryan and Jenji and Jason, they have a brand and they care about the brand and they want to create on that brand, they want to be - and they want to create a lot. So we could give them an infrastructure to do that at Netflix because we have a great history of finding -- connecting an audience for all those different shows.","So that\u2019s not true of all creators, but it has been with the shows that we're doing so far and we're looking and we will probably do more, but it is a pretty rare breed of creator. And then we just physically moved Shonda into her new home here at Netflix and we're thrilled. She has a couple of shows percolating now that we can't announce yet, but we're really thrilled with the direction she's going. Ryan's finishing up his work at Fox and then he will be full steam ahead. Remember his last two shows at Fox are going to be our first two shows actually with The Politician and Nurse Ratched. So we\u2019re in the Ryan Murphy business in a big way. And then Jenji going from Weeds to Orange Is The New Black, and to GLOW was exactly I'm talking about being prolific and successful, so we\u2019re really thrilled.","Todd Juenger","All right. Moving David to your very specific world and then a popular question I received. So and you answer this every quarter. Just regarding your continued use of debt to finance your current free cash flow deficits especially in an era of rising rate or current environment of rising rates, just need to check in and make sure we understand your logic and your continued ability or plan to finance the company and the future deficits for next [year]?","David Wells","We continue to see debt as the most optimal choice, the most cost effective use of capital or sorry source of capital for the company. Obviously we'd love to get to that point where we're organically and self-funding content and we do see a point where we can't get there, but until we do, we see debt as the right choice in terms of cost to capital.","Todd Juenger","Another popular question, I am getting through as many as I can before Spencer tells me time is up, so here is another one and probably for either Ted or Reed, you guys get this a lot. Investors still want to know your desire or appetite for sports type of content rights, for news oriented type of content rights or for other expansions of your platform, you either get into audio or gaming or selling other people's products any of those sorts of new genres or potential expansion theories where you are on those?","Ted Sarandos","No change in our long-term views that have been as you referred to expressed over and over, we have such an opportunity in movies and TV shows of many types around the world that it's consuming every bit of energy and excitement that we have.","Todd Juenger","Got it. Let me if I can move to what I think might be sort of the seminal question, two questions, for long-term Netflix shareholders which is really you've got about 130 million global members now. How long is it going to take you to get the next 130 million and if you double your members, are you going to need to double your spend in content and marketing to attract and retain them?","Ted Sarandos","Well it's kind of hypothetical to think about the P&L structure, we\u2019ll learn as we go. We've been very attentive to all the key factors which is we want to invest enough on content to make our subscribers incredibly happy because that's how we grow. So you know it's a really smart investment for us on the content side. We want to invest in product and marketing to make the whole service better, to make the shows be more aware.","We also want to steadily increase operating margin over the next several years, and so as an example, we've got some adjustments to make because of foreign exchange rates and we know we'll make those adjustments and we'll grow into that. So I think of ourselves continuing every year to figure out how we make certain adjustments to keep the operating margins growing, the subscriber base and revenue growing, and that's been a basic way we've been operating over the last several years.","So it was more of the same, and in terms of the dartboard as you know several years out on when we double, the answer is not soon enough. We're always pushing hard to figure out how can we get even more growth, but we're awfully pleased with what we've got to.","Spencer Wang","Todd, I think we have time for one more question.","Todd Juenger","All right. So I guess I'll use that just to expound on the big dartboard I just asked and maybe start with Greg and then anyone else who wants to come in. When you think about the product itself which is the underpinning of the belief you have in the growth, what's on your short-term and long-term list of things that you think your members most desire would move the needle most from a product perspective, from a content perspective, from a overall pricing and value perspective and therefore drives your agenda I guess each of you over the rest of this year and into the coming decade?","Greg Peters","It\u2019s a long, long list and we want to make really almost everything better about the product. I'll just sort of highlight one that\u2019s fun and happening right now. We talked about sort of improvements in the mobile UI and smart downloads but I don\u2019t want to leave out TV and it was all of this amazing content that we\u2019re bringing out.","We\u2019ve been working really hard over the last several months and quarters even testing and researching, how do we make that TV experience faster, more fun, easier to find, the stories that our members will love and we\u2019re actually going to roll some improvements out to that experience and make that better starting tomorrow. So starting this week you\u2019ll see those and that\u2019s what we expect to be a long line of incremental improvements that make that experience even greater for finding the stories that you love.","David Wells","And I'd say in the short term we\u2019ve got, I have got the great pleasure of trying to make people very happy and in the short term we\u2019ve got new seasons coming up the second half of this year of Orange Is The New Black, Ozark, Iron Fist, Daredevil, Narcos, the finale of House of Cards, the followup series for Making a Murderer and we have some brand new IP coming up with new shows like Insatiable, Maniac with Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, Disenchantment from Matt Groening, the creator of the Simpsons doing animated comedy for us, a new show from Greg Berlanti's company, the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina a spinoff of Riverdale that's been hugely popular for us.","And that all ramps up to bigger and better feature films too for our fans around the world starting with the Christmas chronicles from Chris Columbus later this year and Bird Box from Sandra Bullock with the great Susanne Bier directing. That will lead us into next year we have movies from Martin Scorsese and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and all these fantastic directors and the opportunities are just limitless.","Spencer Wang","And then for me and Reed have the honor of going there and wrapping this up, but I would say we've got 130 million members and the prospect of adding, wherever that is 104 million the next 130 million, all of those folks enjoy connectedness and as we grow to enjoy more stories that are sourced from wherever in the world I think the ability for all those folks are a great portion of those folks to enjoy and see a story and discuss that story, in the same moment is great and Netflix being an enabler of that will continue to do that and I look forward to the 8 billion of content growing from here. We think we can grow operating margin, but we're also going to grow content spend which will enable more of that content.","Reed Hastings","And Todd for me it's about connecting the world and sharing the stories all around the world. I think we've got so much more we can do with that as we learn the various arts of dubbing and style and I think that will make a really profound contribution to the world in addition to just entertaining everyone which is very joyful to work on.","With that, let me thank everyone for participating in the call and look forward to spending time with you guys investors over the quarter. Thank you very much."],"15636":["Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q2 2015 Earnings Call July 15, 2015  4:30 PM ET","Executives","David B. Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Theodore A. Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Analysts","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","David B. Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Hi. Welcome to the Q2 2015 Netflix Earnings Interview. I am David Wells, CFO. Joining me today on the company site is Reed Hastings, our CEO; and Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer. Interviewing us today is Mark Mahaney from RBC. And sitting (00:29) in for Michael Nathanson, who couldn't make today, is Rich Greenfield, veteran interviewer. So we welcome him back.","Just a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements; actual results may vary.","I think it's over to Mark with our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks, David. This was an upside quarter. Let me go through \u2013 we'll go through some of those factors. I'd like to ask you about them. You did 900,000 net adds in the U.S. You had guided for 600,000 net adds. That's an usual level of upside. What drove it and how sustainable was it?","David B. Wells - Chief Financial Officer","We think it's content. It's the building momentum of our original content. It's hard to isolate it specifically to that. But given that we've grown at about 600,000 subscribers for the past two years and this year we were up to 900,000 subscribers in Q2, which seasonally is usually a weak quarter for us relative to Q1 and Q3 and Q4, we just had a really strong slate; and I think it showed through in our results, both U.S. and international.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then, Reed, as a follow up, you've long talked about 60 million to 90 million potential subs in the U.S. market. Looking at these results and looking what's implied in the guidance for next quarter, it looks you're on track to add more subs this year in the U.S. than last year. Do you feel better about the upper end of that range, any comment, any updated thinking on that long-term range?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, Mark. We've been tracking at 5 million to 6 million net adds for several years now; and our hope is that we could just keep that going, 5 million to 6 million net adds every year for a number of years. And then we'll be solidly in that range, (02:03).","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Reed, when you look at the price that you offer, the actual Netflix price of $9, when you think about the fact that the average subscriber is now using Netflix over two hours a day, it just seems like that price point doesn't really fit with the amount of usage. How do you think about the elasticity of your price point now? Do you either start raising price more often or do you simply let people increase their price and they take you through the 4K plan or they need four subscriptions per account, like how fast can we get pricing up now?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Rich, our entry level plan in the U.S. is actually $7.99 for our standard-def one-stream plan. So it is incredibly affordable, and that's part of what's propelling our growth. We also want to motivate people to be able to move up to the two-stream and the high-def and also the ultra-high def plan as you referred to.","Over the last year, we've raised ASP about 5%. We'd like to keep that moving. So we're going to continue to have incentives for people to move up in the plans as suits their usage pattern, but we want to take it very slow. Things are going well. There's no reason to be disruptive. We're not planning anything in the U.S. this quarter. It's really focused on going very steady, very slow; and over the next decade, I think, we'll be able to have more and more content and add more value and then to be able to price that appropriately.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","But are there other ways that you can increase price or tier pricing beyond 4K and number of subscriptions per household? Are there other choices that you've thought about or even tested anywhere globally to drive price or ARPU?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sure there are other ways to do it, and the way that we've chosen is working very well for us. So then we tend to focus on the core, getting more content, more streaming, better usability and the structure on the price tiering is unlikely to change.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","A question for Ted. Going into this year, the company has been saying for a while this is going to be a big original content year, it's showing through in the sub numbers. Does it set up this issue where every other year you've got this tough comp in terms of new content? How do you think about \u2013 how do you follow this act, how robust will the new content be next year? Does each year have to (04:28) up higher and higher in order that you don't go down with the subs and the stock and go up with the subs and the stock, how do you make it more \u2013 how do you steady it out?","Theodore A. Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Well, we have two things that are working for us. The one, we're launching new shows that have become great brands on their own, but also as these shows grow into their second and third and fourth seasons, they're actually more attractive on their own. So we're adding more breadth of content, more original series; and those series have become bigger and bigger brands that down the road will become subscriber events as they grow.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then, David, let me ask you one more question just on the U.S. subs. There was a new user interface on the desktop that much more immersive experience. There were also a lot of competitive launches that maybe gained greater \u2013 increased the focus on the streaming potential use case for consumers. Do you get the sense that either of those were materially impactful already or the user interface improvements of those (05:24) of the impact on the sub base?","David B. Wells - Chief Financial Officer","No, Mark. Generally, we don't see \u2013 when we do a large user interface improvement. That's a very distributed effect. It's something that we're always focused on improving. Generally, it rolls out across our device landscape. We're pretty proud of a lot of the work that we've done; and in fact it gets \u2013 imitation is the best form of flattery. And so our user interfaces get imitated quite frequently across the world; and we're glad to be leading and innovating in that space. But it doesn't really translate immediately to subscriber growth. It's really a diffused retention benefit that we see through year-over-year in terms of the improvements in retention. And then in terms of the competitive announcements, we didn't see anything that was specific that we would point to.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Ted, you've talked about wanting to being HBO faster than HBO can become Netflix. When you think about the demographics of your user and how \u2013 if Reed wants to get to 5 million to 6 million subscribers in the U.S. each year going forward for several years, what types content do you need to create? And what are the demographics that you're weakest in that you need to figure out programming to hit, beyond just simply the pricing plans that we talked about earlier?","Theodore A. Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Well, I think what you've seen, Rich, is that we are launching content to multiple demographics and in all genres (06:45). So the reason why you are seeing the kind of engagement that you are seeing is that we're finding content that everyone can love, so not just one show that's meant to appeal to everybody, not a handful of shows that are meant to appeal just (06:57), we're doing shows that are kind of very mainstream comedy, we're doing very elevated shows for some, we're also doing cartoons for kids. So we really are kind of programming it across demographic and not trying to be one thing for all people or not having our brand really define what kind of content that we're doing.","You've seen in a few of our recent announcements a traditional four-camera sitcom that we hope will be watched in even bigger than traditional way, called The Ranch with Ashton Kutcher, bringing back the cast of Full House for a new show called Fuller House. But we're also doing things that are very edgy, very tough, cinematic shows like Narcos that's premiering next month, or the revival of Wet Hot American Summer with an all-star cast with Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper and Amy Poehler. So it's really programming across demographics.","When I said that we wanted to get to be HBO before they got to be like Netflix, I meant that we'd have to get very good at original programming before they get really great at the technology and the direct-to-consumer relationships that they're only starting to invest in now.","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Ted, do you want to just mention the success we've been having with the Spanish language content in the U.S.?","Theodore A. Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Absolutely. We've recently expanded beyond our own original shows. The only way to watch those shows in Spanish in the U.S. is on Netflix with subtitles and dubs available that we're making for Latin America. And now we've licensed a lot of programming from Latin America into the U.S. and are getting incredible viewing on shows that were successful for us in Mexico that are now drawing huge numbers in the U.S. And, again, that's a very different demographic than we've targeted before and are just barely starting to touch them by getting hundreds of thousands of hours of days on single shows. So really, really impressed with the relatively quick take-up on these shows.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","And maybe just tying this into international, as you think about the programming that you're now creating across these various segments or demographics, how are you thinking about the ability to leverage the programming and what's the success of these individual programs overseas versus the U.S. and some of the new markets that you've opened up? And just how that ties to David from a margin standpoint overseas, because I think that's a big investor question?","Theodore A. Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Sure. And the thing that's been very encouraging is that the proportion of international viewing of our series are pretty stacked the way you'd expect relative to the subscriber base. So Orange Is the New Black and Sense8 have enjoyed great success all over the world. And all of our shows, as we launch, are to a differing degrees out-indexing in some cases our U.S. subscriber base or slightly under-indexing depending on the install base and how U.S.-centric or Latin American-centric the show may be.","We expect Narcos will be an enormous success throughout everywhere in the world and maybe out-index in Latin America, given the Brazilian star and Brazilian director and heavy Latin American cast and that we shot the show entirely on location in Colombia. But we also think the show will be a huge hit for us in the U.S. So we're seeing that great global story telling is great story telling.","David B. Wells - Chief Financial Officer","And, Rich, just the part B of that question in terms of for investors, obviously there's benefits if we produce a show. If there's great reach across the world and we can distribute that show and it will be consumed and enjoyed across the world. So there's tremendous benefits there in terms of just the scale of distributing it. As we see so far, content is being viewed \u2013 western-produced English language primary content is being consumed in large numbers across the world. There's a lot of similarities in terms of what people like. That's what Ted just talked about. As we penetrate deeper into the markets, there might be a question in terms of do we have to add more of the local mix into that and that will have implications for our content spending in each market, but right now what we're seeing is that our current mixture is working across the markets.","Theodore A. Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","And by the way, David, I think what's exciting about that is as we add local programming into those territories, they will be able to find audiences for that around the world on Netflix, not just in that local territory. So I think we'll be able to find scale on local programming as well.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Let me switchover to just \u2013 or follow-up on the international questions, one for David and then a bigger picture one for Reed. So, David, you had about 25% upside to the number of net international subs you thought you would have. Was that pure content or were there other things that really helped in those markets, some marketing efficiencies that you found? A little bit more color on maybe some particular regions of the world that really outperformed versus your numbers?","David B. Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Well, for competitive reasons, we gave less color on the international markets. But I would say you're right in the premise of the question being it's a little bit broader than just content driving that. We think we've got some momentum that's based on brand growth in a number of markets as well and we have a strong launch in Australia as well. So all of those things contributed to the success we saw in the sort of upside versus what we thought we were going to see in Q2.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then, Reed, big picture question there is a series of these international launches you've got aggressively planned it seems like this year or next year. Can you just talk about how you plan to manage the execution risk associated with doing that many launches and that many major markets at once? How do you feel about managing the risk of couple of these markets just going off the rails, not marketed right, not contented right, et cetera?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that would be unlikely for any material market. If you look at the last four years, we've done a wide variety of launches; now over 50 nations, and we've learned along the way. So I'm not too worried about that. We're very focused. And I'd also say how we do in the first year in a new market is not that determinant of the long-term.","If I think about Brazil, we were pretty weak in the first year and now it's a rocket ship (13:02). And so, we're going to get in and really start the learning process, what's getting watched, why; what's generating buzz, why. And then in every nation we're learning. And if you think about it, around the world everybody wants this on-demand Internet TV. It's just a better experience than linear TV. So I'm really very confident that Internet TV is going to continue to grow.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","This is probably a question that we can start with Reed, but you may all have a feeling about. Hulu was a pretty significant failure; I think self-admitted failure in Japan. Curious, where did Hulu go wrong, why will Netflix \u2013 this is one of the biggest or first major market in Asia you are going into \u2013 why will Netflix be successful in Japan and what are you going to do differently from the onset?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Hulu had a couple of missteps. But now, today, four years later, under new ownership, they're actually growing and seeing some real success in Japan. But the initial missteps, where pricing was too high, it was \u00a52,000 or about $20 at that time a month, had no local content. So it seems pretty substantial missteps. In contrast, our pricing will be more aggressive than theirs was. We'll have a local content, we may have some local originals. We're really focused on doing a great job. We've got more experience than they had at that time.","And Japan is a unique market because it's very brand sensitive. So Japan will probably be our slowest market to get to certain penetration threshold, but it may be one of our best markets in the long-term because when the Japanese society embraces a brand, it's a very deep connection, very long-term. So we're willing to make that investment, knowing that it's not the quick route to success that might be in other countries.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","And are you seeing the CE companies come out and support you ahead of launch?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. The CE companies, Sony and Panasonic and Toshiba, they're all integrating Netflix into their devices. And, in fact, if you go today and buy a television in Japan, it's going to have a red Netflix button on it, even though we haven't yet launched.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","On the international side, David, if you could talk about the profitability ramps of some of the older markets that Netflix has been in and how they've looked versus either the U.S historically or some of the other older international markets? What's the profitability ramp look like?","David B. Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Well, just like in the U.S. \u2013 and we've made some comments in the past on Canadian margin getting to a 30% threshold \u2013 we've made general steady improvements year-over-year. We had some headwinds this year with the VAT change in January and with some of the foreign exchange which we've denoted in the letter to give you an indication of the impact on the revenue. But I'd say in general, the profile and the margin profile of each market is steady growth. You want to take a measured approach to make sure we're not running ahead too fast and under investing in the competitiveness of our offering, but in general it's steady growth. And in fact, we've made comments before that our consolidated markets \u2013 our wave one or our first wave of markets were profitable on a consolidated basis; and in this case, in this quarter, we expect them to be individually as well.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then in terms of your guidance going forward, there's a little bit of a surprise to us, your international operating loss is coming down sequentially even though you do have a bunch of launches. I know some of them are in October. I guess the question, I don't know if you'll answer it or not, I doubt that this was the peak international loss quarter, the June quarter, but is it just the timing issue and we really should see the strong content marketing cost behind those launches in the fourth quarter or did we just peak losses?","David B. Wells - Chief Financial Officer","No, you're correct. I mean, we kind of tried to walk through that in terms of the timing. We've got a Japanese launch later this quarter. So you're going to see new content expenses and market expenses related to Japan. And then in Q4 you'll see Southern Europe, Spain and Italy, launch as well. So you've got brand new launches there. So you should expect those losses to continue to kind of work towards that; and then next year we've got rest of world. So you've got some commentary there in terms of we expect those losses to continue to grow through the year.","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, David, is it fair to say in our plans, the international losses peak next year?","David B. Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","When you look at a year ago or basically 15 months ago, you were on this conference or on this video cast talking about kind of your disappointment that you were forced to basically pay for interconnection and sign deals first with Comcast, then Verizon, AT&T, and Time Warner Cable. Today, you're announcing that you've convinced Charter Communications as part of their attempted merger or acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House to give up on interconnection fees for at least the term of the potential consent decree. Why this issue? Was this so important to you? Were you really that worried about these costs that you would support a merger simply to get settlement-free peering?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Rich. I think we've been really clear over the past five years that we saw interconnect fees as the potential next (18:33), where it starts off at very low numbers and then constantly escalates through a set of price discovery battles that impact consumers of various shutoffs to see who can take the pain. And then in general, it sets up an ugly industry structure. And then in fact settlement free was a much stronger way to go where broadband was great for what they do. We and our competitors have to be great for what we do and we don't have to pay each other.","And so we think that's the right way to go. We're thrilled that Charter is willing to commit to that across the entire portfolio. I think that's a very substantial advantage for the public in terms of the growth of broadband in the U.S. So we're really excited about it and what it does is it freezes up from worrying about getting taxed by an ISP; and instead we get to worry about how do we make our experience better for consumers.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Are there other conditions within Charter-Time Warner that you'd like to see adopted \u2013 the government to adopt as part of a consent decree? And is there anyway given how late in the game it is for you to get these types of clauses like settlement-free peering into an AT&T-DirecTV consent decree?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","From a broadband perspective, I think this is the right condition; and so this is the one we're focused on for Charter. And then the government is still working through potential conditions on AT&T-Direct and it would be great from our perspective. Now that the precedent (20:03) is set and the details are clear, if this merger condition proposed by Charter were also applied by the government to AT&T-Direct.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Two more questions on international. One, either for David or Ted. Could you just focus on the China market and what are the variables, the key variables to determine when and how you'll get into that market?","David B. Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Mark. I would say China continues to be sort of its own entity in terms of the challenges and the particular characteristics of the market. We're taking our time and being deliberate in finding a path and the right model to work. So just continue to stay tuned. We hope to be able to launch the service there next year; and we'll continue to treat it sort of as its own territory.","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And we described it, Mark, as modest investment once we launch; and nothing has changed since we use the word modest about our investment levels.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then, Reed, you've had a long-term forecast in terms of subs going back 10 years and you've generally been \u2013 seems like you've been pretty right and the trend seems to definitely support the 60 million to 90 million, the ability to park it in there somewhere. You also seem to have a lot of confidence now about a lot of your international launches. So what's that bogie? How many international subs you think you can get to at some point in the long-term?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it depends upon the timeframe I suppose.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Long-term.","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But when we look at the global Internet, if you look at people who are in the future going to be on the Internet, are interested in video entertainment, watch some TV and have enough money to pay for a service, that's a very large potential market. How much of that we'll get, how relevant we will be in Turkey, how relevant we'll be in Indonesia? That's very open-ended question, it depends on what kind of job we can do, how well we execute. So next couple of years, we'll be able to have a clearer picture of how we will do in markets that are quite different from the U.S.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","When you think about peering, obviously you did not get Comcast to submit to anything because the deal didn't happen, you had the deal actually ended up being blocked. Is Comcast still a threat to Netflix, given that they're the largest ISP in the country? You actively pushed for their deal to not happen and they have no rules around interconnection as you look at it?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there's lots of potential threats and in some ways that's good for consumers that we have to compete with, say, Comcast's new offering called Stream. It's a potential threat on the peering interaction. The key thing about the Charter deal is it's all Internet companies that benefit; us, Hulu, Amazon, HBO Now, so that we can all compete for consumers affection; and it's that openness to everybody that's the key thing. We can hope that over time Comcast will also get to settlement free, it hasn't happened yet. It's something we'll continue to work on.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","And maybe a follow-up for Ted, when you think about the potential combinations, you've got John Malone talking pretty openly about Lions Gate and Stars and really wanting to roll up a whole number of companies into kind of one mega content company you've got \u2013 Fox tried to buy Time Warner, I think they still want to buy Time Warner if Jeff Bewkes was open to it. But is meaningful consolidation of studios, TV studios, a risk or a threat as you look at your access to content?","Theodore A. Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Rich, I really don't think it's a threat. I think it may be inevitable in what's happening around the world today. And I just think that the underlying dynamics of having a great supplier relationship with people who create content, they don't change in the ownership structure.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Let's see, let me follow-up \u2013 sorry about that, let me follow-up, Ted, two content questions. I think, Ted, at Con, you said something like 10% of your content spend is now original and you'd like to get to 50%. I think that's kind of consistent with comments you made in the past. Any updated thoughts on the timing and the speed with which you can get to that 50%-50% level?","Theodore A. Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Yeah. The intent wasn't to steer you towards the percentage, it was to steer you away from it. Meaning that what we are going to do is continue to grow our content spend on original programming, both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of our total spending, because it's been working. It's been helping grow the brand; and more importantly, it's been driving viewing hours, relative to how else we would spend the money. It's been a very efficient investment to program with original hours versus licensed hours; and that's why we keep pushing that out. So I'm not trying to guide you to a specific percentage, because at the end of the day the total content spend doesn't change, just the slices of the pie do.","David B. Wells - Chief Financial Officer","And, Ted \u2013 sorry, Mark, I would just say that we're still, given our growth rate, able to grow licensed content. We're not yet at a stage where we're sacrificing or cannibalizing one for the other. The numbers that we put in there, characterizing long-term letter our future content budgets and the growth of those still allow for the growth of licensed content as well. So it's just a trade-off in terms of the brand implications and the efficiency for us.","Theodore A. Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Yeah. And I think being a partner with the studios and networks, and more importantly being a great source for consumers to watch that programming is always going to be a part of our programming mix.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then, Ted, one more content question and then over to Rich; and, Rich, if you don't ask Reed for his thoughts on the stock price, I will after that. But, Ted, the Disney content that's coming on next year, at a high level could you explain to us how much of an impact that's going to have on overall content on the site? And do you think that that content that comes on, is it material enough to actually change net sub adds? Just from a high level, what is that content that's coming on and for a basic Netflix user what's the so what (26:05)? How excited should they be?","Theodore A. Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Look Disney has situated themselves around a handful of very important, very global tent pole brand, like Lucasfilms, like Pixar, like Disney Animation, like Marvel. And that programming causes a great deal of excitement for our subscribers, both in terms of viewing hours and then potentially there could be subscriber events. But more likely, it's about viewing hours and people finding great things to watch. And more than \u2013 even things that they watch repeatedly, which is why I think that deal was more important to us than any other studio output deal could have been; and maybe one of the few output deals that we pursue going forward because of the nature of that programming, that very specific programming. It's very complementary to our growing Marvel relationship with our Daredevil series; and households with children love and trust the Disney brand, and we love the affiliation with it.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Does that playing off of that when you think about EPIX, which is another output deal that you have a relationship with. You struck a deal five years ago, the first two years were exclusive, it was kind of something you used to help build Netflix; the last few years, it's been non-exclusive on both Amazon as well as Netflix. Is that important to you anymore? Is that contract comes up for renewal anywhere near the price you've been reportedly paying?","Theodore A. Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Well, it helped build us and we certainly helped build EPIX. And it does have a long-term conflict which is, I don't think it's in their long-term strategic best interest to have exclusive deals; and it is in ours. So regardless what happens in the short-term, our long-term will be to move more towards exclusive programming, both films and series; and that deal I think would ultimately have a long-term conflict. But, yeah, we want to have our viewers come to Netflix for great things that they love to watch, but we also want to be differentiated from all the other outlets.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","So, Reed and David, as you think about the stock price, I think we got a tremendous number of people asking kind of trying to tie back the performance. You're up over, well over 100% in afterhours trading year-to-date. Do you sense the same form or do you see the same type of euphoria that you kind of cited in your investor letter not too long ago when you think about the stock price here, or is it warranted given your outperformance in the quarter or even year-to-date your performance?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it probably shows why at least I should keep my day job and not try to be a stock picker, because when the stock was half this price I described it as euphoric. So it's a mystery to me. And what we focus on is how to get incredible content, stream it beautifully, market it in every country, grow the member base; and I think I'm out of the stock commentary business.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good. Rich, our jobs are safe. Let's see. David, let's talk about the free cash flow in the quarter. You don't give guidance on free cash flow. Did the free cash flow loss that \u2013 I'm sorry, the $230 million or whatever, was that largely what you thought it would be?","David B. Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. So we've done our best to indicate the trends that our free cash flow is going to diverge from \u2013 I mean that's going to get worse as we invest more and more content. So indeed that was expected. You should expect that to continue as we invest heavily in our original content, which is more front-end loaded from a cash basis perspective. But we've talked in the past about a ratio of content P&L expense to content cash; and that ratio has, in terms of cash over the P&L, been about 1.2 or 20%, it's drifted up to 1.3 and peaked at 1.4. We anticipate that ratio, it was 1.3 in the quarter, that's still holding. Those comments are still valid and that trend will continue. As we invest in original movies and things that are particularly front-end loaded, you might see that peak at 1.4, but we think that that ratio is still a pretty good guide for investors.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And, David, you also put a ratio in the transcript or the release about running debt now at 4.6 times LTM EBITDA. I assume you wouldn't have put that in if that wasn't also something you track. Do you want to comment on the upper and lower band of acceptable \u2013 upper and lower acceptable bands on that number?","David B. Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think we put that in there, Mark, just to make \u2013 not to have people have to do their own math as particularly debt investors on the EBITDA number. So the goal of that table is to put things that people will reference and easily want to know upfront. That's why we put content commitments in there as well; and that's why we put EBITDA in there. I don't think we have a target range on that. We fully expect as we invest more in international and as the international loss has pulled the consolidated P&L down, over the next few quarters that that EBITDA number is going to get worse.","But we still have high confidence in the profits delivered in 2017, and it's back to your earlier question about how our existing international markets are doing from a profit growth perspective. Those markets are starting to grow. Each one is better year-on-year. The ones that were not profitable last year are going to start to be profitable and then start to contribute meaningfully to profit; and then we'll see on the new markets. We have a comment on Japan being slow. We've got new markets this year growing. So we have a longer term view on the investments; and that's been validated at least in our earlier waves. So we've got great things to come we think.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","When you think about the bundle, we've seen the bundle clearly starting to fray, every MVPD we hear from is thinking about smaller bundles. We're hearing about virtual MVPDs with small offerings even if Apple \u2013 whenever Apple tries to get into the space. But there's clearly this kind of unbundling and then a re-bundling as we see new people put packages together, the way Comcast is doing with the stream that Reed mentioned earlier or even Hulu new packaging in Showtime. Is there a way for Netflix to be part of these new bundles or do you prefer to just have it be pure \u00e0 la carte offering standing on its own?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Rich, when we look around the world, NOW TV Sky's offering is an unbundling, Presto in Australia is an unbundling, of course the U.S. example. So that's something we've seen broadly, which is the rise of Internet TV and the idea that individual apps being able to choose; all of that's coming together.","In terms of being in a bundle, we would always want to be separately priced that we think the service has a great value and it's up to consumers to choose that. So it might be billed by a provider. So, for example, Orange in France does that and it's part of your cable, if you will bill, but Netflix is a line item say at $7.99 or whatever the local price is.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","And from a product standpoint, you obviously have refreshed the interface for laptops and PCs. Where are we? What are the big things you're thinking about? Kind of where you'd go from here in terms of kind of product priorities as you move into 2016?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the core is really continuing to improve the personalization, being able to more and more accurately present content on the screen, whether that's a TV screen or a phone screen that a consumer is just very motivated to click on and watch. And we've seen tremendous benefit as we've done more and more of that big data work. Then in addition on the user interface, we're always working on performance, usability, testing new ideas. We've got some pretty cool stuff in the lab with multi-video streams on the television screen. We'll see if it tests well. I'm pretty optimistic about it. But there is a ton to learn as smart TVs get better and faster as adapters like Chromecast get better. So there's a lot of innovation on the hardware side that we're taking advantage of.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","We could get back to a specific question on ARPU or ASPs. In the script you mentioned seeing a nice uptake in our HD two-stream plan. Any more color around that? And also on the four kind of digital out plan, what kind of uptake you've seen for that?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, on our top plan which is the ultra-HD four-stream plan, there's two drivers. There's people who have big families and want to watch more than two different screens at a time; and then the driver that we're really optimistic on is ultra-HD. So as more and more ultra-HD TVs gets sold at major electronics outlets over the next five years, more and more people will want ultra-HD. Each stream is about 15 megabits per second. So it takes a good quality Internet connection. Of course that's getting more and more reliable. So when we see those coming together, we see over time a significant percentage of our membership upgrading to get the ultra-HD service again over the next couple of years.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then one more question on pricing and particularly the thoughts on global pricing. I think, Reed, you mentioned in Japan trying to come in with an aggressive price point. As you think about all the different markets you're going into, do you want to offer much lower tiered pricing plans for emerging markets or do you want to try to maintain price integrity globally?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're somewhere in between. Most of our pricing around the world is pretty close to the U.S. pricing. Now the recent strength in the dollar and then of course when you add VAT and in some cultures, you have to \u2013 in some societies you have to back that out. But if you look at the underlying price structure, at this point we're going for a model where it's pretty similar around the world.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","When you think about Sandvine, I've been really surprised by the fact that Amazon despite a pretty significant ramp in programming still represents less than you increased your Sandvine bandwidth share over the course of the last six months. What do you attribute the fact to that no one else has really broken. And despite some pretty substantial $1 billion plus programming spend, no one else seems to be closing in on you, why? Because I think investors are trying to understand the barrier to entry, what is so different about Netflix? Are you becoming Kleenex for Internet streaming or like how do we explain what's happening?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Amazon is growing a very quickly in terms of total viewing hours, but so are we. And so what's happening is everyone is maintaining their relative share, but the total amount of Internet viewing is growing at a very vigorous rate. So I think they are experiencing significant success on their investments, as is Hulu. I think we'll see that with HBO Now, because there is massive move from linear programming on to the Internet.","If you mean why is our share not compressed, that's a series of reasons that certainly the brand, while in the Kleenex-type reason that you mentioned, the leadership gets conversation about leadership. It's also our only business. So we're totally focused on making a great consumer experience as an entertainment experience; and that's an advantage. So there's a number of those factors and, well, we don't take it for granted. Those kinds of numbers can switch at any time; and so we have to really continue to double down to do new things.","And I think when you look, for example, at the original movie work that Ted's been doing, it's pretty incredible. You'll see with the Beasts of No Nation, a very intense, Oscar caliber, amazing film; and then, with Crouching Tiger and War Machine with Brad Pitt coming, some really major big ticket studio films debuting on Netflix around the world at the same time. So we're continuing to try to raise the antes to get better at what we do; and I think that's the key to continuing to hold on to our share as the whole Internet TV market grows.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","And when you think about the opportunity that you have for Internet TV, is there a way to think about how many more markets you can open up this year? I mean, I think you have obviously talked about the Q3 launches. Are there Q4 launches that could still happen that haven't yet been announced? We've got that question from several people.","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. For Q4, we're focused on Spain, Portugal and Italy. Q3 being Japan...","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","But nothing else before year-end.","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's right. That's really going to be a big focus item in those markets for us these next two quarters, so nothing else before year-end.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And is there anything else outside the U.S. that wouldn't actually happen, when you talk about international. Are there actual markets, anything of any substance that wouldn't happen in 2016?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, no, we hope to open the entire rest of the world in 2016. So China, again, we still have some things to figure out, so I suppose that's possible. But in the rest of the world, we're pretty confident that we'll open. And then we'll have to see how successful we are in Poland. We have to see how successful we are in Indonesia. So there's still a lot of work to do.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","A question for, Ted, a specific one just on the Crouching Tiger. I think this question came in \u2013 I think that was pushed out \u2013 the launch date for that was pushed out, any color around that? And I think that will be the first one that will be released both on Netflix and in theaters; and it sounds like you want to do a few others that way. Is there a greater concern on your part to make sure you get it right or were there other factors?","Theodore A. Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","There was a few other factors. One is that we are going to have a premiere of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon 2 in China. It will premiere on several screens in China in 3D; and we wanted to line it up with a better window in that way. Give the film a little more time to do \u2013 we also picked up a couple of extra production days to expand on the scope of the film. We're really happy with how that's coming out and that window just lined up perfectly.","On the releasing in theaters, I think for us it's mostly symbolic. I think it's important for people to understand that these movies are not TV movies, they're of the same size and scale and scope of the movies you will see in theaters. So one way to do that is to have them in theaters sometimes. I think the movies, as they go, will be attractive enough that theater owners will want to book them in their theaters at the same time that they're on Netflix. But in terms of \u2013 I wouldn't move around to optimize for the theatrical window. So that's not really the driver. This afforded us to do a premiere few days early in China and helped to launch the film and the film brand around the world.","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And then kind of probably time for two more question here, Mark. I'll let you go.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Let me ask one question and Rich you get the last one. David, you talked a little bit about global rights deals, any implications of that for the P&L? So just a little bit more color there. The global rights deals as you do more and more of those, do those allow international margins long-term to rise up and maybe exceed even U.S. levels? And when would we actually see \u2013 we'd see some nice margin boost because of global rights deals. Is that three years or four years out?","David B. Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Mark, it is probably a combo for Ted as well. So I'll take the first part and then he can comment. But generally, it will take a while. The move towards the global right will be one that will take a couple of years, few years to really flow through. Similarly through our move towards exclusivity, and in terms of the P&L implications for international margins. It really is going to be more about the penetration growth and the rate of growth in that market to begin with. But sure, long-term, we could see some benefits in terms of back to the earlier questions on the benefits of a global distribution if it produces a piece of content that is consumed around the world, and certainly their benefits to being able to distribute that globally. And then, Ted, I don't know if you had comments you wanted to pile on and on.","Theodore A. Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","The mechanics of it are simply that we try to gain more marginal subscription revenue and more marginal viewing hours than the marginal cost to pick up the rest of those rights, and the rest of those territories; and there's been some. We've been so encouraged by the international success of all of our original programming and another proof points too like seeing Jurassic World open number one in all 66 theatrical markets around the world, that if you get the content mix right, you can build the demand for it around the world in a pretty equal basis relative to the population. So it's a pretty exciting opportunity, and we think there's a lot more.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","When you look at the programming investments that you've made and the impact it's had on streaming hours, wondering if Reed could give us a quick update on where you stood in the quarter for total global streaming hours across your user base. And just how different or how much of a gap is there between what a U.S. subscriber is streaming per day, and an international subscriber to understand the impact of your programming?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Rich, U.S. vary somewhat from Mexico, vary somewhat from Norway, but if you look at them all on a graph, it's a big cloud. They're all pretty similar. So U.S. is not unique compared to the range that we see around the world. And with each programming investment, we not only increased the viewing, and increased the satisfaction, but we learn is that the kind of programming that we should do more of, and so you really want to think of us as just a learning machine in terms of the programming, the variety of what we've done, we get so much data about how people watch, how fast they watch, that really propels our programming.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","But no update to the $10 billion?","Wilmot Reed Hastings - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No update to the $10 billion. We'll wait till we get to some nice fun and big number. But in terms of binge-viewing, of course the most important thing about this call is to let you know that Friday, BoJack Horseman Season 2 launches on Friday. So we hope everyone will have a great binge weekend on one of the most incredible shows; and it's kind of controversial when I quoted on this call Aaron Paul a couple of years ago. So I'll stay away from the bad words, it is licious (44:59) show.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Thank you, guys. That's all."],"15780":["Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call July 17, 2017  6:00 PM ET","Executives","Reed Hastings - Founder and CEO","David Wells - CFO","Ted Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Analysts","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities","David Wells","Welcome to the Netflix Q2 2017 Earnings Call. I\u2019m David Wells, CFO. I\u2019m joined today on the company side by Reed Hastings, our CEO; and Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer.","Interviewing us today will be Doug Mitchelson from UBS. We\u2019re going to try something a little different and have one interviewer just for a little bit more continuity. Then I think Doug will have our first question being our only interviewer. ","Before we get started, we will be making forward-looking statements, so actual results may vary.","Doug, over to you for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much, David. I wanted to start simply by asking if there is anything notable in the quarter? For you, Reed, you talked about Netflix being a learning machine. Anything that you\u2019ve learned that you want to share with us from the past three months?","Reed Hastings","I mean anything notable beyond 5 million net adds in Q2; all-time record for Q2s, up sequentially from Q1,do you mean notable beyond that. I think we\u2019re just seeing that the rewards of doing great content focused on the quality of the service are paying off.","Doug Mitchelson","I think I\u2019ll run through some of the quotes that you guys have on the letter this quarter, and one of first things that caught my eye was \u201cDue to our amazing content,\u201d so Ted did you put that word amazing in there, any update you can give us on thoughts around how content influenced the quarter?","Ted Sarandos","I think it was the combination of a lot of great things. 13 Reasons Why, started right at the end of the quarter, rolled into some of our biggest content brands; new seasons of House of Cards, Orange Is the New Black; ending the quarter with Okja. So just I think it was the combination of a lot of different things, kind of a reinforcement that as long as we are programming to a wide variety of tastes and keep the quality level high that we can turn some success off of that.","Doug Mitchelson","And I think congratulations on all the Emmy nominations to the company and to you specifically, Ted [indiscernible].","Ted Sarandos","Thank you. That\u2019s definitely a team effort beyond my own content team, the marketing and PR groups and everyone who kind of makes that happen. It\u2019s hard to forget that it is a race, so it\u2019s a big campaign that attaches to that stuff too, but 91 nominations is an all-time record for us and we\u2019re thrilled.","Doug Mitchelson","Continuing on the letter a little bit, David, for you. You note that our 3Q guidance assumes much of your Q2 momentum will continue. You say you\u2019re cognizant of the lessons in the prior quarters where you forecasted lumpiness in net adds. So should we take this to mean that the third quarter includes that you\u2019re cognizant of prior quarter?","David Wells","Well, I think back to your earlier question about what lessons into the last 90 days have held for us and one of them is our business is a little bit tough to predict given the success of content and the popularity of content. We still think the major driver is adoption of Internet television. But on top of that we\u2019re increasingly growing throughout the world, so we\u2019re getting more word of mouth on our newer territories and we\u2019re seeing great content slates have an effect like they did in the second quarter. So I think you can take that line to mean that our forward guidance assumes continued good trends and continued great trends. But we\u2019re a little bit cognizant of other quarters where we\u2019ve either under or over forecasted because some of that demand was pulled forward by a great content slate. In this case, in the second quarter we had a really strong content slate.","Doug Mitchelson","And continuing on with you, David, at some point ahead of expectations when you talked in the letter about margins being on track for full year 7%, would that suggest that with subs, and therefore likely the revenue coming better than expected, you\u2019re choosing to invest more and maintain that margin target?","David Wells","Yes. So we had a 9% margin in the first quarter and we had a lot of content come on in this quarter, so we got it down to 5%. So on the first six months, we\u2019re running right on our target of 7% and our guide is right on 7%. So you can take from that that we\u2019re going to reinvest and plough back in the business sort of any over forecasted growth that we have on the top line.","Doug Mitchelson","And David, one more for you. You call un-grandfathering impact in the fourth quarter, I think you had some price increase sort of \u2013 perhaps that was back in Q2, and I am un-grandfathering again in 4Q, is there any sizing you can give investors around the pricing strategy issues that impacted, specifically specifically 3Q, but the year as well if you're --??","David Wells","Well, I think last year what we found was because of the PR and the news around the price change in the second quarter, which actually didn\u2019t happen or un-grandfathering until the third and fourth quarter, we had a real blended effect through the year. So it\u2019s hard to tease out exactly which quarter we saw effects on both acquisition or retention. We do know that the comping off of last year we think we\u2019ll have less noise this year, I think that\u2019s pretty clear. So I would say it was a median in terms of size and impact on the business from last year.","Doug Mitchelson","Over to Reed. Reed, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d tell me based on the results you just reported, you did well anywhere, but particularly it looks like Europe is really getting critical mass, and every country in Europe is different. So I thought I\u2019d sort of try to screen [ph] on Germany as an example, and particularly I think Germany is sort of a tough market for the U.S. companies, consumers over there don\u2019t like to pay for TV, they don\u2019t watch as much TV. Obviously, English is not their local language. Amazon was there first as well, so there\u2019s a competitive dynamic. Based it looks \u2013 based on our tracking, you are actually surpassing Amazon, at least with app downloads if not subs, is that -- are you at the point where you are taking the leadership in Germany \u2013 can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019ve done right and what you\u2019re doing right that has caused that market to be able to develop?","Reed Hastings","Doug, Amazon is super successful around the world if you look at U.S. with Prime, incredibly successful. It just doesn\u2019t seem to take away from us, so I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as us versus Amazon in Germany. I would really characterize it as can we have a service that\u2019s so great that Germans find it worthwhile paying for. And clearly we\u2019re succeeding at that making our service better and better. In particular, there\u2019s no advertisements on Netflix, and so it\u2019s great for kids, it\u2019s great for teens. And then the great content is so significant in helping the growth that you\u2019re picking up. But as you suggested, we\u2019re really seeing that around the world, whether it\u2019s Brazil or Argentina or Japan, Singapore, or Germany, Internet TV is really catching on for us, for YouTube, for others.","Doug Mitchelson","And I guess what I\u2019m trying to get to, Reed, is you launch two and a half years ago, and I think when you launched, you grew parallel to Latin America and that it will take some time, but you\u2019d figure the markets in Europe out and eventually you\u2019re going to have similar levels of success. Do those parallels still hold, and can we look forward to the Europe where there is fits and starts in terms of progress? but if you really hit the point where you reach escape velocity, do you think those markets to be strong markets going forward?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think all throughout the West; so Latin America, North America, and Europe, we\u2019re doing very well. We just got to continue what we\u2019re doing, more local productions. We\u2019ve got some amazing new shows we\u2019re producing in Europe and in Latin America. With Asia, we\u2019ve got a lot more to learn. We\u2019re really expanding a lot in India, Japan. We\u2019re figuring it out market by market. But Asia is very unique and very large. So we see a huge opportunity for us over the next couple of years, all of us spending more time there and investing more.","Doug Mitchelson","Reed, continuing along that line because Asia is so diverse and and you think about Korea, Japan, Thailand, India, they\u2019re all very different markets. How do you prioritize your investments in Asia?","Reed Hastings","We look at market size, we look at growth of Internet, kind of all the factors that we\u2019ve always looked at around the world. And so then we\u2019re able to prioritize in what we\u2019re doing. And we saw some great success, for example, this quarter with Okja. And maybe, Ted, you want to describe a little bit on that.","Ted Sarandos","Yes, Okja is directed by Bong Joon-Ho who is the most celebrated director in Korea and is a huge star and an attraction in and of himself, but also the movie itself is one of the most ambitious productions in history of Korea. His films tend to travel around the world pretty well. It made a ton of noise at the Cannes Film Festival. It was the most talked about film at the festival. So it helped in attracting new subscribers also, but it also brings a brand halo to Netflix that it\u2019s a place for great content worth paying for. And I think we saw some of that benefit throughout Europe and in pockets of Asia where we saw big sign-ups in Korea, but remember for most people, they\u2019ve learned about Netflix for the first time when Okja was coming out in Korea. So relative to the rest of the world, we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. But it was a great introduction to Netflix for a lot of the world.","Doug Mitchelson","And so in carrying that forward that Reed just mentioned, more local content particularly in --?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, and even more so Doug, think about local content for global audiences. So the idea \u2013 that\u2019s a fantastic story that we make a Korean movie for Korea, but it\u2019s even a bigger story that the movie is getting watched by millions all around the world.","Doug Mitchelson","So, Ted, can you talk a little bit about how you\u2019re expanding [indiscernible] target overseas, the size of the team and is there capacity growth, is there growth in percentage of budget being allocated to --?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, as Reed mentioned, matching the program into local taste is really the key and we\u2019ve seen it in our expansion through Latin America, our expansion into Europe. And as we look to Asia, we have to get better and better matching those tastes. And those tastes are not as easily aligned with Western tastes. So we\u2019ll invest more time and energy in Asia putting some people on the ground in Asia that we haven\u2019t historically, but well within how we\u2019ve looked at the size of the teams generally but locating them more likely outside of the U.S. as we continue to grow for local audiences in Asia and throughout the rest of Europe.","Reed Hastings","Doug, just to round out Ted\u2019s answer, all those things that you mentioned are involved in that. So it\u2019s growth of the acquisition and development teams, it\u2019s also budget. We already had in place growth in budget in many of these territories who\u2019s just trying to deploy that more efficiently. In some cases, it\u2019s adding on to the levels of investment. You ask about how we prioritize? Generally, when we see success, we try to add on to that until we reach a point of diminishing returns. And so, if we\u2019re going to see success in some markets, we may up the content budget in those markets.","Doug Mitchelson","It all makes sense. Reed, over to you, since I think we are on Asia, if you think about emerging markets broadly, there\u2019s certainly a lot of mobile. And I\u2019m curious if you can give us an update on the implication for strategy and efforts that you have underway, and if you could talk about the --?","Reed Hastings","Absolutely, Doug. We\u2019ve had great success on mobile in the developed markets like the U.S. and Europe and then throughout Latin America, and now and Asia. And all of the Netflix service works extremely well on mobile. We\u2019re continuing to get better and better at encoding efficiently our films and TV series so that it takes less and less network bandwidth and we\u2019re rising in popularity around the world, and that\u2019s paralleling the improvements that YouTube and others are doing to make video a natural part of mobile phones, and so that\u2019s just a continued evolution.","Doug Mitchelson","Are mobile Netflix products a different product than we\u2019re used to right now?","Reed Hastings","No, mobile\u2019s just a 4- or 5-inch screen for us with a great touch interface, and it\u2019s very similar to what you see on an iPad to the television. So think of it as there\u2019s just many screens that you can enjoy Netflix on.","Doug Mitchelson","When I think about [indiscernible]","Reed Hastings","I\u2019m afraid, Doug, I can\u2019t hear you anymore. There seems to be some AV problem.","Doug Mitchelson","Can you hear me now?","Reed Hastings","Barely. You may need to shout.","Doug Mitchelson","So for Reed or David, as you consider emerging markets again broadly, is there a capacity to mass market the product without having the need to lower price point?","Reed Hastings","We\u2019ll see. We\u2019ve been very successful getting to beginnings of a mass model product in Latin America where you\u2019ve got a lot of fairly developed economies. We\u2019ll see in Asia what we can do with that. But for the first couple years, it\u2019s focused on more high-end, Western-oriented elites. And then as we grow into that, we can think about expanding beyond that.","Doug Mitchelson","Ted, back over to you. At the beginning of the year, you talked about having a strong second half content slate. Do you feel that the content slate is settling now to where you thought, and and there is a strong second half --?","Reed Hastings","Is there any way you can see what the --?","Ted Sarandos","There\u2019s a lot to be really excited about in the second half in terms of our content releases. Starting as early as next week, we have a great show called Ozark starring Jason Bateman that we\u2019re really excited to launch. And then in August, we have the release of Death Note, a great new film that we\u2019re going to panel at Comic-Con this next. And also in August, The Defenders, which brings together all of the characters from Marvel\u2019s Defenders; Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Daredevil, and Iron Fist for an incredible season that people are really excited about. And of course throughout the year, we have things that will lead up to Bright at the end of the year which is a huge film with Will Smith that will be only available on Netflix that we\u2019re incredibly excited about.","Doug Mitchelson","Ted, what do you think Reed means when he says he wants you to be able to cancel more shows?","Ted Sarandos","Look, I think I mentioned before that in this universe we look at a lot of things like failure is not such a bad thing and if you\u2019re not failing maybe you\u2019re not trying hard enough. So when we have a good hit rate and even with the recent cancelations, 93% of our shows have been renewed. So you want to be introspective and look at that and say, are we being adventurous enough, Daredevil, we\u2019re trying new things. And I think when you think of things \u2013 when you have a very high hit ratio, you definitely want to keep second guessing yourself even though you do.","Doug Mitchelson","David, when we think about potential for more and more original shows being produced, therefore, likely more and more cancelations over time, any impact on the financials that we should think about? And separately and importantly, is the viewing that you are expecting, whether it\u2019s license content or original content, whether it\u2019s movies that you are putting out consistent with the amortization schedule that you have in place?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, and I think what you\u2019ve raised is a good point which is the more shows we add, the more likely in absolute numbers that you\u2019ll see cancelations of course. But that\u2019s only novel Netflix and it\u2019s still novel because you see on network television about two-thirds \u2013 about a third of the content gets cut in the first season versus our content which is mostly renewed. And it\u2019s not because we\u2019re less careful about it, it\u2019s because we can more efficiently build it and not a 100% of the time. So we want to launch shows. We love when there\u2019s a deep passion fan base for a show. We just need it to be big enough to support the economics of that show so we don\u2019t create opportunity cost for future fans of new shows.","David Wells","Doug, just to take the sort of accounting oriented part of that question, I would say no. We don\u2019t anticipate right now. We look at this constantly. Every quarter, we look at the trends. Many of these shows, even if they\u2019re not picked up for a renewal, they may have a story arc that completes the narrative. And so, it really is for us is about the sort of continuity of viewing over the life of the show. So even if some of that viewing is concentrated as our amortization methodology reflects upfront in the sort of first release, the first month of release of that content on the site, it may have sort of steady viewing over the life. And if it does, then it\u2019s going to be sort of reflective of those trends. If it\u2019s really concentrated, then yes sure we would have to reflect that. But many of the non renewals get wrapped up. Bloodline is an example, something that we got wrapped up in a narrative. We\u2019re going to do a movie wrap up on Sense8. And so I think overall, you\u2019ll see us try to wrap the narratives on these.","Doug Mitchelson","And I have some questions on content. I wanted to set it up Reed with a question for you. In the past, we\u2019ve gotten parallels between Netflix and HBO, and that implies Netflix is a TV network. I think even the letter this quarter, it talked about that, TV network [indiscernible] At the same time, you've expanded to the unscripted movies, original TV, and is Netflix instead more of a Comcast-type version of Internet TV or should we think about it as an Internet-TV network?","Reed Hastings","I think about it more like a super network. We\u2019re talking about addressing content desires and needs across the board, as you mentioned unscripted, but also kids and films. This year, the Emmy is just as an example. We have five different series nominated for Best Comedy or Drama. We also have two documentary series nominated for Best Documentary Series, two documentary films nominated for Best Documentary Films. We won 10 daytime Emmys for our kids programming. So we are doing across the board programming, not programming for one niche which networks tend to do.","Doug Mitchelson","And then for Reed, just a question on content spending, how do you decide how much you allow [indiscernible] \u2013 how do we measure sort of aggregate value the customers want any one piece of content becoming less and less important as you grow your body of original content?","Reed Hastings","Well, every piece of content that we do is important, and we try to have that content flourish around the world, but in terms of the overall investment levels, we\u2019re continuing to see increased median viewing compared to a year ago, two years ago, three years ago as we\u2019re winning a few more of the moments of truth of what you do to relax. But still we\u2019re such a small player in our viewing compared to linear TV, compared to YouTube. So we\u2019ve got a long way to go to have more and more content to please more and more members and continue to grow. And what you see us doing as we grow is also improving our margins, so we\u2019re getting some efficiency out of that as opposed to spending every dollar in the content. But we are growing the content budget significantly also because of the opportunity that we see.","Doug Mitchelson","Ted, back to you in terms of strategy for how you\u2019re producing content. When you think about the fact that Netflix now can self produce titles, you can license exclusive originals from Hollywood Studios, you can license third-party \u2013 you can license reruns, where do you see the race will turn at this point in time, and how do you see others responding to your strategy of self producing a few shows?","Ted Sarandos","The success we\u2019ve had with our self produced shows has given us a lot more confidence to expand it. Because we\u2019re a global network, those rights are really important in terms of being able to control our destiny, when we can make shows available, and what formats to make them available. And beyond that, there\u2019s an economic tradeoff which is there\u2019s a big studio margin that we\u2019re able to put on the screen and make better shows when we produce it ourselves. So a show like Stranger Things, when it becomes a big cultural phenomena, we\u2019d like to be able to control the destiny of those brands as we continue to invest in them. But at the same time we want to lean on putting the best programming possible on the air. So not being dogmatic about which shows we pick depending on their business model but being really careful about picking shows that are great regardless of their business model, but you\u2019ll see us do a lot more of self producing whenever we can.","Doug Mitchelson","And so last question in the series on content, Ted, I\u2019ll probably end up asking this every quarter forever. But any issues on \u2013 with your positive content for access to the best shows with more and more players, obviously Apple hired two Sony executives; Facebook announced they\u2019re buying some original content, others continue to expand. You\u2019re certainly competing very well and the Emmys are sort of proof of the quality of content. But on the margin, do you cost-wise, more than you would like, some projects go to others that you prefer you have yourself?","Ted Sarandos","I think Internet television is an enormous space and there\u2019s going to be lots of competition. And as they come in, they\u2019re going to bid up the cost of the best stuff which is great. It\u2019s great for consumers, because more things get made. And it\u2019s great for creators because they\u2019re more buyers at the table. So we expect the content cost to go up on the top premium things, but I think, as I said, I think that\u2019s a good result for everybody.","Reed Hastings","And that of course brings in new capacity like you saw Headlines Today that Liberty Global and TPG were forming a new television studio to produce shows for all this new market. So as the prices go up, there\u2019s more capacity because there\u2019s very large numbers of writers out there.","Doug Mitchelson","In the letter, it talks pretty exclusively about expanding distribution relationships whether it is a content provider, it\u2019s a pay-per-view provider, bundling in Netflix service and I guess two questions there. Reed, for you first. What about the reverse? Do you see Netflix as a platform that can bundle other video services and sell that on profit and make a margin. And second as part of that, any specifics behind the point made in the letter that you expect to really expand these efforts?","Reed Hastings","There are several companies who are selling networks on top of their platform. So Hulu is doing that, Amazon is doing that. We don\u2019t see that as a business direction for us. We\u2019re really focused on making our network as great as it possibly can be. And then as you point out, we\u2019re now looking at proposals for including Netflix and some services and beginning to learn the bundling part of the business. We\u2019re doing a little bit of that in Europe already and it\u2019s been quite successful. Thus we\u2019re interested in expanding that.","Doug Mitchelson","And shifting over to David and ASP. I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about mid-single digit being a good aspirational point to consider. And when you look at the tiers that you have, it seems like the base tier is relatively high in place to the middle tier and the upper tier. I wanted to deal with that into -- are there other ways to differentiate those tiers to create more value and have that be an even bigger part of ASP growth in the future?","David Wells","Doug, I\u2019m not sure I heard the first part of your question on ASP, so just repeat that first part.","Doug Mitchelson","So for ASPs, I think in the past you have said that mid-single digit growth longer term is the right way for investors to think about Netflix\u2019s pricing potential.","David Wells","That\u2019s correct. So if you\u2019re just looking for clarity there, yes. That\u2019s an easy answer.","Doug Mitchelson","And when we think about the tiers that you currently have in place, the midsized tier and the higher price tier feel like they\u2019re relatively close in price to the base tier. Is there other ways that you\u2019re considering to add value to the higher-priced tiers to have tiering up be an increasing part of that ASP growth?","David Wells","I don\u2019t think so. Right now, I would say we do see success with people taking the upper tier with just the differentiation of concurrent streams and high definition. We don\u2019t think necessarily that we need to add more value. We have the flexibility to add more value in terms of that tier differentiation. But honestly, we think there\u2019s progressive growth just from thinking about differentiating those tiers on price point a little more in terms of middle and upper. And then in terms of an expectation of ASP growth, that\u2019s reasonable in terms of what you outlined. We are lapping the un-grandfathering of last year, so you are seeing sort of revenue on a year-over-year basis or ASP on a year-over-year basis start to reflect that lapping of a large pool of un-grandfathers coming on.","Reed Hastings","Doug, we\u2019re super proud that we\u2019ve been able to maintain this $8 access point in the U.S. or \u20ac8 in Europe which we\u2019ve had in place since 2010. So all of this decade, Netflix has been available for $8. And when you think about that content increase over the last seven years, it\u2019s phenomenal and it\u2019s still $8 a month at the base level. And we\u2019re getting the ASP growth as people optionally select to get HD and ultra-HD which are amazing new formats that have come on, but again a key part of the successful strategy is that we\u2019re staying very, very affordable for people.","Doug Mitchelson","Yes, it\u2019s interesting because you mentioned sort of growth in content and the service, Reed, and you mentioned that the median time spent has been increasing. Are newer customers that are coming on the service this year behaving similar to new customers two years ago or four years ago or --?","Reed Hastings","Similar and better. They\u2019re watching more. More engaged. Again, that\u2019s a combination of the user interface, the algorithms, or the personalization and of course the content itself. And so it\u2019s very exciting that we\u2019ve been able to see even higher engagement with members now compared to last year and the prior years.","Doug Mitchelson","David, I wanted to circle back on churn. You talked about the un-grandfathering churn. I\u2019m just curious if you could sort of help investors understand how churn has evolved over time? And do you see meaningful opportunities to improve churn from here and what specifically those opportunities might be?","David Wells","Well, we generally talk about net additions just because of fluidity of somebody coming back on the service. It\u2019s hard to parse the two pieces. I\u2019ve made comments in the past that generally year-over-year, churn has improved as we improve the service, as we add more content, as subscribers age up. But more and more as our word of mouth and as we penetrate close to 50% in the U.S. today, those lines are fairly indistinct in terms of user rejoin or not and somebody may have been a member of the service 12, 14, 18 months ago. So I would say in answering the spirit of the question, we continue to improve the quality of the service with more content, with a better interface, all the things that Reed just talked about in terms of driving value to the middle and upper tier to have people chose and electively chose a more robust service. I\u2019d say that continues. And then outside the U.S. as we age, we usually \u2013 the pattern there is to improve the quality of the library, we better match the taste and that includes both Western content for that local audience and a little bit of local content as well that Ted talked about earlier, so we expect to improve churn outside the U.S. as we get better and better in these markets.","Doug Mitchelson","Sticking with you, David, on the margin side, you\u2019ve in the last letter and this letter have talked about a 7% margin target this year and modest expansion thereafter, care to help investors out at all in terms of understanding what that pace of margin expansion might be relatively to investment opportunities that you have?","David Wells","We\u2019re focused on making the 7% this year. We know that we\u2019ll clarify that towards October. But we want to balance both growth of the business and reinvestment back in the business given that we\u2019re seeing some great returns on that content given the growth that we experienced this last quarter with sort of a disciplined growth of profit. We also know that you can\u2019t just hockey stick it in three to five years and expect the business to be in the right place. So I think it\u2019s a bit of a balance and right now that 7% with sort of consistent and deliberate growth after that is the right guidance for our investors.","Reed Hastings","Doug, if you remember last year, we were at 4%. So you might be able to apply something there.","Doug Mitchelson","Thank you, Reed. I appreciate that. What would be helpful as well sort of reading the details a little bit out of David is can you frame a margin progression in terms of where the leverage comes in the cost structure? Is it content side, the marketing side, G&A, tech and dev? Where should we see the most leverage in the cost structure over time?","David Wells","Well, to-date, it\u2019s really just been about as we expand globally and people watch a lot of the same content, Ted talked about the cost pressures in terms of as more people pile in at the top end of the market on the unit cost of content costs, but we\u2019ve been able to grow even faster than that. So we\u2019re able to expand both our content spending and our margin at the same time because we\u2019re growing faster than that content. And we expect that to continue forward for the foreseeable future. We are leveraging marketing. We\u2019re spending more on an absolute basis on marketing as we become more and more of a media company. But on a percent of revenue basis, we\u2019re leveraging there. And G&A and tech and dev has kind of run a little bit in line with revenue as we expand internationally and as we become more of a full-fledged studio and a bigger, and at-scale studio. So it\u2019s pressured there in terms of adding people, but I do anticipate the ability to leverage some of that down the road.","Doug Mitchelson","The cash flow burn is certainly an interesting comment, and you mentioned it last quarter in the letter, you mentioned it this quarter in the letter. I think similar to margins, investors are trying to read between the lines, understand how free cash flow burn might progress over the next few years. First, I think \u2013 actually for you, Reed, why the comfort level with this level of negative free cash flow. And David, any sense you can give investors as to carry forward at these elevated levels, does it get better but take a while to get to breakeven, any help would be appreicated?","Reed Hastings","Look, when we produce an amazing show like Stranger Things, that\u2019s a lot of capital upfront, and then you get a payout over many years. And seeing the positive returns on that for the business as a whole is what makes us comfortable that we should continue to invest and integrate to basically self develop many more properties as Ted can find the appropriate ones. And then there\u2019s comfort with being able to finance it and of course our debt to market cap is incredibly low and conservative, so we\u2019ve got lots of room there. And I think that combination that it\u2019s spent well and we can raise it is what makes us very excited. And the irony is the faster that we grow and the faster we grow, the owned originals, the more drawn on free cash flow that will be. So in some senses that negative free cash flow will be an indicator of enormous success.","David Wells","And then to annotate your second part of your question, like Reed said, this is a success scenario in a sense of as we scale and if we\u2019re scaling faster, we\u2019re going to reinvest part of that back into the content and that has implications on the cash side. So for us, as we\u2019ve seen success with both the popularity of our owned originals, we\u2019ve expanded into other content verticals. And as we scale faster, as we grow faster globally, that has implications. That said, we gave you an indication of around 2 billion this time. We\u2019ve updated that to be between 2 billion and 2.5 billion. So you can think about that as a 10% to 15%. When you put that in line and compare that with our subscriber growth on the top line and you kind of get some indication that we\u2019re still being very disciplined about the efficiency of our content cohort investments and we\u2019re looking at how those shows perform over time, but if we have a bigger prize and if we see a bigger prize with the gross of the growth , that\u2019s going to have some implication on the cash flow side.","Doug Mitchelson","A couple more for Ted and then I think we\u2019ll wrap up with Reed. Ted, one question I get a lot is investments in new movies. I think part of it is, with the TV series, it\u2019s a brand that goes forward, year after year of episodes versus one time for film and some could be very expensive as well and with the [indiscernible] approach. I think in the letter you talked about you believe Internet TV can reinvigorate the film business. So one, talk on your film strategy at this point; and two, any thoughts behind the statement in the letter would be helpful?","Ted Sarandos","Well, look, we\u2019re doing a lot in the film space for a lot of the same reasons we\u2019re doing it in the television space, which is access to great content when consumers want it around the world. So we think it\u2019s a good investment. We\u2019re trying a lot of different things. Some of them work out great. Some of them work out not so great and we\u2019ve learned from every single one of them. So we\u2019re going to continue to invest in that space because we can bring films to our members when they want them, which is when the world is talking about them. And that\u2019s almost impossible to do with a studio partner. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re pushing down that road. I think that in success, our films will be able to attract subscribers and retain subscribers the way our series have and that\u2019s why we\u2019re working so hard at it.","Doug Mitchelson","Another question I get I think is just so noticeable is the investment you made in comedy and you\u2019ve talked a bit about that last quarter, Ted. But is there something behind that strategy in terms of forming also relationships with comedians that also might be actors in TV shows, movies, or is it simply ROI, so you keep investing more?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, the category is remarkably efficient even at the premiums that you\u2019d have to pay to get the superstar talent attached to them because it gets a big audience. They can watch like movies and just think about it that the main cost of them is the talent themselves versus the cost of production. And it\u2019s been also a great way to invest in content partners because like Chris Rock by way of example who\u2019s getting ready to shoot his special for Netflix, he is right now starring in the next Adam Sandler movie that\u2019s being shot right now in New York. So we\u2019re really excited about being able to work with great talent like Aziz Ansari, like we do with Chelsea across the entire platform whenever we can.","Doug Mitchelson","And shifting over to Reed, I\u2019ve noticed in the letter it said over 1 billion hours a week of viewing on the Netflix platform. Is that 1.1 billion or 1.2 billion?","Reed Hastings","And climbing. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.","Doug Mitchelson","All right. I think I want to wrap up with a couple of questions, first regulatory. Reed, I think you\u2019ve already expressed your opinion quite clearly on net neutrality. But more broadly if you look at the regulatory environment globally, particularly in Europe, there appears to be an environment that is a challenge for American companies and certainly Google and Facebook. What\u2019s your approach to the regulatory environment given these challenges?","Reed Hastings","Well, first on net neutrality, the recent effort that we participated in generated over 3 million additional comments to the FCC demanding that the net neutrality rules stay in place bringing the total to over 8 million comments. So certainly we, other companies, the public have weighed in heavily. We\u2019ll see where that goes. When you look at Europe, we\u2019re making big investments in local content, local productions, working well with local content companies. And so, I think it will be a really different dynamic or we hope so with Netflix than maybe with other firms, because just of the business structure. We\u2019re able to take some great French and German and other content, Spanish, this quarter and share it around the world and that creates big new markets. So think of us much more as trying to curate some of the world\u2019s best content and share it with the world versus the moniker of being a disruptive tech company.","Doug Mitchelson","And the last question for me, you\u2019re talking a lot about the shift from linear TV to on-demand viewing. It\u2019s something that you talk a lot about, Reed, and you talk about how much video time and how many Internet TV services you\u2019ll be successful. And while that\u2019s all well and good, I imagine that Netflix will have to continue to be the leader in this category. So this final question is, Reed, how does Netflix sustain and expand its leadership position? Because while the market opportunity might be big, I\u2019m sure you are busy executing every day?","Reed Hastings","More watching, less sleep.","Doug Mitchelson","And what are you doing and what is Netflix specifically doing to make sure that Netflix needs that more watching, less sleep charge?","Reed Hastings","Well, again, I\u2019m not sure we are leading it when you look how far ahead YouTube is. Now you might say, well, it\u2019s different content but it\u2019s still very engaging for the audience that\u2019s choosing it. We\u2019re not really focused on like who\u2019s ahead in certain things. What we focus on is doing our best work. And Ted runs a lot of that with the content. We\u2019re doing amazing work on product, making it easy to use, fast and then finally all these distribution agreements and marketing we\u2019re doing. So we\u2019re just improving around the whole company, growing what we have and we\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019ve accomplished. But what\u2019s ahead is also super exciting.","Doug Mitchelson","Thank you all very much.","Reed Hastings","Thank you, Doug.","David Wells","Thanks, Doug.","Ted Sarandos","Thanks, Doug."],"15642":["Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q4 2016 Results Earnings Conference Call January 18, 2017  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Reed Hastings - Founder and CEO","David Wells - CFO","Ted Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Analysts","Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus & Company","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Operator","David Wells","Welcome to the Netflix Q4 2016 Earnings Call. I am David Wells, the CFO. Joining me today from the company is Reed Hastings, our CEO and Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer.","Interviewing us on today's call, or interview, is Doug Mitchelson from UBS and Scott Devitt from Stifel Nicolaus. A cautionary note that we will be making forward-looking statements, actual results may vary. Scott, I think you have the first question, so over to Scott.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Scott Devitt","Yes, thanks, David. First question for Reed. Just an outstanding quarter, both domestically and internationally, relative to expectation from a subscriber standpoint. And there is so much focus on international given the opportunity there to grow the business, as well as the way you've built out the international business with some more mature markets that you've been in for quite some time. Some newer markets like France and Germany that are starting to kick in, and the 130 that were added at the beginning of 2016. So, I was wondering if you could frame, potentially, the over-performance in the quarter and where you saw strength regionally.","Reed Hastings","You describe it as over-performance in the quarter, but if you look at it on a longer term basis like over the last couple years, it smooths it out. So, we are seeing some lumpiness in the quarters depending on when we launched certain content, but the big picture is remarkably steady and so we have a huge quarter like Q4. This quarter it\u2019s a little bit less and so think of it really as this big adoption of Internet TV. It's in somewhat influenced by the content in the short-term.","And then you asked about the international expansion which has been remarkably steady. Again if you don't look at it by the quarter, but you look at by the year, what was seen Latin America's steady growth, Europe as a whole has been really picking up momentum for us, and Asia, we're just getting started.","Scott Devitt","And then secondly, possibly for David, you got the first quarter U.S. contribution margin above the longer term I think target. Understanding that there is lumpiness in that you're going to continue to invest in their business. Is there any update on that longer term target in terms of the contribution margin for the U.S. market?","David Wells","No, no Scott we did, as you correctly asked me that there's two pieces one is the U.S. contribution margin pops up in the first quarter and we're indicating that that's -- we're going to continue to reinvest.","And then on the international line, we actually broke through into profitability for our consolidated international segment and we will continue to invest -- take that back down through the year.","So, I think that we don't talk about long-term targets other than an operating margin target. We had mentioned before that we would produce meaningful operating profit in 2017 and beyond, so we fleshed that out a little bit for you, the investor now targeting at 7% operating margin for this year and steady growth afterward.","And then we don't think anything structurally is at hand than in terms of our international businesses. It really depends on the competitiveness of each market, but we think we can continue to grow the overall profitability. So, we'll grow operating profit by continuing to grow U.S. margin and also reduce international losses with respect to adding on more investment.","So, I think long-term we'll reduce those losses and grow international margin, but we haven\u2019t provided a specific target.","Scott Devitt","Thank you.","Doug Mitchelson","I think on the fourth quarter results, so I'm curious, in the U.S. what content specifically drove the strong performance relative to budgets?","Ted Sarandos","Well, we had a pretty powerful releases in Q4. So, you see particularly shows like Luke Cage, Narcos -- new series of Narcos that travel really well around the world and we know that they are exciting here as consumers of television in America, but it's been fantastic to see how these shows are adopted around the world.","David Wells","Yes, Doug, I would just add to that that we're -- you're now seeing the benefit of Netflix having sort of its third, fourth year of original slates. So, we're now getting -- as Ted mentioned Narcos season two comes out, but we've got new seasons as well. So, you're getting the benefit of shows that might take hold in their second or third season, but some new shows as well, like Stranger Things did for us in the third quarter and continue to be popular through the fourth quarter as well.","Ted Sarandos","And a nice upside surprise us something like Gilmore Girls where you think would be incredibly domestic in its popularity, but we found it to be incredibly internationally popular as well, particularly from performing grade in Europe.","Doug Mitchelson","And this might seem relatively obvious given the comment so far that content is drive to subscriber, but in terms of your ability to measure how content is driving subscribers, and you talked last quarter about including new content into your subscriber growth guidance and you see the strong result this quarter, is it tangible title-by-title, are you making just an overall estimate based on spending or number of release [ph]?","Reed Hastings","Think of it as it\u2019s a cumulative effect. Very few people will join Netflix just because of a single title. But there's a tipping point. We have one more title that has great excitement, you're hearing a lot about and that triggers you to finally sign up for Netflix.","So, it's a cumulative effect of all of these and you can -- you see some frontloading whole forward, but the basic demand creation is increasing as people get more comfortable and more aware of the idea of Internet television where you don't get the commercial interruptions, where you just get to watch when and where you want. So, those are the big drivers.","And then the things that capture the demand are really these big launches that we're doing particular title franchises.","Scott Devitt","Just to feed off Doug's question, there is commentary in the letter regarding content being a driver for subscribers in the second half of 2017. Is that -- just looking at the slate in that period as a driver for their business, or is there something else to that comment?","Ted Sarandos","You should look at, we have multiple seasons of our shows and we see that the audience continues to build cumulatively and therefore the excitement for the upcoming season builds as well.","So, in Q2 of this year, we have new seasons of a lot of our very popular shows, like Orange Is The New Black, Kimmy Schmidt, Bloodline, Sense8, Master of None, and we think that they should have a pretty nice impact on our subscriber growth as well.","David Wells","Yes, and Doug if I -- and Scott if I can knit these comments together, Reed's comments, Ted's comments and your questions, there's a difference between -- so the baseline demand as Reed said is just the transition to Internet TV and the overwhelming convenience of it.","We get -- talking a lot about that sort of quarter, inter-quarter whether we hit above we expected or not based on some of how these shows perform. And if their brand new shows, they don't tend to -- if they are having to punch into the consciousness of the consumer, they don't tend to draw new subscribers in as great of numbers as some of our existing shows. So what we were saying is in the first quarter, we have some great new shows [Indiscernible] that are doing well, but they don't tend to draw numbers like House of Cards did last year in terms of we're lapping House of Cards and for us, it was a surprise of Making a Murderer as well.","So, I think -- what Ted thinks, we have all these great shows coming in the back half of the year and more of them are second season, they tend to draw in more subscribers because they are better-known shows.","Ted Sarandos","Second, third, fourth, and this seasons even.","Scott Devitt","And sorry to be so myopic around the more near-term subs, but one final question on that for me. There was a -- I think a comment, as well, in terms of potentially being a pull-forward in subscribers into Q4 from one as part of the explanation for the 1Q sub guidance. And can you flesh that just a bit and what gives you that type of visibility?","David Wells","Sure. Reed or I could do that, but I'll take a stab at it. I think what we saw in 2016 around our un-grandfathering our price change was a lot of lumpiness in our subscribers in terms of -- we grew strongly in the first quarter, second and third more modestly, and then building into the fourth quarter.","And what we found was we found a lot of rejoins coming back. So, yes, there was a reaction to the price, but we got -- many of those subscribers back. And so I think what we\u2019re talking about in the first quarter -- or the fourth quarter we got many of them back that may have come in the first quarter, we may have seen some of those folks in the first quarter. So, we tend to look less at a specific quarter's performance and we look sort of over a six or nine or 12-month period in terms of what is the real trend here, not focusing too much on any specific quarter because they do seem to have bleeds in terms of some folks joining in a quarter that they would've joined the former quarter.","Scott Devitt","Got it. Thank you.","Doug Mitchelson","Two more questions from me on near-term subscribers. First Reed you said that Europe is really picking up and I think when you launch those markets, you indicated we take some time for them to work Latin America now that's happening, but investors are still wondering, something specific that you have done differently or done recently that's drive improvements, particularly in Germany and France?","Reed Hastings","No, there's no specific like pricing, marketing tactic. It's the cumulative effect of show-after-show being end market, just the steady work that we've done and this is what we also saw in Latin American as there was no step function, there was just steady discipline of staying on our game of great shows, great movies, and enjoyment continues to increase. There's slightly incremental more partners that we have, but there's is no real step function. Again it's really the continue buildup of momentum.","Ted Sarandos","Yes, we're seeing as we're adding more and more global shows that it's rising all boats [ph] across the world.","Doug Mitchelson","And I think we talked about acquisition a lot in near-term, when you think about churn management, I think investors are curious both on did X1 integration have any [Indiscernible] in the quarter, did other bundling deals throughout the world -- you certainly have done quite of them, have any influence and as you think about churn trends, is there anything noticeable for investors' assessment and how should we think about that in a flow basis going forward?","Reed Hastings","All the partnership deals we really believe and that's why we're doing more of them, but you can see we had been outperformance in international and in domestic. So, it wasn't just a Comcast story, in which case, it would have been domestic only.","It's fundamentally a story of the broad acceptance of Internet TV and the content. And then on the margin, those partnership deals are good for the customers, good for us and good for the partner.","Scott Devitt","The cable set-top box deals, the -- I think John Malone was quoted recently at Lionsgate Analyst Day as saying that you had approached some operators in terms of being bundled into service, where carriers would cover. And just interested in terms of the accuracy of the statement, is that something you are interested in and what you think the benefit of that would be of such?","Reed Hastings","We wouldn\u2019t want to speculate on future deals. And in general around the world, we've done extremely well focusing on our service as a discrete service, $7.99 a month and incredible content. And so we're just going to keep pounding that drum as we expand around the world and also here in the U.S.","Scott Devitt","And the X1 interface, which is outstanding by the way, we have it at our house, are there -- I assume that there is interest in doing more integrations like that. Is there any reason other than simply being able to cut those deals, technology restriction standpoint with other providers that would limit the ability to do deals with others?","Reed Hastings","Yes, X1s are very advanced set-top, so not all MSOs in the U.S. have such advanced, so they basically can't do Internet apps or can't do Netflix. So, X1 is very strong in that way, so is the dish receiver, so we're able operate on ones that are relatively modern and have other IT apps also.","Doug Mitchelson","Reed, I think you've had advantage just because of the technology investment you've made over time, the scale that you have deployed, any concerns longer term to the extent more and more of your competitors are bundled in on the same aggregating performs like X1 that you could lose a bit of a technology, consumers access your content all through the same interface that they are accessing [Indiscernible]?","Reed Hastings","Well, when the consumer finds in the Comcast UI some Netflix show, they click on that and it opens the Netflix app and then the consumers in the Netflix app, they enjoy the show and then we control after the show, the post-play experience which guides them into another show, another show.","So, we look at it as entry ramp onto our application and we're -- we feel that our application really is the best way to enjoy Netflix content, but that doesn\u2019t mean there shouldn't be easy entry ramp from interfaces like a Comcast user interface because that's very effective for customers.","Doug Mitchelson","And -- so I was circling back to some of the subscriber and I'm curious any learnings now that the global rollover is full year behind you when you look back anything that's far and different than expected and when can we expect the next round of taking some of those skin markets like Poland and Turkey and turning them into market launches?","Reed Hastings","We'll continue with more Poland and Turkey like launches this year with several countries. So, that will just be a steady process we're going through. We'd really like what we saw once we localized Poland and Turkey in terms of increased viewing, increased membership growth. So, we'll just keep on that pattern.","Think of it -- from a near-term subscriber standpoint, it\u2019s a background influence compared to the big established markets in Europe, LatAm and North America. And then of course over time they should be quite substantial. But they are long-term place.","David Wells","And Doug from a financial standpoint, just keep in mind that when we talk about the investments in international, content is the big piece of that. Localization is relatively modest compared to the content.","Scott Devitt","Ted, I think the last time that you spoke publicly this topic; you were doing local language content in 10 different countries. And I was wondering if you could talk about success or challenges of that, and that was tied to original comp.","And then also more broadly, local language in newer markets as well as marketing campaigns, which was identified in 2016 as something that needed to be put in place to get some of the newer markets to begin to progress [Indiscernible]?","Ted Sarandos","Well, so far we've really happy with the success of our local language productions in France and Mexico and Brazil and as I mentioned last time, we've rolled it out to Germany, to Spain, to Italy. We're deep in production. We're entering into a couple of new productions in Asia. What we find is a -- it creates a lot of great excitement for Netflix in the market because it's a really elevated form of television relative to what else is available in the market.","And we love that we're working with local storytellers, local producers to make that content and even more importantly making its available around the world has been a huge differentiator for us.","So when I mentioned earlier about the Gilmore Girls being so popular globally, so it was a little softer anywhere, it might have been in Brazil and about the same time, we're launching a really great little science fiction show called the 3%, a local Portuguese language show that we shot in Brazil. It was enormously popular in Brazil and played to millions of subscribers around the world including the U.S. So, it's been a great way to find new global storytellers and make Netflix feel a lot more local in those countries.","Scott Devitt","And then I think you also quoted as saying that 1,000 hours of content in 2017 seemed to be pretty conservative. Can you speak to that in terms of -- it was local language as a contributor to that, but also as genres and geographies, and what actually is going to be the makeup of those 1,000 hours?","Ted Sarandos","I would like to focus you a little less on the 1,000 hours and more on the quality of those 1,000 hours. About half of the most searched for shows on television around the world this year were Netflix Original shows and that's the kind of thing we're really proud of. A little bit -- even more so than the volume of it all, it's interesting and it's an artifact of a fast growth and commitment that is so many hours, but the rest of this quarter, we still have 42 Original launches to lunch rest of this quarter including shows like Santa Clarita Diet with Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant, a second season of Love, Iron Fist, our latest Marvel series we'll be launching this quarter.","So, I really want to focus you on yes, it\u2019s a lot of volume, but it's also a ton of quality that consumers are falling in love with.","Doug Mitchelson","Shifting over to -- strategies I'm just curious reflecting back on the last year where you had said your price increases flowing through from the Un-grandfathering, Reed, David, did you learn anything about the pricing power of Netflix and can you bid about what investors should expect your pricing strategies in 2017 and beyond please?","Reed Hastings","You should expect us to continue to invest in the consumer experience, making the content incredible and we don't have any plans for any near-term changes. So, I would just continue to look at as a model us as expanding the membership base at these terrific rates.","David Wells","I also think Doug in terms of -- nothing has changed in terms of our long-term view of our ability -- of our belief ability to continue to add great value and slowly, steadily assume that value overtime. So, I don't think anything has changed in that respect.","Doug Mitchelson","I think along the lines of similar things you've been saying Reed, one of the questions that we get from investors is why focus on earnings at all it Netflix? I mean shareholders have clearly rewarded the [Indiscernible] for subscriber growth and revenue growth or leadership position in the market, while Ted is ramping content pretty aggressively, I'm sure he is always asking for more money. Why the philosophy around trying [ph] growth with delivering earnings?","Reed Hastings","Yes, we don't really believe in hockey-stick kind of businesses, like suddenly we'll turn significantly profitable at 200 million members. We think it's much smarter to grow into that bit-by-bit. So, expect us to modestly move up operating income and operating margins as we have from 4% to 7% and continue a slow and growing into that as we grow larger.","We'll keep an eye on the investment levels that are necessary to protect the advantages that we have. So, don't worry about that, but I would say, in general, you grow into the profitability as opposed to postponement forever and then hope that you can change the business model to deliver on the profitability front leader.","David Wells","And the only thing I'd add to that, and Ted probably has his own answer, there's a little bit of scarcity that goes along way in terms of efficiency and I just making sure that we continue to focus on the quality.","Doug Mitchelson","Well said.","Scott Devitt","Ted, how did The Crown do? And did it -- seemed like it would perform well in the U.K. How did it travel throughout -- perform in the U.S. and other regions?","Ted Sarandos","We're incredibly proud of it, both for the reasons you just mentioned which is that it's been incredibly popular globally, there's an enormous interest in the royal family around the world, so in the U.K., it was really celebrated as something that only the BBC could do just a couple of years ago and really loved in the U.K., in the U.S., but also even in countries throughout Asia, throughout Europe obviously where people just love that story, and more importantly, they loved how it was told and we were thrilled that it won at the Golden Globes for Best Drama. It was our first Best Drama Award there and we're excited, we're deep into season two now and excited to tell the rest of the story.","Scott Devitt","Great. Thank you. And Reed, in the test market, you are one quarter away; I think you are going to be approaching 50 million U.S. paying subscribers at the end of the first quarter. There's over 100 million households in the U.S. that subscribe to cable and satellite cable. The price point and the value proposition, it really does not seem like there's any reason why, over time, with broadband speeds, that you should be able to address all households. When you look at the next 50 million in the U.S., where do you incur the friction points that are limiting you right now to getting to those numbers faster?","Reed Hastings","I think it's really this fusion to the society as more and more people use Netflix. We have better and better shows and more of them -- you just get the word of mouth, which is how you grow from nearly 50 million to 60 million and hopefully we keep going.","In terms of getting to a full 1:1 tie ratio with today's cable that includes a lot of sports which we don't have and don't have plans for. So, you want to wait that a little bit. But in terms of the next couple of years, again, I think if you look back four or five years, it's been really pretty steady growth overall and it's following this formula of just improving the value, improving the content, improving the service like adding our offline viewing. It's really creating a big wave of customer joy, the video merchandising that you'll see where you get to choose content by looking at content. So, we're continuing to innovate on multiple fronts to just make it a better experience.","Doug Mitchelson","Two questions from me for David just on some of the financial commentary. In the letter, I think you gave 7% was the guidance for full year 2017. I think would helpful for investors just to understand on the cost category [Indiscernible], what the outlook might be for 2017, so when you look at G&A, and tech and dev, and marketing, if you could give us a sense of what the dynamics for each of those are this year that will be helpful?","David Wells","Sure Doug and we updated our long-term letter a little bit in this respect as well. So, think about 6 billion in content, a billion in tech and dev, somewhere around a billion in G&A to sort of round out the operating profit expense lines and that should get you there.","Doug Mitchelson","That work. And then also notable free cash flow burn $2 billion for this -- that was a bit higher than I believe you suggested a few months ago. So, what's changed?","David Wells","Well, I think what we put in the October letter was that free cash flow might be similar to Q3, it was more than that. We do think it's going to come down this quarter in Q1, but we wanted to give an indication, it's pretty lumpy right now. Even my team has -- we don't really focus on trying to optimize a single quarter, we're looking at sort of across four and eight quarters and we think the run rate is around 500 million right now in terms of the quarter as we continue to expand content.","It's not too different from 2016. I mean we moved up to 1.7 billion in 2016 and so we're indicating that might be around 2 billion this year and we'll go from there. I mean I think what you'll find is we will organically fund more and more of our own content expansion with the growth of our operating profit and so more and more as we transition over the next few years, our debt will be about content expansion, but it also transition to being about optimization of cost to capital.","Scott Devitt","And I think you said at one point in time or possibly it was Reed that -- if content is available, you would be willing to take on more leverage or take on versus first otherwise letting it go because it does fit into the P&L currently.","So, with -- and I'm paraphrasing there, but with -- where you're now in the $2 billion drag, but where content spend see it's beginning to normalize in terms of the outweigh versus the P&L spend. Is there visibility to when the business becomes self-fund based on the current trajectory?","David Wells","We haven't provided that guidance Scott. It really depends on how much we want to continue to expand content and the growth of the business itself. So, we're little bit guarded in terms of providing specific because there's interdependences there.","What I think -- and this back to Doug's question prior is part of the reason that our working capital needs have gone up a little bit is because we're owning more and more of our content and I think that's a good thing for the investor and the shareholder. We control more of the rights, more of the sort of global advantages for being a platform that is increasingly having 90 million and beyond global subscribers will be advantageous for us to own that content.","So, I think the step-up -- the slight step-up from years past -- a couple of years to the 2 billion that we're talking about this year is inclusive of more owned content and increasingly more content categories. I think you get both of those in there.","Scott Devitt","And then secondly as investors begin to look the U.S. market as a template for rest of world as happens with businesses in the Internet when you grow globally, can you just talk about the takes in terms of what could lead to similar margin profile of markets out of U.S. versus higher or lower as the churn?","David Wells","Sure. I'll pitch it to Reed. I'll say something and then Reed can follow-on. But I would say there's competitiveness in those markets. Generally, overall I would say there's nothing fundamental that we can get to margins equal or better in some places of the U.S. So then you think about an average across the globe and it really is about determined somewhat by competitiveness, it's determined by the cost of that content.","But the more we can grow and provide sort of spread the cost of popular content that is engaging to a large portion of the world, the more advantage and scale advantage we see there in terms of being able to do that.","So, I would provide those comments and then see if Reed has anything that he might want to add to that.","Reed Hastings","I think that's perfect David. Our North Star is providing an incredible value to consumer because upon that you can build a very large and very profitable franchise. But it starts with an amazing value for consumers which is a great service and amazing content behind that.","Scott Devitt","Thanks.","Doug Mitchelson","Two questions for Ted. Ted, anything new in terms of ROIs on your investment in content? You look at acquired versus originals, are the lines starting to cross in any way? And as part of that, are you willing to give us an update in hours consumed? Globally, we haven\u2019t had that number from you in a while.","Ted Sarandos","Well, stay tuned for those numbers. We don't have anything to report today, but I'll tell you I think the -- as David had mentioned while it is a bit more cash consumptive, owning our own content and including our original productions has a lot of big scale advantages to the business, probably the most meaningful one is removing the studio markup and overhead on those productions and being able to put more of that on the screen, owning the IP as we expand into multiple seasons, having control over the windows.","And so I lean into both original programming and owned original programming, but we're still very active buyer of second-window content from our studio partners. We are increasingly coproducing some of the programming with networks and studios around the world. We'll take one country and we'll premiere the show globally at the same time which takes off some of that risk and also enhances our partnerships with those networks and studios.","But I do think there's a lot of value in owning the IP and a lot of value in creating new content. But we need to have great programming for our members and sometimes, we don't have that. So, we will have to go out and we're buying it elsewhere to enhance what we are doing.","Doug Mitchelson","I think along those lines, any suggestions as to where the emphasis will be going forward? I think there's still a feeling that this could use more movie content. You made huge investments on the comedy side, which they -- if you want to talk about that. Particular genres that we should expect you to focus ongoing forward?","Ted Sarandos","Well, you could look at those comedy investments as a good example of taking a category that we primarily bought second window from other people just a few years ago and now are producing original programming that takes it from being just something people watch to something people really value Netflix for differentially. The rest of this quarter you're going to see standup shows from Amy Schumer, Dave Chappelle, Trevor Noah, Jim Norton, like some of the top names in comedy.","And as you are -- going out, we've already talked about Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld's recent deals. But that's a category we took it from being kind of cheap second window programming to something that really becomes an event and a subscriber acquisition driver for Netflix.","Same thing with unscripted programming with shows that will be launching even this quarter like Ultimate Beastmaster and Abstract, which is a variant on Chef's Table, but about design. And it's all that programming that we used to license in second window that we're finding to be much more valuable to go ahead and produce originally for Netflix.","David Wells","Scott, Doug, I think we got time for maybe one final question from either one of you or one each.","Scott Devitt","I'll go first. The question that I had is -- squeeze in net neutrality edits, it's commented on the letter, but we could just the assumption of the new administration entitled to that neutrality is rolled back, what are the implications for Netflix?","Reed Hastings","I think we addressed that in the letter. I don't have really anything to add to that.","Scott Devitt","Okay.","Doug Mitchelson","I think from my end last question, we're just curious the ultimate vision at this point, we're turning the new calendar year. I think we've had a conversation in the past where you talked about to satisfy consumers you have to give them all the television shows they want for $25. I'm just curious as you talk about the letter, your decade -- next decade is going to be pretty exciting, what's your ultimate vision at this point for the services?","Reed Hastings","You never want to characterize something as an ultimate vision because when you get there, there's always more that you want to do. And so we're taking it year-by-year, we're growing around the world, we're thrilled with our global expansion, ex-China we're really focused on all the different markets, Asia still doing work, in Europe we're building up our content production, muscle, we're able to produce shows now in many countries around the world.","So, think of us just continuing to iterate on the basic cycle of more content, better product that combines as a great service with a great price and hopefully with that, we can attract many more people to join Netflix and then that fuels the whole cycle.","So, we're just going to lather, rinse, repeat again and again for the next couple years and expand that. We have a long way to go. When you think about how many movies and TV shows we don't have. We want to be able to just think about the great range of content that we have and we're very ambitious about what we can do, especially around the world.","So, there's a lot for us to work on. And then just the next six weeks in Brazil, Europe, Asia, we're having a blast just spreading and evangelizing this vision of Internet TV where you get to control what you watch and you get incredible quality content.","And we hope to land this quarter in 99 million subscribers, which will be quite an achievement. And thank you very much all for your support and look forward to talking to again in the quarter."],"15633":["Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call October 15, 2014  6:00 PM ET","","Executives","","David Wells \u2013 Chief Financial Officer","Reed Hastings \u2013 Founder and CEO","Ted Sarandos \u2013 Chief Content Officer","","Analysts","","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","","","David Wells","Welcome to the Netflix Q3 2014 Earnings Call. I am David Wells, CFO. Joining me today on the company side is Reed Hastings, our CEO; and Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer. Interviewing us on our results today will be Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson; and for his last time Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Doug will be \u2013 Doug will be handing the baton over to Mark Mahaney from RBC next quarter.","I think Michael, you have our first question. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Michael.","Question-and-Answer Session","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","That\u2019s right. Thanks, David. The first question is going to be to Reed. I think the obvious question to ask is given though the miss in subscribers this quarter in the U.S. and the slightly slower growth next quarter in the U.S. what gives you confidence that you\u2019re still on the middle part of the growth-curve and the s-curve, especially given the fact that you have a grandfather price increase couple of years down the road, so anything on that.","Reed Hastings","Sure, Michael. We added 3 million net subscribers in Q3, so about a million a month and then in Q4 we\u2019re forecasting 4 million. If you look just at the domestic side however, that\u2019s about 1 million and about 2 million in Q4. And we\u2019re hoping for big numbers, we\u2019re always working hard on that. But when you ask what\u2019s the confidence that were on the middle part we really have to feel our way along quarter-by-quarter as we improve the content.","And if you think about the general society, all moving to Internet TV like HBO\u2019s announcement today, there\u2019s a lot of feeling of just everyone is going there, not exactly sure the rate of transfer but Internet TV is going to be everything in a couple of years.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","And Reed, just to follow-up on that, why is 60 million to 90 million still the right number in the U.S. given what we saw out here in 3Q and what you\u2019re looking at for the fourth quarter?","Reed Hastings","Well, everything that we\u2019re seeing is completely consistent with the whole society, not only the U.S., but around the world is moving to Internet video and Internet television. And so I think it\u2019s completely consistent with what we\u2019re seeing. And we\u2019re seeing \u2013 we saw Starz a week ago announced that they are doing an Internet video service; we saw HBO; perhaps all the other providers over the coming weeks. And so think of all the big networks are moving to Internet video and it\u2019s just becoming a very large opportunity.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","","David, given that that revenues came in line, subscribers came in lighter in the U.S. was there a mix-shift amongst your pricing tiers in the third quarter?","David Wells","Not really. Before I jump into the question, I realized that I didn\u2019t provide the Safe Harbor statement. So we will be making forward-looking statements during this interview and actual results may vary. And there\u2019s your proof that it\u2019s \u2013 this is not a scripted interview.","So Michael, back to your question, in terms of really the revenue number, we sort of missed on the total subscriber line and there is a bit of a delay between the folks getting a 30-day free trial and the revenue coming in. So that would explain most of it. There is a little bit of a mix-shift in terms of ASP being slightly higher than we forecasted, but most of it was just because of the revenue having a little bit of a lag.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","Reed, can you talk about the strength of subscribers in the new Western European markets in 3Q, how they performed early on versus your expectations and then also how much do you know here about conversion rates as they\u2019re just coming off of their one-month free trials and how is that impacting your guidance for 4Q.","Reed Hastings","Well, we had a very successful launch. We\u2019ve done numerous launches now starting in Canada four years ago, so we\u2019re getting better and better at it. We\u2019ve got some of the fastest integration with MVPD set-tops that we\u2019ve ever seen in the world. In the U.S., we still don\u2019t really have anything material. In the UK, it took us a year-and-a-half to get Virgin and we were able to announce Orange and Deutsche Telekom, and these are all going live shortly or just turned live or going live over the next couple of months.","So, really a great successful launch that portents well for us and that\u2019s built in to the guidance. So, we\u2019re feeling, I mean, just incredible about international when you think that from starting four years ago in Canada to \u2013 through to the Netherlands, so almost 40 countries, as a whole are now profitable, just an average of two or three years after starting. It\u2019s a great success and that\u2019s why we\u2019re continuing to invest so rapidly at international.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Okay. I have a two-parter for Reed and Ted on HBO GO. Today, the big news out of the Time Warner Investor Day was the announcement of an over-the-top service to be launched next year in the U.S. Two questions would be for Reed. What do you think the impact on competition will be as they start really pushing that product?","And for Ted, the take-away was they might start sourcing some of Time Warner\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019re putting Time Warner\u2019s content into HBO on kids and maybe on movies and TV shows, so talk about those two things.","Reed Hastings","Sure, absolutely on the consumer side it\u2019s one more channel. So already consumers subscribed to us, and Hulu, and Amazon, and they do pay-per-view, and they do DVD, and they do cable. So there are so many great sources of entertainment and consumers subscribe to many of these. So it\u2019s not much of a change in the direct competitive landscape.","We and HBO have completely different content. So I don\u2019t think it will be significant impact at the consumer level. As we bid for content, that\u2019s more significant and I\u2019ll turn that over to Ted.","Ted Sarandos","Yeah, I\u2019d say similarly that HBO is another buyer in the market if they do choose to start licensing from, even from their sister companies. And different companies have different views of how they look to vertically integrate. But in this case, I think they\u2019re very, they have an established revenue model for that content, with buyers like Netflix and others that they will have to competitively bid in the market for.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","Reed, just following up on HBO GO and the competitive dynamic there, do you have a view on how it could be priced and distributed when it ultimately comes out?","Reed Hastings","In Nordics, they\u2019ve competed with us since launch two years now with HBO Nordics and there they chose to price on top of our pricing. Now, that pricing is higher because the VAT and cost of living, so it\u2019s not definitely indicative. But they\u2019ve been quite aggressive in the Nordics and we stayed well ahead.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","It looks like this quarter, I\u2019ll throw to David, that the guidance provided on free subs in international markets missed our expectations and your expectations. What is going on there? How could free trial subs miss expectations?","David Wells","Well, there\u2019s a number of ways. We just didn\u2019t grow as much as we thought we were going to in terms of bringing folks in. So across a number of markets we were lighter versus our forecast than we expected. And you collect all of those markets together and you get to a point where you missed on the total number, but you made it on the paid number.","Reed Hastings","And when David talks about missing, remember that what we\u2019re providing is our internal forecast and we expect to miss pretty frequently. That\u2019s the mid-point to essentially and so we\u2019ll be a little above that, a little below that every quarter.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","And David, you called out in the letter basically that the increase in pricing may have had some impact in 3Q and perhaps a greater impact than you saw in the second quarter, perhaps, because Orange Is the New Black offset that. Beside pricing, is there anything else that you can point to in the U.S. in particular?","David Wells","Any given quarter, there\u2019s a number of swing factors involved. We said that was our leading indicator or leading factor in the quarter. The Home Depot breach certainly brought down some of our \u2013 put a number of people on payment-hold. But we felt like if we provided three or four more swing factors it felt a little bit like an excuse, so we didn\u2019t do that. But there are certainly other factors at play.","We had a strong comp last year with releasing Orange in July versus in Q2 of this year and we talked a little bit about that. We certainly saw some effects from the Home Depot breach and then there\u2019s two or three more of those that we could talk about, but they are minor compared to what we think is the major one.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Reed, we got a lot of questions about France versus Germany as markets. Can you \u2013 I know, it\u2019s early days, can you share us some information as what you are seeing on initial take-up rates or excitement around \u2013 in France and Germany for Netflix?","Reed Hastings","Yes, absolutely. I mean France and Germany are unique markets and so is Brazil a unique market and so is Norway. And now, we are over 45 of these unique markets. And every market we\u2019ve been able to figure out over time, what\u2019s the right mix of content. And think of basic consumer behavior as they want control and they want Internet video, because they get to watch on any screen, they get to watch any time they want, they get to binge-watch.","Those are very universal values and so we\u2019re gaining increasing confidence that Netflix is highly relevant around the world and that\u2019s why we\u2019re just looking forward to continue to expand next year.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","And just following up Reed and perhaps Ted here as we talked about the International business, what percentage of content in new international markets is local? How do you know what the right level is here, and do you feel like you have enough currently in France and Germany?","Ted Sarandos","So, Doug, I'll jump in there. The \u2013 it\u2019s similarly places the other markets have been around 15% to 20% local and within others, with 80%, 85% being either Hollywood or other international content. We \u2013 one of our first indicator is that, we are getting the mix right is how many hours of viewing people are participating in? And in France and Germany, the viewing hours are quite healthy relative to all of our other launches. So we're finding \u2013 consumers are finding the things they want.","The tricky thing is figuring out is the local content something that people want in the long-term, because when we first get to a new market, I think people are mostly excited about those things that they didn\u2019t have access to before. So, Orange Is the New Black was by far the most watched show in both France and Germany and, in fact, all of the markets that we launched.","So it tells you that with all the differences in taste that they both \u2013 they all rallied around that show. I do think too that we're offering those markets unprecedented choice, not just in programming, but also in choice of language, where you can watch the show either in native language or subtitles or dubbed in local language, which is something that\u2019s not been available to consumers in those markets before.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","David, in the press release today or the letter to shareholders, you mentioned that Canada is now at the same margin as the U.S. after four years. How different are the penetration rates between those markets, I know, you don\u2019t get into the actual rates. But how different are acceptance rates there and is that the threshold for profitability in terms of U.S. level profitability around the world?","David Wells","Well, you're right, we don\u2019t get into specifics. But the penetration \u2013 the rate of growth in any given market can be different. So the rate of growth between Canada, between Europe, between Latin America can be very different. But just reiterating in terms of the financial performance and the return on investment, in 2012, we spent nearly $400 million in terms of contribution loss on international. And what we were telling you today is that is now a positive number.","So, in little less than two years, we've made great progress. We think the international is a very good investment. So, some markets are going to take longer than others, the content maybe priced lower in those markets. So, the economics are very different market to market.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","David, you mentioned in the letter a little bit about the changes in the VAT in Europe that go into effect in 2015. Can you talk here about how those new rules will impact Netflix in Europe, and how much profit is at risk here, can you just perhaps quantify things beyond just talking qualitatively about?","David Wells","Sure. So Luxembourg had an arrangement with the EU, where if you were headquartered there, you could charge a 15% Luxembourg VAT rate. And VAT rates, they vary from Switzerland at 8% on the low end to the Nordic countries at 25% on the high end. So for us, we're talking about an internal cost change to Netflix, because we're not going to pass that along to the consumer of about 5% on average of Europe revenue. So some others rates are going from 15% to 25%, some of them are going from 15% to 19%, but a weighted average that you can sort of ballpark is about 5% of European revenue.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","David or Reed, can you give us an update on 2015 international expansion plans, you\u2019ve called out that you are going to keep opening up new markets, how should investors think about the speed of those openings in investments in 2015?","Reed Hastings","We're still sorting that out Michael, trying to figure out, which markets are most attractive and we'll have some announcements to make over the next year. If you look at our long-term strategy, we've been extremely consistent over the past three years, saying that, we're going to take all of our profits and put them into international expansion, because we see it as such a big opportunity. So think of that as the base case if we can move quickly enough, then we can deploy all of those profits in highly productive ways.","David Wells","And I would say to give you some sense of the magnitude, we peaked out of international loss at 105 million we guided in Q4 to a number that slightly lower than that. But in terms of the potential down the road, we certainly could see that level of investment.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Okay. Thank you.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","So following up on that Reed and then perhaps Dave as well, Reed, you recorded about a month ago saying that it would take three to five years for single country to get to break-even. And then also that it could take Europe five to ten years overall to the break-even, and then also that you want to be fully global including China. Can you help us sort these out, and in particular, do you still believe that international contribution margins can be comparable to U.S. margins in a more mature state?","Reed Hastings","Yes, we're making great progress on international. We gave you the proof point on Canada having gotten there; we're continuing to make progress in all those markets towards having a similar contribution to contribution profit to the U.S. and contribution margin, so feeling great about that. The three to five years is what we've seen in our experience, we'll see if future markets are slower or faster, there are some variations. And then overall, Europe picture is, because we keep adding new markets, so that\u2019s why that\u2019s our longer timeframe, because it\u2019s a cascade from the very beginning.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","And just to clarify on that, you still think that that\u2019s the right kind of timeframe for Europe overall cascading from the beginning?","Reed Hastings","Yes, there's nothing that\u2019s changed.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Ted, as you start buying rights like Gotham worldwide, you start seeing some markets like Australia acknowledge that you have the rights to Gotham in those markets. How do you balance the need to basically buy global rights with a desire to be more measured as you expand internationally?","Ted Sarandos","Well, the one thing that\u2019s been really encouraging Michael is that the content, there is a lot of our content choices have proven to be extremely global starting with all of our original series that, Orange Is the New Black and House of Cards have been huge successes in not just in Australia, but in China, I mean, all over the world.","So these buys bode well I think for future expansion in all territories. And the \u2013 right now, I believe we've hit kind of a financial tipping point, where we can move forward on buying up more territories than we're currently operating in versus playing catch-up, which we had been doing, licensing the territory or creating original series, and then several years later having to go back and either renegotiate for that series or not have it like we don\u2019t have House of Cards in some of our current expansion territories.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","David, just on international expansion, what do you think the best way is for the street to think about and model your future international markets? So meaning, if we don\u2019t know the exact markets in any given years, what is the reasonable expectation for the number of new broadband households that you would like to address over the next few years, obviously, there is big implications here for both subs and, of course, for the bottom line. And do you expect these international launches to continue to be more heavy in 3Q and 4Q, or more evenly spread out through the year?","David Wells","Well, I've given you some indication of sort of, at least, the financial magnitude, I don\u2019t think, we have an addressable broadband household target in mind when we think about the next wave of international expansion. There is a number of just execution elements that come into play, how many we think we can do successfully well at the same time or consecutively and certainly we're getting closer and closer as Ted talked about to a global right.","So in terms of the incremental cost associated with an international launch, we certainly are reflective in some of our produced content today of having a global right or close to a global right. So I would say, it\u2019s our intent to continue to rollout international. You've got some indication of magnitude on the financial side, and we intend to continue to pursue it, because it\u2019s been a great investment so far.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","David, based on some of our analysis, I think other people feel the same way, it looks like you can add in new markets between 300 to 500 basis points of penetration in the first couple of years, is that consistent with your own data which you have and we\u2019re not been able to dig into?","David Wells","We don\u2019t provide that level of detail and specificity.","Reed Hastings","The one thing, David, that we said in as we do in the launch markets is that, it took in the U.S. seven years to get to about one-third of broadband households. And that in the developed markets, so not as much LATAM, but for Western Europe that we're targeting those kind of numbers getting to a third of households over seven years. So that would be consistent with the trajectory that you've just outlined Michael.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Okay. Thanks.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","All right. Let\u2019s shift a little bit more toward content, so Ted, a couple big announcements recently certainly Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and then also the Adam Sandler deal, I'll just hit on the latter, but can you talk more about how data influence the decision to do the four movie deal with Adam Sandler. Can you talk about his global appeal as well, and do you think there are other actors or actresses that could have similar appeal for Netflix going forward?","Ted Sarandos","Sure, Doug, the Adam Sandler decision was driven on by following market after market seeing Adam's films either from his deepest catalogue to his newest releases performing \u2013 outperforming not only performing their Box Office, but performing wonderfully in every territory defying conventional wisdom that America comedy doesn\u2019t travel.","And more importantly, he really performs well in the Box Office in our key markets like Brazil, like Germany, like the UK, and his last movie was 60% international. So Adam is not only a proven 20-year star, I mean, he has a move that performs well in the Box Office every summer for 20 years. He is a real global superstar and we see that in the data and the more international we get, the more access we have to that data \u2013 those data points versus relying on conventional wisdom of generic thinking like that American comedians don\u2019t travel so well. So we're really proud of the deal and we think that our subscribers are going to love having access to those movies immediately through this new deal.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Ted, you mentioned or the letter mentioned today that it\u2019s more efficient for you to buy movies this way than buying in your Pay 1 window. Can you talk more about that, because it seems to me that you are a successful film producer, you want to use the windows to monetize all your consumer touch point, so why is it more efficient to do it this way versus Pay 1?","Ted Sarandos","Well, there is a couple of ways to think about it Michael, the main one is access to content that people want to watch. And I think this long protracted window model was fine before On-Demand was possible like consumers now expect to see content sooner or have access to content earlier windows in the formats that they want to watch. So in this case, we are talking about Netflix and the current pay model doesn\u2019t deliver movies to us till about 10 months to a year after theatrical and in some cases nine years after theatrical over sitting behind someone else's deal. So if you look at a successful film and you roll up all the license fee \u2013 all the licensing fees in each territory, it is possible there is an economic trade off that you are paying less to produce the film than you are to license it, and this model to your point about, you want to split those of the windows. For us this is programming cost, not an individual P&L on each film.","Reed Hastings","And the broad point here is especially with Adam Sandler multi-movie deal, it\u2019s establishing a sense in the subscribers of thrilled with Netflix, because I'm in the Adam Sandler I watch this and now the next movie and the next movie comes. So think of it with us playing with this idea of episodic and serialized, but now in the movie forum and seeing what kind of great brand allegiances we can create for Adam\u2019s fans, that\u2019s not everybody, but they are very identifiable. So I think it\u2019s a very creative approach that Ted's pioneered here.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","And on that note with the Adam Sandler deals, Ted, can you just talk to us about how you would actually measure the success of these kind of partnerships given that you don\u2019t have the traditional barometer of the Box Office to track here?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, I would think about the same way we look at the successes around original series or any of our license series relative to what you are paying, do you get this kind of three legs of success, with the viewing, the brand halo, and net subscriber additions based on access to the content.","I think that particularly and this one is, we try to be as consumer friendly as we can and I think the model here is telling us that consumers want access to those films sooner and that we could build them model that\u2019s economically feasible to do it. But if the measure \u2013 the measure \u2013 you should think about measuring success the same way we do series and do people get excited about Netflix because of it. And I think as Reed pointed out, I'm as excited about this as I have been since we talked about House of Cards a couple of years ago, about the potential impact on the brand and the subscriber enthusiasm around it.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Ted, in the UK, we found some data that suggests that younger households are consuming a lot more Netflix than older households, penetration rates are higher. You mentioned in the letter that you had, I think 75 series, kids series with over 2 million views. Can you talk a little bit about what is that mean, is that over a week, is that over, what duration is that and is that globally. They're \u2013 those are active titles, titles that are currently being watched, and that\u2019s a domestic number and we want to point that out, because relative to other outlets for kids programming that\u2019s a pretty big number for those and particularly in that kind of volume. But those are domestic and you can think about the international and domestic split roughly similar to our subscriber base.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","And \u2013 within what timeframe, is it on a monthly basis, is it qummed [ph] over time?","Reed Hastings","They are currently active titles and they are qummed for active titles.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Okay. Okay, thanks.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","And Ted, on Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon some of the major theatre-chains here have responded pretty negatively early on in terms of the day-and-date IMAX release and Netflix streaming plans. What happens to the economics of your film strategy if some of those major chains prevent IMAX from exhibiting the film?","Ted Sarandos","Very little economically, I mean, I think the key to it is we would like to give the consumers the choice to see a big film on a big screen. And Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is not a direct-to-video low budget sequel, it\u2019s a big film. And it\u2019d be fantastic to have the opportunity to see it on the IMAX screens at the same time and IMAX has made arrangements with us for that to happen. I think it\u2019s \u2013 as expected the theatre-chains reacted negatively publicly. But I think the really \u2013 the real story will unfold on August 28 when the film opens, when we see if it\u2019s on those screens or not.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Reed, in the past quarter, it looks like in Canada, a local tribunal, the CRTC was asking for some data regarding Netflix that you guys were not willing because of privacy to share. Are you worried that governments and regulators will start asking for even more disclosure and try to enforce more traditional regulatory pressures upon your business?","Reed Hastings","It\u2019s super important that Netflix maintain a reputation with consumers for protecting privacy against a wide range of players. So you will see us be a really staunch ally of the consumer. Will there be conflict with certain government agencies that may over time; we are not seeking to have a fight. We are going to try to work well with everyone and certainly as an example in France, I think we really turned around what could have been a difficult situation into one that was quite positive. So we are getting better and better at those governments relation skills, where we don\u2019t have to have a battle.","Ted Sarandos","It\u2019s probably worth mentioning, Michael, in Canada producing Netflix content gets bigger in the animated space. We\u2019re one of the largest employers in Canada for animation executives and there is \u2013 I think something on the magnitude of $140 million a year be important to the Canadian economy producing animation for Netflix. It\u2019s pretty impressive.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","David, can you talk about just how the amortization of these newer movie deals are going to be recognized on the financial statements? And then just in particular, can you go into some detail? I know you talked about in the letter some, but just the dynamics around free cash flow and EPS as both a function of some of the heavier content investments and then also the international expansion as well?","David Wells","Sure. So I'll take the amortization question. In terms of how the movies will be amortized, they will be accelerated like our large original series are. And until we have more data to challenge that whether it should be faster or slower, we'll take that assumption that they\u2019ll be accelerated.","And then your second question was on free cash flow relative to net income. So we put the graph in there to illustrate the separation that happened in Q3. We've been saying this for quite some time in terms of the pressures on cash being the expansion of content, including produced content as well as the international expansion, because it forces the loss lower.","So I would say, it\u2019s still consistent when we talked about 1.2 to 1.3 ratio of cash outlaid to content P&L expense is still consistent. And if we spend $3 billion globally on content and growing, even taking the 1.2 or the 20% ratio that\u2019s 600 million of cash laid out for content over and above the P&L expense. So we expect these trends to be persistent and I think that we have 1.7 billion in cash. I think we\u2019re okay for the next few quarters, but we continually look at this and if we continue to expand both content and international as we expect to do, then you should continue to see some pressure on the cash \u2013 on the free cash flow.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Ted, can you talk a bit about off-network syndication? In the past quarter, you were able to license both Gotham and Blacklist a year after they aired on network television. Can you talk a bit about what changed in model and what's the cost of those types of purchases versus maybe library content?","David Wells","Yes, and there is other variants on the model like in January you will see a Better Call Saul, the Breaking Bad prequel that we will be licensing in all of our other territory. And a year after in the U.S. and Canada, and then in the first run every other territory we operate in. So we are super excited about that one too. And I look at it about as all these models are changing pretty rapidly there is multiple buyers in the market. So I think at any one piece of content, the bidding can get pretty intense, but overall, the content costs are pretty consistent on all these new models.","And I think operating in 50 different countries and being willing to operate in multiple windows, gives us a real advantage in the market, so we're excited about that.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","And Ted, there\u2019ve been some comments in the press recently and I think coming from agencies essentially. They\u2019re really the foundation for the agencies in selling to a streaming service. Back-ends of course are typically their foundation, but selling to a streaming with a perpetual deal they wouldn\u2019t necessarily know where that back-end would come from if there may not be a second sale. Does that create a problem for you in buying content rights across all markets and do you see any push-back there?","Ted Sarandos","No, Doug. And just like every time you present to a new market and a new window and a new paradigm, you got to figure out how to make it work in the old world too. So I think in \u2013 these problems were contemplated back when HBO started doing original series before they had a DVD business, before they knew if they were going to syndicate, so I think those are all navigatible and had been navigated in the past and we\u2019re navigating them as well.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Reed, a question on Internet net-neutrality, one of the things we started with looking at broadband investment is if the interconnect fee is capped or protected or kept zero, how do investors in broadband plant recoup their investment if they can\u2019t charge interconnections or how does the Comcast investor or the PIPE investor think about returns on their investment if they can\u2019t charge for interconnection?","Reed Hastings","Well, the simple version is they collect revenue on the Internet from their customers and that pays for the network and we don\u2019t ask them to pay for our content and we don\u2019t think they should ask us to pay for their network. So that\u2019s the basis of the no fee interconnect.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","David, I think U.S. marketing spend was down about 5% year-over-year and more than 200 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Why spend fewer dollars in 3Q if the growth was slowing down and you\u2019re coming in below forecast and could this have hindered sub-growth and how should we think about that marketing dollar trend going forward?","David Wells","Well, I think back six, eight years ago, there was a much more direct connection between our marketing spend and our net-additions in terms of bidding on bounties for people to sign-up via click-through on an online ad. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true anymore. So I don\u2019t think that whether our marketing spend is up 10% or down 10%. There is an immediate direct connection felt on our net addition growth. So when we look at our marketing spend, we look at a number of factors. We look at what content, what opportunities we have to spend against that in the quarter. We look at what our margin targets are. There\u2019s a number of things that go into that.","But I wouldn\u2019t say that that was a large influent on the \u2013 on sort of the year-on-year decline of growth that we saw in the U.S.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Reed, over the past weekend, our home which uses FiOS had a trouble getting on to Netflix which is a good problem to have. But I wonder, what does your research tell you about satisfaction levels when there is a buffering or connectivity issue and how does that get solved?","Reed Hastings","I\u2019m surprised that you got an issue. Verizon\u2019s done a lot of investment over the past three months to get the average speeds up and what\u2019s remarkable is how quickly they\u2019ve been able to expand the interconnect so that the average speeds for Verizon are now some of the highest in the United States, still not as high as many of the speeds in Europe but some of the highest in the U.S. So it should be very rare and I have to follow-up with you and we can take a look at the logs for your home if you\u2019re comfortable with that, and we\u2019ll see what was going on.","Maybe, one of the kids was doing some illegal downloading.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","It\u2019s my problem.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","Reed, just in thinking about the U.S. versus international markets, can you compare and contrast some of the challenges with peering with interconnection and net-neutrality, especially in markets internationally where we may be seeing some consolidation? Do you see any elevated challenges in some of those new markets you might wish to go into in 2015 and beyond?","Reed Hastings","Outside the U.S. there\u2019s much more of a common regiment of settlement-free interconnect. The whole charging for interconnect is really an artifact of size. So Comcast is the biggest so they get to charge the most and then it goes down from there, so it\u2019s straight power dynamics as opposed to costs or anything like that. So it\u2019s a much friendlier climate outside the U.S. for settlement-free interconnect.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","David, can you update us on foreign exchange? I know it\u2019s still early days and you guys are growing internationally, but is your cost base denominated for most part in U.S. dollars and is revenue base denominated internationals? How does currency affect you guys next year?","David Wells","It\u2019s a mix, but it\u2019s actually very quite small. It\u2019s under $1 million of P&L effect. On sort of valuing the balance sheet items there\u2019s a little bit more of an effect especially against the British pound. I would say there\u2019s a mixture across it, so there\u2019s some natural hedging that occurs, but right now it\u2019s actually quite small in terms of an overall influence on our EPS and on our P&L.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","Reed, or perhaps, David, can you review economics just around how the through the middle kind of set-top box relationships work and perhaps talk a little bit about how some of these newer dynamics or relationships in Western Europe may be relative to earlier deals and some of the smaller stuff for example that you\u2019ve had in the U.S.","Reed Hastings","Well, I think we\u2019ll both tell you the same thing that, we can\u2019t tell you much about those deals, that we\u2019re comfortable with the economics. We\u2019ve done lots of deals in the U.S., first with Xbox, then with PlayStation, Apple TV, et cetera. So we\u2019ve been doing these kinds of deals for a long time.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Reed, as HBO starts building out in the U.S. you\u2019ve had experience in the Nordic region where they\u2019ve competed with you. Can you share a bit what you have learned within the Nordics and does it mean for overall television consumption in that market?","Reed Hastings","Yes, each market is unique. So, I think they\u2019ve had some teething problems initially two years ago that they probably would not have in the U.S. I think they\u2019ve been licensing broadly, they just licensed a number of Starz\u2019s titles. So they\u2019re willing to license beyond their core platform. They\u2019ve done pretty well and we\u2019ve done very well.","And what we\u2019ve talked to when we talk to subscribers there is there really, if they\u2019re in the content they subscribe to both services. So I really think we\u2019re going to see this just really fun-coupled years with the two of us compete for the best content, the most Emmies, the subscriber growth. And many, many people will subscribe to both services. So we\u2019re looking forward to that. We\u2019re just excited that HBO is really in the game with the Internet. They\u2019re the leader in their field. They\u2019re well ahead of their peer-group. They\u2019re ahead of the broadcast networks in this dimension so it\u2019s exciting to see.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","David, you updated the U.S. margin outlook to the 200 basis points of expansion per year and getting up to 40% over five years, of course, after you hit 30% early next year. How do you get comfortable that you can still invest what you need to in content in the U.S. and also do that 40% longer term margin.","David Wells","Well, I think Ted would tell you that he take everything that we\u2019ve given. But I think that even with the shift to the 200 it still allows for some pretty significant expansions of both licensed and produced content. So we feel pretty comfortable about the room for continued growth of the quality of the content. And I think it provides a little bit of discipline in terms of making sure that we spend that marginal dollar well. So I\u2019d say that we\u2019re pretty comfortable on both senses.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","And any chance you want to share more on what sub-number that 40% implies five years down the line?","David Wells","It implies continued growth.","Reed Hastings","Michael and Doug, we should do one more question each and then we should wrap it up.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Okay. Thanks, Reed. I have one for Ted. I believe one of your content deals early on had a put option for a company to actually put shows to you. I wondered what do you think will happen to those \u2013 to that agreement longer term and should we expect some more of the show \u2013 a big bundle of shows put to you in the next one or two years?","Ted Sarandos","All those deals, especially the early deals are very organic and they\u2019ve all been in various stages of renegotiation and extension and redefining. So there\u2019s nothing looming that\u2019s troubling in that way because remember they were mostly designed in the beginning to gain access to the content, not to try to avoid getting the content. So we\u2019re \u2013 there\u2019s nothing out there that we\u2019re nervous about or concerned about in our existing deals about a put that could just looming out there.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","And Reed, a question that we frequently get still is on pricing. We obviously saw the small, what we thought was a small pricing change in 2Q, but perhaps had a bigger impact in the third quarter. Does that mean really as we look out over the next couple of years that you may not do anything in, in terms of pricing or do you think, still think that you\u2019d look to experiment potentially, do things around tiering?","Reed Hastings","Well, we\u2019d definitely be listening closely to our members and then as we add more and more great original content than I think were more valuable to consumers. So we\u2019re seeing an adjustment period that\u2019s this quarter, we\u2019re learning how to do that. But over the long time consumers pay for value and it\u2019s up to us to frontload that value. And boy, the slate of content that Ted has for next year, it\u2019s, it\u2019s really exciting and it kicks off with Marco Polo in early December.","With that, let me thank everybody for joining us on this call and look forward to catching up with all of you over the quarter. And special thanks to Doug for his year of service. So we\u2019ll continue.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","Thank you.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson","Thank you."],"15465":["Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 23, 2012  6:00 PM ET","Executives","Ellie Mertz - ","Reed Hastings - Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Member of Stock Option Committee","David Wells - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer","Analysts","Jason S.

A detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the commission on February 10, 2012. A rebroadcast of this Q&A session will be available at the Netflix website after 6 p.m. Pacific Time today. ","Now let's move directly to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Ellie Mertz","[Operator Instructions] For the first topic we'll take questions on is domestic streaming. First question. Why are you so confident that gross add trends result from seasonality and not slowing growth? How can you be confident in 7 million net additions for the year?","Reed Hastings","Well, we had a fantastic Q1, adding nearly 3 million members to our global subscriber base. We had strong results in all of our territories, including the U.S. Our gross adds are consistent with our historic patterns. Our churn is consistent with our historic patterns, and we're feeling very good about the year. If you look at adding 7 million net adds, which is our target for the year, and you compare that to 2010 where we also added 7 million net adds, in 2010, that was 7 million on top of 12 million starting members. This year, that 7 million on top of 22 million starting members. If the mathematical effect, if that's true, with steady churn, that in adding 7 million on top of 12 million versus 7 million on top of 22 million, that there will be a significantly increased seasonality of net additions. So the business is performing exactly as we had hoped. We are continuing to execute on all of the key dimensions. But the artifact of having 7 million net adds on 22 million increases the seasonality relative to 2010, and we tried to demonstrate that or illustrate that in our appendix showing this phenomenon. So everything is consistent with what we've been hoping for, and so that's why we feel good about the year, continuing like this. It's probably secondarily all of the macro factors are very good, which is broadband is continuing. We're getting better and better content. Viewing is at record levels, and consumers want click and watch on-demand Netflix Internet television.","Ellie Mertz","A follow-up question to that. What will be the earliest indicators that you can or can't achieve that 7 million net U.S. streaming subs goal for 2012?","David Wells","I think the earliest indicators will be our net additions in Q2 going into Q3. So when looking at as we continue to see the same net addition rate both with the strength of the new members that we're bringing on to the space and the user engagement that we see both with new members and existing members, if those trends continue forward, we would expect to be continually confident in our ability to add 7 million members.","Ellie Mertz","Can you discuss the rate within the quarter of subscriber additions or their seasonality within the quarter?","Reed Hastings","Those seasonality, if you want, there's variation month-to-month, week-to-week that follows pretty typical patterns. And all of those patterns have stayed consistent -- are going consistently. And again, the main consternation that we picked up is while the growth adds are steady and following the traditional seasonal patterns, why is the net adds different? Why are the net adds diverging? And the answer is just a factor of, I'll slightly repeat myself of the math of, it's on top of 22 million instead of on top of 12 million that we tried to demonstrate in the appendix the way that works. Do you want to add anything in?","David Wells","No.","Ellie Mertz","We got another question on that. Churn spiked after the price increase but remains above historic levels. Will churn come down or is streaming-only structurally higher churn? Please explain your rationale.","David Wells","Just on the prior question, too, I think the prior question asks narrowly what the seasonality in Q1. It follows the prior seasonal pattern, so just to make sure we answer that question. And then could you ask that question one more time.","Ellie Mertz","Sure. Churn spiked after the price increase but remains above historic levels. Will your churn come down or is streaming-only structurally higher churn? Please explain.","David Wells","What we said before is streaming-only does have a slightly higher churn rate than our DVD service did and sort of part of our legacy. It's easier to come in and out of that service than the DVD having the DVDs at home and having to mail them. We would anticipate that, that need continues forward. But we do retain subscribers that have been with us longer at higher rates than subscribers that join our service. So as the base ages, the retention rate -- the overall retention rate improves. Therefore, as the age basis, that retention rate will improve just like it did with our DVD service.","Ellie Mertz","How should we think about 2Q seasonality this year relative to last year when you added 1.8 million subscribers on a similar overall base?","Reed Hastings","In last year 2011, we were on track for 11 million or 12 million arguably net adds on a starting base of 19 million. And so that roughly parallels the 7 million net adds on 12 million from 2010. And it's the ratio of net adds to a starting base that's different this year, and that's what creates the variation in net additions. So this year, we're at 7 million -- targeting 7 million net additions on 22 million, and that's what's different from last year. So again, it comes back to the essentially these unintuitive math effects if you got consistent churn across the year that the net adds seasonality increases. Again, the easiest way to see that is in the 3 tables at the very end of the letter where we've abstracted some examples to try to get comfortable with that phenomena. So we feel very much that we're on track for the 7 million net additions for the year.","Ellie Mertz","What's sort of the upside in contribution margins for the U.S. streaming business? Was there a timing issue associated with content cost?","David Wells","We talked about in the letter streaming content costs were lower, some customer service costs were lower and the delivery costs were lower. On the content side, we actually were pretty close to what we expected in terms of expense. But because it's such a large number, if you're slightly under that, it can be meaningful in terms of contribution margin. And most of what I saw was several small deals got pushed into Q2 or didn't close as of the end of the quarter.","Ellie Mertz","Is the domestic streaming outlook tied at all to H.R. 2471? Meaning, do you assume passage of this amendment at some point?","David Wells","H.R. 2471 is our bill to amend and improve and modernize the VPPA, and no, there's no assumption built into the numbers of that passing.","Ellie Mertz","At current churn levels, over 20 million people will turn off the U.S. streaming service at some point. Are you concerned that the large number of people that are trying Netflix and unsubscribing will ultimately prevent you from reaching your target of 60 million to 90 million U.S. subscribers? So alternatively, how much is churn if people are turning the service off and on repeatedly?","Reed Hastings","Lots of churn is people turning to service on and off. In other words, you join for 3 months, then you're not using it or you run out of money, so it's off for 3 months, then it's back on. Because we only offer a free trial to new members, subscribers particularly who are economically sensitive, price sensitive, had an incentive to them to start Netflix again under a different email address than they've had before. So there's no real clean counting of that dimension. What we feel great about is the very strong growth adds, the churn that's in line with our historic trends. So we're feeling quite good about the numbers.","Ellie Mertz","Question on domestic cost. You priced your Q4 2012 domestic streaming contribution profit assumption to 17%. What's the biggest driver of that? Is it streaming content cost coming in lower than anticipated? Do you expect continued contribution margin expansion in 2013?","David Wells","The biggest driver are deals that we thought would close slightly earlier than they did and that has a carryforward effect from Q1 to Q2. So I'd say that's the largest driver of that contribution margin outperformance.","Reed Hastings","And in terms of 2013, we haven't given any guidance. We would like to see 100 basis points per quarter go on for as long as we can. But we're going to have to feel our way through that year-by-year.","Ellie Mertz","In January 2012, Netflix indicated that over 2 billion hours of content have been streamed globally in Q4. You alluded to continued growth in Q1 2012. Can you provide any more color as to the increase in streaming hours per sub per quarter sequentially?","Reed Hastings","There's a reasonable amount of seasonality in viewing times in the Northern climates due to long nights, so we really compare this on a year-over-year basis as opposed to sequentially. But I can tell you that Q1 was all-time record for us in total viewing and in viewing per members. But in Q2 because of the seasonal, again, we'll compare that on a year-over-year basis.","Ellie Mertz","And then 2 question on profit outlook. Do you still anticipate net income losses for all of 2012, i.e., will losses in the fourth quarter international eat up the surprisingly high profit delivery in Q2 2012 and presumably through 3Q 2012? Do you expect to lurk around breakeven in 2013 as you would reinvest domestic profits into international expansions?","David Wells","So I think we addressed this in the letter, but in terms of Q2 profit expectation, if you take the midpoint of guidance, there's a modest net income profit. What we said is we would continue to launch international markets and stay about roughly breakeven. So with the Q4 launch, we would probably be facing a small loss rather than breakeven and then work our way back to breakeven.","Ellie Mertz","Let's take the questions on content. Do you expect to slow the growth in U.S. streaming content spend? And do you believe there's a certain terminal amount of content that is needed to sustain any number of subscribers, whether it be 25 million or 40 million subscribers? Said another way, do you think Netflix has to spend considerably more on content to grow from 25 million to 40 million subscribers?","Reed Hastings","We're growing content spend and content offering very aggressively going forward. And revenue is growing faster than that, so that's where we get the widening margin. But we have fractured -- a smallest fraction of the total amount of content that we would like to eventually have. So we will continue to grow the investment in content quite aggressively, slightly less than the rate of revenue growth.","Ellie Mertz","You secured the DreamWorks Animation output deal well before the 2013 start date. Are there other studio output contracts that are coming up for renewal such as Fox, Universal, Disney and Sony? Are these all beginning 2014 or '15? Will they similarly be bid out well before the start date? Do existing pay cable channels have right of first refusal?","Reed Hastings","It's highly variable by deal 2014 to 2015 when most of them come up. And as far as I know, no one else has right of first refusal.","Ellie Mertz","What is the current status of Epix content as it relates to exclusivity and what you intend to do going forward?","Reed Hastings","Epix is on cable, and it's on EpixHD, which is a TV Everywhere extension of Epix and it's on Netflix. That's all that it's on right now. And then as we go forth with Epix, we're in a broad range of discussions with how to operate most effectively for both of us.","Ellie Mertz","Here's a handful of questions about originals. How significant to overall views are exclusive or original content?","Reed Hastings","Well, the exclusive and original are 2 different things, so Breaking Bad's exclusive but not original as an example. Originals are just beginning, so all we've got up is Lilyhammer. So it's not yet hugely significant. But as we add in the next couple originals coming later this year, that will builds to a nice percentage of our total viewing.","David Wells","And I would say we look at the performance of those pieces of content like any other pieces of content in terms of cost per hours viewed and its efficiency. So across that class of content, we would expect to compare it against other like content.","Reed Hastings","We think we can produce contents at no greater cost than that per hour of viewing essentially than it would cost to get license, and then we have the advantages of the brand halo as well as the defensive hedge if we need it over time.","Ellie Mertz","Can you discuss how successful Lilyhammer was? Maybe helping to place it in perspective for its views versus other shows?","Reed Hastings","It was quite successful for the amount that we invested in and the amount of the cost. And it parallels some of the other premium exclusive content which we've got, like the Breaking Bad, in terms of its ratio of cost to viewing. So we feel really good about that of our first shot out. And as House of Cards and the other originals that we have come forth next year, we'll be very excited about those also.","Ellie Mertz","Is the cost associated with originals will ramp in 2013? Any way we can quantify the impact of that?","Reed Hastings","It's really just part of content cost, that is we'll spend in the neighborhood of single percentages of our total spending content spending for next year on a P&L basis with the originals. So for us, it's just another source of content.","David Wells","And I think what we said in the letter was that free cash flow, the cash will actually ramp as originals ramp into 2013. So the costs are already baked into our assumptions around content expenses. It's the cash that we'll ramp noticeably in the back half of the year.","Ellie Mertz","Here are some more questions. Netflix appears increasingly focused on exclusivity, especially compared to 12 to 18 months ago. Should we expect the vast majority of your content to be exclusive by year end 2013? In turn, is it reasonable that content spending will continue to move notably higher next year, as well as due to healthy sub growth?","Reed Hastings","As we move up in the content buying economic strata, you start off with the kind of low-end, nonexclusive content. And then as you want to get shows like Mad Men, you have to outcompete with other cable networks to get those shows in syndication and those are exclusive licenses. And so we started doing more and more of those. As we want to do direct deals with movie studios, like DreamWorks Automation, that the other bidders will not take that content if we also have it. So those are de facto exclusive. So this exclusive trend has been going on towards more and more exclusive and will continue as we climb the economic strata and have better and better content. It's a natural outcome of us being a network like other cable networks, all of which are exclusive against each other. I don't think we'll have all of our content exclusive really at any point in time because we'll continue to also have a broad range of nonexclusive content. But certainly, there'll be more and more that is exclusive.","Ellie Mertz","Can Netflix survive as a middleman? I define middleman as an intermediary between content owner and end user. Is the company's largely middleman status the reason for its apparent evolution to, at least in part, original programmer? How long do you think it will take to become a credible peer to HBO, which has had smash hit originals such as The Sopranos and Sex in the City?","Reed Hastings","Well, there are lots of middleman that are hugely successful in many different industries. And sometimes, they verticalize the production and they have store brands for various items, and it doesn't mean that they're middleman or retail status is weakened. They do that to strengthen themselves. And if you think about HBO, initially it was on almost all licensed content and then they grew in as they gain scale to also doing produced content. But still, a majority of HBO's budget is on content produced by others, by the major studios. So yes, we feel very comfortable about being an aggregator that packages together an incredible set of content to provide a great value for consumers and that's a great position to be in.","Ellie Mertz","What is the balance of streaming content as of 3\/31\/2012, that are not currently reflected on the balance sheet?","David Wells","I think that's referring to the content and contractual obligations. And at the end of Q1, that was $3.7 billion, which compares to $3.9 billion as of the end of 2011 and $1.8 billion a year ago. So it's down slightly from the end of the year as we moved content from that table on to the balance sheet, and that it became a window essentially in that asset recognition criteria.","Ellie Mertz","Now just as a follow-up to that. If you include what's in that note to the financials, if you add up the accounts table, you'd see that our total minimum commitment for streaming content is flat quarter-over-quarter. ","The biggest complaint I hear is that Netflix has a weak library of streaming content. While keeping pricing low is a strategy that seems to be working well, it prohibits this very common complaint from being addressed. Has Netflix proposed the idea of a tiered subscription plan for online access? Is silver, gold and platinum plan, which would open up a increasingly larger and more popular library, could both address this issue and increase profitability? Has this ever been considered?","Reed Hastings","No. We're very focused on keeping our proposition extremely simple. We think that, that is the right strategy when we're in this rapid phase of growth of the market, to have a single, paid dollar unlimited product in the marketplace. Eventually, in the next curve model, in the tail phase when the market matures, then you'll look to segment in various ways. But knock on wood, we're a long way from that, and we'll continue to focus for the foreseeable future on a clean, simple proposition.","Ellie Mertz","Cable ratings from many networks have declined this year. Do you believe networks are attributing this to Internet TV? And could it impact pricing on renegotiating TV content deals?","Reed Hastings","No, I'm not sure why cable network ratings are -- some are up and some are down. I think it's mostly due with the individual programming. If you've got incredible programming, there's several examples where the ratings are up. And in terms of how it affects us, we've got the ability to pay because we've got a larger subscriber base than anybody else. So to the degree that the prices are higher, we're still able to deliver on the consumer proposition.","Ellie Mertz","Well, just some questions about competition. Are you still thinking Amazon will do a stand-alone streaming product outside of Prime?","Reed Hastings","Our understanding is that it will still happen, yes. In terms of particular time frame, we're not sure on what that might be.","Ellie Mertz","You talked a lot about net neutrality. What do you see is the most realistic and\/or likely path towards enforcement of net neutrality?","Reed Hastings","Well, I'm not sure at this point. I think we're broadly socializing the idea of what's neutral and what's not, and we documented one clear example where we think this is not at all neutral. And we're engaged in a public discussion, essentially, of the issues. So we'll see how that plays out.","Ellie Mertz","Three related questions. Why are you so concerned about Comcast and bandwidth caps? If 1 hour of streaming time takes up a mere gigabit of bandwidth, and the Comcast monthly bandwidth cap is 250 gigabit, implying 8.3 hours per day of viewing time. Why the concern, especially if you believe that the Netflix streaming product is vastly superior to Xfinity?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think the concern we have is with the principles of net neutrality. Obviously, with a high enough cap, it kind of doesn't matter. But if something is accepted with one cap, we may find the next year that the cap is much lower. And so I think we have to really start to figure out the principles and advocate for those upon which we're all operating. I would agree. It's not a near-term issue with the 250 gigabyte cap. But the core principle is important anyway, which is the cap should be applied equally or not at all.","Ellie Mertz","I was wondering what Netflix will do to increase and hold existing subscriber base in the U.S. and elsewhere with so many other companies entering the streaming video business.","Reed Hastings","Well, I think what's happening is everyone's realizing that consumers want click and watch on-demand, and so there is a lot of announcements of everything from start ups to large companies. And we've been focused on this market for a very long time and have some substantial advantages because of that in terms of the breadth of our integration in the various devices, in terms of our on the remote control buttons that we have on Smart TVs, in terms of our integration into all of the game consoles. We have big advantages in terms of the development of our website in the core service, the algorithms and the personalization. We have incredible content. It's not as broad as we'll eventually have, but it's much broader than any competitor. So often what happens is when there's a lot of attention on the market, there are new competitors, but the leader gets the majority of the benefit of that and it's our job to continue to deliver for consumers so that we're chosen more often than anybody else.","Ellie Mertz","Let's turn to questions about international. What have you learned from existing market launches that you apply to as thought process of selecting your next international market that you've indicated will launch in Q4 this year?","Reed Hastings","Well, we've been really happy with the U.K. and Ireland, just great results there. We've got great results in Canada. And in Latin America, we'll get there eventually, but it's going to be long going harder than we initially thought. So we'll tend to be more towards developed markets that are more like Canada, U.K. and Ireland than strong emerging markets like Latin America.","Ellie Mertz","Your international expense guidance on January's Q4 call forecast $5 million for subtitling. Yet your release today, only months later, says your incentive capitalized such expenses. Why change from passive media expensing to a more aggressive income presentation?","David Wells","The costs were immaterial in the past. They rose in Q1 as we talked about in the letter, getting more towards 100% of our offering in Latin America subtitles. So we faced increased cost in Q1. And the prospect as we launch additional non-English markets is that these costs will be material. So from an accounting standpoint, when your low, it don't matter. You don't have a policy. When they become material and in bulk, they are material and they stay material, there's more argument that they'll be capitalized. And we look at this and we needed to create a policy in Q1, and we didn't have that accounted in our forecast.","Ellie Mertz","Question on Latin America. Latin America, we fully understand the limitations of infrastructure, credit cards and broadband hindering uptick. What I would like to know is what about the progress there that gives you confidence that it will succeed, albeit at the slower pace than you had initially expected as opposed to not work at all?","Reed Hastings","In Latin America, we're seeing a very nice revenue growth. It's just not as fast as we anticipated in terms of catching up to the content. So if there was a situation where we didn't have revenue growth, that would worry us, but that's not the situation that we have. We're seeing very nice revenue growth, and we're continuing to improve whether it's payment, whether it's the streaming delivery, all the other systems. And second, there's no competitor that's ahead of us. If we were would then be beaten in some nation by some other competitor, that would have us maybe rethink how long would it take us to get to profitability. But again, that hasn't happened. So for now, we've got a rapidly growing business. It's still running at a loss, and it's going to take longer, we think, than 2 years to get there. But the vectors are all in the right direction.","Ellie Mertz","Could the iTunes integration be extended beyond Apple TV to iPhones and iPads, too, in order to ameliorate the e-commerce payment problems in Latin America and elsewhere?","Reed Hastings","There's a number of integrations we could do. One would be in the iTunes aspect, others would be with ISPs, others would be with cable companies. So we're looking at those broadly, and each one will have small, positive effects. There will be no one breakthrough or silver bullet.","Ellie Mertz","I would just add, as we say in the letter, we're obviously opened to other people billing on our behalf. But also in Latin America, we're looking to improve the payment options that we offer to the consumers and solve the problem ourselves. ","The letter said you were looking to expand into additional European markets beginning in Q4 of this year. If you can't be more specific, can you talk about the characteristics of that market?","Reed Hastings","I think that's probably just a duplicate question, so let's just go to the next one.","Ellie Mertz","What is the incremental impact of your decision to enter another international market on the expected full year results for 2012 on a consolidated basis? Should we see an investment along the lines of Latin America and the U.K. or smaller?","David Wells","We haven't provided guidance on that. What I said earlier was that we would be looking to fight back to a global consolidated breakeven after the market launch in Q4.","Ellie Mertz","How are you funding the entry and expansion into each country? And how many additional countries planned for this year and next?","Reed Hastings","Well fundamentally, we're funding it with the domestic profit stream. So our domestic business is showing great new growth in both revenue and contribution margin. And so we're using those profits to fund the international expansion, and it's needed by that by our view of staying approximately breakeven on a global basis.","Ellie Mertz","Has your view of international competition changed in recent months?","Reed Hastings","No, not particularly. We anticipated that in markets that we don't get to for a few years, there will be stronger local competition than in markets we get to soon. So I think that's probably pretty obvious. That's really the only aspect of it.","Ellie Mertz","Do you expect to see any different seasonal patterns in international markets? I know they're not showed today because of the high-growth phase you're in. But I would still like to know if there are any quarters with tailwinds or headwinds?","Reed Hastings","Well, from a diversification standpoint, if we were as big in the southern hemisphere as northern, they would balance each other. So it's definitely linked to the length of the winter, length of the night. And it would be -- and is reverse seasonality from the northern hemisphere and the southern. But on a practical basis, with the U.S. just under 90% of the business, it's the dominant aspect of the U.S. seasonality.","David Wells","And I would say that the pronounced weather pattern is one aspect of it. But as we contemplate other markets, we look at the seasonal TV viewing behavior, the seasonal rental behavior on video-on-demand and things like that. I mean some of these countries are tropical. They don't have a pronounced winter or summer, and they may follow the same pattern in terms of the northern hemisphere, but it's early to tell.","Ellie Mertz","While the sub trajectory in the U.K. appears far better than in Latin America initially, can you give us a sense of what usage looks like? How much time are U.K. subscribers spending with the service?","Reed Hastings","Usage has been very strong. I don't want to give, for competitive reasons, specific numbers. But we've been very pleased with the active usage and growing usage as we add more and more content and continue to flush out the devices in particular to getting on the Smart TVs.","Ellie Mertz","Moving to some questions on DVD. Why are you so confident that the DVD will not fall off as fast going forward as it is in the past couple of quarters? Even if churn is going down, is it not getting hard to find new gross additions for DVD films?","David Wells","We're confident because the retention of those subscribers are -- is improving from Q4 to Q1, and we may see some seasonality around Q2. But in general, the number of subscribers we're losing on the hybrid side are not the step change that we experienced from Q4 to Q1, largely because people were deciding whether or not they wanted to pay $16 for a hybrid service when we made the changes in July and they sort of rationalize those decisions over Q3 and Q4. So increasingly, fewer and fewer people are having to make that decision or have already made that decision about whether it's a value to them to pay $16 for the service, and that's what drives largely the sort of decreasing rate of decline.","Ellie Mertz","With the Qwikster episode fresh in mind, but also considering the high overall cost of DVD shipping, would you consider spinning off or selling the DVD division? The cash could be put towards faster overseas expansion, maybe the DVD and streaming services could still be tightly coupled with the right contracts in place?","Reed Hastings","No, we're not thinking of that.","Ellie Mertz","Moving to some miscellaneous questions. Are the terms of your Apple TV deals, the new member sign-ups, similar to the 30% revenue Apple has with other content providers?","Reed Hastings","Those type of contracts we're prevented from commenting by confidentiality, so we can't say.","Ellie Mertz","In late November, you announced the closing of $200 million worth of convertible notes, and those could be converted after 6 months assuming certain conditions were met. The 6th month anniversary will end during the second quarter. Given that the shares appeared to be above the conversion price, do you expect these shares to be converted? And if so, when? ","Yes, so the first convertible, 6 months after its issuance which was November, which places us in May, the company has the option of converting those shares at 30% over the conversion price, which is about $11. And the earliest we could do...","Reed Hastings","$111.","Ellie Mertz","$111. Thank you. The earliest we could do that would be July if the stocks had stayed above that price for 50 of the prior 65 trading days. ","What should we assume for forward tax assumptions?","David Wells","Around 38%.","Ellie Mertz","And higher in Q2?","David Wells","Correct, sorry. It'll play a little bit as we...","Reed Hastings","We should be so lucky to be paying taxes.","David Wells","I was just about to say that, that rate moves around a little as we come from a loss into a profit perspective at around 38%.","Ellie Mertz","Great. That's all we have right now for email questions. So at this time, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator and we'll begin taking live call-in questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first questioner in queue is Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.","Jason S. Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I'll ask 2 questions and I'm not sure what was hit. With respect to what you talked about with Apple TV now taking sign ups from the TV, should we assume that you're paying similar 30% revenue share with Apple and that's kind of taking into account when you think about adding customers that way? And then my second question, you kind of had a positive take on the social integration, the U.K. and Ireland, but didn't give any specific metric. I'm wondering if there's any other type of metrics you can give out for us and maybe what percent of users are uptaking the social functions?","Reed Hastings","Jason, it's Reed. We did just answer the Apple question, which was no comment. And then on the U.K. Facebook success we've had, we haven't characterized any specific metrics, and for competitive reasons, we're not further elaborating.","Jason S. Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then maybe one other follow-up. That functionality offering in the U.K., is that more a passive functionality? So does it seem like a Spotify or is an active sharing functionality with users prompted each time to decide whether or not they want to share their viewing habits?","Reed Hastings","It's passive in the way that you used that word like Spotify U.S. if you're using that where your viewing history is optionally shared with your friends.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Mark Mahaney with Citi.","Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two questions. I think, Reed, last fall in reaction to some of the controversy, I think you made a statement that you think it might take a while for the brand and the relations and the trust with consumers to build back up. When you think about your DVD, streaming net adds goal of 7 million for the year, what you've done year-to-date, do you think you've already overcome some of those concerns that backlash from the fall of last year? Or do you think that that's still a subdued growth number that you could do better once you've regained the full trust of consumers? And then could you just quickly talk about usage on tablet devices and if that's had a material impact on those overall viewing minutes?","Reed Hastings","The brand recovery is partway complete. We had said it would probably take 3 years with the bulk of the recovery in the first year. That still seems to us to be the correct model. So we're feeling good about the progress we've made. We do -- we are conscious that it's tender and that we have to be extremely diligent and thoughtful in the way that we act as we build back our brand reputation. And then in terms of tablet, it's a great and growing viewing source for us, but we haven't characterized with any specifics any of the particular devices, again, for competitive reasons. We are on both Android and iPad.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Richard Greenfield with BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","With consumers using Netflix so much, I think the numbers you broke out essentially equate to over an hour per day actually now. Shouldn't churn be going down meaningfully? When you made that comment about in 2012, if you added 7 million subs assuming flattish churn, why shouldn't we see churn go significantly down now that usage per customer per month or even per day just continues to scale upwards? And if just as a follow-up to that, can you just give us some sense on where subscribers canceling now, what is the main reason people are canceling the streaming-only service?","Reed Hastings","So Rich, the average consumer is watching, as you said, nearly an hour a day, and then they're not canceling. So the cancelations is amongst the people who aren't watching much. So our job is to get those light users that are not very active to be watching more. And the other phenomena is as the service gets better known and more popular, that expands the circle of people who join it, who maybe aren't as much in entertainment as the initial 20 million or 25 million. And so it's natural that as the service expands its reach, that there is continued churn as people try it, figure out if it's for them right now and if not, they get off. So that's where that phenomena is from.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Does that imply that the median is dramatically above the mean in terms of usage?","Reed Hastings","No. It's just that it's -- it's not exactly a bell curve because it's got the skew on the big end. But it's the median is not wildly different. It's just that there will be 20% of people that don't watch much, and most of the churn will come from them. And you asked the question, when people quit, what do they cite? And the 2 big ones are not watching enough and don't have any money, which we see also.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","And when you say not watching enough, is that just because the programming, they can't find something they like? Or there just isn't enough content in total?","Reed Hastings","It's a mix of those. If you think about the moments of truth for a member, at any point in time, they can watch Netflix or they can watch cable or they can watch their DVR, they can watch a DVD or they can watch Hulu. And we have to win enough of those moments of truth to keep the subscriber active. And one of the ways we win is that a really broad selection, personalization, ease-of-use and otherwise it's just a habit, like being able to see the red Netflix button on the remote control.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Reed, you just mentioned that one of the big reasons for churn is people not having any money. So I wonder if you would consider that if extreme picks, for example, of $4.99 and let's say Amazon comes out with a carve-out prime streaming service at something lower than $7.99, have you thought about or would you consider adjusting your price point? And then the second question would be, I think Mark asked about usage on tablets. And I would just ask, has the subscriber acquisition channel changed with the explosion in mobile? Is that something that you can comment on in terms of where you're getting gross add connects from? That would be great as well.","Reed Hastings","We're feeling great about our $8 dollar price because we can then get lots and lots of content for our subscribers, so no anticipated changes there. And then in terms of subscriber acquisition, mobile is a good source for us. Video is disproportionately watched on television. So things that are TV-based sign-up, like on the game consoles, like Apple TV are really the brand center and the biggest drivers of potential opportunities.","David Wells","Anthony, this is David. That hasn't changed, right. That's consistent with what we've said in prior quarters, and that's not a big acquisition driver. It's a big value driver for our subscribers.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of what, just purely on a relative basis, if you see any difference in the levels of churn between your users that are engaging you through multiple devices like connected television sets, tablets, handsets versus your more PC or kind of game console customers?","Reed Hastings","Yes. It's exactly is your intuition is probably leading you, which is if you use Netflix on lots of devices and if you use it for lots of time, you're more engaged with the service and you are less likely to churn. So that's definitely an indicator.","David Wells","Heath, this is David. Teasing out people who don't use it a lot but have a lot of connected devices, that's probably not a common case. So people who use a lot of devices tend to watch a lot of hours.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about the deleverage in the DVD business. I mean is that just purely about the declining sub numbers, or is there anything else we should be thinking about here? And how are you thinking about distribution centers going forward? And any other costs you may be able to take out of the business along the way?","David Wells","This is David. I'll take that one. I would say that in general in the DVD business, the big driver is the rate of subscriber decline. There's some other smaller things out there like postage rates and the fact that we would expect an annual postal increase going forward, which we have in the past. I would say the other aspects are there's some minor things on just as you reduce shipments, you lose some scale advantages, but those are small relative to the subscriber decline. And that's why we put in the letter that we would expect that the margin would stay relatively flat through 2012.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is John Blackledge with Credit Suisse.","John R. Blackledge - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions. The first one is, do you feel like the 7 million net domestic streaming add guide is a comfortable target? And did you guys consider maybe giving a range for the year similar to the range that you gave on a quarterly basis? That's one. And then the second one is, what's the demand for personalized accounts domestically, and is that something we may see introduced at some point?","Reed Hastings","John, yes, we're feeling comfortable on the 7 million, and you could put a range on it if you want, but it doesn't really change the goal. So we were just being straightforward about what our goal is. And in terms of the personalized accounts, that's something that we're developing a number of versions of. We'll be doing some consumer testing with different versions of that going forward. But there's unlikely to be any revenue associated with that, and that is we're most focused on how do we improve the experience and we'll see that in retention and acquisition at this point.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.","Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to ask the 7 million sub question a different way. When you go back to 2010 when you added the 7 million subs you had 2 things, the bundled product at $9.99 and pretty significant distribution tailwind because of mostly the game consoles that were coming online and just starting to benefit the business. So when you look at that 7 million number for '12, what are you thinking are the comparable catalysts that give you the comfort to get to that type of sub numbers for the year?","Reed Hastings","Scott, I would say it's mostly based on how we did in Q1 and then which helps us feel good about being on track for that 7 million. And then secondarily, in terms of the macro climate, it's the increased integration with Smart TVs. So if you go into a Best Buy today, we've got a stronger presence than we've ever had in the integration with both Smart TVs and Blu-ray.","Operator","Next questioner in queue is Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","One quick one and then one broader. To understand the net income view for the balance of the year, when you talked about global breakeven with the fourth quarter launch of an international market, is that breakeven for the fourth quarter or breakeven for the year?","Reed Hastings","You can think about it as breakeven on some rolling basis or approximately breakeven on some rolling basis, or it's -- we'll go under and then come up and go under and then come up. But ordinarily and when I made that comment, it was on the quarter.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you're not saying breakeven for the year. You're not really saying anything about the year, I guess, at this point?","Reed Hastings","That's correct.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I was also wondering, the surge in streaming usage, you guys ever have had your -- a very significant share of prime time hours streaming content. Are you seeing any noticeable deterioration in quality of service to consumers? There are cable companies that warned about brownouts in hours as you see video surge. There's another streaming services coming up. Do you see any negative performance to the quality of your service, or do you anticipate anything as your usage ramps as others ramp?","Reed Hastings","Barton, the technology underlying the Internet and fiber optics is absolutely mind blowing. So you can take our peak viewing on a Saturday night, 100% of our global viewing, and it can still fit into a single fiber optic. So I don't anticipate any brownouts. I anticipate continued growth of the broadband power being released as more and more become -- we become a fiber optic nation and a fiber optic world.","David Wells","I would add to that, Barton, that you're starting to see the ISPs compete on speed. It's in their ad -- prominently featured in their advertising. So it would feel a little inconsistent to be trying to advertise and compete on speed at the same time warning your consumers that you're going to face shortages of the product.","Ellie Mertz","Great. That's all the time we have for questions today. I'm going to turn it back over to Reed Hastings for some closing remarks.","Reed Hastings","Well thanks, everyone. As I've said in the beginning, we had a great Q1. We were thrilled by it in terms of our U.K. launch, in terms of our growth around the world, in terms of getting to great viewing records in Q1, and we're on track for breaking those records in Q2 on a year-over-year basis, so we're excited about that. The odd thing about our numbers, I realized, is that with stable seasonality in gross adds, we see increased seasonality in net adds, and that is this mathematical artifact that we try to document. I know it's got some people concerned, but we feel great about our progress and being on track for our 7 million net adds for the year. ","With that, I want to thank everyone for being on the call and look forward to catching up with you.","Operator","Thank you. Again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference may be recorded.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellie Mertz, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellie Mertz","","Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to the Netflix Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Q&A Session. I\u2019m joined here by Reed Hastings, CEO and David Wells, CFO. We announced our financial results for the fourth quarter at approximately 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. The shareholder letter and the Q4 financial results and the webcast of this Q&A session are all available at the Company\u2019s Investor Relations website at ir.netflix.com.","As is our standard practice, we will begin the call with questions received via e-mail. Please e-mail your questions to ir@netflix.com. After e-mail Q&A, we will also open up the phone lines for additional questions not covered by the e-mail Q&A or the investor letter. The dial-in number is in our investor letter, but let me repeat it now. Please call 760-666-3613 if you would like to get in the queue. We may make forward-looking statements during this call regarding the Company\u2019s future performance.","Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to risks and uncertainties related to the business. A detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission on February 10, 2012. A rebroadcast of this Q&A session will be available at the Netflix website after 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.","Now, let\u2019s move directly to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Ellie Mertz","As is our standard practice, we\u2019ve organized the questions by topics as we\u2019ve received them this afternoon via e-mail. First topic, questions on the domestic streaming. To what extent would you attribute the growth in subscribers to mobile, particularly tablet adoption? How much of usage is over mobile devices, same question for connected television.","Reed Hastings","Both the rise of tablets and phones and the rise of smart TVs are very helpful to us and they are really the beginning of a trend around Internet-connected ecosystems with devices. And certainly, the more convenient those devices get, the more people will be comfortable watching and enjoying content on a wide range of devices, someday including Google glasses, Internet watches all kinds of scenarios over the next five years and as well as a multi-screen scenarios where you use your tablets or phone to choose content on your TV. So, what we will see over the next couple of years, and we saw in this fall also was more and more consumer adoption of Internet-connected streamings which on both tablets and smart TVs.","Ellie Mertz","What is the percentage likelihood that you increase the price of your streaming plan over the next 12 months or even over the next 24 months?","Reed Hastings","We are happy with $7.99 and not speculating on the future.","Ellie Mertz","You\u2019ve talked about improvements in both voluntary and involuntary retentions. can you give us some color on where churn levels are relative to historical numbers? Are you back to pre-fall 2011 levels?","Reed Hastings","That is a really different business when it includes DVDs. Some, I\u2019m not going to focus on that comparative reference, but what we are doing is seeing nice improvements, and again relative over this last year when we\u2019ve been on the straight streaming side. And we\u2019ll continue to look at that. The fundamental though is not to focus or we don\u2019t focus on churn, because we really want to make it easy to quit. I know that sounds strange, but we spend a lot of time so that if you leave, you\u2019ll have a really good experience, and that makes you much more likely to come back in. And we think that\u2019s the right way to build a long-term growth in paid ads but it does result in easy access.","David Wells","And I would say that regionally it continues to be a very strong channel for acquisition and that continues to be the case. We\u2019ve seen that in Q3, Q4, all the way through the quarter, and as a function of that, people flowing in and out of the service, and because we make it easy, they don\u2019t feel trapped by a contract and it\u2019s really easy for them to come back into the service when their lifestyle warrants signing up again.","Ellie Mertz","How much confidence do you usually have at this point, going into Q1 relative to other quarters, given all of the sub-ads that come in early January from holiday devices?","Reed Hastings","It\u2019s marginally better than other quarters in terms of percentage of the quarter\u2019s numbers that have come in by the 20-F, but it is not hugely material.","Ellie Mertz","And then moving to questions about content, first, question is on the Disney deal. You made a bold and expensive move with your output deal with Disney. Presumably, the magnitude of the Disney deal will result in your devoting less content dollar repurchase elsewhere, even accounting for subscriber growth. What types of content are likely to be sacrificed as a result?","Reed Hastings","Well, the way pay one deals work is you pay for some and so the flow in 2016 as it hit in the second half of 2016 are relatively small in total payments, and you don\u2019t really get a full load of the payment until 2018. So it\u2019s a long way off, we\u2019ve got a lot of content to look at between now and then, in terms of what generates the most viewing and satisfaction and a lot of flexibility to build the best service that we can by that point.","Ellie Mertz","What changed the attractiveness of the Disney content, which last year only accounted for 2% of your streaming hours, was it fully the ability to be exclusive? Was it the Lucasfilm acquisition?","Reed Hastings","It is pretty amazing that the Disney content, but it was on our service from Starz was only 2%, and it just shows you how much incredible great content that we have that content as good as the Disney content could only be 2%. And going forward, in addition to the straight Disney content where the Disney Marvel content and the Lucasfilm. So it will be bigger than it would have otherwise. But the rest of our content is growing. The big thing what we\u2019re excited about is the Disney content, once it eventually flows in it is fully exclusive to Netflix. and as we\u2019ve been talking about, we\u2019re more and more interested in exclusive content until it hits that point of differentiation that we\u2019ve articulated before as part of our content strategy. And that exclusivity allows us to have a differentiation in the long-term.","Ellie Mertz","How are the terms and conditions of exclusive pay one deals such as the recent Disney deal similar to or different from typical content deals?","David Wells","We don\u2019t typically discuss the terms on individual deals, I would say that, deals like the Disney deal and other output style deals tend to be more cash intensive upfront, but other than that are not remarkable anywhere.","Reed Hastings","And pay per film based upon the box-office performance.","Ellie Mertz","Are there any material holes in your content library? So in terms of studios and categories, do you feel you need to have?","Reed Hastings","","I would say, not more than holes. There is vast amounts of additional contents that we want to acquire as we grow and the virtual cycle for us is to gain more subscribers and get more content, gain more subscribers, get more content and what propels our growth is that continuing content. There\u2019s no specific holes that as we\u2019d like to get more movies, we\u2019d like to get more privacy\u2019s in television. We\u2019d like to have more originals. And in general, as we grow, we\u2019ll be able to deliver on that more and more for consumers.","Ellie Mertz","Netflix described its library in terms of free groupings, movies, serialized TV and proprietary contents. The first two buckets are extremely large compared to proprietary contents. Should we expect a large proprietary content that launches in the future? Does your hierarchy suggest that despite being small, the proprietary content\u2019s value is on par with movies and serialized TV?","Reed Hastings","Well, it\u2019s early for us on the proprietary original content. You will know a lot more, maybe on the July call after we\u2019ve launched House of Cards and after we\u2019ve launched Arrested. So we\u2019ll be able to comment a little more and at that point may make decisions about how much we want to invest in it, do we want to increase the investment, keep it about the same to last and we have a lot more knowledge. So, we\u2019ll take our time and towards the next six months just focus on the current originals.","David Wells","And I\u2019d say the bar on that, we said before this before, but which was articulating again, the bar on the originals in fact, it performs in similar to other third-party licensed content that is exclusive. If the originals are exclusive for us than they are, we would look to do that better inside, if we can\u2019t and we wouldn\u2019t pursue that. There is the brand halo effects and the PR effects that we get from it and those are very, very interactive. but that comes from the exclusivity as well.","Ellie Mertz","These are more questions on originals. this year you will have four new original series on Netflix plus Lilyhammer. What are your plans for 2014? Presumably, we have some idea now, given the long lead times on original programs. What percent of content cost do you envision for original programing next year?","Reed Hastings","Again, we have made the decisions for next year in terms of what percent of budget will be original content. We\u2019re going to look at the results, look at the viewing and overall press attention, subscriber acquisition trends all of the factors before making those decisions.","Ellie Mertz","Have you planned to market House of Cards? What is your approach to marketing the show different from how traditional cable networks market their shows? Do you envision creating a section for highlight original programing within the Netflix service over time?","Reed Hastings","The huge benefit is that we don\u2019t have to advertise 8 p.m. on the Thursday night tune in. We get to let people know about the show and they can watch it anytime at their leisure. And so that let\u2019s just be much more efficient in our marketing and much, much focused on a specific date and time.","Mostly, we\u2019re going to be able to generate tremendous demand through our service by targeting the specific online ads on the service, the content for the people who will be relevant for. so we get tremendous viewing from our 33 million global members. Then in addition, we\u2019re also generating a lot of attention in certain cities doing a highly concentrated, large scale promotion to be able to see what the effects of ours to stimulate the creative community awareness and generally build a lot of buzz around those shows. So we\u2019re very much looking forward to that launch.","Ellie Mertz","","For a few of Netflix\u2019s upcoming original programs, can you discuss the specific rights Netflix owns and the monetization strategies of the other right holders, which monetization channels, if any, does Netflix view as most complementary to its streaming business over time?","Reed Hastings","","Well, I think that\u2019s something we\u2019ve learned over time. If you look at HBO, they experimented and have had great success with DVD as a channel for their content. They did some syndication, but then they pulled back on some of that. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll try some of the same things and trying to see what makes sense. The current originals mostly where our first window licenser and for example, on House of Cards, Media Rights Capital owns the other rights and will be monetizing those downstream from us. So we\u2019ll try different structures as we go forward, but primarily a focus on monetization on our platform.","","Ellie Mertz","You said that Arrested Development could bump subscriber growth in Q2. can you point to any data that supports this view? Expressions of interest by network subscribers, surveys that point to interest or anything like that? How would you compare interest in Arrested Development to interest in other originals queued up this year, like House of Cards and Hemlock Grove.","Reed Hastings","Well, it\u2019s a great question. In the case of Hemlock Grove, it\u2019s a new property like House of Cards, and the same with Orange is the New Black. So that will take sometime to develop for those shows. Arrested is unique, because it\u2019s already got a big brand, and so it\u2019s good to be more front-loaded in its overall viewing and attention.","In terms of high data, it\u2019s very hard to predict what will happen in terms of membership in Q2. So I think what we\u2019ll do is, we\u2019ll be cautious, and it\u2019s not particularly built into our forecast. And then we will see what happens in Q2. And then from that basis, we\u2019ll have \u2013 be able to project going forward.","Ellie Mertz","A question on accounting for originals. Over what period of time are you amortizing the upfront cash spend on important originals this year, particularly Arrested Development and House of Cards?","Reed Hastings","","Well the accounting for originals is similar to or is consistently the accounting for our whole library, which means we amortize in straight line over the license period. I would say, the question was asked about amortizing the cash. It\u2019s not the cash that gets amortized; it\u2019s the extent of that full title. And so when we have quarters like Q4 and you talked about Q1 being intensive for originals, we\u2019ll pay depending on the terms of the deal, heavy upfront payments, even upwards of 50% and then that content will come into window later in the year. So you\u2019ll see the cash come out in terms of the cash flow, but there\u2019s no offsetting expense. Some of that flows into prepaid content as you see and you\u2019ll see that cash be less as we go through the year and the expense starts to catch up.","Ellie Mertz","As you look at original Netflix content, what are your expectations or how it will perform in the U.S. and International market?","Reed Hastings","Very strong.","Ellie Mertz","How do you decide which original programming to invest in and stream? Do you look to reach certain segments of your sub-base or best available programming or other factors?","Reed Hastings","Well, again, we\u2019re at a very early stages, I think Ted\u2019s done a \u2013 Ted Sarandos has done a great job on different types of content; Hemlock Grove and House of Cards are quite different. I think you\u2019ll be very pleased with Orange is the New Black. So, and of course, that\u2019s the development of U.S., a huge winner. So I think it\u2019s just too early for us to have any great confidence. We\u2019re staying flexible, learning and we\u2019ll grow into original program step-by-step.","Ellie Mertz","A few questions on competition. Do consumers need to choose between Netflix and Amazon? In the past, you\u2019ve referred to HBO and Netflix along the lines of baseball and football. Do you feel that way about Amazon too? As Netflix and Amazon both have exclusive content and original content, will it make sense for consumers to have both rather than choose between them? Do you think the two services will take on different identities and be the two leading digital cable networks in the future?","Reed Hastings","Well, some of this is already happened in the UK, where LOVEFiLM, Sky, TV NOW and Netflix has nearly no overlapping content. And as the press tone is shifting in ways to be getting both, they\u2019re getting three, as there are different channels, basically to surveys someone totally. of course, not everybody has infinite budgets ready, but his budget is tight as real competition for choosing us, if you need to choose. But I do think that many people will choose to get multiple services like we compete with HBO, that is we\u2019ll all have different shows and I will be competing for dollars and attention. But not have the same content.","Ellie Mertz","Can you help us understand the methodology behind the top 200 title comparative analysis? Do you use ratings, actual viewings et cetera?","Reed Hastings","We used actual viewing hours and again, in Q4 on our Netflix service in U.S., those would be for each title in there, not just a season, but a title of an entire show, how many hours that was viewed basically during Q4 and that\u2019s the methodology behind that?","Ellie Mertz","Moving to questions on international. on previous calls, Reed has stated his intentions to continue to re-invest in international expansions or once to get back to profitability. Can you update us on your current thinking on this topic?","David Wells","I can reiterate what we said last quarter, which was these two gating items or grating conditions, one is global profitability, which we\u2019re really pleased that we continue to demonstrate even with the modest launch in Q4, and the second condition being that we\u2019re pleased with the path of our existing investments. So those two conditions still hold.","Ellie Mertz","Two quarters ago, Reed spoke about raising the content spending in the UK. Give a sense where the extended offerings in the UK have impacted subscriber growth or churn in any meaningful way?","Reed Hastings","Yeah, absolutely. We\u2019ve continued right from inception. And frankly, in all of our territories in Canada, Latin America and the different nations in Europe to expand the content and expanding the content has definitely increased viewing, decreased this churn, made this better. So we\u2019re very eager and ambitious to get more and more content on all of the services including the UK.","Ellie Mertz","Has the competitive environment in the UK evolved over time? In the UK, are you seeing different levels of net ad, churns et cetera given potentially more competitive environment?","Reed Hastings","The only change in the UK, and welcomes in there from our launch at the same prices have always been at, has been Sky\u2019s and TV Now, which launched in the fall. So that\u2019s increased. There is active marketing going on between us. As far as we can tell, both services are doing well also. It comes back to us; it may not end up as some game, we want to get the biggest piece of the pie. But it may be that people subscribe to multiple services.","Ellie Mertz","Can you tell us if the procurement changes made in Latin America had a material impact on sub-growth in Q4 or what\u2019s held for Q1 number?","Reed Hastings","I helped on a little bit in Q4, we\u2019ll help a little bit more in Q1 and we\u2019ve still got projects to go.","David Wells","That was an incremental improvement.","Ellie Mertz","What penetration of sublevels that you need in any given country in the Europe or Latin America to reach break-even, roughly what is the time to achieving that now?","Reed Hastings","","It will depend by markets and in some markets, you\u2019ll get that relatively quickly, others will take longer. And there\u2019s no precise level of penetration. It depends, for example, in Latin America, we\u2019ll end up at break-even at lower overall household penetrations, because the Internet is at lower penetrations. So I would say each market is unique in this way.","Ellie Mertz","In the past, you\u2019ve said you believe Netflix can grow its domestic sub-base 2x to 3x out of HBO long-term. what are your expectations in the various international markets that you have entered?","Reed Hastings","So, let\u2019s see our hopes would be that we should get to similar house Internet or broadband household penetration levels as we can in the U.S., but until we actually prove that that\u2019s possible, we\u2019re a little cautious on forecasting it. So in principal, when we look at Internet usage or YouTube usage or television, pay television and free television. It\u2019s pretty ubiquitous across all these societies. so the notion that over 10 or 20 years, Internet TV is that strong around the world as it is in the U.S., it\u2019s pretty sound.","Ellie Mertz","Can you achieve long-term international contribution margins equivalent to U.S. without the same amount of scale in the single-digit?","Reed Hastings","Yeah, I think we would need the same amount of \u2013 the contribution margin is a factor of the scale. so I think we would need to get to that at scale. It\u2019s fairly competition, I mean I would just add, add-in competition. So those two things are the primary determinants of long-term margin.","Ellie Mertz","You expect more modest quarter-over-quarter improvements in international losses beyond Q1? is that because of lower sub-ad expectation or an increase in spending relative to sub-growth?","Reed Hastings","A little bit of both.","Ellie Mertz","And a question on the DVD business; you appear to be marketing DVD subscriptions to streaming only subscribers again. But now we see more e-mail promotions, offering a free month trial to the DVD program. You really want to push people back to DVDs? Isn\u2019t that a bit confusing to consumers, given your intense focus on streaming being the future of media consumption?","David Wells","I would say, this is David here. I would say it was a program that we did around the holidays and into January. I think you\u2019ll see us view this sporadically, I wouldn\u2019t describe it as a large program. It was incrementally positive to our DVD subscription. And we gave a lot of credit to them, 12 to 18 months ago that we weren\u2019t doing enough, in terms of monetizing some of the sales search opportunities on the DVD, on the website and so forth. And I think we\u2019ve cleaned a lot of that up, and e-mail programming campaign that you\u2019re talking about is an evidence of doing a little bit. We test a lot of this, and usually when we do something, it\u2019s going to be an incrementally positive.","Ellie Mertz","So a question on Open Connect. could Super HD and 3D streaming periodically be expanded to ISPs without Open Connect, without significant engineering investment? Ask another way, is Open Connect a prerequisite for technical reasons or more for strategic reasons?","Reed Hastings","It\u2019s a mix of both. I think when companies deal with new features like Super HD, they focus on newer platforms whether that\u2019s Siri only available on iPhone 5, say or something like that. It both get people to adopt to new platform and allows you from an engineering side to concentrate on a simpler use case and being able to support on Super HD and 3D is demanding. And Open Connect is free to our ISPs. And so we don\u2019t anticipate much of a problem. and I think what we find is by doing that we can be more efficient not going through middlemen?","","Ellie Mertz","A question on change in delivery cost. Did Open Connect drive delivery cost down in Q1, or should it in Q4 or is it better pricing from suppliers?","Reed Hastings","The delivery cost, I\u2019m not sure you can believe into that as a result. I would say that our Open Connect program has investments that are front-loaded. So to the extent that we\u2019re rolling out our Open Connect program, there\u2019s a little bit of expenses that are loaded into Q4 and into 2013, depending upon the pace of our rollout and that those flow should moderate going forward. I think the question is in reference to letter, we said that our U.S. contribution marginally better, because of just some delayed expenses that will show up and relative to planning in Q1 and Q4.","David Wells","Thank you the clarification. Yeah, some timing allowance expenses for Q4.","Reed Hastings","In general, delivery is something that\u2019s relatively small percentage of our total cost, it works quite well. So it\u2019s relatively inconsequential.","Ellie Mertz","A question on the social fit. Please discuss Netflix\u2019s experience with social media integration in international market? could you provide some common examples of how Netflix uses social media in international markets? how do you expect social integration to impact your U.S. business?","Reed Hastings","It will be a nice thing for us. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be huge. It hasn\u2019t been huge for us internationally. It\u2019s certainly segmented. There\u2019s a section of the group within each country that loves social and they are really into on Netflix and probably, every other sites that they use. and then there\u2019s a lot of people for whom that\u2019s not why they\u2019re there, Netflix in terms of a social aspect. And of course, over time, those ratios will shift. But for now, all of our social work really caters to a little specific, typically younger, but very social centric demographic. So it\u2019s a good investment. It\u2019s making good progress. We\u2019re thankful the DPPA passed the change to it and we\u2019ll continue to make progress on this front.","Ellie Mertz","Some questions on the financials. how should we be thinking about 2013 in terms of profitability and margins, similar to 2012 as a heavy investment year or here we\u2019ll start seeing leverage in the models; if so, how much?","Reed Hastings","Well, we should see leverage in the model. we haven\u2019t made decisions in the back half of the year on international expansions. Obviously, that will matter as well.","David Wells","And we probably have 7 million reasons not to give full-year guidance right here. So we\u2019ll avoid doing that this year.","Ellie Mertz","We might also make a point that we thought, considering the leveraging in the model in 2012, $106 million segment where we saw 700 basis points of margin expansion.","Reed Hastings","Yeah. we can be confident that it won\u2019t be as big as that.","Ellie Mertz","As profits overall are somewhat exceeding guidance, do you think you might increase investments in marketing, content and your additional country rollouts in the near to medium term?","Reed Hastings","No. That\u2019s not directly affecting us. As we outlined in the letter, we\u2019re feeling good about those plans.","Ellie Mertz","You talked about the goal of 100 basis points of contribution margin expansion sequentially in domestic streaming, but you don\u2019t indicate how far out that goal extends. Can you talk about what you\u2019re thinking is related to long-term i.e., multiple years out, domestic streaming contribution margins?","Reed Hastings","It will be a function of competition and how much of the market, the total addressable market that we can collect. So right now, we\u2019re focused on the target of expanding that routinely by growing faster basically in our content, but expanding our content expense.","Ellie Mertz","So this is the size of the off balance sheet content liabilities.","Reed Hastings","So I think the question usually I get on is related to the contractual obligation table. The streaming obligations were $5 billion as of $930 million as of the end of Q3. That corresponds to a $5.6 billion number as of the end of 12\/31. $2.5 billion is added on the balance sheet to $3.1 billion that\u2019s not on the balance sheet.","Ellie Mertz","Do you expect to be free cash flow positive for the full year?","Reed Hastings","We don\u2019t provide full-year guidance on that.","David Wells","Can you give a sense of how much money you plan to raise in the debt offerings? Did you consider you being soft, with the potential new debt financing be straight debt or could it be convertible debt. When would it occur?","Reed Hastings","The no on stock, no on covert, I think the plans that we put in there are still sort of an opportunity in exploration base. It\u2019s really based on the 20 plus year low that we see in the debt market. It\u2019s a good time to lock in very low-cost long-term capital. So we\u2019d be remiss not looking at that opportunity.","David Wells","Will additional financing be needed if you decide to open new international markets in like 2013 or early 2014?","Reed Hastings","No.","Ellie Mertz","The marketing cost in the Netflix streaming has fallen 24% year-over-year. Yet, you\u2019ve been able to grow your top line significantly. How sustainable is your Q4 marketing spends and how do you think you\u2019re gaining efficiencies in marketing?","David Wells","Very sustainable on the Q4 marketing spend and the second part of that, late efficiency; the late efficiency comes because most marketing is on members telling their friends about Netflix. It\u2019s not the ads that we pay for. And as we have more and more members and as they are happier and happier with the service, the net benefits to growth and then don\u2019t need as much paid marketing.","Reed Hastings","I would say also \u2013 but in the letter about if we\u2019re expanding our content expense and that has benefits in terms of getting people excited about the sign of retaining better, all of that is a quasi marketing expenditure. So the rest are developmental marketing expense or content expense.","Ellie Mertz","Will the company break out cost of subscriptions versus fulfillment expenses for the quarter?","Reed Hastings","Not likely. Fulfillment has grown to be a pretty relatively small portion of our cost of revenues as our DVD business continues to scale down with small portion of content revenue.","Ellie Mertz","","Great, that\u2019s the end of our e-mail questions. Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to the operator to take live calling questions.","Operator","Yes, ma\u2019am. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please go ahead, your line is now open.","Mark S. Mahaney \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hey, great thanks and congrats on the quarter, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve said that on an earnings call in five years. Reed, I know you don\u2019t run the business near term, but congrats on the quarter anyway. In terms of rebuilding the brand, Reed you talked a year ago, year and a half ago and said, this will be a multiyear process in terms of rebuilding the brand. As you think about and survey your customer base now, do you think you\u2019ve rebuilt the brand hit that you \u2013 do you think you\u2019ve recovered that brand hit that you took in the wake of the controversies?","Reed Hastings","No, not entirely Mark, there\u2019s still an echo in the grove. And so we still are extremely thoughtful and careful about what we\u2019re trying to do because it wouldn\u2019t take much to have the issue flare up again or for us to lose track. So you might say we\u2019re on probation at this point. So we\u2019re out of jail. But we\u2019ve still got, as we had initially talked about a two years timeframe, we still got a year-and-half of probation.","Mark S. Mahaney \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And then one follow-up question, in terms of the content requirements or likes, the wants of your subscriber base, have you seen a noticeable change in the satisfaction level of your subscribers with current content or do you still see \u2013 there's always been a gap, but do you think that that gap has kind of narrowed a little bit over the course of the last three to six months?","","Reed Hastings","","Yeah, that would be mostly what drives the improvement in voluntary retention. It\u2019s that satisfaction with the content, in addition the satisfaction for the user experience, how quickly and easy it is to chose, how well the personalization works, how well the streaming works. So, that all comes together and gives them the satisfaction.","David Wells","And Mark, I would say that the other contributor to that is people two to three years ago, when they first experienced a streaming offering had expectations of a DVD full content library. I would say those people are starting to be a little bit more aware of what\u2019s available in an Internet channel and in an Internet network, offering like we have. So the expectations gap might be narrowing as well.","Mark S. Mahaney \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is now open.","Douglas T. Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask about content costs, sort of the outlook for 2013, if you could give us some sense of how you\u2019re thinking about the increase here and perhaps, in relation to what you did from 2011 to 2012. And then just secondly, can you give us more detail on how you improved that involuntary retention? You mentioned processing payments and recovery members better, so if you could give us more color there? Thanks.","David Wells","Yes, Doug. In terms of content cost, we continue to expand our content libraries and we expect that to continue to increase. It\u2019s going to increase slower than revenue. So from that, you can infer that the year-over-year increase for 2013 would be less than the increase that we saw in 2012. And then the second piece of that question was around, how we improved the involuntary retention numbers and that we drew looking at a number of optimization in terms of how we handle folks that go on payment hold.","Douglas T. Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Youssef H. Squali \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you very much. Hi, Reed and David. Just a couple of questions to follow-up. Reed, you spoke about offering more personalization on the sites and if my memory serves me right, I think last time you\u2019ve talked about it, it was several quarters ago. And I think you talked about maybe offering personalization at least of queues by year-end. So one, I wanted to see what the hold up there was and the second, what other ways can you improve personalization on the site? Then I have a follow up.","Reed Hastings","Youssef, we\u2019re still in testing on the features of some Netflix profiles, where you set up an exclusive. I\u2019d say you and your kids, your spouse and then each person gets their own area. And we\u2019re trying to find models that give great benefits to consumers, but are also very simple. And so that\u2019s where we\u2019re involved in a lot of testing and when we get that to a great state, then we\u2019ll roll it out to upfront.","Youssef H. Squali \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Is that still an imminent turn off the launch or has the date on that been announced and put back on hold?","David Wells","It\u2019s not the M&A. We\u2019re still in testing mode. We think we got to do something like that. You don\u2019t want to roll it out and then change it a lot. So you want to do a lot of the tuning in test mode. So sometime over the year, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll want it and so when you find out a model that works really well without testing, but it\u2019s not imminent.","Youssef H. Squali \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay, great. And then just lastly have you integrated with Facebook for more sharing of social personalization? I was wondering if you\u2019d have any interest in participating in Facebook\u2019s Gifts program, which is something, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that they launched lot too long ago and they have other retailers like iTunes et cetera. Is there anything that would preclude you from wanting to participate or being on that program?","Reed Hastings","No there is nothing that would preclude us.","Youssef H. Squali \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Is there interest on your end?","","Reed Hastings","I should know more about it as a Facebook Board member. But it\u2019s very new. And so I\u2019ll take your hint, that it\u2019s a good thing and I\u2019ll go and spend some time on it.","Youssef H. Squali \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay, thanks a lot, congrats.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Scott W. Devitt \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks. Reed, now that the U.S. business has gotten back to this level of strong growth, I was just wondering if you could revisit that U.S. market opportunity, how you're thinking about it, that $60 million to $90 million figure and the points of friction that you're facing from here to grow that U.S. sub-base to a much larger level?","And then secondly for David, in the 1Q guide, I think you noted that you're not specifically attributing any subs to Arrested Development, but is that also the same thing for House of Cards? Is there no specific attribution for House of Cards in 1Q? And are you planning any specific TV spend for either of those two shows? Thanks.","Reed Hastings","Scott, think about it in terms of the content layers. So we\u2019re $27 million domestic now. So the question is do we have good enough content to say, get to $40 million. And then with that incremental content budget, can we improve the content, such that with that incrementally better service, we can get to $50 million. And then similarly, we got more money we can spend on more content.","So that\u2019s one big a growth factor. And second is the overall change to Internet TV. It\u2019s not just us that\u2019s benefitting from this. If you look at Hulu\u2019s numbers over last year, they doubled from 1.5 million to 3 million subscribers. So people around the world are interested in Internet television since you can click, watch, pause, control, choose; it\u2019s just a better paradigm. And so as that tailwind continues to develop, that\u2019s very helpful.","And then finally, it\u2019s what happens in the consumer electronics space. It was only six to seven years ago that the iPhone came out. We\u2019ve had tremendous, right now on iPhone 5. So if you think about 6 or 8 years from now by extension, we\u2019ll be at the iPhone 10 and how incredible will that be for not only viewing video, but maybe controlling video around all of your house and choosing and how immersive and all of that helps Internet video services like our own. So those are three big factors, the content growth as we grow, the general trend towards Internet TV and the consumer electronics ecosystem.","David Wells","And then Scott, on your second set of questions on House of Cards, we think it is going to be a pretty small benefit for Q1. We\u2019ve talked about how \u2013 overall it\u2019s a generally small share of ours, really happy about the quality and the fan fare that we\u2019re getting with the show. And now we think that those would be but overall pretty small benefit we think to subscriber editions. And then TV spend for House of Cards, there will be some media spends likely very little TV, like focus again on sort of influences in big markets.","Reed Hastings","So would it be fair to say David, that its\u2019 a very small impact of House of Cards that\u2019s modeled into our guidance forecast?","David Wells","Yes.","Reed Hastings","And since we have no data to base it on, that\u2019s the conservative and correct approach. But some of us are optimistic that it may in fact be substantial. But we really don\u2019t know and we don\u2019t want to count on it until it happens.","David Wells","I would say that\u2019s fair revenue.","Scott W. Devitt \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tuna Amobi with S&P Capital IQ. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tuna N. Amobi \u2013 Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC","Hi, thank you so much. So again, this question is for David. I\u2019m thinking about how you manage your working capital and swing that are logging from the content licensing payments for regional? I\u2019m just kind of wondering if there is perhaps, a better parameter back in \u201908, kind of reduced the swing of free cash flow, not necessarily quarter to quarter. But as you think about some of the leverage that you might have, for example perhaps deferred revenues and some of their items, I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s the best way to think about that, just kind of managing it to the P&L expense as opposed to something that kind of gives you a little bit more control, granted that the originals are the highest swing factors. Any thoughts on that would be helpful.","Reed Hastings","I think it\u2019s the only \u2013 not quite clear on your question. But if we looked into alternative methods in terms of joint ventures and other vehicles to reduce that cash consumption upfront might be the only available method to assume that. We prefer the simplicity and we may get there sometime down the road. But in terms of the present course, overall the content spend on a regional is a relatively small part. It\u2019s outside in terms of our cash because it\u2019s so lumpy up in the first couple of quarters.","Tuna N. Amobi \u2013 Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC","And just a follow-up on that \u2013 how you think about managing the risk of your original content in terms of showing that you actually collaborate with third-party producers versus showed that you actually own outright? And how does that factor into your calculations of cost per viewing hours in terms of your commitment to either kinds of shows? Thank you.","Reed Hastings","It\u2019s Reed here. The good news is, any one show isn\u2019t an ongoing commitment. So it\u2019s a relatively fixed bound. And it might be that at some point, we produce the show that\u2019s not very good. But what that really means is, we only get a little bit of viewing on it as opposed to a lot of viewing. And when you think about the size of any single original and the size of our total multi-billion dollar per year content budget, it\u2019s not a huge risk.","Tuna N. Amobi \u2013 Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes form the line of John Blackledge with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead, your line is open.","John R. Blackledge \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Two questions, the first on streaming content spend; given the current level of streaming content spend after several years of large step ups; is there a normalized longer term rate of growth or range of growth of that we should be considering or will we potentially see lumpiness on a year-in year-out basis, depended on available content? And then for David, as we think about a potential debt raise, is there a certain level of cash on the balance sheet that you\u2019re comfortable with? Thank you.","Reed Hastings","","In terms of the lumpiness, I presume there will be some quarters where it got a little bit lumpy, where we signed a big deal, but generally any big deal, we would know about several quarters in advance, so we would have that visibility to build in and to let everybody know, and then return to the kind of margin expansion that we\u2019re targeting. And we\u2019re feeling our way along as we grow in the market in creating the service and thus far we\u2019re focused on the 100 basis points a quarter versus some specific operating model, because we want to get the operating model to be better and better and better. And to do that, we have to really feel our way along and make sure that it\u2019s consistent with increasing viewing, and with really good or improving on voluntary retention, I\u2019ll turn it over to David on the cash.","David Wells","","And John, on the cash as long as the cost are low, more cash is better, but I would say this is again as the opportunity presented by the debt market, and the ability to get really low cost long-term capital, and for us to preserve the flexibility, if we feel massive success with original to preserve the flexibility to expand that program, and to develop more down the road. So I don\u2019t think there is a magic number this is about sort of long-term planning for the business.","John R. Blackledge \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","That\u2019s great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Carlos Kirjner \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have two questions; one on content, one on the market potential. First on content, when you lost Starz you said that it accounted for a small portion of viewership time and benefit slots that really impact on customer acquisition churn et cetera, suggesting that no specific content deal has material impact on the customer metrics. If you can\u2019t lose any specific content deal, which will immediately impact on the metrics. How do you think about the positive impact of content dealer such as Disney\u2019s or Time Warner\u2019s, where presumably you are paying a premium, for example for exclusivity or even how do you think about investments in original content?","On the market potential, if you grow your content offer as you described a few minutes ago and succeed in getting 50 million or 60 million households in the U.S., how do you think the cable companies would do which changed their broadband pricing levels or structure? Thank you.","Reed Hastings","Sure, Carlos, that\u2019s a good question, which is why do we talk so much about increasing the content about propelling our growth, but when we lose content, we say it doesn\u2019t matter. And I think the insight is your part about any specific piece of content, I think if we lost enough content that would definitely decrease viewing. And similarly, when we increase content, we have to increase it by a lot to make a difference, adding just one movie here or something like that or one show isn\u2019t going to make a huge difference. The general view, we have is sometimes the content additions are so small, 1% of viewing that we are not to see a big difference, but that will increase, and if we do a lot of that that will help.","And then second on in terms if we get to 50 million or 60 million how does the relations with cable networks change. I think we always were building great audiences for them, if you look at what we\u2019ve done for Breaking Bad in terms of building a bigger audience for viewing on AMC, and if you look at Mad Men, that\u2019s a great win-win, where we are incredibly good at the prior season. They have got the current season and they get bigger and bigger audiences.","And then second, if it's off air like ADC's lost, then I think it's pure incremental money for them, the fact that we will have to monetize it down. So we don't see a huge conflict there in that licensing dynamics.","Carlos Kirjner \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Reed, do you think there is a conflict potentially with the cable companies like Comcast and Time Warner Cable in COGS? If you increase your subscriber levels and using their price to transmit the bids for the year, and it could increase the pricing of cable broadband access??","","Reed Hastings","The cable broadband is very profitable for them and the more that people want to do high definition Skype and high definition Netflix, it's inevitable that there is going to be new high speed packages that are more successful for those ISPs. And so they have got an incredibly profitable great business moving data, and that's great for them. It doesn't conflict with us. In fact where we like high definition Skype are the critical applications that help them drive more adoption of the higher end packages, and in that way we work really well with them.","Carlos Kirjner \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tony Wible with Janney. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Tony Wible \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi. Do you guys believe that Amazon was in their bidding for the Disney content and what's your appetite for chasing down Sony Pay 1?","Reed Hastings","","Tony we don't know on Disney Amazon and Sony Pay 1, our appetite frankly was for Disney, it's strong and we\u2019re interested and we will see how it works out. There is no specific piece of content that we must have, and that's just the bidding negotiation.","Tony Wible \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nat Schindler with Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Nathaniel H. Schindler \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. So if you look at your net sub adds, and then estimate some growth sub add that you had coming in for the quarter. In domestic streaming, you said in the past of 30% of those or third roughly you touched within the last year in our returns, has that number changed, and could you think that longer than a year, how much of your market, the total market have you touched at this point, do you believe over the course of your business?","Reed Hastings","It all depends on, Nat on how you count an entity. You count a household where you will make out and they try both under separate email. Lots of people have multiple email addresses and several of them are willing to enter multiple credit cards to get multiple free trials. So there's no clean motion of that. We can tell you how many email addresses have we touched, but mapping that into people and households is pretty tricky.","Nathaniel H. Schindler \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Makes sense, thank you.","","Reed Hastings","Yes. And Nat on your first question, it stayed roughly, about the same in terms of percent","Nathaniel H. Schindler \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay.","","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Daniel Ernst \u2013 Hudson Square Research, Inc.","","Thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking my call. Three questions if I might, first kind of big picture on, how you're looking at the business and growth. Profitability has been reasonably above expectations in the last couple of quarters, and guidance for the coming quarter? Historically you guys have tended to manage perhaps not making too much profits and always willing to invest in growth, and how you are thinking about that in terms of new market rollouts or acquiring new content to really continue separate yourselves from the competition sort of or on investing on your product expectations versus growth investments?","And then secondly in a related comment, back in the day, eight, nine years ago, we use to kind of get market-by-market updates, you are at X percent penetration in San Francisco and we got the profitability in X number of months, can you give us some sort of directional color like that on some of the international markets in Europe and maybe an update on Latin America there?","And then third sort of viewership question, I know people asked of this before generally and could use a lot of color. But what kind of is the mix of viewing between connected devices to the TV, the Xbox, and there is an Apple TV and DVD players and TVs that have Netflix built in versus tablets, and I think computers and how that looks domestic versus international, where perhaps all those devices are less connected to TVs in Europe or Latin America? Some color on how that, mix in usages fits. Thanks.","Reed Hastings","","Daniel, you started pretty awfully nicely about talking about growth of above expectations last year, but I think you were obviously confused with the different companies, since last year was difficult on that front. But in general, we are pioneering this new service, Internet TV as are other firms, and from a macro level there is a lot of great growth factors because Internet makes certain user experiences, much more enjoyable at lower cost, and Netflix is propelling our growth, and we are very excited about the growth.","In terms of penetration, in the DVD days, we were operating in the San Francisco Bay Area for several years with local delivery, before we were doing the rest of the country. So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve used that as the comp. We don\u2019t really have an equivalent each, the U.S. is reasonably uniform in terms of DVD viewing. Each nation is quite different, and we wouldn\u2019t want to say every nation is going to be like Canada. So there\u2019s no useful proxy in that way.","Then finally, your question was on viewership, and some nations are more Smart TV centric, and some are more PS3 centric, and Xbox centric. But overall, you see a lot of similar trends, which are tablets, are growing somewhat in the absolute and somewhat at the replacement of laptops. Smart TVs are selling to people who want to use and Netflix is the most important application on a Smart TV. Then all of the individual devices like an Apple TV are really cool and doing well. So, the whole internet getting to every screen is just a big secular story that's happening and benefitting us.","Daniel Ernst \u2013 Hudson Square Research, Inc.","All right, thanks. Really, but just to clarify, we were talking about the last couple of quarters being profits above expectations, and your guidance there for the next quarter?","Reed Hastings","","Yeah, Dan let me take a stab at that, in your part A. In the past Netflix has been very good about thinking about that net incremental $1 million or $5 million investment. It's better in content. It\u2019s better in marketing. It is better in improving, our interface and our products. We continue to do that. We are never perfect in sort of finding out that optimal frontier point, but we still continue to think like that in terms of that additional investment whether it's better place in an existing market in a near market and product or in our content offering in the Netflix or international","Ellie Mertz","Great, thank you, that\u2019s all the questions we have time for. We really like to offer some closing remarks.","Reed Hastings","Youssef if you\u2019re still on, we are on Facebook Gift and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a huge opportunity. Thank you all for visiting Netflix teleconference and we look forward to seeing you.","Operator","Thank you again. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."],"15634":["Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call January 20, 2015  5:00 PM ET","Executives","David Wells - CFO","Reed Hastings - CEO","Ted Sarandos - CCO","Analysts","Rich Greenfield - BTIG ","Mark Mahaney - RBC","David Wells","This is David Wells. I am the CFO of Netflix, and I am welcoming you to the 2014 Q4 Earnings Interview. Joining me today is Reed Hastings, our CEO; and Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer is joining us from Miami at the National Association of Television Executives Meeting. Also at that meeting is Michael Nathanson and with too many conflicts. So reprising his role as interviewer today is Rich Greenfield, analyst from BTIG and joining him is Mark Mahaney from RBC.","We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may vary. I am going to turn you over to Mark who has our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Mark Mahaney","Thanks David. Question to start off for Reed. You talked about an S curve and the ability to get to 60 million to 90 million subs in the U.S. you beat the sub-numbers for the quarter but there is a year-over-year reduction in net sub adds. So, walk us through what your latest thinking is on the ability to Netflix to reach 60 million to 90 million U.S. subs?","Reed Hastings","Well, it\u2019s looking very good. We\u2019re at 39 million in the U.S., adding 5 plus million a year. So the trajectory is great. And if you step back and you say is Internet video going to be in every home in America in 10 years, that\u2019s a pretty clear yes. So, tons of potential there and we\u2019re very excited about just continuing to improve our service.","Rich Greenfield","This is a question for Reed. When you think about the international growth profile, the comments that you made in terms of the cadence of market launch is basically saying that every single market would be launched over the course of the next two years was a pretty big move from what I think we were expecting and what I think investors were expecting. Was there something that happened when you looked at the success you were having overseas whether it\u2019d be France, Germany, Latin America? Did something happen? How fast you planned on rolling out the rest of the world to get you over the next two years?","Reed Hastings","Yes Rich, there is two real drivers. One is the success that we\u2019ve seen from Argentina, the Finland to have all of our first wave of markets from Canada, Latin America, Nordics, Netherlands, UK and Ireland, be profitable together as a group. It\u2019s just tremendous accomplishment. And that the growth rate that they\u2019re seeing it\u2019s going to be very significantly profitable going forward. So, that\u2019s been a big driver for us. And then I think Ted really had the vision to figure out how to start to get global rights for some of the content by moving up the food chain. And we\u2019ve been pushing on that dimension to be able to get the global rights where we don\u2019t have to go country by country across 200 countries but instead can provide to produce our upfront money, guaranteed money and get great access. And so Ted do you want to add to that?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, I mean, I think our success this year with Better Call Saul and Gotham where we had moved up the process, license for all of our operating territories at our future operating territories directly with the producers for those shows. So Better Call Saul directly with Sony and Gotham directly with Warner Television instead of having to go country-by-country and piling up those deals and lining up windows, this enables us to make the service, the selection, far more global for viewers around the world who increasingly know exactly when these shows began and are hungry to see them as soon as they can.","Mark Mahaney","Question for Reed or David on the international sub numbers, they came in materially higher in the December quarter and you\u2019re guiding for materially higher than expected numbers for the March quarter. Can you give us any color on which markets and which countries did better than expected? Or is this just a case of the European launch being a little more delayed than expected and you\u2019re seeing the full impact of that. Where was the upside from?","David Wells","Mark, this is David. It\u2019s across several markets. And as you know we don\u2019t talk specifically about individual markets for competitive reasons. But I would say it wasn\u2019t driven by any one individual market it was driven by several markets. So we\u2019re really pleased with the growth that we saw in the fourth quarter and carrying into the first quarter.","Rich Greenfield","And if I can just follow up David on that question on Latin America though, you did give out a 5 million subscriber, that you would reach 5 million subscribers during the quarter in Latin America. Could you give us any other feel or are there any other milestones to think about as you think about other markets that you\u2019ve already launched that we should be thinking about. And why you\u2019re disclosing something like 5 million in Latin America without more detail overseas?","David Wells","Well, it\u2019s a nice round number and we\u2019ll be getting our milestones as we hit in other markets. But it\u2019s incrementally better for us to talk about that with consumers in Latin America because it validates the quality, the breadth and the size of the service. So it\u2019s helpful from a consumer standpoint in the market. So we weigh between the investment community and the consumer community what\u2019s helpful in terms of information. [Multiple Speakers]","Rich Greenfield","Like what change that actually accelerated because it was an area that you talked about as a problem historically on these calls. Why is Latin America now accelerating to the point where you are now really getting excited about the growth potential.","David Wells","Well nothing changed, so we knew we would hit 5 million in the quarter and we did. What changed? Maybe, that we gave you incremental information. I think what we said all along in terms of Latin America it was a challenging market, we\u2019ve had payments issues and e-commerce trust issues that we\u2019ve wrestled with and improved over the last three to 3.5 years. But it\u2019s been growing all along, I think folks may not have taken us at our word for that but we\u2019re very pleased with it. It\u2019s been steady growth; we continue to see great growth and great potential in the market. It\u2019s a market with about 65 million broadband households. So if you take that 5 million number that we talked about and 65 million in terms of addressable, we think we got a lot of room for growth in the market.","Mark Mahaney","David I am going to follow-up on the global expansion little bit. Two things you bolded in this press release was this line about completing global expansion over the next two years. I noticed bolded stuff. And so I guess the question is I know you talked about this a little before. It sounds like you may be buying international content or getting content for international markets more efficiently. But there are other learnings from some of the international markets, the launch as you have had to date that have allowed you to be more efficient and rolling out new markets going forward. So it\u2019s a pretty big statement to make and fairly big change just over the last 90 days.","David Wells","Sure Mark. I think, one thing that I would add to what Reed and Ted talked about in terms of our incremental confidence in international is that our originals programming continues to be highly engaged across markets outside the U.S. We thought it might be based on the type of content that those markets were enjoying. But we just didn\u2019t know and now we\u2019ve had another year of experience in Originals, we see that the Originals are in the top list of content watched in all those markets. So it gives us more confidence that when we make something we produce, we incur those production costs. But it will be an asset that can be enjoyed across markets and across a bigger and bigger set of international markets.","I would say the incremental lessons for us have been the payments lessons we\u2019ve learned and we continue to grow and address each individual market separately because they all seem to have different challenges. The types of programming in each market I think Ted\u2019s team is getting smarter and smarter and we\u2019ve become incrementally better in terms of knowing what to license upfront? What to add in terms of licensing over 12, 24 months to make the content better and better.","Mark Mahaney","A follow-up and just bring the question back to Reed then. So Reed is the point that Netflix is really selling two universal goods. One is streaming and the second is streaming of this content that has universal appeal, a lot of which is U.S. content, but not all of it but the most popular shows in one market pretty much largely transferred to be the pretty top content in other markets as well. Is that the kind of the secret sauce?","Reed Hastings","Well certainly first part of what you said which is the magic of streaming is on demand the control being able to binge on episodes, watch a movie in the middle of the night. And that is a very universal truth which is even stronger in developing markets where television is not as advanced as it might be say in the U.S. or France. And so the more that we expand out of that foot print the more we\u2019re differentially grade with interactive side.","And in terms of the content, it\u2019ll be easy to over generalize from our experience in Western Europe and Latin America. There is some content like House of Cards that really does carry around the world, it\u2019s not on our service in China but it\u2019s been tremendously popular in China. But not every piece of content will carry equally well, but we\u2019ve certainly been impressed on how there is a segment at the market in every country that follows western, Hollywood, British content. And then we\u2019re augmenting that with all kinds of local programming. And so it\u2019s not quite as simple as we do our Originals, that\u2019s the whole thing, it\u2019s everywhere. But that\u2019s at least a two-thirds impact. And Ted may be you can add some color on how we look at the markets beyond Western Europe?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, this has been so encouraging how truly global these brands have been. So when we set out our original program for the beginning, obviously our markets were pretty limited and we were thinking about them mostly as U.S. shows and they would travel like other U.S. shows have. And we\u2019ve been really enthused to see particular in our Western European launches shows like Orange is the New Black and House of Cards, even in later seasons performing tremendous for us because people hadn\u2019t got around to seeing them yet and we could get the brand out there and push it out there. And then Marco Polo was kind of global phenomenon as well.","So for us it was very encouraging that what the world really wants is high quality, great production values, great story telling and that can be truly universal. It might be that there are some cultural barriers to U.S. content as we get into more exotic markets, but my guess is that we\u2019re going to continue to see our original programming travel and carry the Netflix brand around the world.","Rich Greenfield","There is a question for Ted, because you bring up Marco Polo. I think the impact on the fourth quarter is really important to own in on. We got a lot of questions mailed into us basically with the sentiment of how much of a drag was Marco Polo and the negative reaction on Q4 subscriber metrics. The negative press impacted negatively gross additions. And then tied to that as we\u2019ve mentioned also you\u2019ve got House of Cards Season 3 coming. How much of your guidance for Q1 benefits from season 3 of House of Cards globally? I think last year you made a comment that season 2 had a much bigger impact on gross additions then the prior year. Did that follow through again for season three?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, Rich, I think it\u2019s tough to get a big subscriber reaction to a new series that people have been heard before even if they get excited about it or they\u2019re more curious about it before they\u2019ve seen the first view. And Marco Polo had some negative reactions in the press. Viewers have loved it and the volume of viewing has been phenomenal. The rate at which people are completing the show is comparable to our other big ten original shows, so we\u2019re thrilled that we\u2019ve made a show that viewers have loved around the world. And of course because it\u2019s a season one, we had not baked in or had big anticipation before subscriber impact. House of Cards season two, Orange is the New Black season two and Arrested Development have been the ones that the shows we\u2019ve been able to track real measurable subscriber growth with their launches. And I think as we go forward with season three of House of Cards and season three of Orange is the New Black. Daredevil has a built in fan base for Marvel. Our feature film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon two has a built in fan base from the original film. So I think we\u2019ll see those kind of impacts that we saw from season twos in the past.","Rich Greenfield","Because part of the fear is that the marketing benefit that came along with the originals that have good reviews, had a big impact on just building the Netflix brand and obviously Marco Polo maybe is getting critical -- maybe it\u2019s getting good consumer reviews, but the critical press for the media, the general entertainment media does seem to be excited about it the way have been about your prior originals?","Ted Sarandos","I find it hard to believe that. You can build sustainably on things that get well reviewed and not watched. So I am thrilled that this is getting watched and loved and I think that is a sustainable.","Reed Hastings","And Rich, we\u2019re really focused on the consumer and the social media that comes out of that. So if you look at the commentary from people to their friends about Marco Polo, it\u2019s extremely positive, so the spectacle, the costumes, storyline is exotic but approachable, so it\u2019s a great one. The investor audience tends to be highly educated and that really skews towards House of Cards, while you\u2019re an exception. So you can have some of that marketing to me kind of things where House of Cards to the investor audience, it\u2019s a tighter march than Marco Polo. But really Marco Polo has been a great success and we renewed it for season two.","David Wells","And Rich one final comment regarding guidance, it\u2019s worth reminding folks that the investment community is hyper-focused on whether we\u2019re within 100,000 or 200,000 of our guiding number, but when we\u2019re talking about our guide for Q1 at 1.8 million domestic members in terms of growth the addition of even House of Cards season three is 100,000 or 150,000. So we\u2019re talking about on the margin it\u2019s helpful but it\u2019s not the thing it\u2019s not the big thing that\u2019s going to drive the growth in Q1.","Mark Mahaney","Let me go back to Ted with two questions on the original content. Does the success spend of Marco Polo want to lead you to look to do even more of these kind of relatively blockbuster type of productions? And then secondly in terms of the viewing of the seasons just to be clear are you seeing greater viewing of each of the original content House of Cards or Orange is the New Black, are they increasing every year as you\u2019ve seen really successful series during the past. Are the audiences building up for each of those?","Ted Sarandos","The audience is definitely building season and season pre to the shows and I think if you see in our lineup of upcoming shows that we have some pretty epic and pretty spectacular shows upcoming like Daredevil like Sense8 that are done under very big scale. But remember we\u2019re releasing 320 hours of new original programming this year alone and there is a mix of big epic spectaculars, some smaller productions but probably think equally loved like teen comedy from Tina Fey or Robert Carlock, The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and some another shows as well like Grace And Frankie with Jane Fonda or Lily Tomlin. So we\u2019re not going after one kind of audience or one type of show taste or super diverse, we have a big subscriber base and we\u2019re trying to serve all of them.","Rich Greenfield","When you look at the subscriber growth David, obviously you\u2019re looking for slower growth or slower net ads that you look on an year-over-year basis, should investors just assume that a kind of 20% annual decline or is there the content that Ted talking about. Is there the potential to reaccelerate that where you could have more ads domestically in 2016 and \u201915? And then tied to that you gave out I think your first ever margin guidance for 2020 of 40%, would that tie a specific subscriber number in your head or is there a pricing flexibility where you think pricing is notably higher. How do we think about how you get to that 40% contribution margin?","David Wells","Sure, I\u2019ll take the first part. We certainly could end up higher right. Now we\u2019ve learned our lessons on giving full year guidance on numbers so we tend not to do that. But what we\u2019re seeing is look the current trends that we saw in Q3 and Q4 extrapolated forward are down year-over-year in terms of net additions growth. We have a lot of content as Ted just talked about coming out in Q1 and then the rest of 2015. So we certainly could see a jump up, it\u2019s really hard to know. But I think the prudent thing for us right now is just continue to extrapolate the current trend that we\u2019re seeing and that was down year-over-year. And that\u2019s what you see reflected in our Q1 guidance. In terms of the margins guidance for 40%, it isn\u2019t the first time we actually guided 30% right in terms of setting a margin target out there, but we wanted to give investors some guidance in terms of long-term margin growth and what it's about for us is the steady march upward of about 200 averaging -- about 200 basis points a year. We're going to have some lumpiness with the content coming in, in terms of heavy quarters of content introduction. We have accelerated amortization on that original content which tends to pressure the P&L in this quarter so we launch a lot of content. But I think for the 40% it's the continued steady growth of the business and we think that we have the flexibility and the model that doesn't require an 80 million subscriber or 90 million subscriber business to get there, we can get there with the growth that we see layered in today. ","Mark Mahaney","David can I ask about the pricing elasticity, you talked about that a fair amount in the press release. Two quarters ago it seemed like there was a lot of conviction in the pricing power over the last quarters, some questions now it seems like there is greater conviction. Do you think you really have enough data points -- I know you mentioned Mexico it sounds like you did some additional research on some the newer subs coming in, do you have other markets that you have looked at and you have seen the results from there that give you the confidence that you actually there is this pricing elasticity or pricing power -- do you think we could then going forward seeing the dollar price increase every other year or every two years and maybe with year grandfathered?","David Wells","Well I don't think we're talking about a dollar to the consumer price increase every year. What we're talking about is using our tiers to provide value and choice for the consumers to grow -- steadily grow our average subscription price overtime that doesn't necessarily require the frequency of any annual price increase. I think what you should expect from us is a steady growth of that ASP and we will disconnect pricing I don't think there is any reason for us to have a global single event. We will look at pricing in each market and we will grow it accordingly to what we think and makes sense in each market. ","In terms of evidence, sure we have seen growth persist through pricing introduction or raises through those markets. So I think besides Mexico we've got some other examples. Ultimately, it will rest upon when those grandfathering's expire, so we still have that to come. But we think we have enough evidence today to look at it and say the growth that we saw that slowed down in Q2 and Q3 wasn't really necessarily -- wasn't related to the pricing. We still scratch our heads a little bit in terms of explaining fully and as I've said before it takes several quarters for you to really get comfortable on the answer as we look at every piece of information. But right now I think we've got enough information to say based on Mexico and other markets there is still plenty of pricing power for Netflix and not a reaction to the U.S facility. ","Rich Greenfield","Just expanding on that Reed, when you think about the way you price. You basically foreclosed on advertising as an incremental way to drive revenue. Are there forms appearing that could actually be interesting to generate more revenue for Netflix on a per subscriber basis?","Reed Hastings","Sure. The biggest one is our $12 a month plan is our plan for Ultra HD. Now today there are variation television's that are Ultra HD and we only have a few titles. We have more than anybody else but we only have a few titles. But if you look ahead two years, four years from now many of the TV's sold at Best Buy will be Ultra HD and lots of our content will be Ultra HD and it's a natural match. So I think what we are able to do is as the high end of the market spends $2,000 to get a Ultra HD television it's seems fair and natural for them that just like you pay for difference between standard def and HD that there is a difference between HD and Ultra HD. So that's the way that we got incremental revenue without making any changes ourselves by just letting the tide come to us. ","Ted Sarandos ","And Reed if I could add to that. I think what's exciting about this move is unlike other kind of format changes this one is led by a thin layer of content but the front end of the content. So we're shooting all of our original series with a very few exceptions in Ultra HD, our Breaking Bad licenses are on Ultra HD, Blacklist I mean all the very frontline shows and then complimenting with more-and-more of the catalogue. But it's not a kind of a show off of weird quirky things that look good it's actually the program and the people who watch it. ","Mark Mahaney","Another question for Ted, you talked about your overall content was where you gain efficiencies in terms of your procurement of content. Can you tell if whether the competitive landscape is changing at all. Amazon may be getting critical acclaim. It's hard to tell they are getting customer acclaim for their shows. Are you seeing anything in the market that suggests that your ability to acquire content get content is getting easier or harder? ","Ted Sarandos","On the original side it's a very competitive market and we're fortunately positioned ourselves as kind of a premier destination for the biggest and best projects. We don't say yes to all of them and we see them show up at other places but we do think that we're the first or second go-to for most of the projects that we're looking for. And I think in terms of the licensing side it's kind of the same thing which is as we increase our footprint our ability to compete in that space really helps being able to get the most high profile shows but by doing that by being more-and-more confident at earlier stages. So being able to license that content with much greater confidence sometimes a pretty pilot gives us the ability to find those efficiencies. ","Rich Greenfield","But Ted just to follow on that, stacking license become a real issue for U.S studios. They are now looking at your requirements for limiting stacking and also the global buying I mean you don't want to buy things that don\u2019t have that global license attached to it, is that making it harder for you to buy content from some of the big TV producers as you look out over the course of the next 12 months, whether it\u2019d be the Fox\u2019s, the Warner\u2019s, the CBS\u2019s or is that a non-issue?","Ted Sarandos","I think really the truth about it is that they -- it doesn\u2019t make it harder, because it actually makes it more attractive as Studios kind of streamline their operations. I think they\u2019re looking for more streamlined ways to selling their programming efficiently. And on the stacking rights, we\u2019re not standing in the way of the network, we\u2019re holding those rights. We\u2019re just saying, we won\u2019t pay for freight, if it\u2019s not fully exclusive. And if so they want to withhold the right for stacking, they\u2019re welcome to do that, just there is a price tag to it, they know that some portion of the $3 billion we\u2019re spending this year.","Rich Greenfield","But you are essentially limiting their downside, but you\u2019re also limiting the Studios\u2019 upside, if they agree to sell their content to you, is that fair?","Ted Sarandos","In what way?","Rich Greenfield","Well, they don\u2019t have the ability to sell it to, based on the success here, they\u2019re selling it to you what if pre-release, they can\u2019t go out and sell it in other markets overtime, if they basically limit the stacking they obviously can\u2019t leverage all of their other platforms with those full stacking so I mean\u2026","Ted Sarandos","They can do it Rich, they just can\u2019t do it for free.","Mark Mahaney","Question for Reed, Reed couple of months ago I think HBO talked about plans to launch a standalone streaming service in sometime in 2015, any thoughts you have on what kind of impact that can have on your businesses and specifically do you think that there is a probability that there would be a broad streaming solution that would come out at price point lower than Netflix?","Reed Hastings","It\u2019s really hard to speculate on what they\u2019re going to do on pricing. To the degree that they go really aggressive and match Netflix\u2019s price for HBO, then it\u2019s extremely disruptive to their current ecosystem since the prices are higher than that. They\u2019ve generally given the signal that they\u2019re going in softly in terms of not being too disruptive using the existing partnerships that would tend to imply a little bit higher price point. In the Nordics, they did choose which is the first place that they competed over the top, to be directly on top of us about 79 kroner for pricing. So we\u2019ll just wait and see. I think even if they were to match us in pricing, it just going to be a lot of people subscribing to both and I think that over the years last five years with HBO and Showtime, when Showtime has a great run with Homeland and The Affair, it increases Showtime subscriptions, it doesn\u2019t decrease HBO. And I think we\u2019d see the same with us and HBO which is if they do great work, people will additionally subscribe to them because that cost is pretty small per month, hours are small per month relative to all their other entertainment options, so it\u2019s definitely not a zero sum situation.","Mark Mahaney","I guess both Reed and David on the next question as it relates to DISH and Sling TV. MVPD integration in this country has been really a challenge for Netflix I think you\u2019ve had a lot more success signing deals outside of United States. What does the DISH deal mean initially in terms of the willingness of others in the U.S. and will we ever see you on the X1 integrated into the platform and then to the extent that DISH is actually creating subscribers. This is the part for David, curious how you get compensated or -- sorry how you\u2019re compensating DISH if they\u2019re able to actually grow your gross additions?","David Wells","Let\u2019s see I can answer both. We\u2019re certainly not going to talk about the financial details with DISH. And then to the degree DISH has always been maverick doing some things first to the degree that they enjoy great success like Virgin in the UK with platform and it helps the Hopper get more popular because it\u2019s also an internet platform. And I think it is likely that DISH\u2019s competitors would want to co-op that benefit and integrate with us, but right now everyone\u2019s going to watch and see, let\u2019s see how DISH succeeds with the Hopper hardware which is what has Netflix. And that\u2019s independent of Sling TV, so those are two different things.","Mark Mahaney","What do you think of Sling TV I mean a lot of people how downplayed it, what do you think of the offering and its impact on your business specifically?","Reed Hastings","I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see any impact on our business. It\u2019s a great start. Charlie Ergen has been a great entrepreneur and I think he sees the future that its internet centric and it may not be the perfect offering today, but it\u2019s got $20 a month very attractive pricing and he\u2019s been an incredible entrepreneur in terms of starting with something small like early DISH and building it in to the internet and DVD, so it\u2019s great for him and add some competition in that market, but I don\u2019t think it materially changes the desire to have Netflix with our unique and exclusive shows.","Rich Greenfield","Reed on the MVPD integrations in Europe. Are any of those material enough to have called some of the upside we saw in this to your guidance in the December quarter or in the guide for the March quarter?","Reed Hastings","There deals that we work on for a long time, so they were all built into the Q4 guidance.","Mark Mahaney","Reed you have not updated us on streaming metrics in a long time I think Neil Hunt gave the last statistic almost a year ago in terms of where you are now on a monthly or quarterly global basis some color there and then just tied to that we got a lot of questions emailed-in in terms of just split where it stands today in terms of devices given the rollout of better wireless networks how big is non-in-home usage on tablets and smartphones. And is there any color you could provide on movies versus TV in terms of absolute amount or absolute volume of streaming?","Reed Hastings","Yes there\u2019s been no remarkable changes, so TVs or shows watching is bigger than movies that\u2019s been consistent. We\u2019ve said personal devices PC, tablet phone that varies by market some sort of 30%-40% of viewing and TV based viewing being the large green share doing being the majority of it. No particular change in those metrics. In terms of mobile networks, consumers are still in most countries quite conservative because of the data caps typically 2 gigabytes or 5 gigabytes in terms of watching video on. So we see a lot of tablet and smartphone usage but almost always on WiFi networks and then they\u2019re careful about how they use the cellular networks because of the caps and the fear of [overages].","Mark Mahaney","And then total hours?","Reed Hastings","Total hours continue to grow. We haven\u2019t hit any super sexy milestone that we\u2019ve chosen to make an event about which is when we tend to do those things. But both total hours of course that\u2019s going up. But more importantly median hours continued to climb in every market as we make the programming better and better. So that\u2019s the main thing that we track internally and it\u2019s just very exciting to see as the devices get simpler to use, as the UI gets more personalized, as the content gets better. We see it directly reflected in the number of median hours and then that is the closest correlater with retention and word of mouth because if you\u2019re using Netflix a lot you\u2019re much more likely to stay with us and to recommend it to your friends.","Mark Mahaney","But that must mean you\u2019re closing in on kind of hours per subscriber per day if you\u2019ve been growing consistently on a median basis?","Reed Hastings","Well, I\u2019ll leave that speculation to you and when we get to great milestones there is a fair amount of seasonality. So, we might hit numbers like that in peak times like holiday period but not necessarily sustain that over the whole year.","David Wells","I guess which we\u2019ll have a good take on it, whatever that is interesting anyway.","Mark Mahaney","David let me bring you back in the conversation, you talked about the generating material global profits earlier than expected but you also talked about $1 billion debt raise. So kind of square those comments a little bit and then the timing of the debt raise when you would expect that and why you would chose debt versus equity?","David Wells","Sure Mark. I think in terms of profits earlier than expected, it\u2019s more that we have clear line of sight in terms of rolling out the rest of our international expansion. So, we mentioned that we would have an couple of years of heavy investment. And I think that\u2019s going to drive capital needs which then leads into the conversation around the capital. And we think right now is still a good time to secure a long-term low cost capital in the debt market and that\u2019s why we chosen debt. What we\u2019ve done in the prior three years is actually we\u2019ve done a raise every year.","Mark Mahaney","And I think your points have been that purpose for the capital raise is largely to fund international expansion just one check if that\u2019s true. And then secondly there is little commentary here about expanding in the China modestly. I am not sure what a modest expansion in the China is? Sounds like it could be expensive. Are there particular limits you\u2019re going to put on that?","David Wells","It will be quite modest and I can let others speak to that as well. Basically, the incremental cost to launch in the rest of the globe is smaller relative to the individual customized launches that we\u2019ve done to-date in these other territories. So you\u2019ll see the level of investment for the countries that we talked about and the countries we will talk about in \u201915 be a little bit higher than the level of investment going forward, basically countries that we haven\u2019t yet launched in. And back to your cash comment it\u2019s really tough to separate the cash. I mean when you have capital in a business and you use $1 on content and $1 to fund international expansion, it\u2019s really tough to sort of separate those things.","Both of those things right now are requiring cash for Netflix. The international, mainly because it reduces the dollar profit that we would otherwise have. And the content because we\u2019ve chosen to produce more and more of our own content and that means we have to fund the production which has slightly more upfront characteristics than a licensing model where we would pay a little bit more out over the life of the deal.","Mark Mahaney","But you\u2019re not in markets like Japan. When you look at India, you look at South Korea. Those seem like very expensive markets to enter from just a content build-up, what\u2019s the disconnect there?","Reed Hastings","Let\u2019s go back to the China and then we\u2019ll [indiscernible]. So Mark on China what we said in the letters that we\u2019re exploring options. So we need to get a license that\u2019s not the 100% clear that we\u2019ll be able to do that. So, we\u2019re figuring that out. And what we said is that if we go it will be a modest investment because we won\u2019t have that much content. We\u2019re going to be very cautious and feel our way along to that process if we\u2019re able to get that license. And then to Rich\u2019s question, yes, there is many other high GDP markets, GDP per capita, like South Korea and Japan and those are big investments just like we done in France and Germany and the UK.","Mark Mahaney","And just from a high level you had this bigger tree Reed out in, I think somewhere in the Midwest last month. And just curious are there any kind of key takeaways that we should be thinking about that you learned or that were discussed that would be meaningful to investors?","Reed Hastings","I think the key thing is that everyone sees that Internet TV is really becoming substantial. So you saw this with CBS All Access 15 years of shows, any episode really lean forward move. We see this with ESPN both heavily investing in WatchESPN, and if you think about it from an ESPN perspective, as long as people are subscribing, whether a third of the time there are on WatchESPN and two-thirds of the time on a linear channel or the reverse, it\u2019s all the same to them.","So they\u2019re being very forward leaning, investing in WatchESPN and by being in the DISH level making sure that they stay accessible by every home in America. So just across the board you see this phenomena that we described a few years ago of channels becoming apps, people using them on their smartphone and smart TV just as easily and transparently.","So the fundamental thesis is getting validated, that\u2019s great. And for us it\u2019s both on competition and its more consumers coming in the market, speeding up because Internet TV is becoming so mainstream.","Mark Mahaney","Question for David on the streaming content obligations, those rose to 9.5 billion in quarter. What levels are you comfortable with? Should these continue to rise as the sub base rises? Is there a natural level I which it would be appropriate ranges for those?","David Wells","There is no absolute number but when I look at the streaming obligations in the table and even the ones that are sort of not estimable but you can out a range on those as well little bit lighter. I would say that the ratio has been fairly consistent in terms of its scaling with our business. So you should expect them to continue to grow especially as we launch additional international territories. In the produced content side the more we license content the more that will grow in an obligation. The interesting thing about in the production world is when you produce content and you own it, because you have the discretion to cancel it at any time, it doesn\u2019t show up as a content obligation.","So if you look at some of our peers and some of our suppliers in the Hollywood, you don\u2019t have the same sort of accounting when it comes to an obligation. Even though you may say that there is a high probability of finishing or producing a full budget on a particular project. But I would say I think in terms of our revenue and our revenue per obligation. I think it\u2019s been sort of trading in a tight band, it\u2019s been in a tight band along with our scale growth.","Mark Mahaney","Sticking on financials, can we talk about interconnection a little bit? You signed deals with four of the large companies over the last several months. Curious how those interconnection fees add up? Is it the number and where it\u2019s now adding up to north of 10 million plus a 25? And then related to that maybe a question for Reed, in terms of do you expect the SEC order or the SEC policy on Internet regulations actually make the deals that you sign with ISPs actually invalid, meaning you won\u2019t have to pay for interconnection going forward.","Reed Hastings","That would be upside Rich that we would not expect that they would trump existing contracts. But what\u2019s been great for Netflix is the general idea of the Internet as a utility open to all not for discriminatory use, as it really take whole. And of course the shift we\u2019ve seen over the last year around perceptions Title II is amazing to see, just 12 months. And we appear to be on the edge of an acting Title II and generally codifying the idea that at least in the U.S. the Internet is a utility for broad social good and wide open access. And that over time if it happens will significantly insulate us from any accelerating tax for interconnections.","So I imagine we would likely live out the current deals and that\u2019s what\u2019s in our plan.","David Wells","Reed if I could add just on the financials Rich. If we don\u2019t talk about the specifics of the deal but we continue to be very happy with the shift to managing our own CDN, the percentage of our expense that\u2019s been on streaming delivery continues to be quite modest relative to content.","Reed Hastings","Mark and Rich why don\u2019t we hit one more question each and then we\u2019ll wrap up.","Mark Mahaney","Let me throw one to Ted then. Ted just give us an update on the Disney content. I now some Disney content will be streaming into that key Canadian market of this year. But going forward I think there is a very large library Disney content that will be coming on. Just some color about how big that opportunity is? How much content that is? And what kind of impact you think that could have in terms of filling out the pallet or whatever offerings to families in Netflix?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, you need to get in studio; we\u2019re excited about the Pay 1 opportunity with Disney because those movies are not just movies. They\u2019re amazing family content that get flexed over and over again forms great loyalty with our subscribers and it\u2019s a real trust brand for parents as well. So we\u2019re really been expanding our relationship with Disney even in the Pay 1 window which I had been really dismissive with other studios. And coming in Canada this year and then going into U.S. next. And I think that\u2019s going to be a very long-term relationship as global as you get in terms of success of Frozen this year all over the planet. So it\u2019s very consistent with our desire to be more and more global at our programming.","Rich Greenfield","Last question from us that would be a two part question. The first piece coming the DVD front. Obviously DVD still supplies a lot of profit David to your financials, just curious given the comments that Outerwall had today that their DVD business seems to be falling pretty precipitously as they look into \u201815, how do you think about the DVD business and the sustainability of those profits? And then just a final rough question for Reed, you\u2019ve been so vocal on the Comcast Time Warner merger and the danger it poses, are you increasingly confident that this deal gets blocked?","David Wells","Well, Rich, let me take you question first. On the DVD, I continue to think it\u2019s going to have a long tail. I mean if you look we lost in 2013, we lost in 1.2 million of our DVDs subscribers. In 2014, we lost 1.1 million so slightly less. And the margin is held steady for two years if you look at the contribution margins for the DVD business. So it\u2019s going to continue to decline. We don\u2019t have any illusions on that. But we think that there is a lot people in rural areas another cinefiles where the DVD makes sense for them and at $8 a month, it\u2019s a pretty inexpensive add-on. So we\u2019ll just to continue provide great service for those folks that really want it.","Reed Hastings","And Rich, the key difference with Outerwall is; Outerwall or Redbox is [indiscernible] centric so it\u2019s vulnerable to the pay-per-view substitution whereas a broad selection renter like our self on the stable business is much less sensitive to that. ","Next question on Comcast Timer Warner we\u2019ve been vocal on the issues that would be presented to U.S. society if there is one ISP that initially would be 40% of broadband households and that DSL phase pretty quickly would be over 50% of U.S. households, we think that\u2019s a tremendous amount of power in one company, so we think it would be wise policy for the U.S. to block the merger, so we\u2019ve been consistent on that whether it happens or not we don\u2019t really have any direct sense, you know, all we can do is advocate for what we think is great policy and see what happens.","Mark Mahaney","Do you agree with the FCC moving -- what is broadband definition up to 25 megs, does that make sense to you?","Reed Hastings","Yes absolutely. Once you got an Ultra HD video stream that\u2019s 15 megs just a single stream and you\u2019re going to want video conferencing, you\u2019re going to want online learning, you\u2019re going to want all kinds of different applications monitoring of your home, these kinds of things on video. So 25 megs is kind of baseline for the next five years as opposed to the past five years. So with that let me thank everyone for joining us on this call and thanks to Rich and Mark for conducting the interview. Thank you all."],"15779":["Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call April 17, 2017  6:00 PM ET","Executives","David Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Reed Hastings - Founder and Chief Executive Officer","Ted Sarandos - Chief Content Officer","Analysts","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Scott Devitt - Stifel Nicolaus & Company","David Wells","Welcome to the Netflix Q1 2017 Earnings Interview. I\u2019m David Wells, CFO. I\u2019m Joined today on the company side by Reed Hastings, our CEO and Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer.","Interviewing us today will be Doug Mitchelson from UBS and Scott Devitt from Stifel Nicolaus. We will be making forward-looking statements, actual results may vary. Doug, I think you have the first question, so over to Doug.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. Actually, first question for you, David, and then one for Reed. David, could you just talk a little bit about the net add results in the quarter versus expectations, and any dynamics underline the second quarter guidance that you want investors to know about?","David Wells","Well, I think what\u2019s written in the letter and what I\u2019ll reiterate is that, we\u2019re not spending too much time understanding any particular quarter. We were with under 100,000 in the U.S. under a couple of 100,000 in the international versus our expectation. We had a particularly back-weighted first quarter, which were - we don\u2019t usually have, but that explains some of the sort of net adds guidance versus actuals as well, and we have a pretty strong guide for Q1.","So I think looking at our Q4, which is one of our strongest quarters ever and a pretty strong Q2 guide, we sort of look across that like we put in the letter and say, we\u2019re still on a great growth path, and our content is working. And we\u2019re pleased with the international growth and we\u2019ve got a lot of growth left in the U.S. as well.","Doug Mitchelson","I mean, is there anything you would highlight in the second quarter in terms of an easy comparison. Last year, you talked about price increase buzz in the press, having a negative impact on U.S. dynamics, the content slate, anything you highlight driving the result?","David Wells","Well, the obvious one to talk about in total, talk about in more detail is the content slate. We talked in our dissent - in the January letter about House of Cards pushing into the second quarter. We\u2019ve got a particularly full slate in Q2, which relative to Q1 is a little heavier, and then that\u2019s comping off of last year\u2019s Q1, we had a pretty strong Q1 as well. So I think that sort of explains some of it on the margin.","But I think the background trend is just a very strong adoption of Internet streaming. So again, if you look across 12 months trend, we still got a lot of great growth. We\u2019re growing well on track in international. We\u2019re continuing to growing in the U.S. And quarter-to-quarter, you\u2019ll see some fluctuations and some of that is explained by the content slate.","Doug Mitchelson","And Reed, upfront I want to turn to you at a high-level. I think you mentioned in the letter about to cross the 100 million subscribers mark, you\u2019re about a decade into this. And I think in the last quarter\u2019s letter, you talked about the next 10 years being tumultuous. And I was hoping you\u2019d talk a little bit about what you meant by using that word in particular, and what are the challenges and opportunities as you look out over the next decade and target that next 100 million subscribers?","Reed Hastings","Well, I\u2019m - we\u2019re super excited expecting to cross 100 million this weekend, that\u2019s a big accomplishment. But it\u2019s really just the beginning. When you look at YouTube having a billion active users and a billion hours every day. When you look at Facebook\u2019s, multi-billion numbers. We see that the Internet is just a phenomenal opportunity, of course, we\u2019re pay service, not ad supported.","We\u2019re not as deep in international as those companies. But we definitely see a big opportunity around the world to just continue to do what we\u2019ve been doing, which is make fantastic content, get people really excited about that content, and then we\u2019re just continuing to grow.","Doug Mitchelson","Great. Thanks.","Scott Devitt","And just continuing on the roll of content, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the way that content releases do impact seasonality of the business, and as well new releases of new shows, say a Dave Chappelle\u2019s show relative to say Season 5 of the House of Cards and the different impacts on gross and net subs? Thanks.","Ted Sarandos","Scott, I would just say, we\u2019ve said previously that subsequent seasons of shows that have a big audience that are very popular tend to have more impact on the business than introducing brand new IP. So that\u2019s why in the second quarter you\u2019re seeing new seasons of some of our most popular and most acclaimed shows like House of Cards, Orange is the new Black, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Bloodline, Master of None.","And in the first quarter, it was pretty heavy on new IP, but we\u2019re super pleased to have such a big breakout on 13 Reasons why we just came on the last day of the quarter as well as Santa Clarita Diet, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Iron Fist, first season shows, and then something like Dave Chappelle comes along and it\u2019s in its own class in terms of excitement for consumers in viewing and excitement around Netflix and now we\u2019re looking for David - a third special from David next year.","Reed Hastings","And since then you can think of that content is making a little trickier to do the quarterly forecasting. But for the first-half of this year, we\u2019re about 8.25 million net adds, which is what we were last year. So again, it moves itself around levels out. So I wouldn\u2019t get too focused on predicting each quarter by the content. We\u2019re continuing to learn on that. But mostly, we\u2019re just trying to do better and better shows that are more and more popular.","Scott Devitt","And then as it relates to the international business, you noted some markets that are doing extremely well outside the U.S. and other markets that are still progressing. Can you talk about particularly in some of the larger markets where you feel like you\u2019re underpenetrated where the largest sources of friction are increasing the subscriber base in those markets?","David Wells","So I would say I\u2019ll pitch it to Reed afterward. It\u2019s not necessarily a source of friction. I mean, we were pretty careful about not talking about specifics by market for competitive reasons. But we have said that, we experience a wide variety of adoption curves in different markets. We\u2019ve seen some markets come out of the gate really fast. We some - we\u2019ve seen some that have grown slowly and that really caught up and seen a great acceleration.","So I would say, each market is different. Each one seems to have a different word-of-mouth, adoption pattern. But increasingly what\u2019s new for us is that, we\u2019re more and more global. And the more that we can release these shows that have wide global appeal, we\u2019re getting sort of the benefit of that wide global word-of-mouth and the network effect of that that great scale, I mean, growing to 100 million and beyond. Global subscribers is really going to benefit us in having these shows that travel across multiple markets.","So I think, we\u2019re not particularly focused on any one challenge in the larger markets, I think it\u2019s about continuing to make payments available, continuing to improve the product, continuing to improve the continent in that market with our global originals being the largest part of that. And then Reed, I don\u2019t know, if you want to tack on anything there.","Reed Hastings","Yes, Scott, as you might remember, first, couple of years in Brazil, we were struggling with number of the aspects in particular getting the right content, where our service was getting watched a lot. I think it\u2019s pretty parallel to that and of course, not every market is the same as Brazil, we have to learn market by market. But it\u2019s nothing that\u2019s very concerning to us. It\u2019s just a note that in three of the regions LATAM, Europe and North America, we\u2019ve got the formula we\u2019re executing down. And in Asia, Middle East and Africa, we still got a bunch of work to do, particularly around getting enough of the right content that people want to view that we get our viewing hours higher and higher.","Scott Devitt","And just a follow on to the international topic. There have been several markets where you\u2019ve launched non-U.S. originals. And I was interested in terms of the difficulties or ease with which you\u2019re having in finding talent in those markets? And then secondly, in those markets in which you\u2019re launching originals, the benefit in terms of the halo effect of the other markets actually latching onto that continent and viewing it, that\u2019s driving the subscribers in those markets as well?","Ted Sarandos","Well, I could tell you about, we launched this past quarter Ingobernable, which is a Spanish language original Starring Kate del Castillo, that had a huge impact on us throughout Latin America, but also outside of Latin America and throughout the Spanish speaking world. And our ability to get in learn the production infrastructure, learn the - get to know the talent, have the talent get to know us, that\u2019s one of those things that gets a nice accelerator as Netflix becomes better and better known around the world that the top talent in those markets want their shows on Netflix.","So nothing is easy, but that that is something that we\u2019ve had a lot of good fortune with finding the great town and the great shows locally, and it has been having a lot of impact outside of the country of origin.","Scott Devitt","Thank you.","Doug Mitchelson","The international arena is a pretty rich topic, but I want to move back to the U.S. But first, Reed, you mentioned consumption. I think investors would love to have an update on consumption both in the U.S. and overseas. What is the hours per day on average? Is it still growing for both cohorts year-to-year? Anything you\u2019re willing to share at this point in time?","Reed Hastings","Yes, viewing is very large and growing, but nowhere near as big as YouTube. So we definitely got YouTube envy and we\u2019ve got a lot a room to go. And some of the new shows like Ted was talking about, our movie out of Korea [indiscernible] has great global potential. So, we\u2019re finding great talent around the world and that\u2019s what drives up the viewing.","Doug Mitchelson","So I also wanted to hit on the U.S. And so even though a lot of the growth comes from international When you think about the U.S., a lot of investors are worried about the maturity and whether that sends a signal that you could ultimately have some issues with penetrations overseas. And I think, Reed, it starts with you and the vision for 60 million, 90 million subs, is that still the vision? Ted is part of that. What you have to do to execute on getting those subscribers that lead us looking for? And for David, on that topic, is there anything you see in the trends? I know you want us to not to dig into gross adds and churn on a quarterly basis too much, but it\u2019s sort of what we do. Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing that suggests there\u2019s a majority wall coming anytime soon for the U.S.?Thanks.","Reed Hastings","U.S. market is continuing to grow very nicely. I don\u2019t see any fixed wall. I mean of course, every incremental 10 million is a little harder than the last 10 million, but our content keeps getting better, so those forces offset each other. When you look at the last five years, everyone is worried every quarter about saturation in the U.S., and we\u2019ve just continued to grow. But it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be inherently forever. But we certainly feel good about the near-term as we\u2019re expanding and just getting bigger content budget, more shows, more marketing and so all of that feels very good.","Ted Sarandos","And component of that obviously is the international appeal of our global regional shows. But also finding those sweet spot local regional shows that offer some connectivity with the consumers. And for some cases it will be the thing that introduces them to Netflix programming and they fall in love with the broader slate of content.","David Wells","And then finally, Doug, on your last one, I wouldn\u2019t say anything different from Reed. I mean, if we can get, my God, if we can get penetration levels outside the U.S. to be anywhere close to the U.S., you\u2019re implying multiple hundreds and millions of global subscribers with the U.S. beyond 50%. So I\u2019m not sure I understand that point of the question other than to say that the concern as I hear it voiced is really that we wouldn\u2019t be able to get to U.S. levels of penetration outside the U.S., so we\u2019ve got some markets that are starting to get there.","So I think we punch through that sort of concern and anxiety. Now we\u2019re really at a phase where we\u2019re starting to really benefit from the large pipeline that Ted is building and his team are building. And we\u2019re really starting to have sometime in multiple markets that are somewhat new to us as Reed described in Asia.","Reed Hastings","A couple of years ago, Doug, there was a bunch of fear about the 30 million sub wall, with AOL had hit that and HBO would hit that. And the thing is everybody watches TV and nearly everybody has the Internet. So I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s going to stop Netflix from getting to most people in the United States and then eventually hopefully most people around the world. But we\u2019re not - we\u2019re just going to focus on the everyday of making the services better and better.","Doug Mitchelson","The one follow-up to all that is, Ted, are you specifically targeting perhaps older demos you mentioned international with the product flow that you\u2019re looking on?","Ted Sarandos","No, the key here Doug is, you\u2019ve got this many people an incredible diversity of taste. So you have to have programming that really appeals to a broad demographic. So obviously a show like 13 Reasons why appeals much younger Grace and Frankie, which had a really successful third season launch obviously appeals to an older demographic. But the key is just people love television, people love to be entertained and the definition of what that thing is you\u2019re in love with is different for each age, each country, and having a lot of that that increases our chances of having a deep connection with consumers.","So that\u2019s why in Q2, we\u2019re launching a new season of a show, a new brand new set of comedy special, documentaries, kids\u2019 shows every week coming up. And this is the idea the chance that you\u2019re going to connect with somebody and it becomes their favorite show, or the reason they have Netflix it\u2019s higher and higher if you\u2019re able to do that.","Doug Mitchelson","Great. Thanks.","Scott Devitt","Sticking to the U.S. and speaking of genres and different types of content, you talk a little bit about Dave Chappelle. Why the sudden increase in standup comedy? What\u2019s the price to value that you find that you\u2019re getting out of that type of content?","Ted Sarandos","Well, there\u2019s always been an interest in standup comedy. It was actually back in our early original content days and the red envelope entertainment, it\u2019s all we did was produced original standup comedy and acquired documentaries and foreign language films, always had good luck with it just on a very small scale. And the format lends itself really well to what we\u2019re doing and that it\u2019s uncensored, it\u2019s commercial free, and that it allows for a lot of creative freedom and the fan base for these folks is very big.","So Dave Chappelle his return to standup comedy was a big event in the culture. And you could drew series level and movie level of viewing on some of these standup comedy specials if you pick them right and invest in them properly. So these were big ticket investments, but they\u2019re also performing like big ticket content. So we\u2019re thrilled with this so far.","Scott Devitt","And then family and kids content, Ted, you mentioned a little bit and talk more about that in terms of the interest in extending deeper there. And then on that topic as well faith-based programming, conservative programming, Hollywood does lean a little in one direction seems like there\u2019s a pocket, or opportunity there to serve a very big market?","Ted Sarandos","Yes absolutely. We\u2019re not - we\u2019re trying to find the content that people love and that\u2019s different for everyone, as I said earlier. So the faith-based market is something that we\u2019re engaged on the edges, but we\u2019re looking to do a lot more. And we\u2019re also looking for like our kids and family programming, and the really exciting thing is when you get something that can be viewed by both.","So that\u2019s the kind of phenomenon around Stranger Things or Fuller House, where you have these co-viewing opportunities that are so rare on TV these days, where it\u2019s a kids\u2019 show that parents enjoy watching and that don\u2019t get - don\u2019t have to cringe when they watch with their kids.","Scott Devitt","And then finally on this topic, the Disney deal. How\u2019s that progressing the interest in renewing that content specifically, or content like that? And what\u2019s your interest in - I believe there\u2019s a paramount deal that\u2019s available in the next few years as well? Thanks.","Ted Sarandos","Like I\u2019ve said before, our interest in Disney is different than our interest in a Pay 1 output deal from a studio, because Disney has really centered their brand on a couple of really important tempos that perform very well on Netflix and obviously perform well around the world.","So it\u2019s been a great relationship and continues to be a great relationship with Disney as a company producing our Marvel series as well as being their Pay 1 partner and hundred - several hundred hours of their catalog all the time. So it continues to be a great partnership and they\u2019re great supplier of content that people love so we\u2019ll see.","Reed Hastings","And while the Marvel series is global, the Disney Pay 1 is just U.S. and Canada, so it\u2019s not a global deal.","Scott Devitt","Great. Thank you.","Doug Mitchelson","From my end for Reed over the past few months, it seems like we\u2019ve had a number of important executives depart Netflix Chief Product Officer, Neil Hunt; Chief Talent Officer, Tawni Cranz; VP, Global Television, Sean Carey; seems like an unusual number of departures usually you\u2019re the one taking other companies executives. Any comment you want to make around this dynamic?","Reed Hastings","It is unusual. I mean, the last time we had an officer leave Netflix was 2012. So it\u2019s quite a while ago. We\u2019ve got to search on the Chief Talent Officer insiders and outsiders. And then we\u2019re fortunate to have Greg Peters take over for Neil Hunt. Greg has been a long-term Netflix veteran really knows the organization and excited about taking it forward and that transition will happen in about three months from now.","Doug Mitchelson","And so no particular signal that investors should take from this. It just happened to line up this way?","Reed Hastings","That\u2019s correct.","Doug Mitchelson","Thank you. Ted, you mentioned last quarter that it would be a second-half weighted content slate this year. Can you give us more of a sense of why you feel this way obviously 2Q looks pretty big with both House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. Is the second-half going to be even bigger?","Ted Sarandos","Well, we\u2019re introducing a lot of new brands in the second-half of the year, including some of our more aggressive moves into the movie business. Bright actually will be in the fourth quarter, which is our big Will Smith film that we think will kind of give consumers and everyone who watches this space a better idea of the kind of things we\u2019re up to in the movie space, which is those movies that you would see in the theaters. But they\u2019re available to you day in day out on Netflix and that they look and feel like movies of that scale.","Doug Mitchelson","I\u2019m sure you\u2019d love to expand on this topic in detail for the press. Any thoughts on the writers\u2019 strike?","Ted Sarandos","Look, we\u2019re keeping an eye on it like everybody else and like everybody else our productions would be impacted if it happens. We may be impacted a little bit less, because we\u2019re not on such a rigid production schedule, where we\u2019re not producing for the fall in the summer, we\u2019re in year round production. But some of our productions would be held up in the event of a strike, which our fingers are crossed that, that won\u2019t happen.","Doug Mitchelson","And the last thing I did want to follow-up, because I think I\u2019ll let you get away with not giving us an update on the usage trends. You guys willing to make any comment on whether usage is still growing and in the U.S. and overseas, and what level is that?","Reed Hastings","Correct. We said that viewing is strong, growing, healthy, but we haven\u2019t given specific numbers.","Doug Mitchelson","Okay. I missed that nuance again. So, Ted, are you want to?","Ted Sarandos","I did tell you - we did tell you that our subscribers have spent about a 0.5 billion hours watching Adam Sandler movies since Ridiculous 6 launched.","Doug Mitchelson","And I assume that\u2019s a good thing. And I think that Ted for you, is the originals as a percentage of spend and as a percentage of hours is fairly consistent. Is there an inconsistency there? Anything strategically that you\u2019re focused on in that dynamic?","Ted Sarandos","No, pretty consistent into the investment and the hours of spent watching. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve said before that the investment in original programming has been efficient, that\u2019s what we mean relative to what else you\u2019d spend the money on versus the hours of viewing. So and there we\u2019re not driving towards a target of a percent of original programming versus not. We\u2019re just trying to find the great things for people to watch that move our business and grow the subscriber base.","Scott Devitt","Great. Thanks. And I\u2019m going to try to help Doug get an answer on the viewing question. I think there was a disclosure in January 250 million hours of movie and TV in a single day in January, and the last prior disclosure to that was 125 million, which seemed to be like a run rate. And just wondering if that 250 million was an outlier, or if that is more of a run rate currently?","Reed Hastings","It\u2019s really not the total aggregate viewing as opposed to the median viewing by country is not something internally that\u2019s in our metrics pack. And so we don\u2019t even track it that closely, it\u2019s not that relevant. What we do track on a country by country basis is how median viewing at different lifetime slices is, and we continue to see good things in that, continue to see that grow as we have more content.","David Wells","And Scott, I\u2019d add, just like Reed. These are milestones or convenient sort of PR milestones in terms of announcing it, and some of that growth is by launching new territories. And now, we\u2019re more focused on growing each individual user within that territory than we are in terms of the big aggregate number, as Reed said.","Reed Hastings","If we can help you out, I remember that, YouTube announced there were 1 billion a day and when we looked it up and we\u2019re a little over 1 billion a week. So we\u2019ve got a long way to go to catch up to YouTube.","Scott Devitt","Thanks. And then downloading is also a fairly new phenomenon within Netflix, speak a little bit more about that, how it\u2019s being adopted within accounts? Also, any changes from a technology architecture standpoint that have needed to be done to produce that?","Reed Hastings","It\u2019s pretty small impact. I mean, you\u2019re not on airplanes or cars that much of your life, so it\u2019s really nice to have when you use it. But at least in Western and more well-off markets, where networks are strong and relatively inexpensive, it\u2019s a modest feature. I think in Asia it\u2019s a little bigger, because the networks you\u2019re off of an inexpensive network a lot of the time. But again, as networks get more modern, I think, we\u2019ll see that downloading the need for it will go down and down, because basically you want to be able to just click and watch. You don\u2019t want to have to think in advance outside of a couple of narrow scenarios like an airplane.","Scott Devitt","And has the reencoding that was discussed at Mobile World Congress, is that now complete?","Reed Hastings","No, we\u2019re still - there is no complete when you get to encoding, just keep getting better and better and better. And so we\u2019re continuing on all of that work, so that you can get an incredible picture quality on a very modest data plan on a phone.","Scott Devitt","Thank you.","Doug Mitchelson","So I\u2019m going to switch to competition and Amazon, specifically. Amazon\u2019s gone after a David Russell drama series with Robert De Niro producing the next series for Matt, these are sort of big tickets, big prices, very talented producers, actors and directors. Reed, when you look at the competitive landscape, anything at all that that makes you nervous, or that you feel like you have to accommodate, Ted, the fight for talent in Hollywood, any issues with Amazon ramping its originals and David on the cost side, could this influence the cost of originals higher than you\u2019d like?","Reed Hastings","Like at one level, Amazon is an amazing company and doing so many different things, it\u2019s really incredible. And then you think of Jeff Bezos in addition to all of Amazon doing a Washington Post and Blue Origin Rocket. So, I will say, we do think about all of that and their tremendous track record. On the other hand, they\u2019re doing great programming and they\u2019ll continue to do that. But I\u2019m not sure if it will really affect us very much, because the market is just so vast.","Think about it when you watch a show from Netflix and you get addicted to it, you stay up late at night. You\u2019re really - we\u2019re competing with sleep on the margin. And so it\u2019s a very large pool of time. And a way to see that numerically is that, we\u2019re a competitor to HBOs and yet over 10 years we\u2019ve grown to 50 million, and they\u2019ve continued modestly growing, they haven\u2019t trunk.","And so if you think about it as we\u2019re not really affecting them, the answer is, well, why? And that\u2019s because we\u2019re like two drops of water in the ocean of both time and spending for people. And so Amazon can do great work and it would be very hard for it to directly affect us. It\u2019s just home entertainment is not a zero sum game. And again, HBO success, despite our tremendous success is a good way to illustrate that.","Ted Sarandos","I would just add there are 500 cable channels, nearly every one of them have a original programming being produced every day. So it\u2019s great that there\u2019s a - it\u2019s an incredible opportunity for producers to have multiple buyers for their programming and a great opportunity for consumers to have a lot more opportunity to find new shows that they\u2019re going to love.","David Wells","And to Ted\u2019s points, I mean, there\u2019s more than just Amazon competing for those shows. So even if the show were lowering cost, we would have more content. You wouldn\u2019t necessarily would make the decision, I don\u2019t think to reduce the content level. We\u2019re already growing operating margin. We were able to grow us margin over the last four or five years and now we\u2019re switching to growing global operating margin.","So, we\u2019re already delivering that and also growing the content. So I think, sure I\u2019d love to have shows less expensive, but honestly we\u2019re more competing with the quality of the show and trying to push and improve the cinematic quality of that show, which is driving - has more of an influence on the cost of that than the individual competition within the market.","Doug Mitchelson","Absolutely. And Ted, to follow-up with your aspect of this, how is your relationship with Hollywood versus a year ago? How would you describe it? Does this dynamic come into play where at some point there\u2019ll be a backlash from Hollywood we always talk about? The media companies ultimately looking at Netflix as a competitor competing on online video platform versus them supplying you with content and making a lot of money off? But have you seen a change in that dynamic at with any of the studios?","Ted Sarandos","Well, this is probably the most dynamic time of change in the television - in the history of the television industry and how everybody navigates, it feels really important obviously. But we are on top of being a competitor for projects and a competitor for attention, where an enormous customer of all the studios who would license us their content, sell us their content, who produce content - original content for us.","So I think, the content evolution of the relationship is finding a balance between being a great supplier and a competitor. And the networks and the studios have navigated those waters since the beginning of television.","Doug Mitchelson","They have, but Hollywood goes for fits and starts and cycles. And right now, we\u2019ve got writers agitating for more money, the talents getting a greater share, you\u2019ve got a lot of cable networks that aren\u2019t licensing syndicated content like they used to. There\u2019s definitely a lot of change taking place and a lot of folks on Hollywood trying to figure out how exactly to wrestle with. But I guess, to your point, as you said, things are fine right now.","Ted Sarandos","Yes, we\u2019re 10 years in and those fits and starts have started on day one and continue today.","Doug Mitchelson","Well, Ted, I think you would also say that one of the fundamental changes is the globalization of TV. So I think that, that is playing through Hollywood, and I think it\u2019s playing through each one of the talent sections of Hollywood in terms of trying to understand what the value of content that\u2019s now applicable to a double the audience globally say?","Reed Hastings","Correct and who do you compete with today when in the U.S., with - incredible success with our Spanish language original Ingobernable and also with our Portuguese language original from Brazil 3%. So the pool of people who are competing for the attention of viewers and ultimately the attention of buyers, it\u2019s never been bigger.","Doug Mitchelson","Great. Thanks.","Scott Devitt","Speaking of studios, it seems like your initiatives with Netflix studio produced original content seem to be quite unique relative to others, or some recent media attention, Ted, I think you were quoted as suggesting spending several billion dollars in terms of allowing talent to be home when they actually create content.","Ted Sarandos","Yes.","Scott Devitt","Could you speak a little bit more about that, how you think that differentiates yourselves relative to competitors?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, look, it\u2019s - think about it as an extension of our talent-friendly commitments, but also in terms of our commitment to quality. And what we have found in our own business is that, if we create a great working environment for employee, they do the best work of their lives. And I think in the case of production, a lot of that comes off in the performance, which comes off in the screen. So where we want to invest in our talent the way we invest in our talent inside of Netflix and create the best shows on television. One way of doing that is not having people travel all around to chase a tax credit. And one - in that article that I had referred to this, it was suggesting that perhaps the state of California could be more effective in building - investing n infrastructure versus and setting individual productions, because if you give people a great place to work, they\u2019re going to have - they\u2019re going to come to - come work in your state.","Scott Devitt","And there\u2019s also I believe some job postings at least Netflix studio and the cloud and, it\u2019s been discussed also in terms of differentiating and infusing technology into the studio to create content in different ways. Can you expand on that a bit?","Ted Sarandos","It goes along the same lines, we\u2019re just giving people tools, right? We\u2019re giving the people the right - the best tools to work with. So when you\u2019re producing for Netflix - the Netflix studio that you have the most state-of-the-art tools at your disposal to create content and not get stuck in old technology. So we\u2019re trying to innovate on things that matter to consumers, but also things that matter to creators.","Scott Devitt","Does - and I don\u2019t know that this is connected to studio or not. But does the current infrastructure that you have in place does allow you to do live and near-live productions?","Ted Sarandos","It would - we have to invest in technology to do it. It\u2019s not - there\u2019s nothing that would prevent it from happening. But it\u2019s - our desire is to continue to double down on our consumer proposition of on demand. I think it is that kind of freedom that the consumer receives from Netflix of watching what they want whenever they want is part of the value proposition. And live is back to the kind of the old paradigm of appointment television.","Scott Devitt","Thank you.","Doug Mitchelson","Can we shift to sort of on that Amazon topic and the international topic combined. I guess, Ted, for you. Amazon is building out local content pretty aggressively, particularly India, Japan. India, there\u2019s talk of them starting up a studio. And you\u2019ve, I think for the last couple of years really espouse this Hollywood strategy of Hollywood content\u2019s global in nature and that can drive subscriptions globally. But you also believe on the studio here in the United States to pursue that more aggressively, does it make sense for you to more aggressively build out local studios overseas? And what capacity does the company have to even do that at this point?","Ted Sarandos","Well, we\u2019re definitely already building our production capabilities outside of the United States. Today - we\u2019re today filming local shows in 13 different countries, including India, including Japan. So we\u2019re doing it simultaneously. We think it\u2019s going to be the combination of the big global interest in original programming, complemented with a growing number of local language original series in each country. So we\u2019re operating all over the world. We\u2019re producing all over the world, because that\u2019s where our customers are.","Reed Hastings","And, Ted, maybe you could just talk a little as an example in those of Terrace House, Death Note and Secret Games to illustrate that.","Ted Sarandos","Well, the different - the various versions of it obviously would be something like producing - something that would be more on the quality level that you\u2019re used to seeing from Hollywood in India, a new series that we\u2019re producing coming up called Sacred Games.","In Japan, we have a show called Terrace House, it\u2019s incredibly popular more in the unscripted mode as more consistent with the things you see every day on television in Japan. And then a movie Death Note that we\u2019re producing today is epic piece of Japanese manga and anime that we\u2019re remaking and reimagining that storyline for the world with more of a Western spin. So those - the different takes on content from around the world opens up the world to a world of storytellers, and that\u2019s what\u2019s really exciting about doing it.","David Wells","Doug, I think it\u2019s worth, sorry, Doug. I think it\u2019s work noting too that from our perspective this isn\u2019t a change. You\u2019re - what you\u2019re seeing is the fulfillment of pipeline that\u2019s been building for two, two-and-a-half years. And the fact that we\u2019re operating in more territories. So I think, Ted, you would say this, this has been plans and works for a while. This isn\u2019t really a change from what we\u2019ve been talking about.","Ted Sarandos","Absolutely. Yes, we\u2019re deep in production in Spain, Italy, Germany for shows that we\u2019ll launch this year and we\u2019re going to continue to grow in that. Our Ingobernable was our second major series for Mexico, we\u2019ll have four from Brazil. So we\u2019re continuing to grow it out and grow up that capability domestically and internationally.","Doug Mitchelson","And do you think 20% local, 80% sort of Hollywood U.S. content is the ratio that still looks good to you today, or do you think that 20% is rising as the international markets?","Ted Sarandos","I\u2019d say that\u2019s the right picture, that\u2019s the right picture globally, Doug, and not to say that some countries won\u2019t be some variance of that. But I\u2019m not seeing a reversal of it in any territory.","Doug Mitchelson","The second topic I want to discuss was mobile, and I think, Neil Hunt before he retired talked about that since you\u2019ve launched the rest of the world mobile usage of Netflix has really soared, and that there\u2019s a lot that you\u2019re thinking about in terms of customizing content for mobile, or even operationally, any more details on mobile that any of the three of you are going to share?","Reed Hastings","Well, at first, Neil is still with us for the next couple of months. Second is, they\u2019re very experimental, just trying to figure out aspect ratio. So if you think of there were movies originally were very widescreen. When they showed on televisions that were 4:3 Technology developed pan and scan to be able to make that picture look a little better on a 4:3 screen.","And so we\u2019re just experimenting with variations of that of trying to figure out how to zoom in to be able to basically have faces be larger. But it\u2019s super experimental. It\u2019s a neat idea about how to adapt to the future.","Ted Sarandos","What we do know too is that the next 100 million subscribers are going to be far more likely to be watching content on mobile than the first 100 million, whether or not they want to watch anything differently, we\u2019re going to find out.","Reed Hastings","Let\u2019s get one question more from each of you guys.","Doug Mitchelson","So why don\u2019t I take the next one, because Scott and I agreed that he would get the last. I\u2019ll say for fun, Reed, how much longer to get the next 100 million subscribers if it took 10 years to get the first 100?","Reed Hastings","Well, to more than 10 million how you count the streaming shorter than the first 10, for sure. Scott\u2026","Scott Devitt","And then, Reed for you, if you were to like in your current global dominance in global streaming to any army in the history of the globe, what would that be today?","Reed Hastings","I got the invitation to go visit Albania. So I may - you may see some summer photographs from me with members of the Albanian army. But remember that that\u2019s all in fun and that Jeff Bewkes has been a great partner for us. So we do get him and he deserves that. But he really has been a great partner, and we think they will continue to be under AT&T for that matter. Again that comes back to the non-zero sum nature of entertainment. And the more we can all do great content, the better many different providers, including HBO, including Netflix will prosper. So it\u2019s up to us just to figure out how to provide the best entertainment possible. Thank you, everyone.","Scott Devitt","Thanks.","David Wells","Thank you.","Ted Sarandos","Thank you."],"15631":["Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Q1 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call April 21, 2014  5:00 PM ET","Executives","David Wells - Chief Financial Officer","Reed Hastings - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer","Ted Sarandos - Chief Content Officer, Vice President - Content","Analysts","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","David Wells","Great. Hi. I am David Wells, CFO of Netflix, and I would like to welcome everyone to today's Q1 2014 earnings interview. I am joined today on the company side by Reed Hastings, CEO; and Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer. Interviewing us will be Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research and Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan.","We will be making forward-looking statements in today's earnings interview. Actual results may vary.","At this point, I would like to turn it over to Rich Greenfield for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Thanks, David, and thank you to Reed and Ted as well for having both Doug and myself co-moderate your Q1 earnings conference call. I think we are going to go back and forth and switch between Doug and myself asking questions.","The first question we would like to address to Reed Hastings. The question I think is on everyone's mind right now is why is now the right time for a price increase? I know a few years ago, you had talked about the need to wait a few years to raise pricing. Is it merely that a few years has passed? Or is there something else driving the need to raise pricing?","And then attached to that, how should people think about the flow through of the revenue you are going to generate from that higher price increase? Will that be reinvested in content? Or should we expect all of that to drop to the bottom line?","Reed Hastings","Rich, over the last couple of years, we have been improving the content selection on Netflix and broadening it, most recently with the addition of the amazing shows like House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black, and if we want to continue to expand to do more great original content, more series, more movies, we have to eventually increase prices a little bit. We are not doing much. We are doing $1 or $2, depending on the country and all the existing subscribers keep their current price. They don't get it increased. So therefore the revenue increase to Netflix will be quite modest in the short-term and eventually as new members come in, they pay a little bit more and with that we will be able to license much more content and deliver a very high quality video.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And Reed, would you still think about tiering going forward? Or has this potentially removed that possibility over time?","Reed Hastings","No, that's definitely a possibility. We are continuing to look at that. So the big focus is on this increase and we want to get this done well and make sure we grandfather people cleanly and it is something we're definitely looking at.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","But you still believe that through a tiered structure over time, it's possible. What are the things that you could potentially tier on? Concurrent streams, standard def, high def, number of devices, content? How do you think about that?","Reed Hastings","Well, we have tiering now. We have two plans. We have the two stream at a time that's $7.99 and we have the four stream at a time which is $11.99. So we have tiering today, and it is definitely something we are thinking about in terms of expanding the options that consumers have. Some of that being on the criteria that you referred to.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Is the two-year, Reed, that you talked about in Ireland for grandfathering, is that what you deem generous as you think about how to properly support the current subscriber base that you have with the price increase? And how will you actually communicate the risk to a consumer of dropping out and then being tagged with a higher price, if they choose to come back?","Reed Hastings","Well, you are talking about $1 or $2 difference per month. So I don't think it's a huge difference, and then yes, the two years very generous. We will do between a year and two. We are still looking at what's come of that. So we will be able to announce more details later.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And David, how would you think about how you would reinvest the dollars from the price increase into additional content or allowing that to fall more down to the bottom line?","David Wells","Well, Doug, we said before that mostly it is going to be towards content. It is about improving our service and if you think about generous grandfathering, that is going to bleed in over time in terms of the average subscription price. It will take a while. I think it will be gradual. At the point where we reach 30% where we think it is coming up, we will look at the business and make the right long-term choices for both profitability as well as a long-term profitability, which you get from a very strong consumer offering, which means content as well.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","David. I think actually on the last conference call, Reed had talked about as you get to the 30% domestic contribution margin, it would get tougher to expand by 400 basis points a quarter. Does the price increase doing it now actually change that forecast? Is it easier to add 400 basis points to margins domestically in both 2015, 2016 and beyond?","David Wells","So adding revenue makes it, by nature, easier but what he is referring to is the fact that the numbers get larger, right. That margin is a percent of revenue. So as that number gets larger and larger it gets harder and harder to add 100 basis points or 400 year-on-year. So I don't think it changes anything in the calculus when we say that when we reach 30% we will look at the situation, we will look at the company and make the right smart long-term choices, including how much we put to content, how much we put in terms of streaming delivery and product, how much to marketing and then how much to profit.","Reed Hastings","And Ted, do you want to talk for a minute about the new content and some of the things, at least in general, that we will be able to do post the price increase?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, I mean we are rapidly expanding our original production. We have several productions in running today all around the world and I think when you look at the size and scope and the ambition level of some of these projects, you will see that this is a great time for consumers because people who were never working in television before are thrilled to be working in television today and doing some of the best work of their life. At higher budgets, sure, but that's a good thing for everybody, including us because we are in the position to be able to bring that kind of production level to our store members.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","David, the comment about international profitability from existing markets expected by the end of the year. Is it fair to assume that the U.K. is profitable now with Latin America still experiencing losses?","David Wells","We didn't say anything specifically about individual markets. I think what we have said and we had reiterated that each market has gotten better. Both has been growing and has been improving in terms of a loss but we didn't give any specifics about it. We wanted to give that comment about our overall profitability of all of our existing markets to demonstrate that before we launch another substantial expansion that we are pretty confident in our existing performance in the markets we have today.","Reed Hastings","And Doug, I would add that we are very confident of our success in Latin America as well as the U.K. So we are making great progress in every country, which is giving us a big ambition for this next round of European expansion.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","A question for David on a follow-up. When you look at that $300 million to $400 million, I think that you kind of got hit by as you launched both the U.K. and Latin America, should we expect a similar type negative impact on profitability internationally as you get into markets like France and Germany?","David Wells","Well, we didn't give specific guidance, Rich, in terms of an actual number, but I would say that if you think about the U.K. and looking at our financials at the time we launched the U.K., that was a substantial market for us. If you look at what our financials would be today and into 2015, given the comment about our international profit, starting to be profitable starting in 2015, then you would have to assume that those investments will be of that size.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Just moving over to profitability on the U.S. side. I think in the quarter, you saw about 460 basis points of year-over-year increase in contribution margin, David. Where do you feel like you generated the most upside here?","David Wells","You mean in terms of the year-on-year growth, Doug? Or are you talking about versus forecast?","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Versus the 400 basis points?","David Wells","Sure. Year-on-year growth really is about growing our members faster than we are growing our content spend. So I don't think there is any one particular leverage point other than a managed level of content growth. We continue to get more efficient across other parts of our business, but the content spend is the largest piece of that. So it's about managed growth.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","A question for Ted. When you look at House of Cards, I think you are getting a lot of focus on the fact that, you already even said before, that season two would have a bigger impact on your overall subscriber growth and net additions than season one because people have become comfortable with the show. When you look at what happened in Q1 did that actually bear itself? Or is there a way to actually show or tell that season two of House of Cards actually had a greater impact than season one?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, I mean we are getting more sophisticated about how we measure it as well, Rich and I think that what we see is a hungry audience for season two versus a curious audience in season one. So in season one, Netflix subscribers had no idea what a Netflix original series would be like. So there was some curiosity, but certainly not a lot of excitement going in and then season two, there was a lot of pent-up demand. We saw a lot of very early front weighted viewing for the launch, which kind of told us that America was ready for more and dug in right away. And as we mentioned in the letter, we have been actually thrilled so far with the show from the early launch relative to how you would measure television on any show on basic cable or premium cable, and I only give you that information, by the way, to help you understand the class of viewing to think about a show like House of Cards.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","And do you think are shows become more - are shows becoming more expensive, prompting you to need to raise pricing to afford the shows that you want to create, just because the cost of the individual episode is rising throughout the industry?","Ted Sarandos ","Yes, it's partially, Rich. I think what's happening is that we are committing to larger budget shows not that the same show is more expensive to make year-on-year. We are looking at kind of shows that we are competing with. We are still only competing with kind of the top end of cable for those shows. So when I think about it like a sports team where the bidding gets quite high on a couple of key pieces of talent, but the overall salaries, they are kind of in check.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And Ted, do you feel like you are seeing a similar dynamic play out as you head towards the second season of Orange as well here, in terms of the way the viewer base builds?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, I mean we have said before, Orange Is the New Black has been our most-watched show. So we are pretty excited to see what an even bigger mob looks like when who is hungry for season two starting June 6.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","And Ted, when you look at HBO, they had a big hit this last quarter with True Detective and I think it was a show that Netflix was bidding on and actually wanted and thought would work well for Netflix. Curious they still rolled it out on a week-by-week basis and seemed to build a lot of excitement and social media buzz around their releasing strategy. Do you ever look at kind of what is happening at HBO and say maybe there are other ways of doing things in the U.S. the way you even experimented with some doing it overseas?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, I mean we look at it all the time. I think that works well for them. I think this works well with us or for us. I think the promise for our members is that we are going to stay focused on what they like and what they like is to watch more than one at a time and we don't know the exact magic number of how many at a time, but giving people the option to watch as much as the entire season, I think works well and fits well with our brand promise. And by the way, it may be that in the future, we could roll out shows in different release models the way we did with the Turbo cartoons and like to your point, we are in other countries with other American, U.S. TV shows that we premiere outside of the U.S. like we will with Breaking Bad spin up, Better Call Saul, as we did recently with From Dusk till Dawn and we will with Fargo.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","A question for Ted and for David. Are you still on track when you stated double your investment in originals in 2014, but still keep it below the 10% of total content spending level?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, it had been in our previous and that's what is still trending.","David Wells","Yes, and this is David. I would say, Doug, that we sort of migrated away from the 10% number just because that number is going to grow. It is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger. But yes, it is still accurate to say that we have doubled year-on-year, but it still, as a percent of our overall content spend, is less than 10%.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","I guess this is a question for Reed, although it could - probably could be addressed to a few of you. When you think about the amount of money you are going to be investing in content in 2015, especially with the firepower you are going to get from the price increase, how do you think about your total addressable market in the U.S.? Is it starting to move towards higher levels than you had thought before just given the amount of content you are actually going to be producing?","Reed Hastings","Rich, about three years ago we identified the model, that we think in the fullness of time we can be two to three times larger than domestic HBO, linear HBO which would be 60 to 90 million subscribers in the U.S. and that model anticipated that as we got to 40, we would get better, as we get to 50 we would get better. So I would say all of those improvements in the model that we think of our built-in to our 60 to 90 million member projection for the domestic market and so we stand by that. Every year that we add another five or six million members, makes us feel a little bit more confident of getting into that range which is great. And then, with that we are able to add more content and continue to make the service better.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And just following up on that question, Reed can you comment on whether the recent subscriber growth performance is coming were from gross adds or from lower churn? And in particular, can you give us some more detail on what has been happening to churn in the U.S. over the past year?","Reed Hastings","I think most of the growth, Doug, is coming from member satisfaction. When members are really satisfied they tell their friends about the service and they retain better. So it is really driven from member side and when we have great shows coming and unique exclusive and things that make people so passionate about Netflix, then they are again more likely to tell their friends and more likely to stay. And so it's a mix of both of those things. But fundamentally, it's member satisfaction. Without member satisfaction, you can't get much growth and of course you don't have good retention. But with it, you get both aspects are very good. And that's what we have been really focused on. In the letter we talked about our advertising strategy evolving towards more emotive and brand and content and away from direct response and we realized through testing that we don't need to be running around saying Netflix free trial nearly as much. That's very commercial and reductionist. And that by focusing on the core elements of member satisfaction and the content that you get if you join Netflix we can get to a much bigger market share and a better connection with members and then when they come to our website and see that they get a free trial, they are doubly happy, but that's not the core reason to come to Netflix.","Ted Sarandos","If I could just elaborate on it going back to Rich's earlier question about satisfaction. The all-at-once model, for one thing, that sure generates is a lot of satisfaction. So if you are stuck in Washington DC and New York in the middle of a snowstorm and you want to spend the weekend watching House of Cards, it's something not only that brings people a lot of joy, it's something you can't do anywhere else. So that's why we invest in that model as well.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Reed, it sort of seems like you are looking at HBO where they never talk about, hey HBO is $15. They just talk about the value that HBO brings to the consumer from the content standpoint. Is that fair to think about?","Reed Hastings","Yes, I wouldn't say it's because of HBO. I think of it as you know, many great services talk about how they are great and then the pricing is fair and you have to pay to get the thing, but if you want to talk about the great aspect of the service and bring that to the fore that's generally great marketing and HBO is an example of that great marketing. But we are not trying to copy them specifically. We are learning and doing best practices as they have been doing for a while.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Reed, just another question, little bit related to the competitive landscape. Amazon has seen some strong growth recently in terms of Prime subscribers, saying that they are basically north of 20 million at this point, and also rolling out Fire TV. How is all that impacting Netflix and what are your thoughts on the recent Prime price increase and whether that has any impact to you?","Reed Hastings","Well, Prime is a great service. I am a Prime member and most Netflix employees are Prime numbers and it's coming across to most people in our society is, it is very complementary to Netflix. People look at them as multiple channels. You saw that Amazon included us on the Fire TV and of course we been before on the Kindle Fires and it's a great relationship all around where we have got unique content, they have got some unique content. They are also doing originals. There are multiple networks out there. It's a very much not a zero-sum game and we are building this ecosystem together that's about Internet video and the more players there are in Internet video, the bigger that ecosystem gets. In the big theme is Internet video is taking share away from linear video. So we are all participating in that transformation.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","When you look at net neutrality peering interconnection, Reed, you wrote a letter that basically made it sound like you thought that peering and interconnection was a direct net neutrality violation or at least violated the principles. FCC Chairman Wheeler said they are more cousins than they actually are the same thing. You had said, I think two calls ago, that you would not need to pay distribution, meaning ISPs for the amount of content you were serving. You reversed that this quarter. I guess, just kind of from an overall standpoint, can you just address what happened this quarter with Comcast and how you think about the future of the Internet?","Reed Hastings","Sure. The Internet is in constant evolution in terms of the relationships and interconnection that we see. So we did end up choosing to pay Comcast to improve the video quality that our members experience. We don't think we should have to, but in the short-term we felt like we had no choice. So we have got that deal in place. In addition, more lobbying for this idea that we think is very natural, which is interconnect as part of net neutrality, it's a stronger form of net neutrality and now we are in opposition to the Comcast, Time Warner merger because we are really concerned about what happens when the combined entity, if the merger were to go through, would have with over 60% of U.S. homes passed and eventually over 50% of U.S. homes subscribing to cable Internet and that's a worrisome factor. So we think it's more in the public interest to either not have them merge or if the government goes ahead with it, to at least put some significant merger agreements, settlements in there.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And Reed, just as a follow-up, when you say that you had no choice, I am assuming that is coming from a member satisfaction perspective. Did you see a change in relation to churn or just overall member satisfaction in the Comcast footprint and then can you also talk about since that deal was signed and you are obviously seeing big pickups in speeds since then, but are you seeing the corresponding lift in member satisfaction as well?","Reed Hastings","Not that I know of. I don't think we have surveyed member satisfaction differentially between Comcast. I imagine it is very much true, but we had years of a good experience on Comcast broadband for our members and then it was only in the prior six months when it started declining rapidly. So it's a fairly short term thing. We are glad we have got that now fixed. I think it will just work out over time if we can get to no-fee interconnects not only for Netflix but for Cogent, for Level 3, for Akamai. We are going to have a bigger, stronger Internet if everyone can agree that that's a better model than say, retrans. It started off with a very small fee and then escalated into this blackout type model that has been a real problem for the industry and for consumers. So we are trying to avoid that by seeing if we can move everyone to no-fee interconnect.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","But I assume if we had, Reed, if we had Brian Roberts sitting on this panel, he would basically look at what you have just said and say, I spend billions of dollars to dig trenches to get the Internet, meaning to get Netflix, from your offices all the way out to consumers all across the country. If you are going to take up so much of that capacity and force me to actually spend even more money to reach that end consumer, that's not all going to be on me. You are going to have to pay for some of that. What's wrong with that, I guess, in terms of you sharing the burden and the reality is there's always been paying on the Internet whether it's been Level 3 or Cogent. It's not like the concept of peering and interconnection being paid peering is a new concept.","Reed Hastings","No, actually it is. So in the original days of the Internet, it was the opposite, which is the ISP paid Level 3 for interconnect and it's only the very large ISPs that now are able first to demand they are not paying and now to demand payment from the transits. So there's been a real shift in the last five years, but Brian Roberts is incredibly thoughtful. I mean I would say, if there is anyone that you wanted to trust with controlling half of the U.S. internet, you might pick Brian Roberts. He is very thoughtful, very long-term about it and very reasonable. But I don't know that we want anybody to control half of the U.S. internet and that's the real basis of our objection to the merger.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And Reed, how do you think about the likelihood that you would potentially do similar interconnect deals with other providers, with telcos, for example?","Reed Hastings","Well, we have got peering agreements and interconnect agreements with probably 100 ISPs around the world, including many very large ones. So that's an ongoing, say that was only in the case of Comcast when it got to such a bad state and then recovered very quickly, thankfully, that it was so visible.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Then just a question for David, I guess tied to all of this. Could you give us any sense on how these deals are structured? Meaning, is there any way to think about what the cost of interconnection is going to be to Netflix from a provider like Comcast? Does it account for 4K? Or when you launch 4K, do you have to pay Comcast substantially more, et cetera?","David Wells","Well, Rich, we don't talk about the exact specifics of the deal, but as you might imagine, we have been thoughtful about what might be important down the road in the future, including those items that would be important for us to provide our consumers. Comcast and the interconnect fees that we might have to pay are a portion of the expenses that we borne including increased content as we have added more and more content. I would say its part of the pattern. Content continues to be our largest piece of expense on our P&L.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And Reed just a follow-up there, when you think about the amount of bandwidth capacity that Netflix is utilizing as well as other just large Internet companies, is there a longer term capacity problem in the U.S., just in terms of bandwidth, especially as you push more towards 4K TVs?","Reed Hastings","Doug, you can think of it as Netflix is using this bandwidth, but I think it's more correct to think of it as consumers are paying for 20 megabit or a 50 megabit package from an ISP, and then they deserve to be able to use that speeds that they have paid for [AUDIO GAP]","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","-- and the importance of IPTV boxes to your business. We went to the Amazon Fire TV launch, and when we were using the box, we noticed that when you said something like --","David Wells","Sorry, I am being told that we are going to interrupt for a second. And just stand by, we may have had a blip here. So we are going to restart. So I will have to ask you to restart your question.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Okay tell me when.","David Wells","Sure thing. At least this time, we had a protocol for a restart here.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Did we lose the last question?","David Wells","Yes, I would assume that. Sorry, this is David Wells. Are we back live? Okay, great. This is David Wells and I apologize for the interruption. I am going to ask Rich Greenfield to repeat just the question he just asked. So, Rich please, repeat.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Hi, Reed, we attended the Amazon Fire TV launch recently and when we were using the device, we noticed that if you said the words Downtown Abbey, it immediately brought up all of the content that was available as part of your Amazon Prime subscription, but yet when you said something like House of Cards, it immediately did bring up the content. However, it was only for Amazon's paid service. You had to actually buy each individual episode and when we asked why it didn't actually direct you to the Netflix app which is a featured app, it said because they don't have access to your API unless you want them to have access to your API. And I guess that brings to the question of how do you think about how you work with an IPTV box like the Fire TV which is also a competitor in Amazon Prime for video?","Reed Hastings","Well, Amazon has been very straightforward about treating that platform as an open platform and we definitely want to be in voice search and we will be in voice search. We are just still working on the mechanics of it. So there's no fundamental issue. There's just some timing and scheduling things that came together. I wish we could have made the initial launch date, but it's definitely something that will come out this year.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","So you don't mind the overarching search being driven by Amazon's search versus your recommendation engine?","Reed Hastings","We have that capability also on different MVP docks, boxes, also on the Roku where there's an overall search for titles. So we recognize that. Now when you are in the Netflix app, you get a more custom tailored search experience with various suggestions, but it's up to us to continue to improve that and Amazon has been extremely straightforward and open about allowing us to use that voice search and that's something we are working on.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Reed, in your letter you mentioned MVPD integrations coming in the U.S. this quarter. Is it fair to assume that you will continue to maintain that billing and customer relationship going forward? Will they look like the initial MVPD set-top box deals that you have done in Europe?","Reed Hastings","Definitely, that's a way to start. It can also look like the Apple TV where that's billed through iTunes. I mean whether it's iTunes, PayPal or Virgin doing the billing, it doesn't make that much difference. So you will always have, as a consumer, multiple options and how that's integrated. As long as it's a separate line item on the bill, whatever the price of Netflix is in that territory.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","And Reed, given the peering interconnection deal you signed with Comcast, is it fair to believe that at some point this year you will actually be on the X1 box, which I know is something that you have talked about wanting to be on?","Reed Hastings","Yes, we are definitely staying in the state of we want to be on it, but I don't have anything more to announce today.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Ted, just in terms of content, we get a lot of questions about House of Cards season three and what's going on in Maryland in terms of production and Reed is smiling now. Can you just give us a little more color in terms of the status there? Is there any concern here for Netflix customers or investors going forward around that third season?","Ted Sarandos","No. Keep in mind, the relationship is fairly complicated there, where you have the production company who receives the benefit of a tax incentive from the State of Maryland to keep the show in Maryland. There have been ongoing negotiations between MRC who produces the show for us and the State of Maryland. But I would anticipate that these are overcome-able issues and it's a very competitive world out there in terms of attracting production. The tax incentives in place for House of Cards in Maryland have resulted in hundreds and hundreds of jobs and not just for actors, but for carpenters and waitresses and hotel workers. The amount of hotel nights and meals that the production of a television series brings to a state is staggering. So I think this has been one of those really interesting kind of political volleyballs in Maryland, but Maryland has been really great to the show and we love being there and we are hoping that MRC and the state work that out. The investors and fans are not at risk in any way.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Ted, as a follow-up on content, have you started to see leverage from your international distribution footprint in terms of getting the rights to a series, meaning now that you are in X number of countries outside the U.S., is it becoming easier? Is that an advantage to actually buying series? Or is that still on the coming until you launch more major countries in Europe and Asia?","Ted Sarandos","It's helpful. That's where I think we will see a lot more meaningful measurement of it, as we expand more aggressively, but I think even seeing things like doing licensing North America together, you see it and we are premiering shows that premier on U.S. networks on Netflix around the world. Being a single buyer for multiple territories puts us in a unique class of buying. And we hope to realize some economic advantage of that, but also just then being able to coordinate a massive marketing relationship with the studios and networks that produce those shows that we can then take and be a one-stop for them in a world that's pretty fragmented today. So I think we could bring a lot of efficiencies as a global buyer. Just today the studios and networks aren't setup to be global sellers yet.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Ted, just following up on that. Do you want to move more toward owning original content directly, more end-to-end and the effect giving you sort of greater control over international rights distribution going forward? How do you think about that?","Ted Sarandos","Doug, I think we see it as what we wanted to do is we want to be able to make those decisions for how the content is exploited and the more ownership you have, the more likely you can do that, but you can also do that through negotiations in very long-term license deals as well. So I don't have any religion around ownership versus licensing as long as we get that suite of rights that we are looking for and you will see us going forward doing a mix of both because once you decide you only get new programming that you own, I think that you forgo a lot of great programming. I think we have actually seen that in the kind of weakening of the programming on networks today that lean more to like almost 85% ownership that the quality of the programming suffers for it. We want to put the quality of the programming first and then set deals second. But all along, what we want to do is be able to have much more control over the way the content is exploited on and off of Netflix.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","And Ted, are deals that you are not getting purely based on price? Meaning, you just don't have enough dollars that you can allocate to original programming and so you couldn't bid to win something like True Detective? Or are there still shows that want to be on one of the existing linear traditional television net outlets?","Ted Sarandos","No, I would say that a lot of the programing that we are seeing premier are shows that have passed through these doors and it's not that we couldn't afford them. It's just that relative to what we believe the audience is, the deal didn't make sense. So you either want to make a deal at the price that you want or one that you will be happy to see your competitor pay. So a lot of that is at play. But I don't think there was any, we would rather by on one versus the other, I think the Netflix is a number one or number two spot destination for these shows almost across the board these days. We are very proud of that and happy with that.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","And Ted, where do you stand with rights to recent originals like House of Cards and Orange in international markets? Would you launch in certain markets, for example, France and Germany if you did not have all your original content there?","Ted Sarandos","Yes, sure we would, because we are going to have a lot of new original shows that will launch between now and then. And we will also have shows that we are premiering in France and Germany and other markets around Europe that we won't necessarily have in the United States. It's like we talked about earlier with Dusk till Dawn, the Breaking Bad spin-off, Better Call Saul as examples. So there's a lot of ways that the original offering may be slightly different outside of the U.S. in multiple territories and some of those original shows as we launch in other territories around Europe and around the world. We will go back and renegotiate and pull some of those rights back.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Maybe that's a good segue to talk about international. Reed, when you look at international markets, a lot has been made of France and Germany being the next two markets that Netflix targets. I guess, as you think about those markets, how do you think about the competitive landscape in continental Europe as well as the appetite for U.S. content relative to where you have launched previously, which are generally more English speaking markets?","Reed Hastings","Well, we have seen tremendous success in the Netherlands, where we launched six months ago, and that, I think, encourages us about being able to figure out the right programming formula in each nation. We have had success in Argentina. We have had success in Mexico, in the U.K. and in the Nordics and now Netherlands. We are going to get into a broad set of markets. We are going to learn as we go. If we are very fortunate, we will have programmed it completely correctly from day one. More likely we will figure out some stuff's working, some stuff's not. We will adjust the formula, but what we have become really convinced about is around the world, people want the convenience of Internet on-demand video and that that really is a very big and broad need. So we are stepping up on the international expansion and we are just going to be pushing ahead market-by-market.","Ted Sarandos","And keep in mind, our original shows like House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black have become enormous successes in all of those territories. In France, as an example, the most popular television show in France is The Mentalist from CBS. So I don't think that there's some unique hindrance because it's not a primarily English speaking territory for Netflix.","David Wells","Yes, Ted, this is David. I was going to make the same point in terms of Brazil being a very non-English speaking market and lots of demand for Western or Hollywood produced content. So Doug and Rich, I think we have got time for one question from each of you.","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","All right, one more each. Pressure is on. In your letter Reed, when you are talking about the 2Q guidance or the outlook there, you basically talk about, you use the words even in a year with full-year growth in terms of subscribers. So I guess, what gives you that confidence this year in 2014 that you can deliver more net adds than you did in 2013?","Reed Hastings","Well, we always hope to grow net adds both on a year-over-year basis and quarter-over-quarter. We are making good progress on that, but I don't think that we have specific guidance. We don't have specific guidance for the year. So what we are saying there is really a mathematical point, which is even in a year where you are up year-over-year, you can have Q2 be down year-over-year because of the increased seasonality. So you wouldn't want to interpret that or misinterpret it as a backhanded way of sliding in full-year guidance. We are just sticking with our quarterly guidance model at this point and things are looking good.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Reed, when you think about international expansion, one of the things that I think a lot of investors have emailed us about is pay TV penetration and obviously you are a broadband, or your service rides on broadband, but a lot of people look at the relative pay TV penetrations in several of these overseas markets. Do you look at that as a key driver of where you decide to launch? Or is it all about broadband penetration, meaning what are the key things you are looking at to figure out where to launch next and what the total addressable market is in each of these countries?","Reed Hastings","Well, I think we are going to turn out to see that the total addressable market over time are human beings that enjoy TV shows and movies, because everybody is going to be on the internet. In terms of pay TV penetration, its relative low in the U.K., about 60% and we have been very successful there. So when we look at that, we just see there is an unmet need and whether something is a relatively small broadband, or sorry small pay TV penetration or already large like Canada at 90%, we have been successful in both of those kinds of markets. Again it comes back to the fundamentals of people wanting to have the convenience and simplicity that the internet enables, whether that's on a smartphone, on a tablet or a smart TV. So that's what's making us optimistic about the long-term in international. Each quarter, we will have some real work to do to figure things out, but I think we are going to find that it's a very big opportunity. Go ahead.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","Are you seeing wireless become a bigger part of your story in terms of actual time spent watching, especially overseas?","Reed Hastings","There is a funny dichotomy. So there is a good amount of watching on a mobile phone, but unusually when it's on Wi-Fi, because of the data caps. So wireless plan, cellular plans generally have data caps between two and five gigabytes, which you can use up pretty quickly and consumers are very aware of whether they are on Wi-Fi or not, and so they are using their mobile phones and tablets, but mostly on Wi-Fi rather than on cellular. Now if with 4G, we see more competition and lowering prices and eventually uncapped plans as they try to compete with wired, then we could see more of that but right now, that's not what we are seeing in wireless. Go ahead.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG Research","I was going to say, so if the FCC seems focused on encouraging intermodal competition, if Sprint and TMO were to actually merge, that could actually create more competition for Comcast and be good for Netflix?","Reed Hastings","It's a long way till 4G. They first have to be competitive with Verizon and AT&T Wireless and that's quite a challenge that they are focused on. So I am afraid that that, as a realistic alternative, is very speculative at this point that they would be able to compete for residential broadband with cable. So at this point, cable is the dominant technology. So with that, let me thank you guys for being on and interviewing us. David, did you want to close?","David Wells","No, I was just giving you the heads up that we are out of time. So please conclude comments and go ahead.","Reed Hastings","Great. Okay. Thank you everyone. With that, we will sign off.","David Wells","Thank you."],"15638":["Netflix, Inc.

I am joined on my right by Reed Hastings, our CEO; and Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer.","Interviewing us today will be Peter Kafka from Re\/code; and Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Just a reminder a cautionary statement that we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary.","Over to the first interview question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Ben Swinburne","I\u2019ll start out, maybe for Reed and the team, can you reflect on the fourth quarter results for us that we are all going through right now, in particular, talk about the international strength, you mentioned you were pleased with the October - September-October launches, so can we infer that the outperformance versus your expectations may be came from those areas or any color you can give us on the international strength to start us off?","Reed Hastings","You know we\u2019ve got over 50 countries in Q4, so we had a lot of experience Ben, predicting these markets. And then we launched in Japan in early September and Spain, Portugal and Italy in mid-October and let\u2019s say they\u2019ve gone very well as we said in the letter. In terms of the outperformance, it was pretty broad based, many different contributors around the world to that.","Now what we are seeing basically is that this on-demand Internet TV, watch wherever and whenever you want, it\u2019s very popular wherever you go in the world.","Ben Swinburne","And just taking that question over to U.S. for you also may be for David, a little bit later this quarter then your guidance or budget, talk to us a little bit of the churn connects dynamic and anything you would want to add around credit card chipsets or any other issues you want to bring up around Q4 performance in the U.S.?","David Wells","Well Q4 I would say was pretty close to our projections, we\u2019re literally with an hours of it, but so we did anticipate that net additions would be lighter year-on-year. I would say the credit card was a background issue in Q3, it continues to be a background issue. But the larger thing is that it\u2019s just the next 50 million or a little harder than the first 50 million in terms of growth and we are doing everything on the content side, on the product side, we\u2019re continuing to improve that service, but you\u2019re seeing that the law or large numbers when you grow steady at 5 million, 6 million net additions a year on a larger number then that percentage growth is smaller year-over-year and that\u2019s what we predicted and that\u2019s what you see in our guide for Q1 as well.","Peter Kafka","Hey guys, last quarter you said credit card issues were bad rate issue, this quarter you said they are background issue, how long do you anticipate this is going to be a problem for you additionally, any sense of why you are the only major consumer company, that\u2019s called this out as a problem?","David Wells","I don\u2019t think where the - Peter, this is David, I don\u2019t think that were the only one. I think because we are recurring merchant anywhere from five to ten basis points, 15 basis points is sensitive to us, we have optimized, we spend a lot of time optimizing our recurring billing systems in our approach and so we are very sensitive to it. Again it\u2019s a small thing. I think we want to focus on the larger things and not the small things. And we anticipate that the ENV rollout will continue into 2016 into Q1 and Q2 and we\u2019ll always have even globally these issues where there is mass reissues of things and disruptions in the recurring systems that we have.","Peter Kafka","So this be fall into the small thing category but last quarter you added IOS signups, any impact surprising one way or another from that?","Reed Hastings","You know we\u2019ve always been able, customers have always been able to sign up on IOS but they had to do it in the mobile web Safari Browser and now they can do it in app. And it\u2019s a positive, it\u2019s not transformational but it\u2019s really nice positive and a particular in new markets as we expand around the world where we\u2019re less note and less trusted, the comfort for customers in terms of using the Apple payment mechanism versus entering their international credit card information is helpful. So think of it has one more in our long list of great payment options that we have.","Ben Swinburne","Reed, I want to come back to the outlook in the Q1 guidance in particular, starting with international, you mentioned in the letter, the 2016 markets are you are playing the long game here, but the guidance is obviously impressive and well above the expectation. So is some of - are the 2016 launch is a big contributor to what you are expecting in Q1 and sort of for the year internationally or just continue momentum building on the existing markets, any color you can share there?","Reed Hastings","Yes, a lot of both. I mean honestly our global guides for over 6 million net additions will be a record for Netflix and so we are super excited about that. And what\u2019s amazing is we\u2019re seeing some of our new shows like \u201cMaking A Murderer\u201d not only be huge here in the U.S. but it\u2019s emerging as a big hit around the world for us. And you kind of expect Jessica Jones to carry internationally and once been phenomenal about Ted\u2019s teams programming is that you know these more unusual content titles have also had great draw around the world.","Ben Swinburne","Let me just ask you about the U.S. just to pick up on David\u2019s comment with the next 50 million, so what are you doing as a management team maybe that\u2019s head on the content side, what is your research telling about the people who actually don\u2019t have Netflix today, what is there, some generous that\u2019s not being addressed well enough, is there a distribution decision you guys need to make to go after that, what are you doing to maybe go after that other opportunity in the U.S. market.","Reed Hastings","Well, David is big thinker, so he is thinking about the next 50 million, I\u2019ll stick with the next 5 million. And when we can clearly see the next 5 million, it\u2019s I\u2019ve been hearing a lot about it but nothing yet has compelled me to join. And so the big driver is getting people excited about whatever title we have and then making it easy for them to join. So whether it\u2019s integrating on the Smart TV or integrated into the MVPD set-top or the Apple TV those are the things that make it easy to fulfill that desire. But the underlying desire is for these new titles which is why we are so excited about the year coming and the content the Ted teams put together, so maybe he can talk about some of the big hallmarks we have in the next few months.","David Wells","Yeah, I mean just upcoming in this quarter, you are going to see, so then we as - we were pleasantly surprised by how excited the world is overfull our house. So this upcoming, you ask about different kinds of programming for the next 50 million or 5 million depending on your level of aggression that getting more and more mainstream and some ways with the programming. But as a function of breath, as a function of doing more for all taste, so opening that up to include multi-camera sitcoms like The Ranch, like Fuller House, we have also really single-camera sitcom with Arnett called Flaked and the four season of House Of Cards, so you\u2019ve all this kind of breath just in a single quarter we\u2019re releasing is more programming than most networks run the whole year.","Ben Swinburne","That being pleasantly surprised that shows that are not necessarily all in English are being embraced by U.S. audience just one of those things that has been rolling around in Hollywood for a long time that U.S. folks don\u2019t watch subtitles.","David Wells","The continuing success of Narcos in the U.S. where this primarily Spanish language show is being watched enormously mainstream numbers in the U.S.","Peter Kafka","I guess for Reed and Ted, since last quarter, several of your suppliers most specifically time wonder in Fox have been every more explosive about their desire to pull back on the amount of content they sell to you, is that cause you to accelerate your original programming or you ordering on that same trajectory?","Ted Sarandos","We\u2019ve been on the trajectory accelerate original programming. I mentioned a couple weeks ago, we\u2019re going to launch 600 hours of new original programming this year alone. So it is a function of as our budget continues to grow, as our subscriber base grows, we are licensing programming and we are creating programming. As a percentage of our spent, original spending is growing, but as an absolute there are licensing dollar are continuing to grow as well. And Fox is an important vendor for us just like the all are within we\u2019re also a very important source of revenue for them.","Peter Kafka","I mean if that rhetoric was less intense if they went out they are saying look we\u2019re going to stop selling to us but would you be pulling back on original spending?","Ted Sarandos","No, I think we\u2019ve - the positives ever come for original spending have been tremendous in terms of our international growth, in terms of really distinguishing and differentiating Netflix from an explosion of our services.","Peter Kafka","And then when you think about the Marvel relationship, do you see expanding that one or is that kind of sort of stay steady where it is right now?","Ted Sarandos","It\u2019s a pretty expansive relationship already and then we have five seasons - five different series going in, we just announced yesterday that we are going to a second season of Jessica Jones. So when you look at those five series with multiple seasons plus the crossover season of the Defenders, it\u2019s a huge commitment and we are all the way along the way, you are going to be introducing new characters who have the potential to spinoff and grow that relationship in further. So it\u2019s very important for Marvel, it\u2019s very important for Disney.","David Wells","And for us.","Ted Sarandos","And for us, absolutely.","Ben Swinburne","Just Ted sticking with you on content, why the call out of family programming emphasis in the letter, any comment around sort of what you are doing maybe differently there and now you have a quarter behind you with some of your movies in the market, what you learn, how does that change your appetite around film?","Ted Sarandos","Well what the reason we call that out is to acknowledge if there is a large volume of specifically if kids programming coming out when normally people think if Netflix\u2019s original programming, they were thinking about our sophisticated dramas and adult comedies more so than our kids programming, but quietly but I am asking a very big selection of original kids programming at Netflix. Kidscreen magazine is what the Netflix\u2019s number one outlet for kids programming on television which are really proud of. And that\u2019s going to continue to grow and we just - we are also looking to grow categories like Fuller House which are programming that are watch together, parents watching - show that their kids love that they don\u2019t just tolerate but they enjoy too, and it\u2019s a real underserved market and that\u2019s why we call that out specifically.","And on the movie side, it was a great for a swing I think with Ridiculous Six and Beasts of No Nation. Beasts of No Nation is in the discussion about the Oscars didn\u2019t quite make it there but picked up nominations in almost every other category, the viewing were thrilled with around the world and have been continued to be throughout and thus we expand a new territories both Ridiculous Six and Beasts of No Nation are watched in huge numbers in our new territory. So we\u2019re really excited about and we\u2019ve got an aggressive site in \u201816 to keep pushing on it.","Ben Swinburne","And just shifting over to the hours date, Reed that you gave in Las Vegas and then some in the letter, this comes up kind of every quarter, people try to understand the penetration growth curve in these international markets. So if you look at the European markets where you gave the subscriber number last fall, I think penetration grows relatively light so far sort of nearly versus say the UK which was much stronger, what do you guys doing with you can David as you think about trying to accelerate the growth in some of these markets that have been tougher out of the gate and what are the characteristics that we as investors and analyst should out in these markets understand the dynamics that drive these growth rates overtime?","Reed Hastings","You know the first year in the UK was a really tough market, so it\u2019s usually successful for us now but it\u2019s not true that it always well. We saw the same thing in Brazil for different reasons. So being light in the beginning doesn\u2019t worry as a bit. And what we\u2019ve seen in market after market like Spain, Italy, France, Germany, is this building momentum as we do more and more local content. We\u2019ve got this amazing Sophie Marceau coming out in May, I think will really uplift the way that our French members think about say non-members in particular, so we\u2019re really looking forward to that. So it\u2019s a natural building cycle. And I think the way you should model that is pretty consistent growth in all of the territories. The variation is pretty modest. Again if you time adjusted you know from whenever we launch.","Ben Swinburne","And just on your time spent number, I think we calculated in the fourth quarter anyway about a 12% increase per average sub year-over-year which is impressive given you added a lot of new international markets, anything you can tell us about sort of the highest and versus the lowest and whether all markets are still growing, it would appear that the U.S. is still growing which is you know impressive, maybe you could talk about that a little bit?","Reed Hastings","Well, we\u2019re continuing to invest more in content, more in platforms in terms of the performance and the speed and the service is growing. So I think it\u2019s natural that we\u2019re continuing to grow on all those dimensions on you know the per membership basis as a service which was in the idea. Think about smart phone usage now compared to ten years ago, of course the number of smart phones is up, but the usage in utility is up. And I think we\u2019ve only scratch the surface, you know Netflix is a tiny percentage of all video viewing today, so we are tremendous potential growth ahead of us if we can continue to execute, we can continue to produce great shows to have this global launch with no snaffles, so not a hard execution but the market potential is really quiet large.","David Wells","I would add that you, the more content that we\u2019re adding the more likely you are going to land on a show that somebody can\u2019t live without and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing as we are expanding in not just the volume of content but also the breath of generous that we are covering in our original shows and our original movies.","Peter Kafka","Reed, we\u2019ve talked a couple of ago in addition India you called out Philippines, Saudi Arabia is particularly important markets for you, anything else you want sort of emphasis in terms of the 130 plus counties you rolled out a couple week ago?","Reed Hastings","With also a number of countries that have language match, so Philippines a lot of people speak English, we have English language content. We have subtitles in Arabic, you knew we\u2019ve translated our service in Arabic, so that\u2019s a good match for Saudi Arabia. And then in much of the world Russia, Poland, Central and Eastern Europe, we\u2019re still only in English. So we\u2019ve got a ways to go over the next two year, we\u2019ll keep adding more languages and make the service more relevant. So we look at it in sort of two categories where we got language match and where we don\u2019t yet. We\u2019re seen both a growth but more substantial growth in those obviously where we have language match. And then beyond language, we have work to do on payments in terms of in each country there are often local payments or different traditions around payments that will start to work on.","So think of it as you know we\u2019ve really begun on the international or global expansion rather than it\u2019s all showed up and we\u2019re all complete on it.","David Wells","We\u2019ve had two weeks right, so we\u2019ve been two weeks in terms of that launch.","Peter Kafka","And what are you thinking about as you move into markets where mobile internet sort of the dominant way the people get online, traditionally people are watching on a connected TV, what happens when they are used to watching or consuming things on a phone?","Reed Hastings","Yeah, same thing, you just watch Netflix on the phone just like you watch YouTube on the phone. A lot of that phone viewing is on Wi-Fi because of the data charges. And then what you do on the sailor networks is try to have the most efficient video codex you can have and we\u2019re working hard on that. But think if it has you know it\u2019s the same way that people use other Internet video services like YouTube.","Ben Swinburne","David, I want to come back and maybe talk a little bit on the numbers, can you update us on your expected cash burn for \u201816 and then help us understand the relationship between content, cash to the P&L versus cash as we move through this year maybe into 2017?","David Wells","Yeah, there is no change here, so we said before that we\u2019re on pace to burn about a billion dollars of cash mostly on our branded or originals content, that ration of cash to P&L is about 1.3 to 1.4 and that continues to hold. So you see that it will run up in a peak in certain quarters if we take delivery of a lot of original content and then runs back down. But I think the 1.3 to 1.4 range of cash to P&L expense will continue to hold. And so far our expectations of use of cash have been about as expected. You see in the letter that we wrote that we\u2019re on pace to use about a billion dollars and maybe a little more this year, but we upsized our debt last year about a year ago and so you know in terms of timing we\u2019d be looking at later this year maybe early next year before we would need to do any more on the capital side.","Ben Swinburne","And on the U.S. margins, and I realize how you allocate cost between the U.S. international markets may change overtime, but you got a lot more operating leverage last year then perhaps we all thought heading into the year, you maintain this 20-20 guidance of 40% contribution margin, is that just being conservative or do you expect maybe some change in amortization rate to slow the margin expansion down, what color can you give us about the pace of U.S. margins?","Reed Hastings","Well not the ladder, I would say there are couple of points on this. One is that you know to the extent that we launched Western World then it was a little early then maybe 24 months ago that we would have been fully global or near fully global. I would say the U.S. P&L did receive a little bit of relief right, but that\u2019s a onetime thing and that sort of goes away.","The second point is, we continue to add content and add an efficient level, I mean we look at the hours views and what is generated by the content versus the cost and we continue to see new additions even in the U.S. and markets that are have been in place for four to five years now, we continue to see viewership and Ted talked a little bit about engaging new audiences, you know you\u2019ll see us do that.","So I think - you know for the foreseeable future, we think we can grow both margin and grow the content spend even in markets in the U.S.","Ben Swinburne","Back to international, I know you guys aren\u2019t going to offer any more guidance on when you might go into China, but when and if you do, do you imagine that you are going to have to restrict or alter the catalog based on censorship or other issues of the Chinese market?","Reed Hastings","Yeah, the standards at least today they are fluid that the government uses restrict like Game of Thrones reportedly as you know had 10 or 15 minutes from many episodes cut from it and so there are issues conforming to those local standards. That\u2019s true of all of the Western content that\u2019s produced well as well as the Chinese content of that market. So we\u2019ll be on a level playing field with all other services.","Peter Kafka","And same territory, would you have to enter with JV or some way you could enter China without doing a JV?","Reed Hastings","There is all different flavors, if you look at how Disney lie for iTunes or others have done. So you know we\u2019re talking to different partners building the relationships. But again as I mentioned a few days ago, we have a very long term look and this could be a many years or discussions or it could happen faster than that, where you know going to take our time. And that clearest example is really the iPhone which took many years for Apple to get approval for that and now it\u2019s a very large business for Apple. And so our view is for looking out for the business a decade from now, we should just be very patient and continue to build those relationships and listen and learn. So we\u2019re in no hurry. And most of our time and effort right now is going in, how do we build the Japanese market, how do we build the Philippines market, how do we build the Saudi Arabian market, markets that are open to us and available right now.","Ben Swinburne","I want to ask about content spending maybe for David and Ted to comment on you know we presume a relation between subscriber growth and content spend is not linear going forward. So as you guys think about growing the U.S. business, how should we think about the pace of growth in content spending? And Ted is the 50-50 original acquired ratio still your long term expectation or have the relationships with the vertical integrated media companies maybe later that at all?","David Wells","Let me take part and then I\u2019ll turn it to Ted. So I would say Ben, you know it is true that once you get to $4 billion of spend, the rate of growth is going to slow down, so that is definitely true on the U.S. side. But back to my earlier comment, we still think that there is great content to be added to the U.S. service that is efficient that will continue to increase the competitiveness and attractiveness of the offering in the U.S., so we are going to continue to add to that service. It\u2019s had a slower rate of growth but it continues to grow.","And in time, it not true yet, but in time, we will be adding more of our original branded content than our licensed content. So today, we\u2019ve been adding both, we\u2019ve been growing originals rather quickly. We\u2019ll continue to grow originals quickly but you are seeing a lot of that added to the U.S. market. And to the extent that we\u2019re successful and Ted maybe this is good transition to you about finding content that works across markets, you know there will be blurring in the lines between what is really U.S. content and what is international content and vice versa.","Ted Sarandos","Yeah, I mean I think the order this is going to be doing something that doesn\u2019t feel modernizing for the world that still feels like great programming for everybody. And then we\u2019ve had tremendous success so far, I guess that would not goes primarily Spanish language sure working in countries they speak every different language and making it as Reed pointed out, in many parts of the world these kind of true detective documentaries are incredibly popular in Prime Time television. So we\u2019re pleased to see these continue to be grow global generous. Where you asked about our suppliers and the confutation is probably overstated, but there is a lot of letter going around right now about how quickly and how aggressively people will license. It\u2019s still a very competitive business. And then I think what happens is that people sell their programming to the highest bidder and if we are that bidder, we get the programming and if someone else is, they will get the programming. And that\u2019s true today, that was true five years ago.","So I think what\u2019s happening now is we\u2019re very pleased with the results of the original spend and not just driving it up, not fear are being cutoff on either end.","Peter Kafka","And Ted just on that foot point, what should you glean from your DreamWorks extension obviously that\u2019s a family journal and I think it\u2019s kind of an output, you could correct me like output deals, and then on the same side, the CW renewal has not happen, I think that deal sort of still out there. Is that an example where you can get some independent studio but not with a vertical integrated one?","Ted Sarandos","No, the DreamWorks is not an output in the traditional sense meaning that we agree to a certain levels of programming but we work together and what that programming is going to be and developing those shows along with DreamWorks. And we\u2019ve been thrilled with the results, those we took it to be into more territories and expanded the number of years of programming that will come through that deal because it\u2019s been working great. And I think this in the CW deal that\u2019s just in the process of negotiation, it\u2019s not behind in any normal process. And as you know it\u2019s a time on tradition to negotiate in the press, so you are seeing some of that for them and right I would say it\u2019s just in the process of negotiation.","You should also keep in mind that no matter what happens in the CW deal is the programming that\u2019s currently there remains with us to run those series, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to wake up one day without the programming. And we\u2019d like to make that deal work, it\u2019s great programming, we have a great relationship with CBS and Warner Brothers on that deal and we like to continue it.","Ben Swinburne","Reed you said you didn\u2019t think Time Warner should spinout HBO but if they ignore your advice, is that changer view of the way HBO would be - would act as a global competitor for you they have ability do things outside of Time Warner, they can\u2019t do within Time Warner?","Reed Hastings","You know HBO\u2019s been a great competitor one we admire for a very long time. You might have seen the recent news that they are now are offering, HBO now direct to consumer in multiple new nations, they started just in the Nordics then some countries in Latin America, now in Spain. So they will be a formidable global competitor overtime again independent of their ownership.","Ben Swinburne","And then speaking of competitors, Ted want to offer a theory of why your competitors at NBC and Fox and other networks spend a lot of time talking about you last week at the products association?","Ted Sarandos","It might just be putting up a shining object to deflect, they talk about Netflix is sort of what\u2019s going on their networks these days. But I really couldn\u2019t tell you why, it was - NBC was a particular puzzle both mostly because they used as an example to show that produce for us to try to illustrate how what was and wasn\u2019t working with data that didn\u2019t feel very true to us, so it surprised everybody at NBC.","Reed Hastings","I think it\u2019s just a tactical mess which is kind of funny in the press.","Ben Swinburne","Is the talent to anyone else ask for numbers or they happy now or customer reduction they are going to tell?","Reed Hastings","And we follow the coverage from the DCA most of them offered up that they are very happy with the relationship and not to be under that kind of weekly ratings show that wouldn\u2019t matter much of the success anyway, so they are happy not to focus on it.","Ben Swinburne","Coming back to David on some of the financials, David, I think you said at CES or your presentation out in Las Vegas about 120 million loss a quarter internationally, it\u2019s on a levels that make sure that\u2019s the right way we should be thinking about the year. And then on raising more capital, you mentioned in the letter you are looking at lower your cost of capital which we presume would have been the case, what are you referring to specifically there some of the gyrations in the high yield market causing you to think about raising capital definitely have in the past?","David Wells","So on the first question, you heard me right in terms of 120 million. Looking ahead I would say there is two things that might alter that not materially but plus or minus 10-20 million that would be foreign exchange, I mean we continue to have an environment where we\u2019re running deep into some pretty headwinds of foreign exchange, if that continues that might challenge that 120 million upward a little again 10-20 million. And then the other thing is just carving out a little bit of room for us. Like I said we are 14 days you know or two weeks or so into a global launch. We\u2019ve got lots of markets that were in early days of setting our level of compelling and competitiveness in our service offering. This year is about investment, you\u2019ll see that, we\u2019re focused, you know we\u2019re committed to a global breakeven, but we\u2019re also trying to build multiyear businesses in many of these markets. So if we see opportunities, I think there is a little bit of room for us to pursue those later in the year to pour some additional content marking whatever the right mixture of investment is.","But it is true, it\u2019s about a 120 million, it won\u2019t meaningfully depart from that too much but it could be 10-20 million within that.","Ben Swinburne","And then you should assume that that instruments are similar to the ones we\u2019ve used in the past, we\u2019ve been very happy with those.","David Wells","Yeah, sorry Ben on your last question, nothing is changed there, other than our confidence that will continue to drive some meaningful profit in the \u201817-\u201918 and to the extent that people are focused on backward looking financial metrics in terms of credit worthiness. We think that will become a better credit risk overtime, you irrespective or what\u2019s happening in the high yields markets. You know today, their bonds have traded pretty well.","Ben Swinburne","And just follow-up David on your global breakeven point, I think operating income was down a bit in \u201815 versus \u201814, but if I look at the \u201816 outlook for international losses, you just gave us plus some U.S. margin expansion, I think operating income overall should grow a bit of the 15 basis, I need to know am I thinking about things the wrong way, just I want to know that?","David Wells","No, I think you are doing the right math, but I think you are - that question is a little bit of a modeler in terms of looking at the narrow numbers. That\u2019s true and in terms of the math, but in general I would say this year is about our continued international investment, we\u2019re not really focused on making sure operating grows, the operating income growth is sort of an outcome of you know focused on international expansion but also committed to consolidated breakeven.","Ben Swinburne","Understood.","Peter Kafka","You guys said you are releasing people from grandfathering this spring on this price hikes, David or anyone else, are you thinking about ways you might reach out to folks we\u2019re going to see the buildup by a $1.2 and keeping churn as low as possible?","David Wells","Yeah, it\u2019s pretty simple, I mean well, let him know that the certain date, the price change takes effect, so nothing dramatic, pretty straight forward simple stuff.","Peter Kafka","Great, Reed I\u2019ll catch you here. Now I\u2019ve been able to watch sort of what Amazon is doing with its bundle and Starz and Hulu, anymore thought about attaching yourself to any other over the top service in some sort of bundle?","Reed Hastings","Yeah, I mean we do direct consumer research and we haven\u2019t been able to detect any significant take rate on those. So we\u2019ll continue to watch and learn and detect you know our people on Hulu taking a lot of show time where is it pretty much on the market.","Peter Kafka","But you are seeing it right now?","Reed Hastings","We\u2019re not seeing it so far.","Peter Kafka","Thanks.","Ben Swinburne","Let\u2019s start little more about the 2016 launches. Can you guys talk about how the go-to-market strategy is it for these markets versus international markets maybe at a high level operationally when you are thinking about markets like India or part of Africa, what\u2019s the different about what you are doing here versus what we\u2019ve seen before?","Reed Hastings","So extremely similar to how we launched Latin America where there is a couple of countries that we focused on directly and there is still some countries that we haven\u2019t yet visited you know four or five years later, but we have a lot of members. So the Internets are beautiful thing because of its openness. So again it\u2019s a very similar to our Latin America launch.","Ben Swinburne","And anything you are doing on the payment side, since you brought up Latin America, I think that was a challenge initially, I am sure you\u2019ve learned a lot but what can you do proactively in some of these markets to help smooth that for the consumer?","David Wells","I\u2019ll take that one. So I think we - you know we\u2019ve got pretty robust payments teams that we\u2019ve invested internally in building that out, getting smart in terms of the payment systems across the world, we\u2019re pressing on gift cards and prepaid cards that might open up you know to the market to those people that don\u2019t have access to a credit, debit card. But in rest of world, again it\u2019s pretty early days and I think we\u2019ll take the approach that we took in Latin America which is just to look at our next best opportunities to open up additional pockets of the market. We\u2019ve done this before not in Lat-Am but in other places and we\u2019ll continue that without playbook in the rest of the world. Our partners are another element of this right, so Reed mentioned IOS will be looking to draft off of large partners in the group in terms of IOS, Android and other options you know and there is a lot of evolutions going on in the payments world. But I got miscoded at city by saying that we\u2019re interested in big coin, but what I said was it would be nice to have in five to ten years of borderless currency like that coin. I think those people that are so excited about it are interested in breaking down those barriers and in using the power of the Internet and the Internet age you know to reduce the friction of payments that are existing today in some of those banking structures. So we\u2019ll be drafting off those long term as well. But in the near term expect us to continue to just knockdown the best opportunities in terms of adding local payment methods, credit, debit cards, drafting off partners as well.","Peter Kafka","Are you guys, you are participating with TMO and their Binge On program, are you going to Verizon on I think they are calling it FreeBee I think they announced today?","David Wells","You know I don\u2019t know enough of the details of FreeBee. But generally the great thing what TMO was doing is making a limited video consumption of possibility with freedom from oaring about the data caps. And the Quit Procol from the customer\u2019s standpoint on Binge On is that they only get DVD quality on their four or five inch screen, which when you look at the DVD quality is actually very, very good, but that\u2019s a really unique grogram that T-Mobile has done and it\u2019s seeing our great reception amongst all users and we are seeing viewing going and I think TMO was seeing somewhat positive benefits from that, so we help those kind of programs expand.","Peter Kafka","So Reed, can you explain why you are comfortable and in participating in programs like that and then how that differs from stuff you\u2019ve complained about a Comcast in the past with their data caps?","Reed Hastings","Well it\u2019s voluntary on the customer, any customer of TMOs can decide to turn it on or turn it off, that would a big difference and then they are not charging any of their providers, it\u2019s an open program, many of our competitors such as Hulu and HBO are in the program also but it\u2019s an open no charge program where they are really focused on trying to get the customers some optionality of limited to DVD quality and then you get unlimited viewing which you know their customers are choosing.","Peter Kafka","So you don\u2019t feel what the network putting it and saying we favor this kind of program and from this kind of studio, this kind service?","Reed Hastings","Correct, that\u2019s the big difference, that\u2019s right.","Peter Kafka","Thanks.","Ben Swinburne","With the 750, $8 price point in these international markets for the immerging markets where you know that\u2019s a relatively expensive price, do you reserve the right to sort of go down market overtime as well?","David Wells","Well we\u2019re starting off definitely appealing to elite. I mean I mentioned that in Russia and Eastern Europe you know we\u2019re still in English. In Vietnam and Cambodia, we\u2019re in English. So we\u2019re serving elites. You can think of them as a shorthand as iPhone owner, so that they pay $800 for an iPhone, they are comfortable with entertainment in English, and so for them you know $8-$10 is a sweet spot price. Certainly in future years you know as we do more and more and trying to expand it to the mass market, you know we can look at additional pricing option, but we feel good about our pricing and the value for these global originals right now.","Ben Swinburne","And just on these internal markets, you know there is a lot of press coverage on the BTN situation and proxies and maybe you can walk us through what you are doing as a company that\u2019s going to change your policy from prior periods and could you envision situation where that might impact your net adds because you have a million of customers in an international market that suddenly have - went from having a fake U.S. accounts or having an access?","Reed Hastings","I don\u2019t we\u2019ll see any impact and we\u2019ve always enforced proxy locking with a blacklist, now we\u2019ve got it expanded an enhanced blacklist. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see any huge change.","Peter Kafka","Just to be clear, so if you don\u2019t think there is any huge change with VPNs and other proxy workarounds and then why go ahead and do it all, just purely did to play kit content providers?","Reed Hastings","You can call a play kit or you can call catering to their desires which you know they have the gentlemen desires that we license content in Canada you know it\u2019s not fair us to be or our customers to be get in that you know if we\u2019ve only paid for Canada, so we are trying to pay for it all by shifting to global licenses and we are working with our content providers on that, but it\u2019s perfectly reasonable what the content owners want and we know there will be some people effected that are using it today which is what we wanted to be open about it, but it\u2019s really a continuation of what we\u2019ve always done now with this enhanced blacklist and some other techniques.","David Wells","And remember all of our originals are fully global, they go live in every country at the same time around the world. Increasingly we are spending most of our licensing dollars on content that\u2019s successful in that way from small things to other way to big things like Oscar nominated movie \u201cThe Big Short\u201d we\u2019ll have the Pay TV window around the world, so people will be able to watch that movie on Netflix wherever they are.","Ben Swinburne","In the past you said piracy is a major competitor in any concern that the VPN and proxy workarounds will push some of your users back to piracy?","Reed Hastings","You know if we see that there is probably so few of them, it\u2019s not a big contributor to overall global piracy. Overall global piracy is a big problem and we\u2019re working with all the content owners partially to be a great carats and also to have the other services like HBO and Amazon be great carats. And so we can work together on this antipiracy agenda.","David Wells","And I think dual filter hacking in piracy are maybe just in cousins are best, I mean I think dual filter hacking is people hacking to pay versus piracy where people are hacking not to pay.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks.","Peter Kafka","I am curious that you guys could talk about where you are investing on the technology side, I think your long term letter talked about over 700 million in tacking development in 2016, there is some comments in the letter about complexity based in coding. And what about to hear beyond the general areas you are spending money is what are you doing them to reduce the required speed or bit rate that\u2019s needed to stream and enjoy Netflix, you know particularly thinking about the 2016 in the mobile first markets?","Reed Hastings","You know I think the whole industry is working on these advanced version of H265 to be able to do very high quality in coding with small bit rates. And so YouTube has made great progress on that, we made great progress. So I think you know again people have been working on efficient video encoding for 50 years, it\u2019s one of the classic computer science problem, so we are seeing good progress there, we are seeing a lot of progress on our algorithms and being able to rank videos for each person even that are being able to promote to the right person the right content, hopefully you are seeing some of that in your own experience where this is this Justin\u2019s that is the billboard at the top of the page or more often you know very appropriate and something you are just dying to watch.","Ben Swinburne","What are the minimum speed you think someone is going to need in a market like India on fixed line or on mobile to actually stream Netflix?","Reed Hastings","The minimums around half a megabit, so you know that\u2019s been consistent in the past. It\u2019s a fairly low quality picture, it\u2019s around 700 or 800 kilobit to be able to do DVD quality.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you.","Peter Kafka","You guys have said few times now that \u201cMaking A Murderer\u201d have surprised you and success surprise you, can you talk a bit about sort of why you had more modest expectations for that, the surprise of that success has gone, how do you sort of rethink sort of your modeling?","Reed Hastings","Well it surprised me because I know so little about these things. When I met with the filmmakers and you know heard about the Murderer, sequence was interesting, but I thought it would be a specialty thing. I would say Ted and his team had that surprise, they always believed in this content.","Ted Sarandos","Yeah, it had a - there is something very special about of it from the beginning. When it came to us it was seven years into making already and this is came to us over three years ago and recognize then even before making original docs that they had something really special on their hands. The surprises that you see it perform at the levels of script and series, even our best documentary series have done very, very well but not performed in such mainstream numbers.","Peter Kafka","Right, so given that surprising you thought we\u2019re going to sort of rethink how it evaluates for more shows or you sort of or this is happy success and you are happy to move along with?","Ted Sarandos","Yeah, I mean it\u2019s on the continuing of expanding it anyway, so it was, it\u2019s only our second documentary series we\u2019ve - we started with Chef\u2019s Table which is a very different show and the next documentary series are probably very different from \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d as well.","Peter Kafka","Ted, some of your competitors -","Ted Sarandos","Including - in fact it starts in a couple of weeks or just or this week, I am sorry Chelsea Handler and Chelsea Does will be our next documentary series.","Reed Hastings","We should take one more question and then let everyone go.","Peter Kafka","Real quickly, Ted - I guess for Ted. Your competitors report that you are in many cases overspending despite significant amount for original programming and as well as repeats, do you think that gap is going to continue, do you think it\u2019s going to increase, do you think eventually sort of fall in line with those spending?","Ted Sarandos","Well first of all I\u2019d like thank them for endorsing our spending to talent. But the truth of it is the only reason we can in their own work and John\u2019s own words have shock in outspending for a series is because we get shock in our viewing on that series that Dave expected that David said earlier, the efficiency of the content spend has been great meaning that we are spending a lot on great shows and they get a lot of yielding relating to licensed programmed or relative to other programming as well. So we\u2019ve been excited about it as part of and I think it\u2019s a competitive market place and overspending is relative, I would say if the show like \u201cThe Get Down\u201d like \u201cThe Crown\u201d which are relatively expensive shows are successful it\u2019s money where spent the way was for \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d.","Reed Hastings","Out of respect for one of our long time questioners and your colleague Rich Greenfield, who had a question about Charter and was a good, if Charter acquires TWC for the Internet industry OTT. I\u2019ll answer proactively that I think it would be a tremendous positive for the OTT industry because Charter has agreed to a multiyear strong net neutrality policy something no one else has publically agreed to and that would cover not only the Charter footprint but the Time Warner cable footprint. And that means that we, Hulu, Amazon and others can compete on an open basis. And so it would be a huge step forward for U.S. policy in terms of OTT.","Thank you all Peter, thank you Ben, we\u2019ll talk to you again soon.","Peter Kafka","Thank you.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you."]}}
