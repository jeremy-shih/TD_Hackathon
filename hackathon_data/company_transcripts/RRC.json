Please go ahead, sir.","Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range's fourth quarter earnings call. The speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Chief Financial Officer.","Hope you've had a chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we've posted on our website. We'll be referencing some of the slides this morning. We also filed our 10-K with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.","Before we begin, let me also point out that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. In addition, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of these non-GAAP measures and to provide more details on both natural gas and NGL pricing.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks, Laith. Before I discuss what we'll see for 2017, let me briefly review some accomplishments and results from the fourth quarter and 2016.","The fourth quarter was our best quarter of the year, not only from a cash flow perspective but also because it was the first full quarter with our North Louisiana assets. The office integration has gone very well, and the team is making great operational strides, some of which we'll discuss this morning. Our unhedged margins for the quarter were the highest that we've seen since 2014, as operating expense and interest per Mcfe declined substantially, and pricing differentials improved by selling more of our products to better markets.","Our reserve report for year-end 2016 also had a number of highlights that speak to the depth and quality of our inventory. Our F&D costs, however you like to slice them, were very competitive, with drill bit costs of only $0.34 per Mcfe. In addition, our resource potential now stands at over 100 Tcfe, with thousands of locations, providing us a tremendous runway for future investment.","Looking towards 2017 and 2018, we're excited about what's happening at Range, as we have the ability to generate significant growth while spending at or near cash flow on the back of improved pricing differentials and margins. As it relates to pricing, we're projecting significantly better netback pricing for all three of our products: natural gas, NGLs, and condensate. In addition, we're expecting continued improvement in our cash costs. The net effect is that our margins are projected to show a substantial increase versus 2016. The significant improvement in margin, coupled with our very low development costs, results in one of the best recycle ratios in our business for either an oil company or a gas company.","I'll take a minute to walk through the numbers. Beginning with netback pricing for natural gas. We're projecting a 33% improvement in our natural gas differentials for 2017, to NYMEX less approximately $0.30. The reasons for the improvement are primarily twofold. The first reason is that we'll have a full year of marketing on the Gulf expansion project, which came online in October of 2016. This project moves 150 million per day of our production from Pennsylvania to the Gulf Coast. The second reason is that we'll have a full year of our North Louisiana gas production, which receives near NYMEX pricing.","Our NGL pricing is also expected to improve to about 28% to 30% of WTI for 2017, which is significantly better than pricing in 2015 and 2016, while producing over 50,000 barrels per day of ethane and about 50,000 barrels per day of C3+. This is particularly exciting, considering WTI prices have also improved. There are three primary drivers behind the NGL improvements. The first is that we'll have a full year of transportation on the Mariner East pipeline, providing us better netbacks to international markets with the optionality of domestic sales if it makes sense seasonally. The second is that we'll have a full year of our North Louisiana NGLs, which are well located and receive Mont Belvieu pricing. The third reason is that overall NGL pricing has improved relative to WTI on improved supply-demand fundamentals.","Condensate pricing for 2017 is also expected to be significantly better as a result of having a full year of our new condensate agreement sales in Appalachia, plus a full year of our North Louisiana condensate production, which receives near NYMEX pricing. We're projecting a 40% improvement in our condensate differential to WTI minus $5 to $6.","Now looking at costs, we're expecting to see continuance of our low-cost structure in 2017. Combining improved netback pricing with lower cash costs results a projected margin of 40% for 2017, which is a great uplift over what we've seen the past couple of years. Taking this one step further, our expected future development costs for PUD reserves is $0.42, which results in an unhedged recycle ratio of approximately 2.8 times. This is excellent and will be at or near the top of our peers when considering either oil or gas companies.","Shifting now to an asset base that underpins these financial improvements, I'd like to start in North Louisiana, as the team has made some very significant progress early on. In North Louisiana, our well costs were $8.7 million when we closed the acquisition in September. Today, we're drilling and completing wells for $7.7 million. Ray will discuss this is more in detail, but this capital cost reduction obviously has a dramatic impact on the economics of a well, and we're very encouraged by the early improvements of the team. Importantly, these lower well costs also expand the inventory of wells to drill, including generating attractive returns in the Lower Red and potentially in the Pink horizons.","In addition to driving the cost to drill and complete down, our team has done so while keeping the wells entirely within zone. This should improve the wells' performance versus any well that was out of zone for a portion of the lateral. In addition, we're now targeting a much tighter landing zone, and we're keeping the wells within the tighter target. This technique significantly improved the performance of our Marcellus wells and has done so in other plays as well. As we complete wells with this tighter targeting over the coming months and have some production history, we'll see if the technique works here as well. The bottom line is that the team has completed the trifecta. They're drilling the wells at a significantly lower cost while keeping them totally within zone and also within a tighter target window.","In regard to the North Louisiana extension areas, we've drilled three wells and have disclosed the results of those wells in our earlier press release. Based on the encouraging initial results of the wells east and west of Vernon field, we're also planning additional tests this year. As we mentioned before, the Upper Red thickens in these wells and consists of three zones versus one in Terryville. Likewise, the Lower Red thickens in these wells and becomes three zones versus one in Terryville. Bottom line, there's about two and a half times the net pay and about two and a half times the gas in place in these two areas versus Terryville. The extension area activity in 2017 will be focused on how to best drill, target, and complete and produce the wells in this area to recover as much of the resource as possible.","As for the majority of our 2017 North Louisiana activity, we will stay focused on driving up production in Terryville and driving down cost, which is consistent with how we originally evaluated the assets. We'll gather additional data and be very scientific and thoughtful as we continue to evaluate the extension areas, which is the way we do business at Range.","Moving to the Marcellus, we're seeing improvements in normalized well costs and therefore rates of return. These improvements are driven mostly by lateral lengths increasing from about 6,400 feet in 2016 to over 8,000 feet in 2017, which is reflected in our updated economics for the dry, wet, and super-rich areas. Given the recent improvements in NGL pricing, coupled with longer laterals, the wet gas economics are significantly improved versus 2016. Consequently, we'll focus much of our activity there in 2017. We've also made tremendous operational strides in reducing our days to drill and lowering costs through innovation and a focus on costs, which Ray will discuss in more depth. Lastly, our capital efficiency is expected to improve not only from longer laterals and operational improvements, but also from going back onto existing pads and drilling within our built-out gathering system.","So 2017 is shaping up to be a good year for Range. Importantly, the improvements we see in 2017 should continue into 2018 and beyond, resulting in better margins and a class-leading recycle ratio. Range is one of the few in the industry with a decade plus of high-quality drilling locations. We have a deep bench of stacked pays in both Pennsylvania and North Louisiana. Plus, we have the optionality of drilling dry or wet, which is important considering the recovery of NGL pricing.","Hitting on the natural gas macro, first looking at the near term, 2017 is shaping up to be a better year than 2016, or much better than 2016. Last year was the first year since 2005 that natural gas production in the U.S. declined on a year-over-year basis, setting up a more balanced market that we believe the current activity levels are not sufficient to supply the increased demand that we see coming in 2018 and beyond. Looking at NGLs, propane pricing relative to WTI have improved to levels that we've not seen in years. And the rest of the NGL barrel has also improved. This is meaningful to Range, as we're going to be producing approximately 100,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids in 2017.","Looking beyond this year, there's significant demand for natural gas coming from LNG exports, Mexican exports, power generation, and industrial use. In total by 2020, about 14 Bcf per day of additional natural gas demand is projected to occur. In addition to the roughly 14 Bcf of additional demand, it takes more than 6 Bcf per year to offset the base decline in the U.S. In aggregate, that's 14 Bcf of demand, plus about 24 Bcf per day of base decline, which is a total of about 38 Bcf per day of new gas that's required by the end of 2020. Looking forward, Range remains well-positioned in the two best gas and gas liquids plays in North America.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations.","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. Production for the fourth quarter came in at 1.854 Bcf equivalent per day, and for the year we grew production 11% over 2015, with our exit rate 16% higher than it was in 2015. Guidance for 2017 is 33% to 35% growth, which will put us at approximately 2.07 Bcf equivalent per day net for the year. Guidance for the first quarter will be set at 1.92 Bcf equivalent per day, with 30% to 32% liquids. For 2017, our CapEx budget is approximately $1.15 billion, split about two-thirds in the Marcellus and one-third in North Louisiana.","As you're aware, a portion of this year's budget will serve to reverse the significant ramp down in spending over the past three years. So while generating solid growth for 2017, this year's capital program really contributes to production growth in 2018 by getting us back on a normal trajectory. This encompasses spending on things like pad construction, roads, water infrastructure, production facilities, top holes, and things that we term, quote, \"generating completable, lateral footage,\" close quotes, where the production from these expenditures really occurs in 2018.","Incredibly, if you look at our D&C budget of $1.07 billion for 2017, we're actually spending less than we did in 2012, 2013, and 2014 prior to the downturn, but our 2017 program is still generating impressive growth and setting us up for 20% growth in 2018, despite having a production base that is triple the size that it was in 2012. This is possible because of the efficiency gains we've seen from hydrating our assets and now going into a full development mode in the Marcellus. Our 2017 capital plan has us running approximately five rigs and two to three frac crews in Southwest Pennsylvania this year, and four rigs with up to three frac crews at a time in North Louisiana. Starting with the Marcellus, we continue to make great strides in unit cost reductions, and our capital efficiency continues to improve.","I'd like to take a few minutes here and talk about some impressive examples. Looking at water logistics and sourcing, because we don't own a separate water MLP, we're 100% focused on reducing costs associated with water handling, and our shareholders receive 100% of that benefit. This has been a big area of improvement, not only improving LOE by 39% over the prior year, but also reducing our capital expenditures for water by over $30 million in 2016. We've reduced the average completion costs per foot of lateral by 14% year over year, while pumping a record number of stages in 2016 with less frac crews than we had in the prior year.","Our top three pads completed in 2016 averaged over eight and a half stages a day for a total of 432 stages. The best pad achieved a completion cost per foot almost 23% below the average, which again was already 14% lower than the previous year. We achieved a 17% reduction in CapEx for production facilities, resulting in over $6 million in savings as a result of design improvements, reductions in contract labor and materials, and redeployment of existing equipment.","On the drilling side, we've realized a 40% increase in lateral feet drilled per day as compared to last year. This results in a 27% reduction in average drilling costs per lateral foot compared to the prior year and our top 10 best days for lateral feet drilled in a day were all accomplished during the fourth quarter. In fact, just a couple of weeks back, we set a company record of over 6,100 feet drilled in a single day. The drilling and G&G teams accomplished all of this with zero sidetracks from 2016, illustrating that we're still improving and expect to continue to improve going forward.","In Southwest Pennsylvania, our current plans have us drilling about a third of our wells on existing pads in 2017, and that number could increase to as much as half of our wells in 2018. Our average drilled lateral length in 2017 is projected to be well over 8,000 feet, and our expectation is that the 2018 average will be longer. For example, we're currently drilling the third of three wells on a pad that will average over 15,100 feet per well. What's important is that we have the ability to drill longer laterals, drill on existing pads with permits in hand and infrastructure in place.","Let me call your attention to our updated economics cost and type curves in the presentation on the website. Please take a look at slide 10, which summarizes the data from all the Marcellus areas with activity in 2017. Again, we believe our cost and performance are the best in the southwest portion of the basin. I also want to point out that these are expected averages for the year and are inclusive of all the costs, including facilities, and factor in all the midstream expenses using actual realized prices. Our well costs include all expected increases in services and supplies that we see in 2017.","As we go throughout the year, I believe our technical and operational team will continue to optimize the plan and continue to beat these averages, as they have year after year. A good example of how this happens is a seven-well pad that we just approved a few weeks back that is projected to average 10,079-foot laterals with 50 stage completions per well for an average cost including all the facilities of $6.3 million per well. Thus, on a normalized per thousand foot basis, the cost is estimated to be $625,000, yielding a projected EUR of over 3.5 Bcf per 1,000 foot per well \u2013 clearly much better than the expected average case.","I would also like to highlight a wet area pad in Southwest Pennsylvania that we brought online during the fourth quarter. It was a four-well pad averaging 9,265-foot laterals completed with an average of 46 stages per well. The average peak 24-hour production rate to sales under constrained conditions was 35.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well. The seven-day average to sales, again under constrained conditions, was 28.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well. Importantly, on a normalized basis, the 30-day cumulative production of these wells is 30% higher than the average offset, with the new wells flowing at significantly higher and constrained flowing pressures. I believe this pad represents some of the upside we expect to see as we go back into our underdeveloped core areas with longer laterals. We literally have thousands of these opportunities going forward. Again, please refer to our earnings release, where we provide the expected number of wells by area with all the average cost, recoveries, and economics that we have in our current plan for 2017.","Our team continues to investigate creative new technologies. For example, in April of 2016, the team successfully executed a three-well pad in our wet area with a new pinpoint stimulation technology. The idea is to get more uniform and consistent proppant placement on a cluster-by-cluster basis along the wellbore. Production of the three-well pad at year-end was on average 22% higher than that of the closest offsets. The cost of this initial test on a standalone basis was about 20% higher. However, we expect the costs to come down significantly as we do more of these completions. We're currently planning additional applications for 2017.","Another example: The team rolled out initiatives to exploit Big Data technology using machine learning or artificial intelligence. These groundbreaking tools have significantly reduced the time required to update well forecasts and assess the economic performance of different development scenarios in almost real time. We are big believers in making data-driven decisions that are based on, and tailored to, our large inventory of core area assets. And the team's innovation and resulting successes speak to that.","So shifting to North Louisiana. We're incredibly excited about what John and the team there are doing. But, first, let me take a step back to where we were in mid-September. Our expectations for the acquisition were initially grouped into three categories. First, we believed strongly we could lower well cost, improve operations, lower unit cost, and improve targeting in Terryville. This is where our focus is and will remain so throughout this year. We've made great strides and exceeded a lot of those expectations already. Secondly, we believed our cost and targeting focus could increase our potential drilling inventory in other horizons in Terryville, namely the Lower Red and the Pink intervals. Additionally, we believed there were marketing synergies and advantages. Both of these look promising. Thirdly and longer term, we also believed there was significant upside in the extension area, potentially developing more Terryville-like fields with expanded stacked pay opportunities that also exhibited significant overpressure and higher gas in place. As you know, we recently released the early data from our first three tests, which verified that that potential is real. So we'll be working very methodically and strategically to delineate that potential as we go forward. But again, as you would expect, our primary focus will continue to be on Terryville.","So let me cover some of the successes and highlights from our activity at Terryville. We've reduced our average all-in well cost for a 7,500-foot lateral by another almost 12% to $7.7 million while reducing drilling time, refining the target window, and staying 100% in zone. This is over $1 million less than we reported just last quarter, which obviously has a major impact on the economics. It not only improves the economics on an Upper Red well, but also opens up some of the Lower Red and Pink potential in Terryville.","So how did we get there? On the drilling side, Scott and his team have made great strides, setting all sorts of company and field records resulting in lower cost. Since taking over, they've drilled the fastest two wells, spud to rig release, the most daily footage drilled, the fastest curve, and the longest drill-out under intermediate casing with a single bit. They've reduced drilling time by 11%, lowering costs by over $300,000 per well by increasing mud motor and MWD reliability using more aggressive motors and bits, and responsive and real-time decision-making.","New drilling rig contracts with reduced day rates, along with ancillary contract negotiations, have lowered overall spread cost, dealing an additional $125,000 per well cost savings. Casing costs have also been reduced by over $50,000 per well by utilizing the Range supply chain management team. We reduced our mobilization time significantly. We've brought in different vendors and a lot of new technology. And this was all done while routinely staying 100% in the new refined target window, which is now around 30 feet versus 90 to 100 feet before.","On the completions front, Jeremy and the completions team have refined our completion designs, resulting in less impacts on offset production. We're routinely pumping almost twice as many stages per day as in the past, greatly reducing costs and cycle times. We've reduced the flowback equipment and coiled tubing costs by over $300,000 per well by utilizing more efficient designs and operations. And our design changes have helped us reduce our fracturing costs by over $200,000 per well. We started the year with a plan of completing eight stages per day, and I'm happy to report that we're routinely pumping 12 to 15 stages per day. And one crew achieved a high of 17 stages per day on a three-well pad while pumping between 330,000 and 350,000 pounds of proppant per stage. All of this accelerates our return of capital.","And on the G&G side, Kyle and his team are approaching near full 3-D seismic coverage across the Terryville area and the expansion areas, as well as acquiring significant new core and reservoir characterization data that will help direct our development going forward. All of this helps to open up a large inventory of future locations on our Terryville acreage. Please see these economics presented on page 11 in our updated presentation. Again, these economics and our capital plan in North Louisiana have baked in our service pricing for the year. We fully expect that improvements in our operations and designs will more than offset any modest service price increase that we have baked into our 2017 plan.","By the end of March, we'll have completed 26 wells so far this year, utilizing up to three frac crews since the start of the year. These include 19 completions in the Upper Red, five in the Lower Red interval, and two in the Pink intervals. Of these wells, 18 were drilled by the Memorial team prior to Range and have waited an average of 10 months to be completed. Eight of the wells were drilled by the Range team with improved targeting and will average just three months waiting on completion. While the first quarter was dominated by all of the completion activity, we do expect to smooth the frac schedule out over the year to get to a steadier pace of one to two frac crews working consistently as we go into 2018.","So switching to marketing for a few minutes, as Jeff mentioned earlier, our netbacks continued to improve in the fourth quarter, with a full quarter of North Louisiana production and with the addition of Spectra's Gulf Markets project going in service in early October. Additionally, we've received favorable news regarding other takeaway projects where Range is a long-term capacity holder. Spectra's Adair Southwest Project and TransCanada's Leach and Rayne XPress projects have now received final FERC certificates with projected in-service dates in late 2017. The combined capacity from these projects for Range is 400,000 dekatherms per day out of the Appalachian Basin to the Gulf Coast, further improving our expected pricing. In addition, Energy Transfer's Rover project was approved earlier this month.","Touching on North Louisiana quickly, there is an incredible amount of existing downstream infrastructure in the area to markets and liquidity at near NYMEX pricing. This does not require any significant contract capacity commitments, as there are several large trunklines around our acreage. You almost couldn't place a field in a better area for accessing demand in the Gulf and the Southeast.","Combining our existing base of transport capacity, our Louisiana production, and the 400,000 dekatherms per day from Adair Southwest and Leach\/Rayne, approximately 85% of our gas will move to better markets by year-end 2017. As Jeff mentioned, this solid base of natural gas sales gives us confidence that we will improve our corporate differential dramatically to approximately minus $0.30 for 2017. This is nearly a $0.20 improvement over what we've realized for the past couple of years and significantly improves our margins.","In summary, our Marcellus team is continuing to improve returns through lower cost and improved well performance as we continue to develop our extensive inventory of core locations with longer laterals. In North Louisiana, we've achieved outstanding results in a short amount of time and expect more of the same going forward. And our marketing philosophy that we've followed for many years now is paying off by improving our margins and setting us up well for many years of profitable growth.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials.","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, Ray. Continued financial progress was made in the fourth quarter to complement the operating progress Ray just mentioned. Financially, we turned the corner in the third quarter of this year, and the fourth quarter results show that we're gaining momentum as we further exit the down cycle. The fourth quarter results exhibit demonstrable improvement in top line revenue, cash flow, and cost control over earlier quarters in 2016 and over the fourth quarter of 2015.","Revenues from natural gas, NGL, and oil sales, before hedging entries, was $459 million, 81% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. Cash flow at $254 million was 24% higher. EBITDAX at $299 million was also 24% higher than last year. Cash margin at $1.48 an Mcfe was 80% higher than the third quarter of this year. Fourth quarter earnings calculated using common analyst methodology, which excludes nonrecurring items, was $56 million, 33% higher than last year's fourth quarter.","To help place the fourth quarter in perspective, cash flow in the fourth quarter was more than double the third quarter of this year and more than the first two quarters of this year combined. The last quarter where cash flow was higher than $254 million was two years ago, in the fourth quarter of 2014. These improvements from prior periods stem from continued margin gains from our new long-term takeaway capacity on Mariner East and the new Gulf Markets expansion project, combined with improvements in our cost structure, consistent organic growth, and completion of the Memorial transaction.","Full-year 2016 cash flow was $569 million, and full-year EBITDAX was $723 million. These figures include only 15 weeks of results from North Louisiana. If one includes a full year of EBITDAX from the North Louisiana assets, as used when calculating a trailing four-quarter debt to EBITDAX leverage ratio, EBITDAX totals $1.033 billion. Fully diluted cash flow per share for the fourth quarter was $1.04 and for the full year was $2.99 per share.","The DD&A rate is always reset during the fourth quarter of each year to reflect the results of our year-end reserve report. Our DD&A rate for the fourth quarter was $0.88 per Mcfe, down 9% from the fourth quarter of last year. Five years ago, in 2011, the DD&A rate was $1.80 per Mcfe. Reducing the DD&A rate by almost half over a relatively short period of time reflects the dramatic improvement in capital efficiency brought about from high-grading our asset base through the sale of non-core assets and further improving our processes as we develop our sizable position in the Marcellus.","As for our cash operating expenses during the quarter, all items came in at or below fourth quarter guidance, except for G&A, coming in $0.02 high due to some nonrecurring land administration expenses. Another expense item impacted by nonrecurring activity was transportation, gathering, and compression expense, which at $0.96 was $0.08 below guidance. The major contributor to this cost improvement was a one-time cash payment associated with the extension of our MarkWest agreements. The extension provided an opportunity to settle the cumulative true-up items of both parties. To assist listeners with their financial projections, the fourth quarter earnings release contains detailed expense item guidance for the first quarter of 2017.","Over on the balance sheet, things were quiet and stable following the closing of the Memorial transaction. Total debt was down slightly from end of the third quarter. And with cash flow building sequentially each quarter, we expect the leverage ratio has peaked and will begin to drift down as we move further into 2017 and 2018. Thanks to improving margins and our strongest-ever finding and development cost performance, our forward-looking recycle ratio, using either hedged or unhedged revenue, approaches 3 times, which demonstrates our ability to not only replace our production but also meaningfully grow within cash flow.","The fourth quarter provided many opportunities to add to the Range 2017 and 2018 hedge positions. Significant volume increases were added to our hedge positions across all products. Currently, over 75% of our 2017 natural gas production is hedged, with an average floor price of $3.22 an MMbtu. Going forward, our hedging practices remain consistent: to opportunistically hedge a significant portion of our expected production in order to have a more predictable cash flow which supports efficient operations and our ongoing capital program. Please reference the just-filed 10-K and Range website for specific hedge volume and price information.","As good as the fourth quarter of 2016 was from a financial perspective, we look forward to even more improvements in margins and cash flow going further into 2017, as the out-of-basin capacity on Rayne and Leach XPress becomes operational, production increases from both of our core areas, and we experience a full year of higher prices and better margins from our diverse portfolio of marketing contracts.","Jeff, I'll turn it back over to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Ventura. The question and answer session will now begin. And the first question is from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Arun Jayaram at JPM. My first question just regards the 80% planned allocation to liquids or the wet area and super rich in the Marcellus. Why was that the right number? And I'm thinking about just the returns that you guys cite in your deck versus the Southwest PA dry gas area.","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, Arun, this is Ray. I think the answer's got two parts. I think, one, we see a greatly improving market for liquids over the next several years, and with the great contracts we have, and when you fold in the large core inventories of liquids-rich locations that we have, we think this is going to create a ton of value going forward. And you've really seen improvements in liquids showing up, of course, in the fourth quarter numbers as a result of some of our great contracts, but we've also seen substantial improvements in ethane and propane and so forth since the first of the year.","And then, secondly, we've got a huge inventory of existing pads and infrastructure and really a core liquids-rich area that's underdeveloped at this point. And I think as you see us moving into a true development mode, we're taking advantage of that. And I think that's an advantage that's really unique to the Range story, and you're going to see improving well performance, improving capital efficiencies. At least a third of our wells are going to be on existing pads this year.","And I don't know if you heard in my remarks about that four-well pad we just did that's 9,300-foot laterals and has already cumed in 30 days 30% more than the offsets, and we're talking substantial improvements in Bcf per thousand foot over what we've seen in the past. And literally, we have \u2013 I said it before \u2013 we have thousands of those opportunities going forward, and I think I can say with confidence that the team is going to far exceed those average numbers that you see in the press release, and clearly those economics are going to be outstanding going forward. And we just really see a great market looking into the future over the next couple of years with all the ethane and propane improvements that we see there.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","And I'd just tack on what Ray said. When you look at the economics in the book, as we have every year, that's just strip pricing as of December 31. If you look at where we are today, gas is lower, liquids are probably better in the NGLs. So in addition what Ray said above, when you take that into account today, that gap is narrower, and really that's saying the strip is very volatile over a short period of time. If you look at what we're trying to do, we're managing through the cycles. We're looking forward a year, two, five, and 10 years. Ultimately, we're going to drill all those locations.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fair enough. Thanks for that. And my follow-up, just wanted to get your perspective. There's been some talk from the buy side regarding potential gas-on-gas competition if the TRP Mainline kind of goes through with their rate reduction. I know you guys have some volumes committed on Rover, so I wondered if you could, from a marketing perspective, talk about the potential impact to netbacks to Dawn from a Range perspective if that project goes through.","Chad L. Stephens - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, hi. This is Chad Stephens. I run our marketing team. So on Rover, half of our volume goes to MichCon Citygate and Dawn, and half goes to the Gulf Coast. We think that the TransCanada offering that they just had an open season on is going to be difficult to feel because the arb or spread between the prices they're getting in the Western Sedimentary Basin and Dawn and the cost to get the gas there, it's going to be difficult. But whether it gets done or not, we feel like with our volumes going \u2013 about half going to MichCon and half going to the Gulf Coast, it doesn't put us in a difficult situation.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fair enough. Thank you, gentlemen.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question is from Pearce Hammond of Simmons.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Thanks for taking my questions. Jeff, obviously the winter has been very warm, and gas storage estimates here for April 1 have been ballooning upwards. And then the price of gas has settled lower. Is there a gas price that you would say, hey, we're going to dial things back a little bit? Or do you feel like with all the hedging that you have in place, that right now you're pretty comfortable with your plan and you're just going to move forward with that?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, I think if you look at where we are for 2017, we're well-hedged, we're comfortable with our plan, and we'll move forward. And then I think if you look into 2018, there are several thoughts there. One is there's multiple ways to win, even if gas is a little lower and closer to strip. We see differentials that could even improve, beyond what we have in there. NGL pricing and netbacks could be better. Cost structure inefficiencies I think will get better. So I think you look across 2017-2018, we're in good shape. And then I still think if you look out far enough and you take into account incremental gas demand's coming and account for base decline that has to be overcome, there's a story brewing for gas. And, last but not least, I'd add in with gas prices where they are for people that aren't hedged, or even with some people saying oil prices may fall back in the second half of the year, actually lower prices in 2017 might help 2018, even though the strip doesn't reflect that right now.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Great. Thanks, Jeff. And then my follow-up \u2013 I appreciate the prepared remarks on the improvements in the NGL market. I'd love to get a little more color on what you guys see as far as the opportunity set for Range over the next few years with the ethane market and how you see ethane's supply-demand over the next few years in the U.S.?","Chad L. Stephens - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, this is Chad Stephens. I'll take that. We think that the ethane markets, both domestically and globally, are improving. There's several crackers coming online in the Gulf Coast in mid to late 2018 and coming into 2019. Those stocks are high right now. We feel like they'd be \u2013 several hundred thousand barrels a day demand that's represented in those crackers that's coming online will more than offset the supply that's available there. Also, propane with the ME 2 (sic) [ME 1] project that we're involved in and the propane that we're flowing through and putting on boats to the global markets is really flowing through currently into the improved NGL prices you see. And we see global propane demand increasing, PDH plants in China, the energy use for propane in Japan. So we see over the next several years propane demand increasing as well.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Great.","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, and I'll just tack onto that, Pearce. Chad said ME 2, but we're actually on ME 1, right?","Chad L. Stephens - Range Resources Corp.","ME 1, yeah, sorry.","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Didn't want to confuse anybody there. But with the great contracts we have on Mariner East 1, on Mariner West and ATEX and the improving markets that Chad was just referring to, we're pretty well set up. Our goal all along for years has been to have a diverse set of outlets and a diverse set of pricing scenarios. I think we're finally beginning to see how that's serving us really, really well. And what's important \u2013 it's going to offer us a ton of optionality going forward. So we can sit back and wait and see what Mariner East phase 2 is going to look like, or Mariner East 2X and the Shell cracker and all these other things. We've got lots of opportunities going forward, and I think that that's going to be a unique story for us as since we were so early on in these other projects.","Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Thanks, Ray.","Operator","And the next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","The ability to increase lateral length relative to the contiguousness of your acreage has long been a question, and it's certainly notable, you're at Range is substantially increasing lateral lengths in the 2017 program. Can you talk about whether the 2017 program is representative of the lateral lengths through the rest of the southwest Marcellus portfolio? And can you give us a sense of where you expect the lateral lengths to trend in future years?","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, Brian. It's a great question, and I think something that's not well-understood. But we literally have thousands of opportunities when you think about the hundred and some odd existing pads that we have that were all set up for anywhere from 15 to 20 different well locations, and most of them are five or six wells or less per pad. So it sets us up really well, and you've seen consistently, I think last year our average lateral length was around 6,400 or 6,500, something in that range. This year I think I can say with confidence it's going to be well over 8,000 feet. I think with the same amount of confidence, even more so, I think I still see those numbers going up significantly in 2018 and 2019.","I think eventually, if you look at it on a whole, I think the optimal lateral length that we see in the dry gas areas is probably over 10,000 feet. And I think in the liquids-rich areas I think we see some \u2013 the optimal average is probably going to be a little less than 10,000 feet. But, again, we've got more and more examples every day coming up like the one I talked about in my prepared remarks, that we're currently on a pad where we're drilling the third of three wells that's going to be over 15,000 feet. I think the average for that pad's going to be 15,100. And we've got several more of those pads coming up. So the fact that we've got this large core inventory of existing pads, we have a lot of flexibility in how those units are formed and reformed, and the ability to do that is really going to set us up for some big capital efficiency improvements going forward.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. And then shifting to Louisiana. You mentioned before that post the extension wells that you drilled that you see a gas in place that's pretty significant and expectations for EURs to be in line with what you're seeing in Terryville. What is the specific plan activity-wise in the extension area in 2017? And what are your expectations for what the wells you're drilling this year are going to deliver and tell you?","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Well, like I said, in our last press release, we put out the early results on the first three wells, and those three wells are \u2013 two of the three wells, the ones east and west, are still performing right in line with what we had talked about previously, right in between the Lower Red and the Upper Red type curves, so we're real pleased of those. Those are first up at bats. We've got a lot of work to do in reservoir characterization and modeling and a ton of science we need to do. We've permitted three more wells. We're in various stages of drilling pilot holes and taking cores, and I think we got one lateral waiting on a completion. I'm not sure what the timing's going to be on that.","All of that stuff we're developing very methodical, strategic plans that are going to be very data based, and they're going to be pretty slow going through this year. So I think the results, as we get more meaningful results that we have a lot of confidence in, we'll be able to talk about those, but I think those are going to be later this year. And our focus is still going to stay at Terryville, because that's clearly where we're seeing all the big wins. Lowering the cost by $1 million just in the last quarter is phenomenal, and I can say with great confidence it's going to go a lot lower. So I think that we're going to see some big, big things out of Terryville going forward. It's pretty exciting.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question is from Ron Mills of Johnson Rice.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. A question just on capital allocation, this year's two-thirds Marcellus and one-third North Louisiana. As you get more wells drilled in Louisiana and given the relative return profiles, do you foresee a situation where in 2018 or 2019 or beyond that the spending could be more equal between those areas?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, I think well, the good news is we have optionality there as you look forward. So there's good things happening in Louisiana, and of course with the pricing, that's a big advantage and all that, but there's good things happening up in the Marcellus, too. You're seeing a lot of improvements, longer laterals, better netbacks, new transportation agreements kicking in. So we'll continue to look at that as we go forward and turn that knob to where we think is optimum for any one particular year or time.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Ray, can you go over again in terms of lateral lengths on the dry gas versus the liquids-rich areas up in the Marcellus in terms of where you think they can go? And does that have any impact on potential well spacing?","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Sure. I think what I've been saying for some time now is we believe, from looking at what the optimum spacing and lateral length and all that is, I would say today that we're thinking in the dry areas of Southwest PA, you're looking at probably in excess of 10,000 feet. I don't know if I'd say 11,000 or 12,000, but somewhere between 10,000 and 12,000 foot, we feel like will probably be the optimal lateral length from an economics and return standpoint. I think as far as well spacing, we're probably looking at between 750 and 1,000 foot in general.","I think as you go more and more liquids, that spacing could get a little bit closer, and we still have in our presentation some of the extended tests, 500-foot spacing, and some of that stuff that looks really, really good. And then also the infill wells that we put on some of the existing pads, we've continued to update those examples in the PowerPoint also. So I'd encourage you to look at that, and the results are still very impressive. So I think to sum it up, dry areas are longer; liquids-rich areas are probably a little bit shorter just simply because of the physics of the issue.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Maybe flipped the other way, Ray.","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Oh, did I say it wrong?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, you said it backwards.","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","I'm sorry. Well, I'm talking about lateral lengths. The lateral lengths will be longer in dry and probably a little bit shorter \u2013 probably a little less than 10,000 foot in liquids. Spacing would be closer in liquids and a little bit further apart in dry. I think that says it clearer.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. Yeah. The other thing I'd say is we have a really big acreage position.","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Right.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","And we have the ability, back to Brian's question, it's really a big blocky position. If somebody says otherwise, that's fake news, to use that term. So we have the ability to drill long. And what you're seeing us do, again, is we try to be very thoughtful and methodical, scientific, data-driven, so we're drilling some 15,000-foot wells as we speak. We have some 10,000-foot wet wells, like Ray said, that are phenomenal. So we'll look at where that optimum is. It's probably a little early to say where it is. It's longer than we are, so we'll continue to march out, but we'll step out like we are with 15,000-foot wells, so we can see what that data looks like, and then again, dial it to where we think is optimum as we move forward with time. But that'll drive increasing efficiencies.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great. I appreciate it. The rest have been answered. Thanks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question is from Bob Morris of Citi.","Robert S. Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Ray, just following up on the lateral lengths in Southwest PA. The average lateral length you said is going to be just over 8,000 foot this year, but you talked about a lot of 10,000 and even 15,000-foot laterals with very good results. So 30-year wells are being driven on pads; that implies that there are going to be a good number of wells drilled at 5,000 or 6,000-foot laterals. Are those shorter laterals strictly on continuing to hold acreage? Or why would you drill shorter laterals anywhere in your program?","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Well again, like referring back to Jeff's comments, we have a huge position out there, and there are some areas where you physically can't go more than 5,000 or 6,000 feet, just because it may be somebody else's lease or just a lot of different reasons when you look at that large of an area. So in general, the team is always pushing to drill longer and longer laterals. And again, what we put in the earnings release showing you the plans, that's the plans as of we see them today. And the one thing I can tell you is we're going to change, and just like we have pretty much every year, those lateral lengths will all go longer, and the performance will be better and the costs would be lower. I mean, we've seen that year after year with what the teams have been able to do up there.","So again, I mean you're exactly right. What we're quoting is averages. So there will be some that are, like I talked about, that seven-well pad we just approved that's over 10,000 foot average. There's a three-well pad that the three 15,000-foot wells, actually on that same pad there's a 5,000-foot lateral. So you average all that up, but in general, we're going to be going a lot longer. And we see that continual improvement in capital efficiency over the next several years for sure.","Robert S. Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So the shorter laterals are just due to physical limitations? Just where you don't have acreage blocked out to drill the longer laterals right now?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Or you could have an old well out there that's butting up against that lease, so there's some of that in there.","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","But we have a lot of wells that we can drill longer laterals on.","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. Like I said, our focus is going to be always going longer.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah.","Robert S. Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question is from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys. A question on that slide 38, where you just talked a little bit on the Utica\/Point Pleasant. Totally understand your box where you talk about the low-risk, high-return in the Marcellus and North Louisiana, kind of with the focus there. Is there a few more well \u2013 I guess, what would you be waiting to see in order to accelerate the program there, would be my, I guess, larger question?","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, it's a good question. And our well \u2013 I mean, the good news is we've drilled I guess three wells in the Utica, and our third well is clearly one of the top four in the play. And so when looking at going forward, we're still basically in a wait-and-see mode, Neal. The issue is, as much as we've improved cost and understanding and everything else, you're still looking at something that cost 2.5 times more than a Marcellus well. And I quoted one in my remarks, a four-well pad that averaged over 9,200 feet for around $6.3 million per well that's making 30% more. It's going to be way above a 20 Bcf well. And so we just don't see it \u2013 it's going to be a compatible play or comparable play, something that at some point it's going to make sense to pull the trigger on. But in this current market and given the fact that we have literally thousands of these kind of locations that we're talking about to do going forward, I just don't see it competing with the Marcellus in our case anytime soon.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, and it's back to, that play's in an earlier state, so you'd be spending a lot of R&D dollars to try to unlock it when, like Ray said, we've got a lot of much higher probability, stronger economic wells to drill instead. But at some point, there'll be a lot of value to it.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Sure, sure. And then just lastly -","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","We hold all those deep rights, by the way, so we -","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, we have 400,000 acres so -","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, it's captured.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","It's all HBP, Jeff?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Right.","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Yes.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just lastly on the hedging, how active I guess, or how liquid is the NGL market if you're able to try to not do a dirty hedge but try to hedge each of the components right now out a year or two or three?","Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, this is Laith. There's really no problem hedging out a couple years. Liquidity gets a little more challenged if you get out beyond a couple years, but we're also on the physical side able to hedge some of that. If you're looking at propane and some of the sales out of Mariner East you're able to do that through some physical sales as well.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah, I've seen that. Okay. Great. Thanks, Laith.","Operator","We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Marshall Carver of Heikkinen Energy for our final question.","Marshall H. Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yes. Thank you. Most my questions were answered, but I do have one left. You had very good results in two of the initial extension wells in North Louisiana. With the higher net pay in the extension areas in multiple zones, do you think those first couple wells targeted the best possible zone? Or do you see any room for improvement there in terms of targeting now that you've been looking at it a little bit longer?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","That's a great question, Marshall, and back to \u2013 what we said is those wells, really they're east and west of Vernon. They're more like Vernon, so you've got instead of just Terryville, you've got one Upper Red; down there you've got three Upper Reds. In Terryville you've got one Lower Red; there you've got three Lower Reds. And all these laterals are just in one of the six zones. Did we pick the optimum zone? Did we optimally drill and complete it? And actually \u2013 I mean, you can go on and on. That's why there's tremendous upside. We're excited about the 400 Bcf per section, the high pressure, the thicker interval. And which of those six laterals is best ultimately that we developed \u2013 who knows? Four of six or five of six or two of six? So there's a lot of upside and a lot of potential there, so it gives us optionality. We just want to be very thoughtful how to go forward. Like Ray said \u2013 he talked about all the types of data we're gathering to help understand that.","Marshall H. Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","All right. And the next wells will be likely the second half of this year?","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, I think before we can talk about any results that are meaningful, I think, yeah, we're looking later this year. Like I said, we're in various stages of drilling pilot holes and thinking \u2013 I think we've got one lateral that's ready to be completed, but we're waiting on a lot of the rock data and the stuff back from the cores and valuations of all the logs that we've run to figure out and design those ultimate completions and figure out the best fluids for it and that sort of thing. Like Jeff said, there's just a ton of work to do, and with all the great success and our focus on Terryville, we're able to basically take our time and make some real data-driven decisions going into this extension area.","Marshall H. Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","All right. Sounds good. Thank you very much.","Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.","You bet.","Jeffrey L.

Roger will be next with a discussion of our financial position and John will follow with his perspective. Then we'll open it up for Q&A.","Let me begin with a review of where we've been as a company, where we are today and where the company can go in the future. Despite the current low gas price environment, Range is well positioned for 2012 and beyond. This is a result of our multiyear strategy of growth in reserves and production on a per share basis, debt adjusted, with one of the lowest cost structures in our peer group, coupled with building and high grading our inventory. It's also the result of long range planning, both operationally and financially.","Our organic growth rate from 2003 to 2011 ranged from less than 5% to 2011's top rate of 12%. During this timeframe, Range went from being one of the higher cost companies in our peer group to one of the lowest cost companies. This was the result of getting into plays that if successful, offered very repeatable high rate of return growth opportunities such as the Marcellus Shale and horizontal Mississippian plays. It's also the result of exiting relatively high cost low-growth plays with little repeatability, like the Gulf of Mexico and Deepwood Viner Chalk [ph]. As a result of our strategy, we sold about $1.8 billion of properties during this timeframe. This focused our technical resources on higher quality opportunities and lowered our cost structure. It also provided significant funding for better return projects.","Looking back, we were fortunate to have sold these properties in a higher commodity price environment. Carrying over a portion of the 2011 sale proceeds into 2012, coupled with our strong hedge position for the year puts us in a strong position to execute on our plan. We're currently hedged on the gas side with the floors of $4.45 per Mmbtu for approximately 75% of our estimated 2012 production. I believe 2012 will be an inflection point for Range.","In 2012, our organic growth target is expected to be 30% to 35% versus the past 9 years of less than 12%. Since 95% of our capital is planned to be directed into the Marcellus Shale and horizontal Mississippian plays, the growth should also come with higher returns and lower costs than before.","Given our large acreage position in these plays, we'll have the opportunity to do this for years to come. Even at current strip pricing, all of our projects generate good to excellent rates of return. The rate of return in the liquids-rich portion of the Marcellus and horizontal Mississippian plays range from 73% to 99%. The rate of return in the dry gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale ranges from 27% to 32%. Even in our dry gas fields in Virginia, the rate of return of the wells that we had originally considered ranges from 20% to 27%. However, given that this acreage is either all held by production or we own the minerals, we're limiting the capital allocation for Virginia development to $30 million in favor of higher rate of return projects.","For 2012, we're projecting 30% to 35% growth based on a $1.6 billion capital program, which is roughly flat spending from 2011. Approximately 75% of this capital will be directed into liquids-rich areas, primarily in the super-rich and wet Marcellus, and horizontal Mississippian oil play. For 2013, assuming that gas prices continue to stay relatively low and oil prices remain high, we can contain capital spending to a level which does not increase our leverage above year-end 2012 levels.","Given the current strip pricing, we believe the company can grow between 15% to 20% in 2013 using just our internally generated cash flow, if we choose to do so. In this scenario, 85% to 90% of our capital would be directed into our super-rich wet oil plays. We can do this and still retain substantially all the key acreage that we want in the Marcellus and other plays. What puts us in a different category than most companies is that we're positioned to grow at 15% to 20% within cash flow for years to come and retain the ability to significantly ramp up when it's prudent to do so, based on either recovery of natural gas prices or significantly enhanced drilling results. Also, all of our investments are in the best or some of the best plays in the U.S.","Bottom line, everything we're drilling is well in excess of our investment hurdle rates, which are well above our cost of capital and therefore, will add value to the company. Additional advantages of our 2012 program are: that will increase our cash flow and convert more of our Marcellus and horizontal Mississippian acreage to held by production.","Given the rates of return, the spending question is not whether this is a prudent economic investment. It's more of a balance sheet question. Our best estimate at this point in time is that our debt-to-EBITDAX at year end 2012 will be approximately 2.7x compared to 3x in the first quarter of 2011 before the Barnett sale. Therefore, we feel that our current 2012 capital plan is very consistent with the prudent management of the resources of the company. Roger will discuss this in more detail shortly.","In addition, we're evaluating 5 enhancements to our portfolio. They are as follows:","The first is the super-rich Marcellus. We currently have an acreage position of 125,000 net acres west of most of our drilling in Washington County, Pennsylvania, which we've defined as 1,350 Btu in higher gas or super-rich gas area. We now have drilled 8 wells on the edge of this super-rich area. So far these wells average 400,000 barrels of liquids and 3.9 Bcf of gas per well. One of these wells is estimated to produce 520,000 barrels of liquid and 4.8 Bcf. This compares to our current average wet Marcellus well of 281,000 barrels of liquids and 4.2 Bcf of gas. Given the high price of oil versus the current low price of gas, this super-rich play enhances the value of our Marcellus economics.","The higher volumes are not only the result of drilling in the higher Btu area, but are also the result of drilling longer laterals and completing them with more frac stages. We've also experimented with reduced cluster spacing, decreasing the frac interval from 300 feet to 150 to 200 feet, all of this looks very promising. Once we extract ethane beginning late next year, this will further enhance the economics.","The second area is the super-rich Upper Devonian. We believe the Upper Devonian has comparable hydrocarbons in place relative to the Marcellus. This thermal maturity is also similar to the Marcellus. Where the Marcellus is dry, wet and super-rich, we believe so too is the Upper Devonian. To provide more data to evaluate this potential, we plan to drill a few wells in the super-rich Upper Devonian this year, which will be our first test there.","This potentially can double what we have in the Marcellus in this area. The first super-rich Upper Devonian well has already been drilled and is waiting on completion.","The third area is the wet Utica. We have 115,000 net acres on our Coopers timeframe of an area in Northwest Pennsylvania that's prospective for wet Utica. The Point Pleasant should also be present across this position, which is the target interval for the Utica test. The drilling depth of the wells in this area will be about 7,000 feet true vertical depth. This well will spud this summer.","The fourth area is the horizontal Mississippian oil play. We now have about 125,000 net acres in this play, and we started program drilling this year. We have 2 rigs running and expect to exit 2012 with 2 to 3 rigs. This is an oil play with very liquids-rich gas at a depth of about 4,500 feet.","The fifth area is the Cline Shale oil play. This is an oil play on our Conger field acreage that we formerly referred to as the Penn Shale. Devon, Chesapeake, Laredo and Apache are all in this play and are all calling it the Cline Shale, which is another name for the same interval, so we're changing to the more common industry nomenclature.","Our first horizontal well here is very encouraging, and we have recently drilled a second test about 10 miles way. We currently have about 100,000 net acres that is prospective for this play. Ray will discuss all of these plays in more detail during his presentation.","As you know, Pennsylvania recently passed legislation, which adopts an impact fee, better regulatory uniformity and enhanced environmental protection and safety regulations, all of which we believe are positive for the communities where we operate and for continued development of our acreage in Pennsylvania.","For 2012, we're projecting production growth of 30% to 35%. Production guidance for the first quarter of 2012 is 638 million cubic feet equivalent per day. This represents a 17% production increase over the first quarter of 2011 including the Barnett and a 47% increase excluding the Barnett. We will stay focused on safety and being good stewards of the environment. We are drilling at what most people believe is the best gas play in the United States, the Marcellus Shale. We're also focusing most of our efforts in the super-rich and wet portions of the play, where the returns are as good as any oil or gas play in the business.","The horizontal Mississippian oil play is also considered to be one of the best plays in our industry. Our high-quality plays and low-cost structure, coupled with our good hedge position and good financial planning have us well-positioned for what looks to be a tough gas price environment.","Next is Ray.","Ray N. Walker","Thanks, Jeff. Let me start out by saying that 2011 was a great year, full of great accomplishments. And I'd really want to give a strong shout out to all the members of our operations and technical teams across the company. In all the divisions we have great news, great metrics and great upside, and it's truly a testament to their dedication and efforts. Our people make this company great. And it's the people that create the value that they as well as we all appreciate as shareholders.","What I really want to do with my remarks this afternoon is focus on going forward and give you some additional color and details that maybe you hadn't thought about just yet. On our website, in our investor presentation, you will now find maps of our acreage position across the state of Pennsylvania. This is the first time we have disclosed this level of detail.","Let me focus on Southwestern Pennsylvania for just a few minutes. There's about 210,000 net acres in the wet area, which is that acreage we have been drilling in for several years now, in and around the MarkWest Houston plant. The wet area is defined as that acreage which is between 1,050 Btus and 1,350 Btus. In the dry area, we have about 235,000 net acres, and of course, this area is that acreage where the gas is not processed and is less than 1,050.","We have 125,000 net acres with greater than 1,350 Btu like Jeff referred to, which we now define as the super-rich Marcellus. We are introducing 5 new enhancements to our portfolio. These are not new projects thrown together in response to current market conditions. In fact, several of them have been in the works for more than a few years.","We have also been working for some time now to redirect more of our capital and resources to liquids-rich and oil plays. Given the current environment, this strategy is performing well for us.","Liquids growth for the company in 2012 will be up approximately 40% as compared to 2011 year-over-year. Our first enhancement area is particularly impactful and is what we call the super-rich Marcellus. And I'll spend most of my time discussing this area, and we've not discussed a lot of detail previously because we've been working for a couple of years now consolidating and trading acreage, while at the same time, planning and putting together infrastructure.","We've now completed 8 horizontal wells in this area. They were drilled in the timeframe beginning in the spring of 2010 through this past summer. And like Jeff said, the average EUR of those wells is 400,000 barrels of liquids, of which 95,000 barrels is condensate plus 3.9 Bcf of gas. I should make it a point to emphasize that these numbers do not include ethane extraction.","When comparing to other plays like the Utica and the Eagle Ford, it's important to compare apples-to-apples. If we were to extract ethane today like we will in late 2013, these 8 wells would have an EUR of approximately 720,000 barrels of liquids and 3.3 Bcf of gas.","Simultaneously, we've been developing a completion technique utilizing reduced cluster spacing combined with moderately longer laterals as Jeff mentioned. This new technique appears to have great potential in both our super-rich and wet areas. And in fact, we will be experimenting with this technique throughout the rest of the play this year. So let me tell you about 3 of the wells that we've used this technique on. I've got details for one well in the super-rich area and 2 wells in the wet area to highlight.","Jeff touched on one of these wells and there's IP information on all 3 wells in the press release. But I really want to take a couple minutes and add some more detail.","The well on the super-rich area was completed with a lateral length of 4,137 feet in 19 stages. The EUR of this well without ethane extraction is 520,000 barrels of liquids, of which 138,000 barrels is condensate plus 4.8 Bcf of gas. No doubt, that's a great well.","If you extract ethane, that becomes 915,000 barrels of liquids and 4.1 Bcf of gas. Our plan for the area in 2012 is to drill approximately 59 wells and place 55 of those wells online.","In the wet area, we completed a well with a lateral length of 2,375 feet in 14 stages. The EUR of this well is 355,000 barrels of liquids, of which 19,000 of barrels is condensate plus 4.8 Bcf of gas. With ethane extraction, it's 748,000 barrels of liquids and 4.1 Bcf of gas.","Another well in the wet area was completed with a lateral length of 3,425 feet and 22 stages. The EUR of this well is 356,000 barrels of liquids, of which 21,000 barrels was condensate plus 5.1 Bcf of gas. With ethane, those numbers go to 794,000 barrels of liquids and 4.4 Bcf of gas. All 3 are great wells, and we believe illustrate the significance of this technique in both our wet and super-rich areas. Let me talk about economics for a minute.","Using the average of the 8 super-rich wells, we believe we can drill and complete those wells in a development mode for approximately $4.7 million. At strip pricing, we could achieve a rate of return of 95% and a net present value at 10% of $11 million. This contrasts with our wet area economics, which yield a rate of return of 73% at strip pricing and a net present value at 10% of $8 million based on an average of 188 wells drilled in that wet area from 2009 through 2011.","As you can see, both areas compare favorably to any play, whether it be gas, liquid rich or oil in North America. While we believe all of our acreage in Southwestern Pennsylvania is prospective and including the dry, let me take a little liberty here and suggest just how impactful this wet and super-rich acreage could be for the company.","If we took the 335,000 net acres, which is the combined acreage count across the wet and super-rich areas and we assume those acres were developed on [audio gap] over 4,150 wells to drill, that number of horizontal wells with the kind of economics that I just discussed would have a huge impact on the net asset value of our company.","The second area is the super-rich Upper Devonian Shale. It's really exciting to think that we could essentially have a lay down double sitting right on top of our super-rich Marcellus acreage, especially when you think about the impact to our value that I just discussed.","Our third enhancement is the wet Utica or Point Pleasant in Northwest Pennsylvania that Jeff described, and we look forward to our first test this summer.","The fourth project is the horizontal Mississippian oil play. You've already heard a lot about this over the past year and there's a lot of detail in this oil play in our presentation. Again, even though it's very early in the project, with our experienced team and with the data that we have, there is confidence in the production profile of the original wells, confidence in our completion designs and confidence in our projected economics. The team has done a great job with planning, infrastructure and marketing, and we believe our team has positioned us in a significant sweet spot of the play.","We fully expect the team to continue to make great improvements in enhancing the performance of the reservoir, lowering the cost and improving the efficiencies and economics of our operations there.","Our fifth enhancement is the horizontal Cline Shale oil play under our Conger properties in West Texas near Sterling City. Last year, we drilled our first test well. That well's been on production for approximately 6 months and looks very promising with great economics. We just completed our second test well, approximately 10 miles from the first and are commencing flow back as we speak.","We plan to drill 3 or 4 more delineation wells this year and should have results to discuss by the end of the year. At strip pricing and using the first well results and our current today's cost, these wells will generate a 41% rate of return with a $3.7 million PV10, pretty impressive for the very first well. Again, this is a legacy asset with ample infrastructure and with an experienced team on the ground and ready to go.","It could be a great oil play with substantial upside, and as typical with most oil plays, we fully expect that our team will steadily improve the well performance and cost as we begin drilling in the play.","I know there have been lots of questions about the new legislation just passed in Pennsylvania. We believe the Commonwealth now has some of the strongest safety and environmental legislation in the country. Range pioneered or advocated for many of the provisions and has been implementing these standards voluntarily in the field for some time.","From an operations standpoint, having uniformity in how our industry interacts with local municipalities now allows predictable planning and consistent regulation. Also included is a competitive fee to offset our industry impacts with the majority of the revenue directed to those municipalities where drilling is taking place. Again, we congratulate all the leadership in Harrisburg for this great accomplishment.","In summary, it's an exciting time at Range and a very exciting time for me personally as the new Chief Operating Officer. Range has a great track record of production growth at an industry-leading cost structure. We remain focused on safety and environmental protections. Our balance sheet is strong and we have a great year in front of us that will show even more improvements in unit cost, while experiencing substantial production and reserve growth.","We now have new enhancements to our already substantial portfolio that should provide growth and exceptional economics in liquids-rich and oil plays well into the future. Overriding all of that, we have what I personally believe to be one of the best technical and operations teams in the business today. And it's truly a great honor for me to get the chance to lead them for many years to come.","With that, I'll turn it over to Roger.","Roger S. Manny","Thank you, Ray. Before I take you through the quarterly expense items and first quarter expense guidance figures, let me follow up on some of the balance sheet issues Jeff mentioned earlier.","Our leverage, prior to the Barnett sale, stood at a debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 3x. Following the Barnett sale, this ratio declined to 2.2x. Range has the financial flexibility to fund our 2012 and 2013 capital spend through cash flow and our remaining proceeds from asset sales, combined with our existing credit capacity and without taking our leverage to uncomfortable levels.","By uncomfortable levels, I mean that even though our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio covenant limit is 4.25x, if our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio gets much over 3x, we become uncomfortable. And it will not stay there for an extended period. One of the reasons we're so confident with our 2012 and 2013 funding plan is because Range has always had such solid underpinnings to its credit quality. Our low operating cost structure, our disciplined hedge program, our operating control over our major growth areas, our long reserve life, our simple balance sheet, our orderly staggered debt maturity ladder, our sizeable liquidity cushion from our well diversified $2 billion borrowing base credit facility, and perhaps most important, a long track record of low reserve replacement cost and consistent reserve and production growth.","These strengths are not going to change. We've never compromised our balance sheet to achieve growth for growth's sake. And we're not about to start now.","Moving to the income statement. There's a new line item this quarter that I need to bring to your attention. E&P companies generally report their transportation, compression and firm capacity expense 1 of 2 ways. These expenses are either netted against revenue or these costs are itemized and included as an operating expense.","Because our focus is on the upstream segment, and we rely mostly upon our midstream industry partners to provide these services, it always seemed to make more sense for Range to use the netting method. The 2011 Pricewaterhouse industry accounting practices survey revealed that approximately 1\/3 of all E&P companies use the netting method and 2\/3 use the itemized expense method.","So to better conform with the majority of other E&P companies, where Range is billed separately for these services, we will adopt the expense method of reporting these costs, and we have re-classed these expenses in our current and historical financial statements.","Rodney's team has included several new tables on the website to help everyone get comfortable with this reclassification. Please remember that both methods gets you to the same gross margin EBITDAX, cash flow, net income and breakeven mcfe prices. Every $0.01 you see in this expense increase revenue by the same $0.01.","Cash flow in the fourth quarter recorded its sixth consecutive quarterly increase at $216 million. That's 36% higher than last year. On a fully diluted per share basis, cash flow was $1.35 or $0.09 above the analyst consensus estimate. EBITDAX came in at $249 million in the fourth quarter, which was 31% higher than last year. Cash margin for the third quarter was $3.69 an mcfe, that's up 18% from last year, thanks to higher realized prices and significantly lower op cost.","Fourth quarter earnings used -- calculated using analyst methodology was $53 million or $0.33 per diluted share. That's $0.02 above analyst consensus estimates.","Cash flow for all of 2011 was $737 million and EBITDAX for the year was $869 million, it's 28% and 25%, respectively, over last year's annual figures. As always, please reference our website for full reconciliations of these non-GAAP figures, as well as supplemental tables breaking out our results from discontinued operations.","Moving down the income statement a bit. One of the first things you'll notice is a sharp drop in our direct operating unit cost expense. Including workovers, unit cost operating expense was $0.45 per mcfe. Now this unusually low figure benefited from several prior period adjustments, making the normalized figure $0.49 per mcfe. The important thing to note here is that the normalized $0.49 per mcfe figure is 31% lower than the $0.72 figure from the fourth quarter of last year.","The first quarter of each year usually sees a slight increase in operating expense due to seasonal operating conditions. So I expect direct operating expense to be in the $0.52 to $0.54 range next quarter.","As I mentioned a moment ago, we're now breaking out our third-party transportation, gathering and compression expenses on a separate line item rather than netting them against revenue. On a unit cost basis, this transportation, gathering and compression expense was $0.60 in the fourth quarter. That's up $0.44 from last year.","This expense has trended upward with production during the buildout years, but will eventually flatten out and begin to decline as we add volume through the newly built infrastructure. First quarter 2012 expense is expected to be $0.01 higher than last quarter at approximately $0.61 an mcfe.","Our DD&A rate continues to decline as our capital efficiency continues to improve. Fourth quarter DD&A fell from $1.85 per mcfe last year to $1.69 per mcfe this year. Going forward into 2012, we expect the DD&A rate to hover between $1.65 and $1.68 per mcfe depending upon our production mix.","Production and ad valorem taxes declined in the fourth quarter to $0.10 per mcfe. This will likely be the low watermark however, as the new Pennsylvania state drilling impact fee that Ray mentioned goes into effect this year. We anticipate the initial retroactive payment for wells drilled in 2011 and previous years, that's due September 1, to be approximately $25 million. And the 2012 payment, that's due April 1, 2013, will be approximately $28 million. Because of the need to concurrently accrue the retroactive payment and the payment for current year wells, first quarter 2012 production taxes, including the new impact fee will be approximately $0.55 per mcfe.","In the second quarter of 2012 and the rest of the year, the rate should be closer to $0.20 per mcfe. But as production taxes vary with price and the Pennsylvania law is less than 2 weeks old, we're still working through all the details.","G&A expense adjusted for noncash stock comp and other nonrecurring items for the fourth quarter was $0.59 an mcfe. That's $0.06 below last year. And we expect unit cost G&A to be a few cents lower next quarter, likely coming in between $0.55 and $0.57.","Fourth quarter interest expense was essentially flat with the third quarter, but came down from the prior year on a unit cost basis to $0.60 due to higher production. We continue to build production volume at a faster rate than debt. So interest as a unit cost should continue to decline slightly in 2012.","Exploration expense, excluding noncash compensation in the fourth quarter, was $24 million. And that's up from $16 million last year due to the timing of budgeted seismic expense. The first quarter of 2012 should see exploration expense in the $26 million to $27 million range before drifting down to the low-$20 million range later in the year.","Unproved property abandonment and impairment for the fourth quarter was $28 million. This figure is up from last year's $24 million due to year-end reassessments of our acreage and our drilling plans. Unproved property impairment in the first quarter should decline and will likely be between $19 million and $21 million.","Touching back briefly on the balance sheet before I conclude. I would add that we are not anticipating any reduction to our $2 billion borrowing base at next month's bank redetermination. Though most banks have significantly reduced their price deck that they apply to borrowing base loans from last year's levels, our strong reserve quality and reserve replacement history, combined with our favorable multiyear hedge position and cost structure should result in an easy 2012 reaffirmation of our $2 billion borrowing base.","In summary, 2011 was a terrific year for Range, consistent reserve replacement and production volume growth combined with lower unit cost have produced increasing revenue and cash flow. A true inflection point. When combined with our strong balance sheet and hedge position, 2012 is set to be another great year.","John, over to you.","John H. Pinkerton","Thanks, Roger. Terrific update. As everybody has mentioned today, obviously, our 2011 results, I'm very pleased with. I want to congratulate the entire Range team for their extraordinary performance in 2011.","Over the past 8 years, we've repositioned Range driven by our strategy of consistently growing production reserves at low cost. The 4 key takeaways are:","One, Range has achieved 6 consecutive years of double digit per share production in reserve growth. Only a handful of companies have ever achieved this high level of consistent growth. Importantly, we have the ability to extend this streak for many years.","Second, we have one of the lowest cost structures now in the industry. We have seen unit operating cost decline from a high of $1.05 in 2008 to $0.49 in the fourth quarter of 2011. We've also seen our D&A expense drop from a high of $2.48 in 2009 to $1.69 in the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect to generate further enhancements to our cost structure in the years ahead.","Three, we have painstakingly pieced together very high return low-cost inventory of drilling projects that now totals over 8,600 locations. These projects generate attractive returns even in the current low natural gas price environment.","Fourth, we have assembled a very talented group of people who work together extremely well and are extraordinarily focused on delivering our strategy of low cost -- I mean, of consistent growth at low cost. Inflection point has been mentioned several times on the call. I think inflection point very clearly defines where Range is positioned today.","We have worked tirelessly over the past years to sell $1.8 billion of mature higher cost properties, lower our cost structure and strengthen our balance sheet. In particular, the bold move last year of selling our Barnett Shale properties, which at the time comprised 20% of our production reserves, was a defining moment for Range. As a result, we now have a balance sheet that can fully support our operating strategy.","I want to highlight all of this was accomplished with a laser focus on shareholder value. The bull's eye of our inflection point is our drilling inventory. We have a diversified portfolio that covers over 1 million net acres and includes the best liquids projects in the U.S. in Southwest Pennsylvania, high-quality oil projects in the horizontal Mississippian play in Oklahoma, the Cline Shale play in West Texas and some very high quality dry gas projects in Northeast Pennsylvania.","In last night's operations release and the updated company presentation. We have added a lot of information including detailed acreage maps and well economics to stress the high return, low cost nature of our portfolio.","While the returns and costs are terrific, I'm convinced our team will do 2 things. First, they will make the results better over time by optimizing the returns. And second, I believe they will continue to deliver for Range's shareholders just like they have done in the past 6 years.","In summary, while the last 6 year's results have generated significant value for Range's shareholders, I believe the best is yet to come. The inflection point has clearly raised the bar. Now it's up to all of us at Range to make it happen in 2012 beyond.","Operator, let's now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the liquids play. Could you tell us, I know it's very early, but could you talk about potential spacing here, as well as kind of drilling plans, how active you intend to become on that play.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, Neal, that's a good question. We currently today are drilling our wells generally on 1,000-foot between laterals, which would translate into longer -- moderately longer lateral cases to something around 80 acres. Do we expect, I mean the question is, do we expect it to get denser? I think in most plays today, we are seeing denser development as time goes on, but it's just too early to give you a number at this point because we just simply got to do more wells. We got to get reserves, do some modeling, measure the hydrocarbons in place and so forth. So today, we're generally looking at 1,000 acres and also trying to HBP all the acreage through there as we drill.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And I would just add on to what Ray said. Particularly if you look at the oil plays, specifically like the Mississippian, we put out recovery factors of 4% to 9% of the oil in place. Do I expect ultimately it'll be that? No, I would say it probably will be higher. Most likely will come from down spacing. Same with the Cline Shale, whenever you get oil plays with more viscous fluid, to go to tighter spacing I think is clearly reasonable.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, then just one follow-up. Just on the horizontal Miss. We've heard some chatter about just, over at [indiscernible] County and I guess state results showing a bit more volatility, some not as good. But if you can maybe just a comment on just overall results and shale expectations for the play.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I think in any of these places it's really important on where you are. There's always a core area and non-core areas. There's better areas and poor areas. I would say looking at the results of our Mississippian wells even though it's early, there's only 8 wells, but the average results of 485,000 barrels per well is really great. It's outstanding. So I feel comfortable that we're in a good position. And we think really what drives that is the fact that where our acreage is located. Really that's an oil play with a lot of water. We think being high structurally is good. A lot of our acreage is up on the Nemaha Ridge, so we're higher uplift, so we're higher structurally. The other advantage of being up on the ridge is that you have a chat component to your production. And with chat comes higher porosity. The chat -- when you get off structure, you tend to lose chat or you don't have nearly as much. The porosity in the chat is 30% to 40%. The porosity in the carbonate is 3% to 5%. So you have significantly higher porosity and a better structural position is what we think leads to those results.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Kistler of Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly on your CapEx for '13 and growth for '13. You talked about those numbers with respect to living within cash flow. What are you actually targeting? I mean, that seems more like a kind of a test case or an illustrative example, but should we be thinking about more like 30%-type production growth numbers? And living outside of cash flow kind of tying up our models to maybe 3x that debt to EBITDAX figure.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Let me take a crack at answering that. It's a great question. Really what we want to give total granularity on what we're doing in 2012, what we're seeing for 2013, it shows you the flexibility of the company and the optionality of what we can do. If we choose to live within cash flow, we can still grow at 15% to 20% per year, if we choose to do that. And importantly, I think when you look at a company our size and given our portfolio, I'm not saying we are going to do this, but if you could grow consistently at 15% to 20% for years for a company that has a market cap for more than $10 billion with the cost structure and return we have, it's pretty impressive. That being said, we really want, what we're saying is, we want to maintain the flexibility that based on where gas and oil prices are, based on the results of our wells, even if we choose to cut back for a year to live within cash flow, if we do that, we have the ability to significantly ramp up the following year, say, and really capture a lot of the NPV. So we got the ability to ramp up or down depending on what we think is the most prudent to do. I know you guys probably want the answer to that today, but what we're going probably to do is what we've done in past years. Where we'll continue to look throughout the year and we'll continue to look at where gas and oil prices are, where our portfolio is, what the results of the wells are, present it to our board in the fall, come out with our plan, most likely early next year like we do every year. But we'll give you -- we'll continue to give you guidance or a little bit of color as we go throughout the year. Most importantly, we're telling you what we can do. We can, if we want to, choose to cut back and live within cash flow even if it's for a year, still retain all the resource potential, still retain our acreage and then ramp up when we want to. So we're not saying we're doing that for 2012. But we're saying we have the ability to do that if we choose to do so.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that. And then just a clarification on your liquids production growth number for '12. If I heard it correctly, you said 40% liquids production growth. Can you split that up for us between oil and gas?","Ray N. Walker","Well, the percent growth, we've given guidance on the overall production 30% to 35%. And I guess the way to answer that is say, the liquids year-over-year 2012 compared to 2011 will be growth of 40%. So we're disproportionally growing more in liquids than we are in gas. It's definitely back-end loaded towards the end of this year. There's no question about that because we have been trying to consciously make this shift from dry gas over to the liquids-type plays for several months now. And we're still evolving that. We're still waiting on the infrastructure in certain cases and things like that. So the best clarity I can give you today is to tell you that year-over-year, it's going to be about 40% liquids. I think in the coming calls, into the next quarter or so we'll have a lot more granularity that we'll know by that point. Right now, we're just trying to maintain flexibility to be able to get to that point.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","I guess the clarification I was looking for was really with that 40% liquids growth, the split between oil and NGLs, I apologize.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, what we've tried to do over the next few weeks is continue -- we're in the process of fine-tuning our models and everything else. Hopefully within the next few weeks, we can come out with something in guidance that we can put out for everyone in terms of what that will be.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that. One last one, if I might. Just looking at the Cline Shale, obviously returns there are little lower than what you're seen in the super-rich and what you're seeing in the Miss Lime. At anytime point would you think about liquidating that asset and redirecting capital in these high-return areas?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, I think the key thing. Your comments are true, except what to me is so exciting is that's our very first well. If you go back and look at our very first Marcellus wells, they really weren't that good. And typically in all of these shale plays, you tend to see significant improvement with time in terms of what you can do in terms of driving down costs or driving up initial rates and reserves. The fact that our very first well IP-ed at 600 boes per day and has a rate of return off of today's costs, and assuming no improvement in reserves and just what we can drill it for today, still generates an attractive rate of return is really exciting. So I have great faith in the technical teams that are working that, led by Ray and Mark and the rest of the guys that at the end of the year, that's going to look a lot different and hopefully, I think a lot better. And then we always assess with where it looks a specific point in time. But to me, to come out of the box on the first well, usually it's a strike or foul tip or you're beaten out of bunk to first base, that's a solid single for a first well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ron Mills of Johnson Rice.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","On the Mississippi Lime, can you talk about -- maybe some of it has to do with where you are in the Nemaha Ridge and the structural component. But the variance between your well design and some other people in the play, you have a much shorter lateral with fewer frac stages. Is that something geologic in your area? Or is that something that you will begin to test longer laterals and increase frac stages like you have started to do up in the Marcellus?","Ray N. Walker","Yes, Ron. And that's a great question and Jeff sort of alluded or hinted at an answer a little bit in that there are geologic reasons that we think it's better. We are primarily up on the uplift. We've done a real good job of concentrating our efforts in putting our operations and acreage together there in a consolidated manner because a lot of it is focused on operational efficiencies. We're a little bit shallower up on the ridge. We got a little bit less gas or pumps downhill can work a little bit more efficiently. We can drill shorter laterals because we think the rock is probably or potentially a little more fractured. We've got the chat, which has higher porosity. And so what we've seen with the first 8 wells and granted it's the first 8 wells, so it's very early in the play is that with 2,200 feet in 12 stages, which is approximately 1\/2 of what people are doing out to the far edges of the basins, we're seeing the top end of the reserves. And I think all of those things kind of accumulate to get the results that we're getting. Of course, what we're doing this year, we're going to be -- we got 2 rigs running currently. We're going to drill, put online about 23 wells in that area this year. We'll drill about 3 saltwater disposal wells. And I fully expect that the team's going to do a great job in getting those costs down and learning things about where to target the laterals and become more efficiently -- more efficient in the way that they complete them. And then of course, we are going to look at some longer laterals and that sort of thing, just like we would in any play. So hopefully, without rambling on too much that answers your question.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And do you have, was this a seismic-driven portion of the play where you were looking for structure? And if you look at your total 125,000-acre position, do you start to get a little bit more into a strat portion of the play versus structure? Or have you been able to confine your acreage more along this uplift?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes. Let me try to answer your question. And I think it's important to get into the history of the play for us. We really started in that play back in 2004 as a reactivation of Tonkawa field, which was the world's or the U.S.'s largest light oilfield back in the early '20s, late 19-teens. And we started reacting within a shallow formation there was the Tonkawa at a depth of about 2,700 feet. So we did that, which is reactivating that old field. Once we did that after the first couple of years, plus or minus, the team recommended shooting a 3D over that old field which was to me was pretty creative at the time because there's such well density, you think, how can anybody missed anything. And what it led to, was it led us to drilling deeper targets like the Mississippian and even things below, in the Wilcox and Redfork and some of the other targets. As we did that, drilling them vertically we found that, \"Hey, the Mississippian was even better than the Tonkawa.\" And then what it led us to do based on our interpretation was to move off that structure. Remembering, the whole structure really is up on the Nemaha Ridge and the ridge is 10 to 20 miles wide and several miles long, runs up into Kansas. So it's got us to drill off structures. So we found out, not only were the Mississippian wells good on structure in this localized area, they were good off structure. So then we started to drill horizontal wells 1.5 years, 2 years ago and really started ramping up our acreage position. So when you look at it from a broad sense, our acreage is all along, and it's up on for the most part to Nemaha Ridge. So within that whole area -- and there's a cross section in our presentation that shows it that when you got off the ridge, you fall off on either side of it. But our acreage predominately is located all up on the ridge. So we're from a regional sense, high structurally with all of our acreage. Seismic really doesn't drive it. We shot seismic, that helped us get there. But at this point, we're all, we're in a great position structurally. We're high up in the play where you got oil and water, which is a good thing. And there's a lot more chat when you're up there on the structure. So sort of a long answer, but hopefully, that answered your question.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And then as it relates to the Upper Devonian and Utica Shale, you obviously talked more about Northwest Pennsylvania today than before. But when you look at the Upper Devonian, the Rhinestreet versus the Genessee versus the Tully, is there any one of those Upper Devonians that is a more prolific target in your opinion? It looks like the Rhinestreet's a lot thicker than say the Genessee's? Or do you think you're getting contributions from multiple, those Upper Devonian zones? Or how do you think about the development of that opportunity?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, let me lead off with the answer and then I'll turn it over to Ray for a little more color. To me, what's exciting is, in a broad sense, you have the equivalent amount of hydrocarbon in place in that Upper Devonian section that you do in the Marcellus. That's pretty exciting. And then when you look at it from a thermal maturity again, it's roughly equal. So you have just -- and we put the maps out on the website again so you can see dry, wet and super-rich in the Upper Devonian. And we've only really tried drilling and completed 2 wells so far. Again, what's exciting to me about those 2 wells and they both were in the wetter, on the dry side of the wet line or in the wet area, is you have a thick interval just like you described. And off of our first 2 tries again, we actually made pretty reasonable wells. And again, when you look at any of these shale plays, usually the first 2 tries are your strike outs or other science experiments, we actually made pretty decent wells the first 2 tries. To put it in context, just like you said on that slide and Rodney, are these the right numbers?","Rodney L. Waller","Yes.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","So it's on Slide 27, you can see that the Marcellus is much thinner than that total Upper Devonian section. So in the Marcellus, plus or minus, what we're drilling is 80 to 120 feet. So we've found that if you still early on, where you land the well in the Marcellus, just moving it up or down within that 100 or 120 feet, you can double or quadruple the rate. So where you land it and how you complete it is extremely important. So now we have a broader interval in the Upper Devonian. So if you ask me, I'm going to turn it over to Ray in a minute. Did we optimally land those first 2 wells. I sincerely doubt we did because it's just so early on. But even not optimally landing them, we made reasonable wells. And now we're going to go into the super-rich area, and we'll see what the hydrocarbon content is. And again, I think we're really going to go up the learning curve in terms of how do we optimally land them and complete them and what they'll cost. So Ray, do you want to try to put a little more color on there or...","Ray N. Walker","I don't know what else I could say.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","By the way, Ray, you put in -- most, some of you know this, probably not all of you, when Ray started with this, he actually was out on the wells completing them and frac-ing them. Then he also was the first guy to open our office and built the office. And now, he's our Chief Operating Officer. So when he speaks, he's speaking with great authority because he's been there and done that.","Ray N. Walker","The first 2 wells, we did primarily because we knew there was a lot of hydrocarbon in place. And in fact, like I finally used the term, it's almost like a lay down, double right on top of the Marcellus. And we knew it was there. The question is, can you complete it, can we make it economical, commercial, all those things? And so the first question was, was everything connected? Or when we completed the Marcellus well, were we in fact connecting to the Upper Devonian since it was so close. With those first 2 wells, we designed them in such a manner to try to answer that question. We did isentropic  analysis, which is simply fingerprinting the gas, to determine if it's 2 separate reservoirs. We did some downhole pressure work and different things. And so, we have proven that it's 2 separate reservoirs. And even where you're on the same pad completing in the Marcellus, you still have a unique isolated reservoir above it in the Upper Devonian. Now we've only done 2 wells. The industry has only done a handful of wells. And so I think we're far from knowing where the optimal place to land the lateral is. But I feel like, with the test that we have and with the information that other industry folks have shared with us, that there is a lot of potential there. And we'll probably be experimenting with 2 or 3 different places over the next year to try and to figure out what that optimum answer is. So that's about all I could add to it at this point. I think Jeff did a great job of describing where it started from. So...","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","But do you think you'll end up with potentially 4 different development zones? Or so in other words, is there an effective frac barrier between some of those Upper Devonians? Or you may end up getting contribution from multiple Upper Devonian zones in one frac?","Ray N. Walker","I think today, we'll get it all from one lateral. I mean, potentially down the road, might there be 2 laterals pretty close together. Like for instance, there is in the thicker parts of the Barnett. I mean you could see that way out in the future. But I think at this point, we believe it will all frac together. And we'd be able to complete it that way.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","You're saying -- and to clarify that, we're saying we think the Marcellus is one completion and then the double is the Upper Devonian. So one well can frac all those intervals, the Upper Devonian intervals together as a separate second unit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick questions here for you. Looking at your acreage in Pennsylvania, it looks like some numbers have kind of moved around a little bit this quarter. I'm seeing your acreage in Northeast Pennsylvania go from 240,000 net to 180,000 net. And your acreage in Southwest PA went from 550,000 to 570,000 net. Just curious is there kind of -- what's going on there maybe there is some acreage swaps? Or maybe you guys have let some acreage in Northeast expire? Any color you have around that would be helpful.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes. We can all chime in a little bit. I think what you're saying is exactly true. Our focus really is right now is the wet and super-rich of the Southwest. It's our big core position and given where oil prices are and gas prices are, clearly, our best economics. So the land dollars that we're spending are down in that area. So 100% of it is down in that area. Also when we're trading, we're trading to block up in that area. So we're trading stuff that's outside of the area to get stuff inside. And not all those trades, they aren't proportional because we really like the area and we think it has stacked pay and superior economics, we may trade 1.3, 1.4 acres for 1 acre to get it in the wet because we think the value is so much greater. So it's a variety of things like that.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess looking at your super liquids rich area of 125,000 acres, how much of that do you think is de-risked at this point, if you guys could talk a little bit about infrastructure in terms of gathering and processing on that acreage.","Ray N. Walker","Well, we feel like it's all de-risked. There's enough well data, penetrations all around it that we feel pretty confident it's there. Now there's different levels of de-risking. We still got to get in there and drill and determine what the exact composition of the liquids will be and all that sort of thing. We have contracted additional process capacity with MarkWest. There were some announcements that went out on that. Here a while back, a month or so ago. And we've got plans with MarkWest to lay infrastructure, put compressor stations in that area. So that was part of what I said in my notes that we've really been working on this for a couple of years, both doing acreage trades, consolidating, filling in the holes and putting plans together for infrastructure. These big pipelines and the transportation on some of the lines that go through there and the rail facilities and the de-ethanizers and all of the things that are coming together didn't happen overnight. So we've actually been working on that for quite a while. So...","John H. Pinkerton","And including the ethane agreements, the 2 got signed and the others that we're working on. It's all part of the master plan to optimize that because it obviously has the highest returns and the highest net present value.","Ray N. Walker","Right, and so to coin the phrase we've been using a lot, it's really an inflection point for that area because we've now got 8 wells that are online. We've got all these infrastructure plans in place and it's now time to start drilling. So like I said, we'll put approximately 55 wells online this year in that area. So I think you'll see us talk about that area a lot this year because that's really going to be a big focus for teams in Pennsylvania.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of your program for this year, you guys talked about outstanding cash flow. Any other plans for any other non-core asset sales this year that might prevent the debt from ramping up as much?","Ray N. Walker","We've got several small properties, cats and dogs and a couple of positions in some non-operated cases that we'd like to divest of at some point. But at this point, we're not going to give them away in this kind of environment. So I think that's going to always be part of our plans going forward is to continue to take the high cost, low return type properties off the bottom of the pile and monetize it and take that money and then reinvest in the higher return projects. We're just down to the smaller properties at this point.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I would just add. Like I mentioned, I think the bulk of the heavy lifting's done, and we sold $1.8 billion worth of those properties. There's small things here and there, if we can sell them, great. And if we can't, we're still in good shape.","John H. Pinkerton","Yes, and this is John, even taking it a step further, I think, we've now got the balance sheet that we could -- we've got several levers we can pull and we can pick and choose. Obviously, like we've always said, if somebody comes in and wants to make us an offer for something, and we think it's attractive, we'll take advantage of that and then recycle that money. But the good news is, given all the great work the team's done and under Roger's leadership, now we have the balance sheet and liquidity and availability to really pull either one of those levers and do the one that's most attractive for the shareholders. So I think that's, again that's an inflection point, too, that I think is really driven again by what I said was the bold move of the big Barnett last year. It really puts us in a position to be on the offensive versus being on the defense in the low gas price environment.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, and I would just add. Last year was critical but more like I'll go back, it's really the last 8 or 9 years of just having a consistent strategy of growth at low cost on a per share basis, building high-grade inventory. Because we've consistently done and executed on that for years, it's put us in a great position for 2012 and beyond.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay and I guess a question on your production guidance. You talked about 638 million a day in the first quarter. Because if I look at that number compared to the fourth quarter of '11, it's up about 13 million a day. In 4Q '11, you guys added about 90 million a day sequentially. Obviously, that's kind of lumpy growth. Could you guys maybe just talk a little bit more about how you expect it may play out into the next quarter, are there any significant sort of milestones in terms of infrastructure components that are looking to come on, where you might see production jump dramatically in the second quarter or maybe the third quarter? Any color you guys have around that will be helpful.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I'd give you a little color, but before you downgrade our growth a little bit. Let me say, it's still 17% production increase over the first quarter of last year. And then if you account for the Barnett sale, it's 40% -- 47% year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter growth, which to me is pretty impressive. Granted, when you look at the 30% to 35% for this year, it'll be back-end loaded sort of like what it was for 2011. I couldn't be more excited and not only are we getting the growth, but we're growing our liquids disproportionately relative to the gas like Ray pointed out earlier. But we're going to stick with quarter-by-quarter guidance like we have every other year.","Ray N. Walker","And I can add just a little color in that. It's pretty traditional especially in the Northeast for the first quarter of every year to not grow a whole lot over the fourth quarter. I mean, you've got wintertime, you got everybody's in a real crunch at year end and there's a lot of maintenance and things that happen in January, February, March timeframe. So that's pretty traditional and so that kind of helps explain it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Scialla of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You've given a lot of guidance on your plans for infrastructure and agreements that you've entered into for ethane. I'm just wondering given some recent weakness in propane prices, what are your thoughts on the other NGLs and maybe condensate as well in terms of where you see price going and would you be willing to hedge more here?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, I would and several of us will probably chime in on this one. I would say we have continued to hedge the condensate price that we received now is basically close to oil price for that area. So that's encouraging. We are hedging. We'll continue to look out to hedge to lock in the strong returns that we have. So again, you got to look at the whole program of, we have a very rich gas. And in order to build and grow volumes, you got to handle the ethane. But that's a good thing because the ethane is an enhancement to the economics and will add value over time, creates more space in the pipelines to move more gas and more liquids. So I think we're in a great position.","John H. Pinkerton","And just add on what Jeff said. I think the key here is you want to grow volumes and reserves, but you also really want to focus on growing your cash flow. And where going to get the biggest bang for your buck given where oil and gas prices are is obviously the condensate and NGLs. So we're aggressively hedging those out because there's such high prices. And we got great markets in the Northeast for those. And MarkWest is doing a good job in terms of storage and selling and all the contacts that they've got. So we are aggressively hedging our condensate and our NGLs up in the Northeast. And you'll see that on the hedging program slide and you'll also see it in the quarters -- the months and quarters to come. You'll see us continue to hedge that. And we talked about it a lot at the board, so we're going to take that price risk off the table. We like those prices a lot and we'll accept those because we make such great rates of return.","Ray N. Walker","On your condensate up in the Marcellus, it's about 84% of WTI posted prices. So that's selling at $84 to $85 a barrel up there, which typically has -- it's probably $5 or $10 more a barrel than what it traditionally has been. So you're C5s and your C4s and your C3s, which are your heaviers really have had a very stable and increasing price over the last 6 months. Where you've had a little weakness is propane. Propane is primarily a heating fuel. We didn't have much of winter. So therefore, you've got a weakness there. You've had a weakness in the ethanes, which basically is because you got 2 crackers down off the Gulf of Mexico. So it's going to have some seasonality and they always do a lot of maintenance at the first part of the year. But with our C5 proxy hedges that we're working off of, we're actually locking in on the heavy side of the barrel, the liquids and we think that will give us some uplift to the weaker side of the barrel until we know exactly what our ethane productions are, et cetera. And then in 2013 and '14, be able to move and be able to bifurcate that barrel to hedge both the heavies and the lights appropriately. So we're just working there, but that's something we look at every day. And we hedged some C5s yesterday, probably at $6 above our average of what we have got built into the system. So it's a thin market. You just do it when you can.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that. Looking at your presentation, you show well cost in Southwest Pennsylvania for your wet area of $4 million for your 5.9 Bcf type well. Is that a projected development mode kind of cost or representative of what you're seeing recently?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, when you look at those -- it's interesting when you look at the cost we have in the development mode and by area particularly, I'm glad you asked. When you look at the wet area, when you look at existing pad drilling down there, they're straight away wells or right at about $4.4 million, some of them as low as $3.8 million. The wider swing outs maybe $4.3 million, $4.4 million. So that number, we basically achieved the development mode cost for that particular area. I would also say for the horizontal Mississippian play, when we're seeing in a development mode, we're basically at those costs. And theoretically, in a development mode, if we've got 1,000 or 2,000 wells to drill which could be if it all drills out, I expect that team will do 1 of 2 things like they have in the Marcellus, either significantly drive down costs or we'll have longer laterals with higher rates of return or longer laterals with more stages and higher rates of return. Also when we say development mode cost, on the Cline Shale same thing, it's what we're drilling them for today. So hopefully that answers that question.","Ray N. Walker","Yes and I'll just add a little more color in that. We are really excited about this reduced cluster spacing in the longer laterals. So we will be drilling longer laterals. And we'll be putting more fracs per foot of lateral. And that's all going to increase cost. And so you may see cost on a well-by-well basis that are higher than some of the numbers in here, but that's because there's a lot more money spent on completion. And consequently, we'll get a better return with more reserves that, that well produces. So it's a little bit of apples and oranges, but that -- what we try to do is take the average of the last 188 wells that have been drilled in that area and that's the kind of numbers that we come up with.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, let me just pile on to Ray a little bit. What we've talked about is the wet area having very strong economics. But the super-rich area, because of the higher liquids component coupled with the longer laterals or more stages, are moderately longer laterals with more stages, it's even an enhancement of that.","Ray N. Walker","Right.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Ray also mentioned a couple of the wells in the wet area where we've tried longer laterals and more frac stages and reduced cluster spacing and those wells look really attractive. We didn't tell you the rates of return, but if we drill more of those types of wells in there, we believe we can really even potentially enhance the rates of return in the wet area beyond where we are now with that new technology. And throughout the year, towards the end of the year, that should be another significant improvement to what we're doing.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And this is probably a dumb question. But I'm just wondering, with gas prices as low as they are and really almost all the value in the wet gas, part of the Marcellus being driven by the liquids and you mentioned earlier that the very low recovery factor, have you looked at all at the feasibility of reinjecting the methane, could that help maintain reservoir pressure and maybe improve the liquids recovery?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Let me come back and clarify what you're saying. When I was talking about lower recovery factors of 4% to 9% of the hydrocarbon in place, I was referring to the horizontal Mississippian oil play. So one, I want to clarify that. The second one is when you look at a shale and reinvesting gas in, it's just too low permeability. Again, gas prices are where they are today, our economics are strong. Personally, I believe at some point in time, and I can't tell you whether it's -- or even if you look at the strip, when you go out a few years, I don't think gas is going to be $2.50. Gas maybe $4 to $6, or $4 to $5, or $4.50 to $5.50 but I expect that gas at some point in time will move up a little bit.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. I thought that was a dumb question. I'm glad you clarified that. Let me end with one last one. Looking up at Venango County in the Northwest part of the state, you mentioned you have drilled some wells up there. Any color around what you're seeing up there?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","We -- I want to clarify that. We're saying we will drill in the Utica up there in the summer and spud a well there. But given the well control that we have from looking at old wells and even current wells around us, we feel that our acreage is very prospective for wet Utica and for having the Point Pleasant.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan McSpirit of BMO Capital Markets.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You illustrate what percentage of your Marcellus shale acreage is held by production today. What are the same ratios look like say, over the next 1 to 2 years from the Southwest to the Northwest and I guess to the Northeast of Pennsylvania?","Ray N. Walker","Well, let me see if I can handle it, to start with the easy one. Northwest is 100% HBP today.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well the -- we have the -- let me clarify that.","Ray N. Walker","Almost. Yes.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","If you look at the traditional Cooper's timeframe of an area, which is where the bulk of our acreage is, it's all HBP. We've added a little acreage in and around the fringe so that number is 83% HBP today.","Ray N. Walker","Oh, okay, okay.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","So but I think right now it's showing 47% to 51% in the Southwest and Northeast. You're probably going to add roughly 10% per year to that. But let me talk about a really important point there, so if we look at the 3 areas, the Northwest is pretty easy. I mean, you can drill a hole that, we'll see what the Utica looks like. That isn't an issue. In the Northeast, this is really an important point. We talked about we have the ability, if we choose to do so, to take the roughly 4 rigs we're running in Alabama to -- a rig or 2 at the end of the year and a minimal program next year. The way we can do that is those leases up there tend to be bigger leases and there's continuous drilling clauses with them. And I always use the example of the best one. So I'm telling you, it's the best one. But we have one lease up there that's 25,000 acres. And literally, it just requires one well per year to hold the lease in perpetuity. And as long as you drill one well per year. So to HBP it would take a lot of drilling and take a long time. But we can hold the acreage for the next 50 years by just drilling one well per year. And a lot of those leases are 1,000, 2,000, 5000-acre blocks. That's what gives us the ability to cut back to 1 to 2 rigs next year in the dry area. If you look at where we really need to drill to HBP, it's primarily in the wet and super-rich area in the Southwest, which fortunately is where our highest rates of return are. That's where we have a lot smaller leases, and we really need to drill to hold more. So that's -- and then the other part of that is if you look at the Southwest and on the map, it shows super-rich dry or super-rich wet and dry, most of that dry acreage in the Southwest is HBP by old -- by shallow legacy production, just like most of the stuff in the Northwest is. So really, it's a little better than it sounds. That's why we have a lot of flexibility to ramp up or down in certain areas or direct our dollars to where we think we're going to get the highest rates of return.","Ray N. Walker","And just to pile on to that, if you look at our capital budget this year, the great preponderance of our leasehold dollars will go towards the Southwest Pennsylvania and locking up and continue to...","Jeffrey L. Ventura","In Southwest PA, wet and super-rich.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, and to build that position and continue to fill in and whatnot. The good news is we own, we're the 800-pound gorilla in that area. So we're in great shape there. But the bulk of those dollars just to give complete transparency is going to go there. And there'll be a little bit of money out on the Cline Shale and the horizontal Mississippian, but the bulk of the dollars are going to go into Southwest PA as Jeff mentioned.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, got it. And second question here. You continue to demonstrate higher yields on lower cost in the Marcellus. Can you speak to at least in general terms your -- where you go from here? That is, what could drive the next step change in targeted economics? Is it including the ethane stream?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Let me start and I mean, Ray and other people, we're going to give you joint team answers today to show the integration of our team or the excitement I have that I had to jump in, in front of Ray. I think that it's really interesting when you look at the rates of return in the wet area and the upgrade by going to the super-rich. We're taking a well that's rate of return at strip pricing in the 70s up to the mid to high 90s by moving into the wetter areas and into the super-rich, just the quality of the type of reservoir fluid coupled with moderate length laterals with more stages. I think the next big jump will be taking that same technology and just doing it in the wet area. And the evidence of that is we've tried it on 2 wells. What we didn't show you but we have are the rates of return of the wet area. So we want to get a bigger sample set and we want to make more history. But it could be we can then significantly improve what's in the wet by drilling and completing them differently than we have. I think that's the next big change and it may not be that far out there. And Ray, you can -- and the other thing with Ray, other than being a great guy and a good -- a great manager, he's really strong technically. I think one of the best completions guys out there. So now with that big build up, what's next?","Ray N. Walker","Wow, I'm excited to hear what I'm going to say. Well, I think what I envision as the next big steps is, one is this reduced cluster spacing. Because coupled with everything that Jeff was talking about in the liquids rich play and our better understanding of all of that. This reduced cluster spacing, which is not really that new. It's kind of a term that we use, but it's essentially putting more fractures along the wellbore in a better optimized position, let's call it, that's reflective of that particular situation. We're seeing some real step changes in performance. And that's pretty exciting. I've often been asked what's the most exciting thing or most surprising thing about the Marcellus today and it's been just simply the rock. It's mother nature who was really good and she put some really good rock. And for lots of different reasons that I won't go into, Range finds itself with I think some of the best rock that there is anywhere. And so past that, it's really going to be our technical team becoming better and better, able to understand what the rock's telling us. We're continually improving our reservoir description capabilities. In other words, to try to describe exactly what the porosity and the permeability means, exactly what the thermal maturity means, exactly what the Btus, exactly what kind of conductivity we need in the wellbore. And then past that, I think we're seeing a real step change in the quality of the service industry in Pennsylvania. I mean, we went from -- when I first went up there in 2006, being so bad that I'd really won't talk about it here, to a point today that all of the latest, greatest technologies and things that are happening are happening in Pennsylvania around the Marcellus. And so we are very much a company that likes to apply technology off the shelf. And it's really the, finding the people that understand the right way to apply that technology. And then trying to optimize performance not only on a well-by-well basis but on a project basis over several years. In other words, we could drill really long laterals and make great big reserves and IPs, but our project for the year might get less return than it would drilling moderately long laterals and getting wells online faster. So it's going to be a real evolution and I kind of handicap us as being in inning 3 or 4 of a 9-inning baseball game. We've made great deals. We're way out in front, but we got a long ways to go. So...","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And let me add a little bit. I talked about something that we literally could experience this year not that far out and that's just taking that technology and applying it in the wet area. Ray talked about some things that can go on beyond that. And then I'm going to paint the picture for 5 to 10 years down the road. I mean, they can even get more exotic, assuming the Upper Devonian really drills out, can you have stacked laterals off the same pads or all kinds of things like that. Beneath there, we don't talk about, but you actually have dry Utica. We're excited about the wet Utica in Northwest PA, but there's a bunch of dry Utica right underneath that same acreage. You'd literally have 3 stacked pays there. Might you have triple stacked laterals in year 10? Who knows. But I think -- but what I can say is historically for the whole history of the industry, technology has improved consistently with time. And I don't expect that it will stop.","Operator","We will go to Jon Wolff of ISI Group for the last question.","Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I'm just thinking about the commercial acreage. I think you said 315,000 in the wet gas area. There's a significant amount of acreage to the east of that, which you -- a couple in your southwest acreage out of Westmoreland and Fayette. I was curious if there are wells there and what your feeling was. And then when we think about the commercial acreage that's outside of the sort of 700,000 that you talked about, when we look at like Venango and some of the northern areas, wouldn't they pose perhaps lesser economic risk than some of the dry gas in the Southwest?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, let me say, and if you look at the dry gas in the Southwest, again, a lot of that acreage is HBP by legacy shallow wells that we control and operate. So I think that the potential of that acreage given drilling in and around there, there's no doubt it's prospective for the Marcellus and there's some good wells in Fayette County, in Westmoreland, Armstrong County, I think EQT has a 16 million a day well. And we've got wells on the edge of it that are that good or better. So I think that acreage in time will be very attractive. When you go up to Northwest PA, I think it's very prospective for Utica. We've got some control on the edge of our acreage on either side of it that shows -- we know where the oil, wet gas contact is. And I think we believe we have a pretty good feel for the wet gas dry contact. Our acreage is sort of right in the fairway. We believe we got Point Pleasant on it. So I think that acreage position is very prospective. It's at a reasonable depth, not unlike what we're drilling in the Marcellus. Long term, a lot of it, well, almost all that acreage is HBP, 83%. So it's a big chunk of it. It is held by old historic Medina wells at about 5,500 feet. Up-hole there, you have Marcellus potential and we actually tried one well in the Marcellus. We haven't reported it. But it was an interesting and I'd say somewhat encouraging first try. It will be something down the road or something we can look at how we take value out of it. But there is, I think there's no question there's value on that acreage. It's wet gas, so that's very interesting. And then I think when you go up to, our acreage position in the Northeast, again, it's new technology. We announced really we've got 4 wells. We talked about 2 of them in the release. But if you look on the website, it shows there's a couple of other wells on the big blocks we have up there that are encouraging. There's other horizons behind pipe. It's really lightly explored. So I think there's a lot of upside on all that acreage. But because a lot of it's either HBP or we have these really good favorable drilling clauses, we can direct and focus most of our near-term capital in the areas that have really high rates of return and we're retaining that upside for another point in time.","Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on the Utica plan, you'll drill a well soon, spud a well soon.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","That's probably around the middle of summer of this year.","Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So do we have any feeling of what point you'd say some of it's de-risked or not de-risked on the 330,000 acres up north?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, I mean the first well is good. I'll be very encouraged because we got pretty good control. So if the first well is good, I'd expect that future wells probably would be. But again to be conservative, we'll do what we've done in some of the other plays, we'll probably just scatter a handful of wells probably over the next 12-month period past that, across that acreage position to show what our acreage is. But we're also looking at, there's a lot of industry activity that either has or will be occurring in and around our acreage. So I think that's a very exciting upside.","Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I've never been a big fan of selling acreage in your core areas, but given the capital need as potential for super wet, a lot of super wet gas, is any of the dry gas acreage potentially JV-able or saleable perhaps in the Southwest dry?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I think we'll always look at optimum ways to run our company, optimum levels of growth and optimum ways. We look at NAV. Really, what we're looking about is how do we maximize the value our company. And a lot of that depends on the quality of the acreage. It depends on what you think future of oil and gas prices are going to be and what the market is for those pieces. So we'll continue to stay focused on maximizing the value our company. And we'll be open-minded about that. That being said, everybody around the table here, people on the call, it's a huge part of their net worth. So we're aligned with the shareholders and each -- every individual in our company is a shareholder. It's an important part of our culture. So we're aligned with you.","Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And I might have missed it, but was there any talk about a potential third NGL or ethane solution such as at Mariner East and how likely do you think that is?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","We're continuing to look, yes, we really think we have an opportunity to really drive up volumes in the wet and super-rich areas. So these first 2 ethane solutions are just that. The first 2, we're looking at other solutions. Mariner East is one of them. There's some real advantages to that in terms of where you can potentially bring the product. And we'll be looking at growth and expansion. And I think you'll hear more and more about that with time.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his closing comments.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I'd like to close with what I believe are the 4 main takeaways for Range. First, we have a very large acreage positions and some of the best plays in the country, led by the Marcellus. Given the acreage we have, we should be able to achieve double-digit growth in production and reserves on a per share basis for many years. Second, given the high quality of our acreage and the plays that we're in, we should continue to be one of the lowest cost producers in our peer group. Third, given the good financial position that we have, which Roger just described, we can clearly fund our 2012 program with cash flow and existing liquidity without levering up the company and keeping our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio at or below 2.7x.","For 2013, we believe we can grow 15% to 20% within cash flow, if we choose to do so. Finally, the 5 enhancements to our portfolio, the super-rich Marcellus, the super-rich Upper Devonian, the wet Utica, the horizontal Mississippian oil play and the Cline Shale oil play, all offer significant upside to the Range story. These 4 keys will drive shareholder value for years to come. Thank you for participating on the call.","Operator","Thank you for participation in today's conference.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Laith Sando, Vice President, Investor Relations at Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range's first quarter earnings call. Speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Degner, SVP of Operations; and Mark Scucchi, who will be named CFO at our Annual Meeting in three weeks.","Hopefully, you've had a chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we've posted on our website. We'll be referencing some of the slides this morning. We also filed our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.","Before we begin, let me also point out that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call.

Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks, Laith, and thanks everyone for joining us on this morning's call. Range is off to a good start in 2018, executing on the operational and financial objectives that support our five-year outlook. I'll provide a few comments on the progress we've made so far in 2018 and then turn it over to Dennis and Mark to elaborate on the details.","But before I do that, I'd like to say that I'm excited to have Dennis and Mark leading operations and finance here at Range. They bring new energy, ideas and skill sets to their positions, and the team we have in place is going to work tirelessly to translate our class-leading resource potential into shareholder value. I know I speak for Mark, Dennis and the entire Range team when I tell you that we believe we have an incredibly bright future ahead of us.","Before talking specifics on the quarter, I'd like to touch on the five-year outlook we introduced a couple of months ago. We have received a lot of positive feedback regarding our firm commitment to capital discipline and de-levering. However, I'd like to try and make it crystal clear what the five-year outlook represents.","It represents what our assets are capable of and are (03:07) what we believe are conservative estimates for efficiency gains and underlying assumptions based on year end 2017 strip pricing. And it's driven by high-quality de-risked Marcellus position. The outlook shows the resulting path towards lower leverage without the benefit of asset sales.","However, this is not our plan. Our plan is to continue the process of high-grading our portfolio and accelerate the de-leveraging process by targeting non-core assets sales and the thoughtful monetization of under-appreciated inventory in our portfolio. We currently have processes underway, pursuing various transactions that would support our near-term goal of getting leverage below 3 times, as we ultimately move towards an investment-grade leverage profile.","And our near-term goal of sub-3 times is reflected in the short-term management incentives laid out in the proxy we filed earlier this month. We see pretty clearly a significant dislocation between the current equity value and the underlying value of our business. Driven, we believe, in part by leverage exceeding investor thresholds and our own targets. For reference, Range's enterprise value is currently at a significant discount to the PV10 of just our proved reserves. Obviously, our proved reserves using the SEC definition, excludes several thousand top-tier Marcellus locations and significant upside in the Utica, Upper Devonian and Lower Cotton Valley. I believe this represents one of the largest disconnects in value in E&P today. And we believe that consistent execution of our plan and prudently addressing leverage should begin to square those valuations.","Reflecting on the quarter, we continued to see meaningful improvements in cash flow per share with production and cash margins both higher versus last year leading to record quarterly cash flow.","Helping to drive this cash flow was a natural gas price differential of $0.13 better than NYMEX, as Range was able to take advantage of additional pipeline capacity and strong basis pricing in the Midwest and Northeast.","The driver behind Range's improving differentials over the past three years and our strong first quarter price realization is our diversified portfolio of both natural gas and NGL transportation, combined with an active marketing team. Our thoughtful approach towards building out firm take-away capacity over the last many years has set Range up for future success.","Looking forward, Energy Transfer's Rover project is expected to be in service sometime in the second quarter. Rover represents the last firm transportation commitment that Range has made for natural gas. And we expect to fill this capacity by the fourth quarter of this year.","To frame that for you, Range is currently selling approximately 1.4 Bcf per day of natural gas in the southwest part of the Marcellus on a gross basis. This compares to our current firm capacity of just under 1.3 Bcf per day. So we're currently selling the difference of approximately $130 million per day in the local Appalachian markets.","When our Rover capacity starts, those local volumes will simply move from the Dominion M2 market (06:16) to the Gulf Coast in Midwest. And our plan is to fill the remainder of the Rover capacity, as we grow throughout 2018. This puts Range in great shape heading into 2019. And to what we expect will be much better differentials in Southwest, PA and provides Range a great deal of flexibility in where we set spending (06:34) as we'll have filled our firm natural gas commitments.","In addition to our natural gas production, in the first quarter we produced 103,000 barrels of NGLs per day and about 12,000 barrels per day of condensate and oil. So, in addition to being one of the top 10 natural gas producers in the country, we're one of the top three NGL producers amongst E&P companies which provide significant leverage to improving NGL in oil pricing fundamentals. Importantly, our basis for natural gas, NGL and condensate are all improving or stable.","Looking at operations for the quarter, I think there are several things worth noting, and Dennis can touch on them in more detail. First, as most of you know, the Mariner East 1 pipeline shut down created challenges for us operationally. But collaborative efforts between our marketing, planning and operation teams working together with our midstream and processing partners allowed us to maintain production from the field.","Second, the team continues to become more capital-efficient. Like we've been talking about for some time, the team is going to be drilling up to half of this year's activity on existing pads. This not only reduces well cost, but it also improves our go-forward cost on gathering, as we're using existing infrastructure to produce these wells. Improvements on our gathering, processing, and transportation cost in the second half of 2018 and going forward, should result in better margin in what you'd expect to see in this phase of the development in the Marcellus.","Another benefit to our more mature development is land position allows for longer laterals. We've recently drilled our two longest Marcellus laterals at around 18,000 feet each. We'll see what the results are from these wells later this year but if these wells produce EURs that are in line with our type curve, the extended laterals would improve our normalized well cost in returns by approximately 17%, so a meaningful potential. Pushing average lateral length beyond 10,000 feet is consistent with our plans and expectations. But it's worth noting, that this efficiency wasn't assumed in our five-year outlook.","Before turning the call over to Dennis and then Mark, I'd like to reiterate that we see great things happening as 2018 gets underway. And we begin a new chapter at Range. We have an energized team working hard every day to translate our high-quality inventory into shareholder value. I truly believe that we'll see Range valued as a top-tier E&P company again and we're all going to work diligently to make that reality, a reality for our shareholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Dennis to discuss our operations.","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. Before I begin first quarter highlights, I'd like to say this is a really exciting time to be leading operations here at Range. We've got a de-risked, world-class asset in the Marcellus. And we have a great team in Appalachia with a long track record of delivering results. We are focused every day on continuing to build upon that history as the Marcellus drives the company forward.","In North Louisiana, we also have high expectations that the new team will build on the improvement seen in late 2017 through enhanced completion design and a renewed technical approach. Looking at the quarter, production came in at 2.188 Bcf equivalent per day, exceeding our guidance of 2.18 Bcf equivalent per day. We turned to sales a total of 13 wells in Q1. And as we look ahead, the combined activity for both divisions in the second quarter will result in first sales on approximately 40 wells.","Operations are in full swing on these wells, with the majority of them scheduled to be turned in line during the last month of Q2. With this in mind, we are setting second quarter guidance at 2.19 Bcf equivalent per day, which is in full alignment with our 2018 production plans to deliver 11% year-over-year growth. Our capital budget for the year remains at $941 million, with 85% being directed towards the Marcellus, as discussed on the last call.","Looking at our operational highlights for the quarter, we'll start with the Appalachia division. As Jeff mentioned, our Southwest, PA drilling team continues to build upon their success by drilling the company's two longest Marcellus laterals in Q1, with the longest well at just over 18,100 feet. We expect these wells to turn to sales in the third quarter and look forward to sharing the results on our future call. Overall, the team has drilled 5% longer laterals at a pace 12% faster per day in Q1 versus the average in 2017.","With these efficiency gains, the team has been able to offset small service cost increases and ensure well costs remain in line with the guidance we provided from the last call in February. We couldn't be prouder of the team and the service partners that are producing our longest, quickest, and most efficient wells. While we head winter conditions to contend with this year, the completion team was still able to successfully complete 1,003 frac stages or 19% more than Q1 in 2017. This translates into an 11% increase in wells completed compared to the same time a year ago and sets us up really well for 2018.","During the first quarter, the division turned to sales nine wells, from three pad sites, covering our super-rich and wet Marcellus acreage. In the super-rich area, we initiated production on two wells, from a five-well pad, with an average IP of 33.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which was comprised of over 60% liquids. The average lateral length on these two wells is 13,600 feet and is a great example of the type of lateral links and well performance in our 2018 plan. The three remaining wells on this pad will be turned to sales during the second quarter.","The other two pads turned to sales in the quarter were in the wet area. These wells are cleaning up nicely and are producing in line with normalized type curve. Similar to prior results reported, all nine wells are flowing under facility constrained conditions.","Before we leave Appalachia operations, I wanted to look back on some of the continued performance of wells drilled in late 2017. As a reminder, we had five pads in 2017 that produced at or above 100 million cubic feet equivalent per day each. These wells continue to be strong performers with an average production in line with our type curves.","One of these pads in the dry area contains our first wells drilled to 15,000 feet. And today, they are producing 19% above the type curve further supporting long lateral development. Also, four of the five pads that produced over 100 million cubic feet equivalent a day were drilled from pads with existing production.","Going back to existing pads have become a normal course of business for our operations team. And in 2018, we plan to repeat this model where drilling from existing pads could represent as much as 50% of our program. Like Jeff mentioned, this not only saves upfront capital costs for roads, pads and facilities, it also saves on a go-forward gathering costs as we more efficiently use our existing systems.","Commissioning of the MarkWest Houston 1A (14:08) processing plant was completed in the first quarter and is in full operation today. This additional processing capacity, along with the Harmon Creek plant, which is scheduled to be in service later this year in Northern Washington County, will support our development plans for the years ahead.","Now to North Louisiana. Consistent with the plan discussed on our prior call, we started the year with four active rigs and are now running one rig. The plan will be to stay active with this rig for the remainder of the year with the frac crew active as needed. The division completed and turned in line four wells in the first quarter, with seven more wells scheduled to turn in line this year.","Our first quarter Terryville well results are early, but as we look at the normalized type curves, the new wells are producing at or above their forecast due to well placement and improved completion design. As we look at both historical and recent well results, fluid intensity is proving to be a key driver in our Lower Cotton Valley well performance. The technical work by our North Louisiana team is ongoing with the efforts translating into an improved completion design for the 2018 plan.","Last item on the operations front is around Range's company-wide tubular goods. Over the past several months, discussions have surfaced around increasing transportation cost and tariff change impacts to oilfield tubular goods. To get ahead of this impact, our supply chain and operations teams moved quickly in late 2017 to secure a large percentage of our 2018 tubular needs at a cost below current spot market.","Planning efforts such as this, coupled with the operational efficiencies mentioned earlier, are helping to ensure we continue to advance the ball as a low-cost operator.","In summary, we're off to a great start in 2018. Drilling record laterals in an attempt to improve returns and hitting production and cash flow targets despite temporary setbacks.","Mark, over to you.","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, Dennis. As we evaluate Range's first quarter performance. We're keenly focused on project level returns and translating those into tangible corporate level returns. Jeff and Dennis highlighted operational successes, which are underpinned by a rigorous capital allocation process, directing dollars to wells with highly competitive rates of return. Efficient operations and diligent efforts in marketing production resulted in cash flow of $323 million for the first quarter, an increase of 25% over first quarter 2017. The increase in absolute cash flow translated to an equivalent 25% increase in cash flow per fully diluted share.","EBITDAX was $374 million, an increase of approximately $70 million over first quarter 2017. Increased cash flow and profitability was driven in part by higher realized commodity prices, despite NYMEX natural gas prices having declined 9% from the first quarter compared to the same quarter prior year. Average realized price per mcfe, including the effects of hedges and transportation costs, increased 8% compared to the same quarter prior year.","Something that stands out to me in the first quarter is Range's brokered gas book, which saw the benefit of some winter volatility. By optimizing our sizable transportation portfolio and using brokered supply, we were able to take advantage of some temporary market opportunities. This is episodic and would be difficult to replicate, since winter volatility created the opportunity. But it was the driver behind our $4 million net gain in the brokered book for the first quarter of 2018 and shows the benefit of having an in-house team dedicated to marketing.","Looking at unit costs for the quarter. Total unit costs were up about 2% excluding the impact of changes in accounting treatment of certain processing contracts, which I'll touch on more in a moment. LOE increased by $0.03 due to water hauling, equipment leasing, and workover expenses, these are transitory and timing-related costs, largely a function of the significant number of wells completed and brought on-line during the fourth quarter of 2017. General and administrative expenses increased by $0.02 also due to non-recurring items.","The presentation of gathering, processing and transportation expense is changed beginning with the first quarter of 2018 due to the implementation of new accounting standards. In applying the new standards to certain of our existing processing agreements, the associated costs are now shown in gathering, processing, and transportation expense line item, whereas historically, these costs were reductions to revenue. The end result is an equal increase in revenue and expense with no impact on margins or cash flow. Comparison for financial results to prior periods will require adjustment for this change in accounting to ensure line items are compared on apples-to-apples basis, which we have done in our 10-Q and press release.","For the first quarter 2018, GP&T expense was in line with the guidance before the accounting change, please refer to the side 17 in our company presentation for a reconciliation of revenue and GP&T expense under prior and current accounting standards.","Looking ahead, I'll direct you to the guidance provided in our press release on expected trends and unit costs. We expect to continue driving better unit costs with transitory impacts behind us and changes in GP&T unit costs, influenced by the timing of our final contracted firm transportation capacity coming on-line.","Turning to the balance sheet. While we still have work to do, the first quarter was productive from a capital structure perspective. During the quarter, our scheduled borrowing base redetermination associated with our revolving credit agreement went well with our existing group of lenders. We also used this opportunity to renew the credit facility, and extend its maturity date to April of 2023.","Due to the quality and scale of Range's asset base, lenders extended the maturity of the credit facility on terms and with borrowing costs essentially equivalent to our previous agreement. As a result of this renewal, we have maintained and extended our ample liquidity and Range's debt maturity profile is well structured (20:26) with the first maturity not until 2021.","Leverage as measured by debt-to-EBITDAX was 3.5 times at the end of the quarter, a slight improvement from 3.7 times the year end. As I mentioned before, we still have some work to do and are actively pursuing multiple initiatives to monetize certain assets and use those proceeds to reduce debt. We're working diligently to negotiate these asset sales and we expect these efforts to yield meaningful progress toward achieving our leverage targets. Our near-term objective is to have leverage below 3 times. And our longer-term objective is to maintain leverage closer to 2 times.","In summary, our focus is on converting consistent drilling success into tangible shareholder returns. From a financial point of view, a cost-effective resilient capital structure is the foundation to those efforts. Drilling success achieved with Range's existing inventory when coupled with safe, efficient operations and rigorous capital management, we believe will yield predictable and growing cash flow. Range's deployment of future cash flow whether into drilling, debt repayment, or returning cash to shareholders will vary over time, but it will be underpinned by a disciplined thoughtful allocation process.","Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you Mr. Ventura. The question-and-answer session will now begin. We will take as many questions as permits (22:01) until the end of the call at 10 AM Eastern Standard Time. And the first question comes from Bob Morris with Citi.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. My first question is for Dennis. You mentioned that the higher unit operating cost is partly timing related on the water hauling side, but where are you seeing some cost pressures? Since you mentioned equipment leasing also being higher in the quarter, so what is \u2013 for Range, where are you're seeing some cost pressures or tightness in the system?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. Great question, Bob. What we're really seeing in some regards is really working off some of the water hauling from really the fourth quarter wells that we turned in line that really were part of our success story toward the end of the year. Net production is now carried into the first quarter. And we really haven't seen a lot of cost pressures. It's really more just service-related versus unit cost.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, thank you. And then, my second question is for Jeff. And Jeff, I know this year you're going to be focused on filling your firm transportation capacity, you'll have your final pipeline project on-line. You talked before about the five-year plan, at the end, if you wanted to \u2013 being able to hold production flat then, 3.5 Bcf per day. But beyond this year, after filling your capacity, as you look in where oil prices are in the ramp and associated production in places like the Permian Basin, what would it take or what point might you consider holding production flat sooner, or if you were to choose to do so beyond this year? And given your valuation just looked into (23:50) somehow returning capital to shareholders rather than continuing to grow, and does that ever come into the thought process or something you would contemplate?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Well, yeah. I think we we'll constantly look at what's the optimum way for Range to operate and do the best job we can for our shareholders over that five-year period. And we'll look at all the different sensitivities and things that are out there, what happens to gas prices, oil prices and NGL prices. And go back to some of our commitments are to spend within cash flow, we'll have a lot more flexibility post-2019, we know when we've fulfill those commitments. So we'll look at all those things. The good news is that we have the high-quality assets. And we have the ability and flexibility to do multiple things so we'll be looking at all those different sensitivities.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Can you give a bit more color on the asset sale process? And how you weigh the need to de-lever versus the free cash flow given up from assets being sold or are \u2013 is there a middle ground of de-levering the assets that don't actually generate much free cash flow?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, Brian, this is Mark. I'll start off and then Jeff and others will chime in. So to your point, the sale price is, of course, a consideration as we look at monetizing assets and what the resulting impact on leverage would be. The good news is that Range has a deep inventory of projects and we have multiple asset sales initiatives underway. Some have significant future potential, some are farther out the drilling schedules, so there is no current impact on cash flow. Some have modest impacts to cash flow because, looking backwards, they might have had wider basis differentials and not \u2013 and have contributed significantly or in any material respect to our corporate cash flows.","So, that is kind of a valuation question specific to each asset. But the punch line, I think, that we're trying to convey is we have multiple asset sales underway, interested parties, and dialogues going on, on multiple fronts and monetizing those assets. In some respects, you're pulling inventory that may be much further out our drilling schedule, may not be currently reflected in our stock price, in our opinion. And on an NPV basis, it may be so far out the drilling schedule that we have the opportunity potentially pull that forward by monetizing it today to reduce debt and still maintain many, many years of the high-quality inventory and all without harming or altering the trajectory of the company laid out in the five-year outlook.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And then, my follow-up is with regards to the NGLs and the marketing arrangements and agreements that you have. Obviously, there was a very slight impact from the Mariner 1 delays. Beyond that, do you still see upside relative to others from the NGL and marketing agreements and the exports, both ethane and propane? Is there further relative upside that we should expect or through \u2013 have most of that \u2013 has most of that already been achieved?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","I think there's further upside to that. I think we're \u2013 if you go back on how we're set up, we have a different outlets, Mariner West, Mariner East and good exposure to the international markets with our ability to export on \u2013 from that. Internationally, we see \u2013 we believe, will be robust demand for propane, ethane and some of the NGLs driven a lot by China, some by \u2013 in Europe. And then, even in here in the U.S., we had good weather this winter, which helped \u2013 we have new demand from all the ethane crackers that are coming on. And, of course, I think exports are a big part of it and we're able to benefit.","If you look at propane prices, even though as a percent of WTI, they're down some. On an absolute basis on a \u2013 propane currently is about $0.80 a gallon. This time last year, it was $0.73 a gallon. So, kind of think it's important when you look at Range on the NGLs side, we're expecting on our NGLs and WTI and even if we have (28:23) natural gas, our net back pricing to improve or be stable from where we look today, which I think puts us in a good position relative to other companies and perhaps even relative to other basins.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. I was wondering, if you could maybe elaborate a little bit more of what you're seeing in the A&D market. Jeff, you guys have talked about having your Northeast Appalachia assets on the block, so obviously some assets in the Mid-Continent. And today, you guys articulated maybe perhaps some opportunities to even look at selling some of your core inventory that perhaps is not looked to be developed over the next 15 years or so. But I was wondering, if you could just comment on the A&D market for natural gas-focused assets?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. I think \u2013 well, I think the good news, as you just pointed out, we have multiple levers we can pull. And of course, we'll consider all of our assets and what ever makes the most sense. We'll pursue all of those. So I think the good news is we have a huge inventory, we have high-quality assets. Like Mark said, some of those are because of the size and scale and quality. Maybe out there in the future to the extent we can pull them forward. So, I think it's \u2013 you have to have high-quality assets that will interest people. And I think you have to be somewhat disciplined in order to find the right buyer. That being said, we're really focused on \u2013 and we believe we can accomplish a significant asset sale by the end of this year. And we, like Mark said earlier, we have multiple processes underway.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fair enough. Dennis, as you take over and are now leading the operation group as a whole, I was wondering if you can comment on your leadership style and any new ideas that you think that you could bring to the table? Excuse me.","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, I'm happy to answer that. Over the past, now almost eight years with Range, one of the things with my time in Appalachia and now moving to this new role is I'm kind of an incrementer (30:42) at heart. And I really enjoyed the ability for us to take what we have is repeatable and successful and continue to build upon that year-after-year and month-after-month and when (30:52) watching the teams be successful. I think that's coming out in notes like today, when we talked about our long lateral links or efficiencies that we capture on a completion side or LOE levels that we've been able to achieve over the last few years. As we look at the five-year outlook, I think the next chapter is, now how do we look at what are our next phase of efficiencies and really being capital-efficient looks like in line with that five-year outlook. So from a leadership perspective, I'm really looking forward to working with the team to try and capitalize on that.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc Capital Market (sic) [KeyBanc Capital Markets] (31:34).","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I know there's a lot of interest in some of the M&A opportunities you guys have discussed. And I wanted to ask like two questions basically around that. One, what's in the five-year plan now, Jeff, in your prepared comments you talked about Range having the largest valuation disconnect in the market right now. One, I guess how do you see \u2013 what do you think is the most pertinent thing for Range to take care of in order to bridge that gap? Or is that \u2013 do you have an intention of pursuing things like share buyback plans before potentially de-leveraging to kind of address some of that near term? Or is it squarely focused on using potential proceeds to de-lever? And then, I just had a quick follow-up.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Okay. Let me start with the answer and then I'm going to flip it back to Mark our new CFO \u2013 and you heard a little bit about Dennis and some of his thoughts. We're going to hear a little bit more from Mark and what he's thinking in that regard. But yeah, I think when we look you at the disconnect, I think when you look at Range versus our peers, I think we have excellent quality assets up in the Marcellus, long lead time that's driven it. I think when you looked at EURs per thousand \u2013 cost per thousand, they're at the head of the class recycle ratio. What's different, and I think what helps or what's driven some of the disconnect, is our leverage relative to peers is high. It's come down a little bit but at 3.5 times, it's still high. So in the short run and in the short run being our goals and you can see it even in our management short-term compensation, that we have a leverage target in there to hit where we needed to be for this year. And we need to get it below 3 times. So we're intently focused on that, we have different processes underway. Once we get below 3 times, then I think it opens up different options and flexibility. Let me turn the call over to Mark for that.","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Sure. So, Jeff kind of touched on the gating item which, at present, is leverage. We think that can have a material impact in valuation as we look forward into really integrating our operating strategy and financial strategy and directing the company in this kind of next phase of development. Mean, we're a decade into developing the Marcellus at this point. So the \u2013 in effect, commissioning phase is done and we're at the point where we're optimizing infrastructure, optimizing sales and customer relationships. We continue to optimize operations and drilling new wells more efficiently. So as we bring together a financial strategy and an operating strategy, and think about these targets that we've laid out as immediately as quickly, prudently as possible getting leverage below 3 times, what are some of the options of the table?","As you pointed out, maybe returning cash to shareholders in some form or fashion becomes a much more active dialogue. Meaning as we (34:35) get below 3 times, those are the discussions that we, management, and the board have to have and decide what a prudent time is, once you have a durable, sustainable leverage in your target range. Does that mean a change in the dividend? Does that mean share buybacks? The five-year outlook laid out the possibilities of what the assets can generate, in terms of de-leveraging in the profile and timing of that. But, as we said numerous times so far, the asset sales are intended to accelerate that. So in other words, as we accelerate that de-leveraging effort that should also accelerate our ability to give serious consideration on how and when and in what format to return capital to shareholders. So all of those things are the new (35:17) under consideration. It's a function of timing, durability, sustainability and making prudent decisions around those things.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","All right. I guess following-up on that. The conversation on potentially monetizing some underappreciated inventory that could potentially be within the core. I know that you guys have talked about other zones outside of the Marcellus before. One, I guess, are you considering any areas where you would actually enter agreements for Marcellus development with somebody else's capital? Or \u2013 and two, should I presume that the deals that you would be considering would have large cash components or cash components upfront and not necessarily just be some sort of accelerated JV program?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Well, the most effective form of de-leveraging and the intention there would be, obviously, to bring in some proceeds upfront and reduce debt in the absolute as well leveraged, measured debt-to-EBITDAX in this case.","To your point, though, Southwest, PA is what you're touching on, the core of our acreage position. It's stacked-pay opportunity with 0.5 million acres. So it's a tremendous opportunity set with a very long-dated drilling inventory. So there's the ability to bring forward some of that and there's any number of ways of monetizing that, either through outright acreage sales, to your point, joint ventures, using somebody else's capital. So what I would say, in general terms, is that we are open to considering a number of different structures. The key principle is to not do anything that complicates our core asset and on what is the heart of the company (36:55).","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Appreciate the comments, guys. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for all those comments on the assets sales. But shifting to Dennis for a minute. You talked about some of the improvements of \u2013 in productivity of some of the longer laterals. I see your overall lateral length this year is plus or minus 10,000 feet. What are some of the gating items moving to potentially longer development? Is it more production history? Is it area dependent? I'm asking because your contiguous positioning you have sets up well for as long the laterals as you want to drill?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ron. I think at this point, we fairly confident that we continue to advance the ball with longer lateral development and continue to see those numbers increase over the course of time. What we also know is that one of the fundamental principles for us to be successful is to be repeatable. So having a good methodical approach to advancing those lateral links year-over-year will be key versus trying to leap to the record numbers.","From a production standpoint, we see our performance at this point has been really close and in line with our type curves and projections. So we continue to have confidence that as we drill longer our well performance is going to align with what our projections are. From a competition standpoint, same thing, we haven't seen any challenges from an execution standpoint, and when you look at, as you pointed out, the contiguous acreage position that we have, it really sets us up well, as we drill both in the heart of the field and also move to the outer areas and continue to advance our development. We see the lateral links really not being impeded.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And in terms of productivity, are you talking about productivity on per 1,000 lateral feet. And is there any at least goalpost you can provide in terms of what that's doing on a cost per lateral foot as you have presented in the past?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","So, I'll start with the first part. Yes, we do see that the well productivity on a normalized basis is in line with shorter links and also our projections and forecasts. So, we've got a high degree of confidence there. What was the other question? I apologize.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","The other question was just, as you drill the longer laterals with the same productivity per lateral foot, I would assume one of the bigger efficiencies is on the well cost side. What's the \u2013 what kind of efficiencies or improvements are you seeing on a well cost per 1,000 foot of lateral?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Well, we see significant improvement. And \u2013 but what we also are seeing is that once you're starting to get beyond somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 feet, in reference to our 18,000 foot lateral, you're seeing that rate of change slow down. It makes a whole lot of sense. But we're continuing to see it improve as we drill longer and longer.","What's the upper limit going to look like? I don't think anyone knows at this point, because ultimately here's what's driving some of this. A, we're drilling some of, as I mentioned earlier, our fastest wells. And we're also seeing the team repeat now 4,000 and 5,000 foot days on a regular basis, not just to get on a record basis. So, as we look at how fast we're drilling the wells, that all plays into it also from a total cost standpoint. So I don't think we've seen the lower end yet. And we're close on where we think the dollars per foot can look like.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","And \u2013 but Ron I'd go back to my introductory comments. We talked about we got a couple of wells now. We've drilled 18,000 feet, one of them was a little more than that. We haven't completed them yet. But if they produce EURs that are in line with the type curve, the extended laterals, both long laterals, would improve our normalized well costs and returns by about 17%. So it's meaningful.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for the repeat there. And then, my follow-up is just in terms of completions. Dennis, you mentioned 40-plus completions in the second quarter, up from I guess 13 including Louisiana in the first quarter, most of which come on in June. Are those fairly evenly spread across your three windows in the Appalachian Basin? And then, as we look to the second half of the year, do the \u2013 does the completion pace in terms of wells being turned in line become, I guess, more linear?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, as we look over the balance of the year \u2013 I'll start there. We have about 43% \u2013 40% to 43% of our activity will basically be focused on the dry area. So you can almost say it's a 60\/40 split, when you look at Appalachia. Over the balance of the second quarter, we're going to see a very similar well mix, but some of the stronger wells that we'll be bringing on toward the end of the quarter will be focused in the dry area for this particular next reporting segment.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Paul Grigel with Macquarie.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, good morning. Could you guys provide some more color on the STIP proxy (42:15), focusing on leverage? And then as a follow-up to that one, the fact that the top threshold is focused at 2.9 times, should we be viewing that as really the goal is 3 times, and you're comfortable below that, or should there be further debt reduction beyond that?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","So to your point, the leverage levels have been set in new incentive \u2013 management incentive measures, that's all been disclosed in the proxy along with a number of other changes that have been made to try to enhance linkage between the company's goals, objectives, incentives for management team as well as shareholder interest.","To your point, the one-year target at the excellent level is 2.9 times. Those are measures set with a desired level of hitting over the coming year, but I think I'd go back to our high-level comments of a near-term objective of being below 3 times, and a longer-term objective of being at 2 times. So those are our fundamental objectives and targets in order to achieve in the near-term as well as hit and sustain over the longer haul.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And just on the color on that. Is that \u2013 was that push from shareholders, was it from the Board? Obviously, a pretty sizable change, just trying to understand where that manifested from.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","All of the above. (43:40)","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","I'd say \u2013 I'll start and then...","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, yeah.","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","...take it back to Jeff. It comes from all of the above.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Right.","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","It is looking at the company and what a sustainable leverage level is that preserves a strong balance sheet to support the operating profile and the ability to harvest the value that's in our inventory. It is, what leverage levels appear to impact your trading multiples on the equity side. We hear that loud and clear from shareholders and what their views are. We internally have our views, as does the board. So, it's a dialogue amongst all of those topics.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. I'd just add in, I agree 100% with what Mark said. But we made a big effort this year with shareholder outreach. So clearly, there was a big effort to really communicate with as many shareholders as possible. And we talked to a number of them.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, changing tones just a little bit. You guys talked about getting the decline rate down to below 20% in 2019. Could you indicate where is that now? And then could you also walk us through kind of where the trajectory goes throughout the five-year plan? But also, what the main driver is of the reduction between 2018 and 2019 in the corporate decline rate?","Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. This is Alan Farquharson. Let me kind of address the issue. I think we mentioned on the year end call, that our corporate decline rate for 2018 was approximately 23% and then moved to 18% thereafter. I think it's really just the impact. And then, what we had said previously in the previous years is that within five years or so, you're going to get down to low-double digits. So, I think that kind of plays in well to what the overall production forecast is and that's what's going to drive the overall low maintenance CapEx. What's driving that is probably a combination of things.","Number one, obviously the Marcellus, has \u2013 our decline rate in Marcellus has historically been lower than probably most of the other peers. I think it's really a function of quality of reservoir. Our well performs \u2013 so obviously (45:38) with over 10 years of production history, we would kind of understand what the declines of those wells are going to look like over to look like. Then of course, as you get longer and longer laterals added into the mix, it's going to flat and decline as well. Obviously, it's going to continue to feed in. So decline rate of the Marcellus is what's going to drive the overall decline rate and we would expect to see it continue to decline from, I believe, 23% to 18% next year. And then continue to decline out, that's corporate. So, Marcellus is obviously less than what that is at this point in time.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you for the time.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly with Seaport Global.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, guys, good morning.","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Sorry to give you a kind of boring modeling question here but I'd love a little bit more color on your go-forward gathering and transportation unit cost. I think on slide 25, you give $1.35 to $1.40 per mcf, kind of peak rate. Then it's supposed to come down from there. I mean, can you just talk about that trajectory, and maybe what it should look like as we move maybe through 2019? Thanks.","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Sure. So the guidance we've provided there, first of all, incorporates the impact of new accounting guidance. So, you see the increase of our prior numbers. Remember, that's just a gross of increase in revenue and an increase in the expense. But we've also talked about for the last of our contracted firm transportation capacity is expected to come on-line in the form of Rover in Q2. So, we talked about our gathering transport expense peaking in the early period if that comes on-line. And then, over time as we are able to continue filling all of our gathering and long-haul transport, you're able to optimize their expense. So by the end of the year we expect to have long-haul transport filled with our production, that's a benefit.","And then, going forward, we see the benefit of ourselves as well as other producers shifting their current in-basin sales into this new capacity coming out of Southwest Pennsylvania. What that does is it frees up sales capacity, your demand in-basin. So we're not obligated to take on any further long-haul transport. We have the option of sitting back and looking at what the best net backs are, whether improvement in local basis differential, benefit us locally or do we use some of the expected unused capacity to move gas to out of basin. So what that does is it allows us to continue fully utilizing the existing gathering, transportation inventory and portfolio we've put together, continue growing our production, and what that's expected to do over the five-year outlook, we laid out a $0.25 improvement per mcfe. And that's the trajectory.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Yeah. Appreciate that. That's it from me. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. I'm intrigued by the 18,000 foot laterals. Can you talk about what the constraints are as you go beyond that in terms of completion technology? Or even sort of productions physics?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. I think at this point, what I would focus on is really, it's going to be the gathering and processing side of the equation. I think we're still looking for what the technical limits are going to be from the drilling and completion side, and again we're walking our way down the pathway of longer laterals and really haven't seen where that limit is just as yet. And clearly, there are other examples and other basins where folks have drilled 20,000 foot laterals.","So feel confident that they're still running room for us to continue to push lateral links longer. But the other piece of this is how do you optimize facility design and your ability to compress, gather, and process what comes off of a given well side, vapors (49:45) management, all the other facilities, components that have to be considered. So with all that in mind, I mean, we can certainly upsize facilities and have done in a lot of cases. But we're really not seeing, at this point, where the end of the runway is for the end of this lateral links development.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So you were able to complete as many stages as you want out to that length and you like the spacing in the stage and you don't worry about staying in zone and you don't worry toe up, toe down? All that stuff's handleable?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","We have a very dedicated and talented team that monitors our geosteering efforts 24\/7. So our \u2013 if anything, I would tell you we're drilling our fastest wells, but we're also drilling it within our tightest targets that we've had in the history of the program in Appalachia. So we feel really good about our ability to land these wells, keep them within the desired target and drill them in excess of 3 miles long.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Dennis, I might \u2013 (50:37) Bob that's a great question. I've challenged our team and asked Dennis that question. So at the end of that 18,000 foot lateral that target line is plus or minus 10 feet and they're able to do that.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. That's amazing. Thank you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","And we are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Marshall Carver with Heikkinen Energy Advisors for our final question.","Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yes. Thank you. I know your five-year plan cooks in 10,000 foot laterals. And you do have a very blocky acreage position. Have you been able to figure out what \u2013 if the longer is better and you wanted to go a lot longer than 10,000 feet, which you theoretically could do over the next few years \u2013 I mean, is it 15,000 feet? Is it 13,000 feet? Is it 18,000 feet? Based on what's already been drilled and these (51:42) configurations and things like that.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, Marshall, it's Jeff. I think, that's one of the things we tried to do when we laid out our five-year outlook, was to lay out something very reasonable. Even though you've seen us each year continuing to expand lateral length and we totally have the expectations and we'll do that with time. We wanted to put something reasonable to conservative. So even though we totally believe we'll do that, we didn't bake that into our plan, so that's an upside to our plan.","Same with some other efficiencies, we didn't put a lot of efficiencies in there, we only put things that are kind of in hand. And so, there's good upside to our plan, as Dennis mentioned and I mentioned, with this year, we're drilling some wells that are as long as 18,000-foot. Dennis talked about, earlier, some wells that were 15,000-foot and performing above type curve from some of the wells we talked about last year. So, that's a good upside to our plan.","Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Laith Sando, Vice President, Investor Relations, of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range's second quarter earnings call. The speakers on today's call are: Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Chief Financial Officer.","Hopefully you've had a chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we've posted on our website. We also filed our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.","Before we begin, let me also point out that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. In addition, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of these non-GAAP measures. The supplemental tables also provide calculated natural gas differentials for the upcoming quarter and detailed hedging information for all products.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, Laith, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. The second quarter of 2017 was another quarter where Range successfully continued to execute on its long-term development plan across our deep inventory of high-quality assets. As you know, Range has built a concentrated 500,000-plus net acre position in Southwest Pennsylvania and now has a 200,000-plus net acre position in North Louisiana, both of which we believe are best-in-class assets for creating shareholder value. I want to begin by reviewing a few significant events from the quarter and then discuss that we expect to see for the remainder of 2017.","During the quarter, we drilled on the east and west boundaries of our Southwest Marcellus position, with great success. Both of these pads, that I like to think of as bookends, were significant. And at the dry gas pad on the eastern edge is now our highest rate dry gas pad on record, and our super-rich pad on the western edge is our highest-rate condensate pad on record. If you look back at our first quarter release from April, we also highlighted a pad drilled on the north side of our Washington County acreage position. Production from that pad has been stellar and, after 100 days, has significantly outperformed our wet type curve. Ray will discuss these results in more detail in a few minutes.","The bottom line is that these recent results highlight the quality of our Marcellus position and further confirm that we have consistent results across our Southwest Marcellus acreage. Every company says that they have core acreage. However, we encourage people to pay close attention EURs per 1,000 foot and cost per 1,000 foot when comparing quality.","To me, it's interesting and noteworthy that Range's Marcellus discovery well was completed in 2004 and, even after more than a decade of drilling, we're still improving and setting new records in different portions of the field.","We continue to drill longer laterals in an effort to optimize our development in Southwest Pennsylvania. Importantly, our blocked-up acreage position allows us to drill some of the longest laterals in the area. Our average lateral in Southwest Pennsylvania for the first half of 2017 was approximately 7,500 feet. We're projecting to increase that to over 9,500 feet for the second half of 2017 and should average even longer laterals as we get into 2018.","It's worth noting that there will be an optimal lateral length when normalized EUR begins to crest and returns are maximized, but we have not found it yet. In fact, 2017 results to-date suggest that some of our longest laterals are performing extremely well on an EUR per 1,000-foot basis, which Ray will discuss in more detail.","On the marketing side, our team has a first-mover advantage to plan and acquire a right-sized capacity with one of the lowest-cost firm transport portfolios in the Basin. Importantly, this portfolio takes our gas to good markets and we have incremental demand expected in the coming years. By year end, we should have access to additional natural gas transportation projects to take our production out of the local Appalachia markets and direct it to the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions. Rayne\/Leach Xpress, Adair Southwest and Rover Phase 2 are all currently being constructed and have scheduled in-service dates before 2018. The combination of these projects and strengthening local pricing will be drivers of our expected improvement in natural gas differential for 2018.","We've also made progress in North Louisiana, as we continue to change development activity towards a steadier cadence. Right off the bat, the team has done a tremendous job driving down the cost of drilling complete well, which has opened new economic locations. As discussed last quarter, we got off to a slow start in 2017 with our North Louisiana production. The results we've seen from the group of wells brought to sales in the first quarter were not up to par with our expectations, but we are looking forward to seeing the results in the third quarter and fourth quarters from redesigned wells in Terryville.","We also expect to have new test results from the North Louisiana extension area, two additional horizontal wells offsetting Vernon Field to the east and west. In addition, we'll drill two vertical well science tests of the stacked pay potential of the eastern offset of the Vernon Field. Well logs indicate resources of 400 Bcf per section and stacked pays with multiple targets. These vertical wells will help us build our future development plans.","In addition to extensive log and well test results, Range is acquiring considerable 3D seismic across some promising acreage that will help delineate and potentially expand the position. Included in the 2017 budget is approximately $16 million for 3D seismic, covering the Western portion of our position. As Range learned in the early stages of what has clearly been an extremely successful Marcellus development, which required several years, shortcutting the timeline in science in not an option. Unlocking the resource potential across 220,000 net acres of stacked pay requires a certain amount of time and well repetitions in order to establish the most predictable economic development program.","Moving back to the corporate level. A key question for Range is how to develop our huge inventory, given the ongoing commodity price uncertainty. For 2018, we'll be responsive to prices and set our spending at or near cash flow, including any asset sales. This should lead to annual year-over-year production growth of 10% to 20% over the next couple of years, depending on commodity prices.","Given our peer-leading well costs and EURs per 1,000 foot of lateral basis, on a relative basis, Range's growth per-dollar spent should remain amongst the best in the industry. Longer term, our sizable inventory of high-quality locations provides Range the ability to grow at a significant rate for a long time, if economically warranted. Also important, thinking long term is the benefit that Range has in having stacked horizons in both Appalachian and North Louisiana with the added optionality of drilling dry, wet or super-rich wells.","And looking at where we'll set the growth throttle over time, we'll continually seed to balance operational efficiencies, balance sheet strength, acceleration of NAV in return of capital to shareholders. Over the long term, we expect to generate significant free cash flow for Range.","In closing, Range's long-term planning has taken the company from its discovery of the Marcellus 13 years ago through years of significant growth while leasing and holding over a half million acres in Appalachia with stacked pay potential. And not to be overlooked is the innovative nature of our marketing and midstream arrangements that this long-term outlook has generated. This is reflected in the improvements we are seeing in year-over-year differentials and our corporate recycle ratio, both enhanced by our North Louisiana assets.","I believe the Range has the size, the scale and the quality of inventory that is extremely difficult to match. We will continue to shape our long-term planning around both strategic assets, seeking to create long-term shareholder value.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. Production for the second quarter came in at 1.945 Bcf equivalent per day, exceeding our guidance of 1.93 Bcf equivalent per day. Guidance for the third quarter is 1.97 Bcf equivalent per day and for the fourth quarter is expected to be 2.17 Bcf equivalent per day, resulting in annual growth of 30%. This is below our previous guidance of 33% to 35%. And there are two main drivers behind this change.","First, as mentioned on the last earnings call, the performance of the North Louisiana wells in the first quarter was below our expectations. Using round numbers, the underperformance of these wells and the corresponding frac hits to offset production accounts for the loss of approximately $75 million a day for the year. By itself, this would explain a 5% difference in growth for 2017. Despite the early North Louisiana setback, we were still expecting to hit our full-year guidance of 33% to 35% growth, as our Marcellus wells have continued to perform well, in many cases, significantly above our average type curves.","However, we've been hampered by delays in obtaining the necessary permits. Again, using round numbers, six pads representing 32 wells were delayed an average of 25 days per well. This represents 800 combined sales days and approximately $75 million a day of production for the year, coincidentally very similar to the underperformance from North Louisiana. So, we could have withstood some underperformance in the early North Louisiana production or we could have withstood some delays in Pennsylvania permitting, but the cumulative effect of both results in a reduction to our annual guidance. Importantly, the Pennsylvania permitting issues have been resolved and we do not expect any delays going forward and we anticipate significantly better well results in North Louisiana for the second half of the year.","I want to emphasize that we still expect to exit the year above 2.2 Bcf equivalent per day, which is in line with our plans when we started the year. This $200 million a day ramp of new production coming online during the fourth quarter, both in North Louisiana and in Appalachia, fits well with our anticipated incremental pipeline capacity, expected improving pricing differentials and sets us up really well for 2018.","Looking at some of the operational highlights for the quarter, let me start with Appalachia. We had two exceptional multi-well pads brought online in June. These pads happen to be on the eastern and western edges of our acreage position. These pads, in conjunction with two other pads that were announced over the last couple of quarters on the northerly and southerly portions of our development, have essentially book-ended our entire position. This highlights the high degree of confidence we have across our acreage.","In the super-rich portion of the field on the Western edge, we recently completed a seven-well pad with an average lateral length of 10,685 feet, with the longest lateral being 14,444 feet. The wells averaged 54 stages on a per-well basis, with 2,000 to 2,500 pounds per foot of proppant placed with optimized completion designs that I'll discuss in just a few minutes.","We're currently flowing five of the seven wells under constrained conditions, with two wells to be opened up later. The average IP per well is 29.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day, or 4,843 barrels of oil equivalent per day being 73% liquids. We've achieved and maintained rates of over 5,000 barrels a day of condensate off the pad for 24 days, setting a pad and per-well record for condensate production. During the first two weeks of production, average gas and condensate rates were more than 40% higher than the next-best offset pad.","On the opposite side of the field, in our dry acreage, we recently brought online a four-well pad with an average lateral length of 11,100 feet. Two of the four wells have lateral lengths in excess of 15,000 feet, with up to 78 frac stages per well. All four wells are now producing, with the pad currently flowing 100 million a day. The average IP for these wells is 30 million a day per well and the 30-day average IP is 26 million a day per well. These are proven to be some of our strongest dry gas Marcellus wells ever, as we've been able to maintain 100 million a day flat for 40 days from that pad.","Moving to the north. The super-rich pad we talked about last quarter, near the planned MarkWest Harmon Creek Plant, continues to perform well and is 65% above the type curve after approximately three months. A similar story exists in the wet area, where 23 wells have been drilled over the last nine months. These wells average 10% above the type curve after 65 days. Included in those results is a four-well pad on the southern edge of our position in the wet area that we announced a couple of quarters back that averaged 9,625-foot laterals with 46 stages and IPs at over 35 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well. Today, those four wells are forecasted to average over 4 Bcf equivalent per 1,000 foot of lateral.","These results are exciting, not just because they're some of our best performers to-date, but also because they illustrate consistent performance enhancements. Our development plans and designs have been evolving since we discovered the Marcellus almost 13 years ago. And over the last few years, we've utilized technologies such as real-time data streaming, advanced data visualization, machine learning and predictive analysis. The performance of these new wells demonstrates early wins using this technology, identifying opportunities for improved well performance and returns through optimization of our completion designs, which involves changes like using different proppant loading for specific cases.","Spending just a minute on the technology. Our most recent evolution of this multi-disciplined process involves developing a software platform driven by machine learning. This tool is used to address one of the most significant challenges, the non-linear, non-parametric and highly dimensional nature of predicting well performance. This platform that our team developed connects our engineering teams to a single source of data combined with interactive and predictive models. This allows them to focus their time on improving the economic outcomes of our capital program. It makes it possible to evaluate field development decisions in almost real time.","We believe these tools and the multi-disciplined approach that we've developed represents a unique and competitive advantage for Range. While we haven't been very vocal about it, our teams have been working with machine learning and predictive analysis for years. And what's critically important is that it's truly driving improvements, as demonstrated by recent well performance. Going further, these examples clearly illustrate the quality of our low-risk long lateral inventory in Appalachia across the dry, wet and super-rich areas.","These types of improving results, when combined with going back onto existing pads with existing gathering and compression infrastructure, generate economics that are among the best in the business. I'll repeat again, we literally have thousands of these types of opportunities. And I still don't believe we drilled out best well yet. Here we are almost 13 years after the discovery, and well performance is still getting better.","One big driver of capital efficiency is our lateral lengths. In the first half of the year, our lateral lengths averaged 7,500 feet. But in the second half of the year, we expect length to be turned in line to exceed 9,500 feet. These longer laterals increase the cycle time slightly as we make the transition, but they really set us up well heading into 2018.","Continuing with what was reported during our first quarter conference call, the drilling team continues to drill longer laterals this year and has drilled seven of the top ten longest laterals since inception. Of the seven laterals, four were drilled in the second quarter, averaging over 14,000 feet. Daily drilled lateral footages have increased by 57% versus the second quarter of 2016, resulting in a 23% reduction in dollar per foot drilled. This type of reduction in cost offsets some of the increases we've seen in services and supplies.","The completions team finished the second quarter completing 20% more stages than the same time period last year, while utilizing less than three frac crews. As drilling was able to successfully drill record lateral lengths for the division, the completions team has been successful in completing these longer wells safely while continuing to test new technologies and processes.","Shifting to North Louisiana. Our plan for the year remains consistent: focusing on Terryville while methodically testing and delineating the extension areas over time. In Terryville, we've made great strides in improving cost while driving operational efficiencies. And we're continuing to delineate the stacked pay potential of the field.","As of the end of June, we have 23 additional wells expected to be online this year, with most of that activity in November and December. This group of wells includes 12 Upper Red, five Lower Red, and three Deep Pink wells in Terryville. The other three wells will be in the expansion areas. This is all designed to better understand the full potential of the Lower Cotton Valley. By year end, we'll also have 3D coverage across some very promising areas south of Terryville that will further assist in our delineation efforts.","Looking ahead, we expect the Terryville wells in the second half of 2017 to perform significantly better than the wells turned to sales in the first half for a couple of good reasons. First, as mentioned on the last call, the initial batch of wells included many that had been sitting as DUCs for quite some time, over a year in many cases, and probably for good reason. We looked at these DUCs on a cost-forward basis and made the decision to go forward with the completion.","Second, because the majority of the DUCs were in a concentrated development area, we experienced significant frac hits to offset production as we completed the wells. We discussed this on the last call. In experimenting with completion designs in order to help mitigate that interference, we made changes to fluid intensity. Essentially, we pumped the designed amount of proppant with significantly less fluid. With additional production history, it is now apparent that we under-stimulated the wells, or more simply, the wells have had lower IPs with flatter declines, indicating a less-than-optimum stimulation. On an average, we used approximately 40% less fluid per foot and the resulting production showed a similar percent decrease from what was expected.","Going forward, we're going back to using a typical Terryville-sized completion. We have confidence in this because of the six wells we turned to sales in the second quarter, which were made up of three Upper Reds and three Lower Reds. In these six wells, we pumped larger volumes, but not as large as the original completions, as we were in the middle of analyzing the data and beginning to determine that frac volume and not proppant volume was the key. Early indications from these six wells show that the results will be better than the quarter one wells and closer to our expectations. Thus, going forward, we're headed back to larger frac volumes and better outcomes.","Again, we believe the wells coming online in the second half of the year should meet our expectations and compete with the Marcellus. We're bringing in a frac crew later this month and the crew will run steady throughout the rest of the year. The first of these wells will likely come online in mid to late September, so we should have some very early results from the improved completion designs in our next earnings release and call. With over half the wells coming online in November and December, we expect a significant ramp in North Louisiana production in the fourth quarter, setting us up well going into 2018.","Switching to the extension areas. The exceptional work the team has done in reducing well cost has allowed us to do more work in and around the Vernon Field, which is south of Terryville. The two expansion wells previously announced, each located in separate Terryville-sized fault blocks, again, one to the east and one to the west of the Vernon Field, continued to perform. And plans are underway to offset each well with another horizontal well. We should spud the first of those next month, expecting both wells to be online late this year.","Additionally, we have two vertical science wells in the extension areas designed to test multiple horizons individually. This allows us to determine reservoir and rock properties unique to each layer in order to identify the best lateral targets. With over 400 Bcf per square mile and up to six target intervals, the potential is large.","In closing, in North Louisiana, where we've improved well costs, operational efficiencies and we're gaining more understanding of a full potential of the assets. In the Marcellus, we're still continuing to improve returns through newer technologies, lower costs, longer laterals and improved well performance. We expect solid growth in the second half of this year, setting us up well for 2018.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials.","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, Ray. The big story this time last year was the dramatic production and unit cost and continued improvement in capital efficiency. These positive trends continue this year, and for the second quarter of this year are coupled with higher realized prices such that our quarterly cash flow has more than doubled from last year.","Meanwhile, our DD&A rate and direct operating expense combined is now down to $1.04 in mcfe. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $70 million. Net income adjusted for non-cash and non-recurring items, to match analyst methodology, was $16 million. This quarter, like the first quarter of 2017, was profitable even before considering the earnings contribution from our hedge book.","Second quarter cash flow was $194 million, a 108% increase over the second quarter of last year. Fully diluted cash flow per share for the quarter was $0.79, a 41% increase over last year's second quarter. Second quarter year-to-date cash flow totaled $452 million, a 135% increase over the same period last year. EBITDAX for the second quarter was $240 million. Year-to-date EBITDAX was $543 million. These figures are 86% and a 106% higher, respectively, than the corresponding periods from last year.","Cash margin for the second quarter was $1.09 per Mcfe, 55% higher than the second quarter of last year, while our cash margin year-to-date is $1.28 an Mcfe, 74% higher than the first half of 2016. With two consecutive quarters of profitability and improving margins and cash flow over last year, Range is off to a great first half, with the majority of our annual production growth for the year and improved takeaway capacity still to come.","Looking at our second quarter 2017 expenses, all items were at or below guidance except for exploration expense, which came in $1 million higher than guidance due to the timing of budgeted 2017 seismic expenditures. Expense guidance for the third quarter of 2017 may be found in the earning release.","Committed liquidity under our bank credit facility is just under $800 million and our unhedged recycle ratio is approximately 2.5 times. With the ability to replace each unit of reserves produced with 2.5 new ones out of existing cash flow, our liquidity is more than adequate for our current and anticipated pace of operations. And as Jeff mentioned, the drilling throttle can be adjusted in response to commodity prices, available cash flow and asset sale proceeds.","Range has continued to add hedges to its current hedge position and presently maintains price protection on over 75% of its anticipated 2017 natural gas production at a floor price of $3.23 an Mmbtu. Also approximately 65% of our 2017 oil and NGL production is hedged above current market. During the second quarter, additional 2017 and 2018 natural gas, oil and NGL hedges were added.","Details of these hedge additions may be found in the earnings release and Range website. I would also like to draw your attention to the other Supplemental Tables posted on the website, particularly Table 9, which provides an illustration of our estimated third quarter 2017 natural gas price differential, including basis hedges. Lastly, as we're approaching the one-year mark for the Memorial transaction, investors can expect to see us file soon with the SEC the documents required to publically register the 144A Exchange Notes issued with the transaction last fall.","In summary, with another quarter of solid profitability accomplished and the outlook for the second half of 2017 pointing toward improved margins and stronger growth, we are clearly seeing the benefits of our hard-fought effort to reduce our cost structure and improve our capital productivity flowing through our financial statements.","Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Ventura. The question-and-answer session will now begin. Your first question is from Dan McSpirit of BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Turning to the Cotton Valley. In light of recent results here, how cautious are you in changing or experimenting further with the completion technique? I'm asking in an effort here to get a better sense of the rate of change going forward and whether Range will show better results than what the prior operator delivered or even with the acquisition economics were based on. I guess put differently here, are the results expected later this year as good as it's going to get?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","That's an interesting question, Dan. I hope not. We are pretty confident, really confident, in fact, that the wells are going to be a lot better in the second half. First of all, I think I discussed this in detail on the last call, that you group the wells that are happening in Terryville into three groups. First group was wells that we really didn't have the ability to change hardly anything and then the second group were sort of in transition where we might have changed the targeting of the well or something like that. And then finally, the third group is what, of course, we're all interested in, the Range wells.","Range picks the location, we pick the target, we pick the spacing, we pick all the parameters around the well. Those wells really started with the six wells that came online in the second quarter. And we began working on what is the most important factor in the completion design that impacts production. And we are pretty confident that we realize now that that is volume of fracture. It's different than in the lot of the shale plays. Again, remember, this is a really tight sandstone and it's a whole different frac geometry and it's a whole different world essentially.","So what we've learned is that frac volume is important. And as we were in the middle of determining that, we made some significant steps in volume sizes through those six wells. And of course six wells is not enough to be statistically significant yet, but we did see enough of a correlation there to be really confident going forward that with our plans starting later this month that the completion designs going forward will perform a whole lot better.","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Well, I think another key thing to look back on the acquisition economics is prior to Range announcing the acquisition, those wells were costing 10 plus million dollars, $10 million or $11 million. When we mentioned it, on our acquisition economics were based on $8.7 million drill and complete per well. We're at $7.4 million. So when you take the $7.4 million against the type curves we have in the book that we expect that we'll get for the rest of the year, you're looking at really strong economics that compete with the Marcellus. And we have confidence that's what we're going to see for the second half of the year.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. And as a quick follow-up to that, you talked about spending your cash flow, including proceeds from an asset sale or asset sales. What could be divested to cover the difference between cash flow and capital spending? And maybe how much is needed next year to generate, say, 20% growth at $3 NYMEX pricing?","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, when you look at we've sold, as you know, a lot of non-core assets over the years, about $4 billion worth. So we still have assets in the Mid-Continent that would be deemed non-core. One can make the case that the stuff we have in Northeast Pennsylvania, although it's high quality, is away from that core blocky stacked pay position we have in the Southwest. So there's other assets we have that we could sell. It's early to put out 2018. So we have assets we could sell to fill the gap. Clearly we've done that in the past and we'll be disciplined, but actively trying to do that.","The other thing is, we said last October, consensus at that time was $3.25, and we said for $3.25 we could grow at 20%. So, obviously, with all else being equal, if prices are lower than at $3.25, then growth would be less than the 20%. But I don't have a specific number to give for you today, but that's currently where we are.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Very good. Have a great day. Thank you.","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Ron Mills of Johnson Rice & Company.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thanks for your answer on Dan's last question. As it relates to 2018, you talked about further differential improvement from those three pipeline systems. This year, I think you expect $0.10 to $0.15 improvement in differentials. Can we expect something similar next year? And how much, if any of that, would potentially be offset by higher transportation costs to get to those better markets?","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, I think that we're looking at significant improvements next year on the order of what you just stated. So net-net, when you look the cost to get to the markets, we're still expecting the benefit of improvements in differentials with nat gas coming in again. So the story of continued improvement differentials we see for natural gas, I think we see for NGLs as well.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. And, Ray, for you. In the Marcellus or just Appalachian Basin in general, in addition to drilling longer laterals, you've talked about the use of the machine learning. What other changes has that learning resulted in, whether it's are you using non-geometric completions, are you using more proppant? Or what are some of the benefits that you're seeing from that machine learning?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Well, it's a good question, Ron. The ultimate benefit is well performance. And we're clearly seeing, in lot of the examples I just went through in my remarks, significant improvements above the type curves, our average type curves, that we've got published.","So, to me, that's always the true measure is are we seeing it in well performance. And we are. It involves a lot of things from well design, from the standpoint of what target it should be in. Although the Marcellus is one compact package of shale, if you want to think about it that way, there are different layers in it. And, again, we talk about the super-rich, the wet and the dry area. But what this machine learning capability allows us to do is take this tremendous amount of data, whether it's geological, geophysical, rock properties, all of the completion histories and reservoir pressures and everything else that we see there, and look at this in multi-dimensional views. In other words, there's no bounds on the machine as to how many different things it can consider at one time.","And so it allows us to take an approach to use all of those things you mentioned, whether it's changing the perforation design, cluster spacing, the proppant loading, the amount of fluid that we pump, exactly which target we put the lateral in. And it allows you to look at not just one well on a specific well basis, but it allows you to take your capital program and say what's the best way to get the best return in well performance out of this amount of capital in this field with these sorts of parameters.","And so it's been a really eye-opening experience for an old frac guy like me to see this team and the technical ability that they have today to develop that. We hope to do the same thing in North Louisiana eventually, but it will take some time. Again, we've only had that property for less than a year now. And we're beginning to apply a lot of those technologies, but it's going to take a long time to build that model.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","And then just to clarify, did you say the recent six wells that you mentioned in Terryville, are those the first wells that you've done from soup to nuts in terms of Range drilling, design completion, design (38:36), bring online? And would there be any legacy Memorial wells left, or have you moved through that whole inventory?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, I think we own it from this point forward, bottom line. Those wells were pretty much Range wells. A couple of them, we may have used permits that MRD already had in hand or something like that, but I think that we would consider those our wells.","But, again, we were in the middle of determining the results of what we saw in the first quarter, and clearly we made a mistake. We made what we thought was a good decision at the time, but looking at the results, it didn't turn out like we hoped. But going forward, we think we've cracked the code and, again, we'll start seeing those results in a couple of months from now.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Charles Robertson of Cowen.","Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody. This is Adam Meyers stepping in for Charles Robertson. Thank you for taking my questions.","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC","Just had a quick question. Obviously given some of your peers and their pending merger, was kind of interested in what your thoughts are regarding industry consolidation, really looking at how Range fits the mix there given the current low price per reserve that Range appears to be trading at?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Well, you're talking about the EQT Rice merger.","Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC","Sure.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","If you think about it at a very high level, fewer companies I think in the Basin drilling is probably a positive thing. It's probably a more pace development, a more prudent and more rational development. So I think that's a good thing for the macro.","In terms of Range and the price we're trading at it, I think when you look at the quality of our assets, the wells we're posting, the improvements in cash flow per share, I think we're on sale. So I would say that it's low.","Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Okay.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Our share price is a bargain, it's clear. $0.73, our IR team was pointing that out last night. When you look at where we trade versus some of our peers and any compared quality of assets on an equivalent basis, I think for investors that believe in gas markets long term, Range is a good place to be.","Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. No, definitely makes sense. And then I guess for my follow-up, it seems like investors are gaining more traction with this idea of maybe the Cabot business model, switching to sustainable growth that returns cash to shareholders. Do you see Range moving to that business model long term? Is that something that you see on the horizon?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, I think when you look at us long term, we expect to generate significant free cash flow, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. And with long term, when you look at that, we'll look at all the different things you can do from working with the balance sheet to returning capital to shareholders. So we'll be looking at all those different options.","Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Neal Dingmann of SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Roger \u2013 or probably for Ray actually, my first question. Ray, you talked just two things here. You mentioned about, I think it was you, talked about the constrained conditions, how you're running a number of your wells. Will you continue to do that? And is that more just \u2013 I know I've talked to Jeff and you all about this, just the natural practice? Or is this more about you don't want to have to overbuild the infrastructure and then have the wells settle down? And certainly wells are impressive. So I'm just wondering, when you talk about this constrained condition what is driving that. And how do you see that playing out going forward?","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, that's a good question, Neal. And it's a philosophy we've had for many, many years now. Basically, when you design production facilities and things like that, you could design them to be able to produce the IP of the well unconstrained. But I think if you did that, it would be very uneconomical because you would have facilities out there that you paid for that would only be used for a month or two or maybe three at the best case.","So what we choose to do is look at it from a project standpoint and the optimal economic approach of what is the best \u2013 when you are looking at the fact that we're going to do thousands of wells over the years and we're going to build this infrastructure system and, again, our design from the early, early on, and it took us 10 years probably get it in place, was that we would have this existing infrastructure of pads and pipelines and compression stations and water infrastructure and all of that that would allow us to optimally develop the properties going forward at the lowest cost. And I think you see that in our cost structure quarter after quarter. We're getting better, LOEs are getting better, all that.","But what that does is you bring on some of these wells, and especially as we drill longer laterals and we're seeing the performance enhancements that we've talked about this morning, all of that means that the wells come on and they're basically choked back for months at a time before you start seeing those declines and we believe that the best economic, lowest-cost approach for developing those resources, we're going to take a very similar approach in North Louisiana, and we've talked about that, which is significantly different than what they were doing before.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","No, great. Good point. And then just moving over to slide 10 where you talk about quality of your North Louisiana acreage, you hit this a little bit earlier. Could you talk about when you look and think about the delineation, even going down as far as Jackson Parish, is most of that delineated? Or how do you anticipate your plan over the next couple, two, three quarters, will you still have to delineate down in that southern area? Or maybe just talk about the delineation plan in general, if you could. Thanks.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Well, the second half of the year is pretty well lined out. And like we've talked about, I think it was 23 wells that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And I think it was 12 Upper Reds and five Lower Reds and three Deep Pinks and then three more wells in the extension area.","Most of the focus this year still remains on Terryville. And I think going into 2018, that won't change. We're still looking at delineating the edges of Terryville. In other words, taking tiers of wells south from the existing development. We see a lot of potential there. There's still potential for stacked pay and in-fill potential inside Terryville. It's going to take some time to build the reservoir models and determine that. So we'll be working on that also.","And then, like Jeff mentioned and I talked about a little bit, the extension wells, we've had some pretty exciting early results, but pretty exciting, to the east and west of Vernon Field, so we're going to continue some work there with some additional offsets. We've got some science work going on the east side of Vernon Field to try to determine just how much potential was there and what's going to be the best way to develop that.","One of the things we've learned in the Marcellus in the stacked pay position that we have in Southwest Pennsylvania, that it takes years and you need to be very thoughtful and strategic about how you develop and stack those laterals and what that program is going to look like. We're taking all of that learning and we're basically going to take our time and be very strategic in the same way throughout that whole 220,000-acre position. We have a big 3D that's going to be coming in later this year that is going to open up a lot more of that extension area to the south of Terryville.","So all of that said, the primary focus is still going to be drilling development wells in and around Terryville. But we're still going to have a pretty steady program, pretty consistently, but strategically, delineating that acreage around to the south. But I think it's going to take some time to do that because we are going to be very scientific, strategic and data-based and really develop some long-term plans around that.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks much for the details, Ray.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. Could you guys talk about the 25-day per well delay up in Pennsylvania and your comfort level that that won't recur?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Sure, Bob. What happened is the DEP had some issues with staffing and different things. And the permitting delays just kept getting longer and longer and longer. We have worked with the DEP. They have developed a solution worked with us very well. We have permits in the hand now for 2017. We feel very confident going forward. They have done a wonderful job in working with us to solve that issue.","So what that caused us to do throughout the year was to substitute and move different wells around. It wasn't the same plan as we had early in the year when we developed the forecast for production growth. And so you substitute some wells, you delay some wells, you move some wells around, add a couple of wells to a pad here and there. And it just changes timing. And, again, it doesn't change the economics of the well. The capital still gets spent, the EUR doesn't change. In fact, the EURs are getting better just because we're using all the new technology.","But what it does is when you take like the four-well pad that we did on the east side, that's 100 million a day for 40 days, that's an outstanding well. We knew it was going to be a good well, but it's a really great well. But it ended up online three months or four months later than we expected. And so when you take a big pad like that and it's delayed three months or four months, that just impacts your year's growth. And so here we're with five months left in the year, you just can't make it up.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","And you think of the progress we've made, if you think back two years or three years ago, that was unheard of. And now we have that pad actually initially come in at 100 million per day from three wells.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Great economics. No change to any economic parameter. No change to capital in year spent but you slide that, like Ray said, three months or four months, it makes a difference. And then you do that with the numbers Ray said, it's impactful. But we're excited we have those kind of pads. And that situation going forward looks like it's solved.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","It's solved. Okay. Thanks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Kelly of Seaport Global.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Jeff, you gave that 10% to 20% growth range earlier in the call. And I'm just curious on the commodity price you envision on the bottom end of that range. And I believe last quarter you laid out in a $60 oil, $3 gas world, you could be 20% plus. What's the bottom end envisioned? Thanks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Well, you look at strip pricing for next year, and I'm probably a week out, is it $2.90 or something like that, $2.80 something. First quarter is good. We have good hedges in there. And we think when you look at the pricing for oil and for gas and you look at the rig counts and where they are, I think Appalachian rig count right now is around 60 actually combined Marcellus, Utica, haven't been spiking up, and you look at the cash flow that's available for Permian players at, call it, $49 a barrel oil or $45 to $50 or something like that, cash flow will be down. So we think that strip historically is wrong. It probably will come up a little bit.","And interestingly, if you look in the back of our book on slide 66, it has total macro Lower 48 oil production streaming up, like everybody sees it. But when you look at the total gas position in U.S.-ex to Northeast, it's pretty flat. So you look at the Northeast, its constrained, far Northeastern Pennsylvania until Atlantic Sunrise comes on. That's basically you're looking at probably middle of 2018 or before.","So we think that the macro setting up, strip pricing may be a little better. We said that $3.25 gas last October about where consensus was that we'd grow at 20%. Consensus today, I think it is $3.12 or $3.14 something like that, so growth may be a little lower. And not going to throw a specific number out, but we'll be in good shape I think. With where gas is next year, most likely expectation is that 10% to 20% range.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. That lower end of 10%, is that something that you could achieve at a $2.50 gas price? How should we think about that lower end?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, $2.50, I think the whole industry slows down dramatically at $2.50. You saw what the rig count did early part of 2016 as the gas went to $2.50 and ultimately broke $2 for a little bit. And the only good part, I think the industry is pretty sensitive, the message anymore is most of the operators are going to be living at or near cash flow. So I don't think you're going to see the big out-spends.","If prices dip down, we'll be sensitive to cash flow. I'm sure you have a model of Range and you can model what that cash flow is. But we're going to be sensitive and set the throttle somewhere in that position. I think if gas goes to $2.50, you'll see the industry slow down dramatically. I don't think it'll stay there that long.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Got it. Appreciate it. And just a quick one for Ray. In the second half of this year, if these 22 wells in the Terryville don't really pan out and you don't see the results that you're looking to see, I'm just curious how you could think about or how quickly you could pull capital away potentially from the Terryville in 2018, maybe slow down there and shift that back toward Appalachia. Thanks.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Well, it's a good point, Mike. Of course, if we don't see the results, then, yeah, we're going to slow down and look at this a lot harder. We have a lot of confidence in what we're doing going forward. And we've seen the data. We've looked at it seems like 1,000 different ways with 1,000 different experts. And so I feel very confident that the team has their arms around it and that we're really confident going forward. But, again, we're going to learn a lot in the third and fourth quarter. We should see some really improving results in North Louisiana, but we're also moving the needle forward in Marcellus. We continue to make better wells there. So I think we'll look at all of that as we approach the budgeting time. And the board approves the budget in December and I think that's when we'll know what the plans are for next year.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning. Range is often lumped into the higher-levered balance sheet camp. And there's always been the case that I think you've made, that EBITDA growth will help to de-lever. You highlighted in one of your slides that you have been active in asset sales in the past. How close are you to considering more meaningful asset sales, equity issuance or other ways to bring that leverage down further, particularly if the $3.25 doesn't materialize?","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, Brian. This is Roger. I'll comment on the leverage. And you're exactly right. With our windshield ratio, the recycle ratio at 2.5%, even with a pretty dismal backward-dated strip, we're able to grow within cash flow at a respectable rate. So that gives us a lot of comfort. The rear-view mirror ratio at 3 times debt to EBITDAX, at this point in the cycle we're comfortable with it, but long term, we're not. We want to get that back down to historical levels. And as you know, the first lever we pull when we want to do that is the asset sale lever. And as Jeff said, $4 billion is what we've sold in the past.","We've still got some attractive assets to sell. And it would be imprudent for me to comment on the likelihood or expectations of that effort. But that's clearly the next stop on the waterfall for those proceeds.","When you look at our debt structure, it's a very stable balance sheet. Our bondholders are obviously pleased with the paper. The spreads remain tight to our index. We trade tighter than a lot of our even higher-rated peers. S&P has us at BB+, both agencies at stable outlook, which is all appropriate given our low cost structure, our asset quality, the deep inventory we've got, the track record.","So as I said, we're comfortable at this point in the cycle. But we're going to work hard to get that leverage down. I think when you look at the composition of the liability structure, one thing you'll notice and investors will notice is we're carrying over $900 million in floating rate bank debt right now, which we're real comfortable with, because we've got a rock-solid borrowing base, no pun intended, and ample liquidity for whatever we have planned. But we really like having pre-payable debt that we can pay down literally at a moment's notice with some asset sale proceeds or if we're blessed with a normal winter. So that's going to be the first place we go is to reduce that debt. And we're positioned to be able to do that with that revolver balance.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is with regards to guidance for next year. You talked about the risks from a gas price perspective. What do you have baked in in terms of Louisiana well performance, Marcellus well performance and pipeline takeaway and timing out of Appalachia, what are the risks around the volume guidance one way or the other for reasons other than gas price?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Well, I think when you look at, again, we'll have a lot of flexibility on where we allocate capital. As Ray said, the good part is you look at the big fourth quarter ramp, 200 million per day, it's timely when you look at the pipes that are coming on that I mentioned in my notes. It's also timely that differentials tend to be \u2013 improve up in Appalachia in the fourth and first quarter.","So we'll have a nice ramp going into there. We have flexibility. By the time we get to the end of the year, we'll know lot more about the Terryville wells. Like Ray said, we have confidence in those wells in the second half. And with the expectations that we have, those economics will compete with the Marcellus.","However you look at the Marcellus, we're drilling longer laterals and we're getting some spectacular wells. And we do think basis will improve up there for 2018 given the new pipes that are coming on and the fact that we think overall that those pipes won't fill the rig count, like I said, up there currently around 60. We had commented in the past, to fill those pipes, the industry would have to be we think somewhere around 120 to 130 rigs. And that would have been a few months ago. And I've heard other people say the rig count needs to be at least 90 to fill them by 2019. So I think Range is in good shape. And we have adequate flexibility.","We've talked all along, one of the advantages of the acquisitions was to be able to toggle capital either way. And I can sit here and build a case where, with success in Terryville and success in the extension areas, you'd toggle more capital that way, or with basis coming in the Marcellus and longer laterals, we'd toggle more capital in Appalachia. So we'll look at that very hard as we go into next year.","But with the pipes we have, I think our team's done a good job of thinking through the flexibility. And couple of those pipes that I mentioned, for us, we're expecting should be on in the fourth quarter, that's Rayne\/Leach, Adair Southwest, Rover is scheduled to be on. But even if there's slight delays, I think our team does a good job of thinking through the various outcomes and planning for contingencies.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Jeffrey L.

Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risk and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers' remark, there will be a question-and-answer period.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Rodney L. Waller - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome. Range reported results for second quarter 2015 with record production, a continuing decrease in unit costs, and some outstanding well results. The order of our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, Chairman, President and CEO; Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ray Walker, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer.","Range did file our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on our website under the Investor tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we've posted to our website supplemental tables which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins, and the reconciliation of reported earnings to our adjusted non-GAAP earnings that are discussed on the call.","Now, let me turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Rodney. The past several months have been a challenge. Appalachian natural gas differentials have widened as the basin awaits takeaway expansions and a more balanced regional supply and demand picture.","In addition, NGL netbacks have been weak in Appalachia, particularly propane, as regional supply has outstripped summer demand. In the face of these current pricing issues, we remain focused on things that will improve our netbacks in the near term and things that will make Range successful in the long run.","We're focused on executing our plan and driving down costs in the field and at the corporate level while operating safely. The good news is that we put some arrangements in place years ago that will come to fruition later this year, which should make some of this pricing pain short lived for Range.","For the second half of 2015, there are two projects that will benefit Range, specifically. The first is Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City project. Range is an anchor shipper on this project and has approximately 200 million cubic feet per day of capacity. The first leg of the project is anticipated to commence on August 1, and the second and final leg is projected to start up on September 1. This will move about 200 million cubic feet per day gross or about 170 million cubic feet per day net of our production from the local Appalachian M2 markets to premium Midwest markets.","Under current strip pricing, this should increase our realized price by approximately $1.00 on this production. For the next 12 months, we've locked in a significant portion of the price uplift by hedging the basis. The uplift from this project is expected to have a significant impact on our Southwest Marcellus realized pricing for future periods. The 170 million cubic feet per day net capacity would equate to 28% of our average Southwest Marcellus gas production in the second quarter.","The second project, which we expect to be very impactful for us, is Mariner East I. Range has 40,000 barrels per day of capacity on Mariner East I and is the anchor shipper on this project as well. The capacity is for 20,000 barrels of ethane and 20,000 barrels per day of propane. We'll also have access to 80% of a 1 million barrel propane storage cavern at Marcus Hook.","Sunoco is projecting Mariner East I to start up in late September with commissioning completed a few weeks thereafter. Mariner East I will lock in our Appalachian propane transport costs and result in significant transportation savings. It will also enable us to choose between Northeast markets and international markets, depending on demand and pricing. When Mariner East I is fully up and running, this project, in combination with Mariner West and ATEX, is anticipated to result in about a $90 million increase to our net cash flow on an annualized basis without counting the potential propane price uplift opportunities.","The marketing team has not only put in place good projects for the second half of 2015, but also, looking forward into 2016 and 2017, there are other projects that should benefit Range. Range is an anchor shipper and has 150 million cubic feet per day gross of capacity on Spectra's Gulf Markets Expansion Project. Start-up is targeted for the fourth quarter of 2016 and this will move 128 million cubic feet per day net of Range's gas to the Gulf Coast.","Rover Phase I is also planned to start up in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, at the end of 2017, Range has participated in several pipeline expansion projects that will allow Range to move an additional 900 million cubic feet per day of Range's gas to the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Canadian markets.","On a macro basis, good things are happening inside the Appalachian Basin. The overall rig count for the Marcellus is down 55% from its peak. Total Marcellus production has been flat to declining since the beginning of the year based on pipeline flows. The Utica rig count has dropped 66% from its peak. In addition to dropping rigs, the remaining rigs are moving out of the wet gas and liquids-rich portion of the Utica, which should help rebalance the oversupply of liquids in the basin. Given the steep declines of most of these Utica liquids wells, the rebalance should happen sooner rather than later. With the drop in Utica rig count by two-thirds, coupled with the lack of hedges for 2016 and beyond by most companies, and with lower strip pricing for 2016, the Utica rig count will probably stay low for a while, which will help on the supply side.","Good things are also happening outside of the Appalachian Basin. Looking across the U.S., the oil rig count is down about 60%. There's a lot of associated natural gas with oil, and the associated gas now accounts for a significant portion of total U.S. gas production. Per flow data, it appears that the gas from some of the key oil basins may have peaked in April. Since the associated gas is very rich, about 40% of all NGLs come from this source. Therefore, the NGLs from this source should follow the trend in associated gas.","On the demand side, LNG gas exports from the U.S. are still on target to begin in the fourth quarter of this year and ramp with time. Natural gas continues to take market share from coal, and I believe that this trend will continue, given that natural gas is a much friendlier fuel from an environmental perspective than coal. In addition, natural gas exports to Mexico, industrial demand for gas and natural gas for transportation, directly as CNG or indirectly as electricity, are projected to grow with time.","We believe these supply and demand side forces are working together to rebalance the market sooner than it was currently priced into the strip. Consequently, we believe that as supply and demand equalize, that natural gas will move up. Equally important, as the infrastructure within the Appalachian Basin builds out, the basis should narrow with time. In combination, this should result in better netbacks for Range.","In a commodity business, it's important to be low cost and have scale. On slide four of our IR presentation, we've included a new slide from Wood Mackenzie. According to their work on the Marcellus, Range not only has the largest resource base, we have the lowest breakeven cost. In addition, we have the upside of potentially 400,000 net acres of dry Utica gas beneath our Marcellus acreage.","Coupling this resource base with our capital discipline and diversified portfolio of marketing arrangements, which gives us multiple options that our competitors do not have, Range is positioned to create value as we move forward into an expected better market that balances supply, demand and infrastructure.","I'll now turn the call over to Roger.","Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Jeff. The second quarter traditionally brings the mildest weather of the year, which tends to amplify the pricing impact of a supply surplus. This year's mild second quarter occurred against the unusual backdrop of seasonal market surpluses for all of our energy commodities: oil, natural gas and NGLs. Fortunately, as Jeff discussed, better days are ahead; and in the meantime, our results are supported by significant cost reductions and a strong hedge position.","Quarterly financial performance since 2008 has been a tug-of-war between low-cost production growth and realized price. With the help of consistent and significant unit cost reductions during this timeframe, more often than not at Range, growth at low cost has won the contest. Production growth of 24% and 11% lower unit costs in the second quarter, however were no match for a 38% year-over-year reduction in realized price. Despite significantly higher production, revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales, including cash-settled derivatives, was $383 million, 15% below last year.","Second quarter cash flow was $161 million and EBITDAX for the quarter came in at $203 million. Cash flow per fully diluted share was $0.97. Year-to-date second quarter cash flow totaled $367 million, while year-to-date EBITDAX was $446 million.","GAAP net income for the second quarter was a loss of $119 million. Non-GAAP earnings, calculated using popular analyst methodology, was $2.3 million or $0.01 per fully diluted share.","The second quarter was another good one on the expense reduction side, with direct operating, production, taxes, exploration, G&A and interest expense totals all coming in below last year on both a unit cost basis and absolute dollar basis.","The only expense item to slightly exceed quarterly guidance was interest expense, as the second quarter included one month of negative interest carry from our issuance of $750 million in 4.875% 10-year senior notes. We issued these notes in favorable market conditions several months ago, well before next month's redemption of our callable 6.75% notes.","Second quarter cash unit costs were reduced by $0.25 per mcfe and total unit costs were reduced by $0.36 per mcfe from last year. At current realized prices, these are very meaningful reductions. We believe additional unit cost reductions are possible as we become even more efficient with both our operating and capital expenditures. Third quarter specific line item expense guidance may be found in our second quarter earnings press release.","The big news over on the balance sheet was the $750 million issuance of 10-year senior notes. At May issuance, the 4.875% notes represented the lowest yield of any non-investment grade energy and power sector issuer of any maturity in 2015. Many thanks to the institutions on this call who helped make this possible as the transaction demonstrates the credit worthiness of our company and the quality of our long life, low-cost, high-return assets.","Lower prices and the front-end loaded nature of our capital budget in 2015 pushed our leverage a bit higher in the second quarter with second quarter trailing 12-month debt-to-EBITDAX ratio coming in at 3.3 times. I should mention that this leverage ratio is charted territory for Range, as we have been over 3 times on several occasions over the years. Even though we no longer have a debt-to-EBITDAX loan covenant and our next annual borrowing base determination isn't until May of next year, our stance on leverage has not changed. When leverage exceeds 3 times, we will begin working on ways to bring it down. It would be premature to discuss the specific things we are working on right now, but as Range has sold over $3 billion in assets over the past 10 years, this is the first option we consider to reduce leverage.","Range added new hedges for 2015 and 2016 across all commodities during the second quarter, the details of which may be found in the earnings press release and Range website.","As Jeff mentioned, the second quarter was a challenging one. However, Range is structured operationally and financially to handle this kind of adversity. Our low-cost structure, high-return projects, long life assets, strong balance sheet, plentiful liquidity and consistent performance history provide welcome stability and the means to navigate through these tough times. Until times are better, we will continue to drive down costs, high grade our portfolio, and prudently allocate capital.","Ray, over to you.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Roger. During times like these, it's critical to have a great team, quality assets, size and scale, a strong balance sheet and a low cost structure. Range has all of that, but we also have the unique ability to drill in high-quality core areas of dry, wet or super-rich with the operational flexibility to reallocate capital when needed and maintain capital discipline.","During the first half of this year, we've clearly exercised those abilities and changed the lay of the land. And I'll walk you through some of those changes now. Of course, the first step happened at the beginning of the year when we adjusted our 2015 plan by cutting CapEx by 45%, or $700 million less as compared to last year, while still delivering 20% production growth. And we're still on track to execute that plan. Another step we took was to allocate more of our capital to dry gas drilling in Southwest PA due to the challenges we saw coming in the NGL market. The dry gas economics were substantially better.","In Southwest PA, our normal year-end inventory of wells ready for completion would normally be in the range of 20 to 30 wells. Our current forecast is that we should have between 50 and 60 wells in inventory, and about half of those wells are expected to be in the dry gas area. Of course, it's very preliminary and those numbers will likely change, but those wells can be brought online in 2016 with less capital since we're only looking at the completion cost rather than the total well cost.","In addition, we've increased the number of wells being turned to sales in 2015 as we now expect an additional 16 Marcellus wells to be turned in line at the very end of 2015 rather than early next year; all of this allowing us to start 2016 with good momentum into the historically better winter pricing environment.","With our new contracts and low-cost transportation, we will be positioned well to start off next year while maintaining good capital discipline. Our capital spending was front-end loaded this year with us spending approximately two-thirds of our capital budget during the first two quarters. In January, we had 15 rigs running. Currently, we have 10 rigs running and we expect to average seven rigs in the third quarter, going down to six in the fourth quarter. We'll also be tapering off frac crews in the second half of this year. So, as you can see, our CapEx spend will be substantially less during the second half of the year, and I want to reiterate that we remain committed to meet our planned $870 million budget.","We beat production guidance for the second quarter and came in at 1.373 Bcf equivalent per day, largely driven by better-than-expected performance in the dry gas area of Southwest Pennsylvania. For the third quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.39 Bcf equivalent per day to 1.4 Bcf equivalent per day with approximately 28% liquids, and are still on track to deliver 20% production growth for the year.","The Mariner East I project has been delayed from the original expectation of a July start-up, and we forecasted the project coming online late in the quarter with full operations during the fourth quarter. Like Roger pointed out in his remarks, our costs are consistently improving on both an absolute and unit basis. Corporate LOE per mcfe is down 20% for the quarter as compared to last year, and G&A per mcfe is down 21%.","We've demonstrated discipline and a continued focus on costs. Reacting to the current environment, we had to make some tough decisions in closing our Oklahoma City division office and making substantial personnel cuts in our legacy fields in Pennsylvania. Those decisions resulted in layoffs of approximately 11% of our workforce. Those decisions were not made lightly, but in this environment, tough decisions like these become necessary.","We've updated our Marcellus economics on page 16 in our presentation to reflect the current pricing and differentials. We left the well cost and type curves unchanged in order to get an apples-to-apples comparison. As you can see, our economics are still good in all cases, but the dry area economics have improved, supporting our decision to direct more of our capital towards dry gas in Southwest PA. The improved economics in the dry area are driven primarily by the improvement in basis differentials coupled with our transportation contracts going forward.","In the Marcellus, we continue to upgrade our completion designs by optimizing proppant loading, sizes and concentrations along with reduced stage spacing across our very large and diverse acreage position in Southwest PA. For example, stage sizes today range from 200,000 pounds of proppant per stage up to 500,000 pounds per stage, depending on the area and the particular reservoir characteristics in that area.","Well performance this year is on target, and I'll point out a couple of examples of recent performance. In the wet area, we brought online a five-well pad averaging 28.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well initial rate to sales with a seven-day average rate to sales of 20.8 million a day per well under constrained conditions. Those wells averaged 5,204-foot laterals with 27 stages per well.","In the dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania, we had a two-well pad come online with an average initial rate to sales of 34.2 million cubic feet a day per well under constrained conditions. The average 90-day rate is 20 million cubic feet a day per well. Those wells average 9,074-foot laterals with 45 stages, and have cum'd over 1.8 Bcf each well in 90 days.","Expanding on that area where these two wells are located, we have a total of six offset wells with up to a year of production history. The average cum'd production at 90 days to sales under facility and gathering system constraints was 1.5 Bcf per each well. These were shorter laterals averaging 5,064 feet with 26 stages. Our EUR in this area is currently 3 Bcf per thousand foot, with some of the older wells over 3.2 Bcf per thousand foot, putting this area on par with some of the best production in the basin.","We believe our dry gas area in Southwest PA will be very prolific and it's clearly exceeding our expectations thus far this year. In Southwest Pennsylvania, we completed 52% more stages in the first half of this year as compared to last year.","Our stage count per day improved by 20% for the first quarter and by 30% for the first half of the year. Highlighting the second quarter, we averaged 6.3 stages a day per frac crew, which we believe is the best in the basin. As we've front-end loaded a lot of the activity this year, our total stages and stage counts per day are expected to be less during the last half of this year.","On the drilling side, during the second quarter we saw a 13% decrease in days while drilling 21% longer laterals as compared to last year. To put that in perspective, based on recent data, we would estimate drilling an 8,500-foot lateral well in less than 18 days. These efficiencies have been critical in helping us deliver 20% growth this year with 45% less capital, and we're far from done as these improvements will keep on coming.","Other than having a great operating team, a critical factor in achieving these operational and well performance gains is being in the core of the play. As I've often said, the rock rules. We list the normalized EUR and cost results of our Marcellus areas in a table in our earnings release.","Achieving results comparable to these are very difficult when you're not in the core. When you combine these results with our lower transportation costs and all the great work our team has done at securing better markets, it drives what we believe to be one of the best capital efficiencies in the industry.","Operational gains, coupled with further service cost reductions, have helped to reduce our overall well costs significantly. When comparing the first half of 2015 with the second half of 2014, we're seeing total well cost reductions on an apples-to-apples basis of up to 25% or more, and we're continuing to see costs come down on things like steel, along with other goods and prices \u2013 services.","Like I said on the last call, Range did not have any long-term drilling or service contracts and, therefore, our operating teams had, and still have, a tremendous competitive advantage in optimizing our service provider relationships. Coupled with our operating practices, we can achieve attractive pricing while our service providers maintain high utilization rates and reasonable margins.","Over the long term, we expect that this will differentiate Range versus our peers as we believe our well planned, disciplined and growing operations have allowed us to attract some of the most favorable service pricing in the basin.","Our Washington County, PA Utica well is still producing into our wet system on an interruptible and constrained basis, and it's still too early to make any reasonable estimates of ultimate performance. We're finishing up the completion on our second well and expect that both wells will be online in the permanent new dry gas infrastructure over the next couple of months.","You can see some of the details on that second well in our earnings release. I expect that we'll be able to give more information on well performance after both wells have been online consistently for a few months, and we still expect to spud our third well before year end and it will be completed in 2016.","Our Fort Worth operations team, which now also runs our Midcontinent division in addition to our Northern Marcellus division, is doing a great job focusing on cost while delivering great well results. In Northeast PA, we just drilled and set pipe on a well for $284 per lateral foot as compared to $394 per foot estimated for 2015. That's a 28% reduction in cost from what we originally planned.","Since that team has taken over the Midcontinent assets in a very short time and with just a few wells under their belt, they've reduced the total completed well cost in the Nemaha Chat play by over 31% to approximately $2.2 million per well with the last few wells. And the initial production from those wells is consistent with our expectations.","Our Southern Appalachia Nora team is also doing great, and while they have a very limited capital budget this year, they're continuing to bring online some of the best coal bed methane wells we've seen in 25 years. Utilizing the new high rate frac technique, the recent CBM wells are 60% better than their average offsets with significantly better economics.","Although Range's operational tempo has been high, employee safety remains a top priority. Employee and management commitment to safety has resulted in Range having no OSHA recordable injuries thus far in 2015 and zero hours of lost time in the last 18 months. We are really proud of all of our operating teams for working safely and being good stewards in the communities where we live and work.","Like I said in the beginning, times are indeed tough and every penny really counts. Maintaining capital discipline and a low-cost structure are extremely important. I'm proud to say that we believe we have a deeper, more diverse and better inventory than anyone in the basin with minimal type curve risk at one of the lowest cost structures, with one of the best capital efficiencies, great capital discipline, and one of the best teams in the industry.","Now, back to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Ventura. The question-and-answer session will now begin. Our first question comes from Ron Mills with Johnson & Rice. Please proceed with your question.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I know it's still early, but do you have any preliminary thoughts on 2016, in particular, in light of your 3 times leverage ratio, how CapEx versus growth can look at either varying levels of CapEx, depending on how the cash flows look like they'll settle out?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's a great question. And I'll start by saying it is early. Typically, we work that really hard, present it to our board in December, and then after their approval announce it in January. But let me give you a lot of thoughts around it that, hopefully, will put some sideboards around it and give you a lot of color.","I'd like to start by talking about this year, 2015. In this year, we're getting a 20% growth with $870 million of CapEx. And we feel good about those numbers, and that's where we'll end up. And if you look at that, I think, versus any of our peers, I think we're at the head of the class. Our dollars go further than almost any operator. We're, I believe, one of the most, if not the most, capital efficient company out there. So, we'll start with 2015.","If you look into 2016, I think our pricing gets better. The netbacks will get better. One, we'll have a full year of Mariner East in 2016 and we're \u2013 again, have the lion's share of Mariner East. We're the only producer that has capacity on it. We have 40,000 barrels per day on it. So, our netback pricing for our NGLs should get significantly better for ethane, for propane, et cetera.","Also, we'll have a full year at Uniontown to Gas City, which is a big uplift and one that's a really significant portion of our production in the Southwest. It's initially $1.00 uplift in that $0.75 to $1.00 range, and we've hedged and locked a lot of that in. So, our netbacks should get significantly better in 2016.","And, as I mentioned on my call notes, there's other projects that come on in 2016, like Spectra's Gulf Markets Expansion and Rover Phase 1. And as each of those projects occurs and the supply and demand inside the basin equal out a little bit, basis should contract. So, I think we're one of the most capital-efficient companies in terms of growth. Plus, we're \u2013 given our unique portfolio of marketing contracts, I think our netbacks improve next year.","But I think a really important slide that I'd like to refer everyone to is slide eight on our website. And it's a slide that shows what our production growth has been with time plotted against the dollars of capital per incremental mcfe of production. And if you look at that, you can see consistently, really for the last five years, our capital efficiency has gotten better. If you hone in just on 2015 versus 2014 and you look at the blue line on the graph, we're getting 20% growth, but the blue line, our capital \u2013 our costs are down literally 50%. Dollars per incremental capital were 50% less in 2015 than they were in 2014 through a combination of better completion, better targeting, lower service costs.","And I really applaud Ray and the entire operations team. If you had asked me at any point in time, this time last year, where would we have been, I wouldn't have predicted we would have been able to reduce that by 50%; but it speaks to the quality of the team and the ROC in our position.","So, when you \u2013 20% growth in 2015 for $870 million CapEx is, I think, outstanding. Next year we get better pricing, but I don't think our efficiencies go to zero in 2016. I think \u2013 I'm not saying we're going to knock 50% off, but I think that you'll see significant improvement in capital efficiency when you look at 2016 versus 2015 if we're sitting here at this time next year.","So I think that's really important. And that efficiency will come from \u2013 again, where our laterals this year averaged about 6,000 feet with x stages that's in our work, you'll see us, I think, continue to migrate towards longer laterals with more stages and all of those types of things, plus we'll have a full year's worth of service contract benefit that we didn't have this year. So I think all that speaks to better performance in 2016 than in 2015.","I think there's a couple other ways to look at it as well. Ray mentioned we're going to be carrying in almost double the number of wells into 2016 that we normally would in a typical year; so almost 50 wells to 60 wells instead of 20 wells to 30 wells. So, the drilling costs are in this year. The completion \u2013 just the completion costs are in next year, so that's going to be really capital-efficient growth with that.","And I think if you look at us versus our competitors, if you look at our fourth quarter 2015 exit rate versus fourth quarter 2014, we should be growing roughly 15% fourth quarter 2015 over 2014. So we've had that continual ramp up in growth, so we're going to be entering 2016 with good growth versus a lot of our peers, who'll be flat over that same timeframe \u2013 or, in fact, some of them will be down.","So, I think all those things are important and, again, hopefully give you some things to think about in terms of how you might model 2016. We don't want to be premature. Again, would I have predicted we would have knocked 50% off of our capital efficiency and grown 20% for $870 million? I wouldn't have, but I predict Ray and the team will step up, again, big time for 2016 and you'll see good improvement in those numbers.","But I can also tell you we'll look hard as we go throughout the year at what oil and gas prices are in 2016. We'll look very hard at the returns. We just recently updated the economics and returns of all of our areas where we're spending money in the book, and we'll continue to do that. We will be very prudent with our balance sheet and will be sensitive to that. And given that, I think we're in good shape for 2016. Kind of a long answer, but an important question.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I guess a follow-on to that \u2013 maybe if you don't want to give more clarity, that's great, but the second half capital run rate of plus \u2013 a little bit under $300 million, if you were running on that run rate, can you just still \u2013 with those completion backlog, can you still kind of stay on track and hit that 20%, or 15% to 20% type growth or \u2013 I'm trying to get a sense of growth versus CapEx dollars to be able to compare with cash flow\/liquidity.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me try it at a high level and maybe Roger or Ray will chime in. You're right. I mean, we're not going to come out with specific numbers at this point in time. Again, if we would've done that last year \u2013 I've been with the company, now, 12 years or 13 years. I would have missed \u2013 every year our team has outperformed my expectations year after year. Plus, we don't want to get ahead of our board. We want to run it by them. And we want to look at prices as we get closer to the year.","That being said, I think you'll see significant improvements. Just like on page 8, you've seen year after year after year with better contracts, better netbacks; so carrying a big inventory in, exiting the year high with improved capital efficiency. So I think, again, if \u2013 in terms of growth for the dollar spent, if we aren't at the head of the class, I think we'll be near the head of the class with some of the best contracts there. And actually on page 8, our IR team has looked at all of our competitors and looked at every single company in the basin and out \u2013 peers out of the basin and, based on our work, I think we're \u2013 if we aren't one, we're two; but I think we're actually one.","Ray or Roger, do you want to add to that or no?","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think, talking about the run rate the second half of this year, we're still absolutely committed, again, to the $870 million CapEx budget that we had set, and we're still on target to deliver 20% growth for the year. So all of that has been part of our model going forward. Typically, capital budgets are always a little bit front-end-loaded, but just taking that run rate and running straight through 2016 I don't think is a good way to look at it because we'll probably ramp activity up a little bit in the first half of the next \u2013 or the first quarter, for sure, into that better pricing environment, and so forth, as we always try to do.","So I think the kind of the shape of our growth profile will be about the same as it's been most years.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But I think we're in good shape. We're going to \u2013 2015 should be a good year and, particularly, we should end strong with two new contracts kicking in, Spectra and the Mariner East. And with carrying the wells in, exiting high and with the continued improved efficiencies, we'll be sensitive to the balance sheet and to the economics; but I think we're in good shape.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","All right. Let me get back in queue. Thank you, guys.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ron","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, everybody.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jeff, I apologize for laboring the last question. Maybe I'm going to ask it slightly differently, or a different take on it. What would it take, in your view, to hold 2016 production flat? I know that's probably \u2013 with Range, that's probably a bit of an unrealistic scenario, but from a CapEx point of view, do you have a kind of ballpark? What do you think it would take to just hold the production flat from here? And I've got a follow-up, please.","Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Doug. This is Roger. Let me take a swing at it. I'll answer some of that how we've answered this question before. When you take our anticipated 2015 production times our F&D costs \u2013 and you can pick any F&D costs. It's in the appendix of the book on any of our key plays. You end up with a maintenance capital to replace our reserves of around $200 million to $220 million. So, I think that's one bookend for you \u2013 for folks to think about.","The other bookend, of course, is what Jeff just mentioned, that in 2015 we've gotten 20% growth at $870 million with anticipated additional efficiencies going into 2016 for a lot of the reasons that were just mentioned. So I think you can look at those as two bookends.","Another thing I would add is just that something a lot of folks forget about is we really have, if not the highest R\/P ratios, one of the highest R\/P ratios out there, particularly of a shale producer and \u2013 especially if you look at just the proved developed producing reserves and that ratio. So, we have a much shallower decline, which means it's a lot easier to replace production.","So I know I'm not getting to the exact number, but, like Jeff said, we don't have a micrometer for 2016 right now. But I think, hopefully, that will help you with bookending the answer.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","It does, Roger. But it kind of begs another question, I guess, which is, I suppose, an issue facing all you guys right now is that if your assets are that good, which they clearly are and with the Utica, they're probably \u2013 the portfolio shift is probably going to see an even better aggregate for the whole high-grade portfolio, if you like. Why accelerate or push the growth in this environment when, historically, your shares have been given an equal recognition for debt-adjusted growth; in other words, the shoring of the balance sheet, the strength of the balance sheet and so on, as opposed to growing the top line? I'm just \u2013 from a strategy point of view, how are you guys reconciling that? Why not wait a year and then push the growth once things sort themselves out from a commodity standpoint?","Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, again, Doug, I mean, it's not like we have a growth number and we're just not telling you. I mean, we just don't have the facts to make that decision, yet. So, in answer to your question, we've never been about growth for growth's sake. And we're not going to start now. We're going to be mindful of the forward curve. We're going to be mindful of the supply and demand balance, our optionality to drill, where the best opportunities are and the balance sheet. So, we're going to triangulate on all of those variables to come up with the right growth percentage. But at this point, it's just too early to predict on what that might be.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and I would add in a little bit. Historically \u2013 if you go back historically over the last several years, we've talked about growing 20% to 25%. And I've always \u2013 and I'm sure you've heard it, and all the people in one-on-ones, and to draw home the point I take silly examples of gases and nickel. We're not going to grow at 20%; or if gas is going to be $10 flat, we'll grow higher than 25%. But that's been kind of reasonable target. It's interesting over that timeframe, for the most part, prior to the last year, people have challenged us, why didn't we grow faster?","And we also stuck to our guns on what we thought was a reasonable and prudent plan. If you look at this year, it's very interesting. Again, we wanted to be reasonable and prudent where prices were. We cut $700 million out. And at that point, we weren't even targeting growth. We were just saying: how capital efficient could we be? The 20% fell out of that and then happened to be kind of in line with 20% to 25%, but there was really nothing magical. That's just the quality of the team and the rock.","And, again, if you had asked me, could Ray and the team, on page 8, knock 50% off of our capital efficiency from 2015 versus 2014, I wouldn't have said that last year. They did \u2013 went above and beyond, which, again, speaks to the quality of the rock and the team. We'll approach 2016 and 2017 and beyond in that same fashion.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the full answer, fellows. My follow-up is hopefully a little quicker, because we're only talking about six rigs at the end of the year. Given you're still, I guess, testing the Utica set of your portfolio mix, how should we think about allocation of those rigs as we roll into the end of the year? And I'll leave it at that. Thank you.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the Utica, like I said earlier, I think we'll have both of the first two wells online here in the next month or so into the new infrastructure, and we'll be able to produce them consistently at that point. And we're going to need to watch them for a couple of three months or so to get an idea what those wells are going to look like on an ultimate performance standpoint.","The third well will get completed sometime early in 2016. So, we'll have three wells. And one of the things I'll point out, when you couple that with some of the recent wells that have been announced around us, it really proves up our math that we've had in the book for over a year now. And I think it really helps delineate our 400,000-acre position, which is the biggest position out there. And it's going to give us a big, big lever going forward for some really capital efficient growth when the time's right.","But like Jeff and Roger have pointed out really well, I think, at this point it's just too early to know how we're going to allocate those rigs to potential Utica wells in 2016 or not. I think we'll look at the economics. We'll look at the cost. We'll look at the markets and our new transportation deals and the customers that are coming online. We'll have to look at all of those things to see how that rolls out when we present our budget to the board in December.","And then, like we've done every year, we'll continue to manage that budget as we go throughout the year and reallocate capital to the best returns. That's what we've always done and that's part of what's been able to drive our capital efficiency.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I would just point out, it's nice that the Utica stacked with the Marcellus and with the Upper Devonian. Really, the Marcellus that we're drilling will hold all of that acreage. So, in essence, it's kind of a free option on what may be the biggest and potentially the best Utica position out there, which could drive capital efficiencies in 2016 and beyond and continue to make us more capital efficient.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answer, guys. Thank you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Doug.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Wolff. Please proceed with your question from Jefferies. Jon, your line is live.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Hello. It was on mute. Good morning. How are you?","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Jon.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Few things, since I'm getting a tremendous amount of questions, maybe we could just clear up. So, number one, on \u2013 a little bit of confusion out there on Marcellus versus Utica. And my response has been that there's quite a long inventory, a very differentiated inventory, in the Marcellus that is highly capital productive and people are thinking why does Range need Utica right now. I completely understand why you want to test the potential. I guess, so just thinking about that and the high rates of the wells and the added midstream infrastructure or the takeaway from the pads, how does that sort of color your view, or is it \u2013 I assume it's a low capital item that may kick in over time.","And related to that, CONSOL reported a very strong well test in Westmoreland, which is kind of in around your acreage. Any reactions to that? But the bigger one is just the capital productivity returns at this point given your just huge Marcellus inventory. How do the two compete, and how do you think about that?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me start, and Ray or Roger might chime in. You know, we agree. I mean, the low-risk, high-quality, strong return is the Marcellus. That's where we're focused and that's where \u2013 95% of our capital is going into that. It's important, we think, to drill a few wells, and we picked three to give us a feel for what the Utica could be; plus, like Ray said, it's encouraging with the well in Westmoreland County and the ETP well.","Actually, you can see it on our website. I think they're still up there. Bill Zagorski did a presentation with SunTrust that's much more detailed in terms of the Utica. And you can see where those wells are and how they delineate our acreage and help de-risk our acreage. And again, being stacked pay is important. We're getting some phenomena right now. Some of the strongest returns we have are in the dry Marcellus, but the takeaway for the dry Marcellus could be used at some point for dry Utica. And so all that stuff kind of stacks together. The wells we're drilling are off of existing Marcellus pads with Marcellus roads. It's the same team. We've already paid for the acreage. It's already held by the Marcellus. So it's kind of an option.","So we'll stay focused on the Marcellus, but to the extent we learn more about the Utica and to the extent the Utica economics ultimately compete with the Marcellus, then you may see us allocate some capital there in a very disciplined way in order to maximize our returns and to \u2013 as we go forward.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Jon. I mean, one of the things that we're considering is \u2013 the Utica we're three wells into this, or two-and-a-half wells into it if you want to say that that way right now, and we're \u2013 a couple of things we need to understand is the production characteristics of the well and what we believe the cost can get down to. And so far, everything is meeting our expectations that's not exceeding our expectations.","We still believe we can get the costs down, and we still believe the wells are going to perform. And, clearly, with the Westmoreland County well from CNX and the EQT well, which I'll be the first to congratulate both of them, those are monster wells. But we really believe that just helps prove up what we've been saying for a year or so now, that this is going to be a great lever for Range to push going forward. And when you start thinking about the gas markets three years, four years, five years out, that's where we really see the Utica being highly potential for us.","Like Jeff said, we're holding all the acreage with the Marcellus wells. That's where our best returns are. Some of those Marcellus wells, there's probably nothing in the world that's going to compete with them. They're just that good.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But if the Utica ever does, even in the shorter term, we'll just allocate a little bit of the capital there.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","You'll see us work it in...","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, from a land perspective, any one well (46:55) one horizon holds all of it so...","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Right. Right. I'm just \u2013 just wanted (47:02) \u2013 yeah.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","(47:03) Okay, Jon.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Is the messaging really that \u2013 I mean, is this going to be potentially a 10% capital item next year? I would assume less than that. I mean...","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's too early to say.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I know we're driving you guys crazy a little bit. We think about those things hard, but we actually try to factor in the most recent data as we go into the year and most prudently allocate capital to where it's best for the company.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's fair. And on the Westmoreland results just on a closeology basis, or however you want to think about it, what does that tell you about some of your more eastern acreage?","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, if you \u2013 like Jeff said, if you look at on our website, there's a presentation that Bill Zagorski made at a SunTrust conference. And on page five, there's a great map and has that well and the recent EQT well highlighted. And if you look at the map, it fits right in with what we've said all along. And if you see the outlines on the map, you'll see we've got a considerable amount of acreage offsetting both those wells. So, again, it helps just prove up what we've been saying for some amount of time. We've got 400,000 acres that we think is highly prospective. And as time is going forward, it's just getting better and better.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We probably have the largest position, and the good news is it's stacked right underneath our high-quality Marcellus. And there's still good Upper Devonian on top of it. Yeah, it all helps.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Two more quick ones on \u2013 I think I get the concept around the weak NGL realization in the field, like you had to deal with other ways to evacuate, like rail, which we're hearing $0.25 to $0.30 cost. Obviously, it's transitory for Range, but is that \u2013 I know you got some sales into Marcus Hook, but I imagine it was a small number. As you \u2013 as the Mariner East gets commissioned, my guess is that that $0.25 falls to something less than $0.10. Is that fair?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'd answer it this way. It's \u2013 again, we have \u2013 we're the only producer that has a position on Mariner East I, and we have 40,000 barrels per day, 20,000 barrels per day of propane, 20,000 barrels per day of ethane. The 20,000 barrels per day of propane covers basically all of our propane production. And we've said, and we still believe, when you consider \u2013 take Mariner East, Mariner West, and our whole portfolio, once that's up and running, and Sonoco is still saying end of the third quarter, a little commissioning, so call it early fourth quarter, on an annualized basis, it's about a $90 million uplift for us net of transportation; about half of that is savings on the transportation side on propane. So, hopefully, that's enough clarity into what that looks like.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. And last one on the \u2013 yeah. Go ahead.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, and, again, don't forget Spectra. That's August 1 of this year. So, that's like next week, the 200 million cubic feet a day. That takes a huge portion of our production out of M2 into a better market and we've hedged that uplift, which is \u2013 it will be a nice uplift for us. And again, we have \u2013 we're an anchor shipper. We have a huge part of the volume on that project, 200 million cubic feet per day.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Right. Last one. When I saw you last time, you talked about there being at least a small arb between Mont Belvieu to Europe, or rather versus \u2013 Mont Belvieu to Europe versus Marcus Hook to Europe. Do you feel good about being able to at least market those propane barrels overseas?","Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development","Yeah. John, this is...","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Just in terms of liquidity?","Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development","This is Chad Stephens. Yeah. One of things we're excited about is the ability to take advantage of any available arbs. To date, we've been selling the propane on what they call handy ships, very inefficient loading, less barrels. You've got to use more ships. Transportation costs are higher.","Once Mariner East is in service, we'll be loading VLGC ships, about 500,000 barrels per ship, and we'll be taking advantage of the arb between Rotterdam, the ARA Rotterdam Index, South America, Mont Belvieu, and the FEI Index in Asia. And that's both \u2013 you can take advantage of either lower transportation costs and\/or better index prices as you play those arbs around the world. And so, we're real excited about the ability to do that.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And we think we'll get better pricing. The $90 million does not include any uplift on pricing. That's just counting the transportation savings and the other contracts. So it could be better than that, and we expect that it will be better than that.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Got it. I had one more, but I forgot it. So that was long enough. Thanks so much for the color.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Blaise Angelico of IBERIA for our final question.","Blaise Matthew Angelico - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Blaise Matthew Angelico - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Just one quick thing. Can you talk about well costs and where service prices are trending? Do you see any additional relief coming over the balance of the year? And then, second, I know you don't have long-term service contracts in place. Do you maybe step in now and lock in that lower service cost with long-term contracts? Just kind of curious as to how you guys are thinking about all of these given the macro environment.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, great question, Blaise. The service costs have clearly come down a lot this year. And like I said in my prepared remarks at the beginning of the call, on an apples-to-apples basis, when you look at what we've seen the first half of this year compared to the second half of last year, and you just pick Southwest PA, for instance \u2013 some areas are more, some are less, but just pick Southwest PA. We're 25% or more less total well cost. And that's a range of all sorts of things: less cost for the drilling rigs, frac costs coming down, directional drillers, all of that sort of thing. And we are still seeing some of those prices come down because, like Jeff said in his remarks at the beginning, the rig counts are down in the Utica by 66%. They're down in the Marcellus by, what, over 50%; I think close to 55% now. The other basins are seeing the same kind of thing.","So there's a lot of competition out there. The service providers are having to really pick the people they want to work for and really having to hammer down on their suppliers. So, you're seeing this continual bump down of lower cost, going all the way down into things like steel and proppants and guar gum for friction reducing \u2013 all those sort of chemicals and everything else are getting cheaper.","So I think it would be pretty aggressive \u2013 probably too aggressive to think that we're going to see as much of a decrease as we've seen so far, but I do think we'll see more as all of this tries to settle out at some level of constant activity. I think because of our kind of well-planned and disciplined approach and the way we try to really focus on utilization of the frac crews and so forth, that gives us a leg up. And the fact that we didn't have any long-term contracts was a big advantage to the team. I think it's still a big advantage to the team.","We're much more a believer, philosophically, in long-term relationships rather than long-term contracts, because we really try to make it a win-win relationship with our service providers. And when you \u2013 I think we're living proof of the fact that that's allowed us as a company to attract some of the best pricing and some of the lowest well cost. And all that translates into the best capital efficiency, I think, in the basin. So that's our philosophy going forward.","I think the other thing you'll see going into 2016 is we'll have a full year of these price reductions, which will really help our capital efficiency. So, I don't know that \u2013 we'll probably still see some decrease here and there, but the fact that we'll be able to apply what we've seen thus far to a full year is really what's going to help us next year, plus the fact that we have a bigger inventory. We got better contracts. We got Mariner East up and running. We got Spectra Uniontown to Gas City. We got Rover and the Gulf expansion coming on late next year. All of those things that we've been talking about on the call are really going to help set 2016 up very, very well.","Blaise Matthew Angelico - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Appreciate the color, guys.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his closing remarks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The first half of 2015 has been challenging for Range and our industry. The good news for Range is that we have two significant marketing events that are projected to commence in the second half of the year, which are Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City project and Mariner East I. Combined, they should result in a significant increase to our netback price we receive for our gas, ethane and propane. We're on track to spend approximately $700 million less in 2015 than 2014 and grow our production volumes 20%.","We believe that we'll have the most capital efficient growth versus any of our Appalachian peers on a corporate basis. Importantly, with our 1.6 million acre of stacked pay potential in the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian, we have the option to drill dry, wet gas or super-rich acreage since about 900,000 net acres are dry and the rest is split between wet and super-rich.","In essence, this gives us a portfolio within our portfolio. Coupling this resource base with our capital discipline and diversified portfolio of marketing arrangements, which gives us multiple options that are our competitors do not have, Range is positioned to create value as we move forward into an expected better market that balances supply, demand and infrastructure.","Thanks for participating on the call.

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are statements forward-looking. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Rodney L. Waller","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported outstanding results for the first quarter with a continued increase in production and a decrease in unit cost. Both earnings and cash flow per share results were greater than First Call consensus.","Our speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Range has filed our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It's now available on the homepage of our website or you can access it using the EDGAR system. In addition, we posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today. We've also added tables which will guide you in modeling our future realized prices for natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. Detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter is also included on the website.","Now let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thank you, Rodney. I'll begin with an overview of the company. Ray will follow with an operations update and Roger will be next with a discussion of our financial position, then we'll open it up for Q&A. ","Range is on track to achieve the targets that we've set for 2012. We're on track to grow production 30% to 35% year-over-year, exit the Marcellus at our goal of 600 million cubic feet per day net and to grow liquids production 40% year-over-year. We're also making good progress in all 5 of our enhancement areas, which are the super-rich Marcellus, super-rich Upper Devonian, wet Utica, horizontal Mississippian oil play and Cline Shale oil play. Ray will give more details on all 5 projects in his talk.","Financially, we're also in good shape and making good progress as well. During the quarter, Range continued to lower its cost structure. On the units of production basis, our company's 5 largest cost categories fell by 6% in aggregate compared to the prior-year period. Our natural gas hedge position is excellent for 2012. We're 75% hedged to the floor price of $4.45 per Mmbtu. We recently completed our bank redetermination and reaffirmed our borrowing base under the bank credit facility at $2 billion and increased our commitment amount to $1.75 billion. We have no debt maturities until 2016 under our bank facility and 2017 for our notes.","I want to highlight the great job that Roger and his team did on the recent $600 million bond offering, which resulted in the lowest interest rate ever by BB-rated company in any industry. We issued the notes at a fixed rate of 5% for 10.5 years. ","Most importantly, in today's environment of low natural gas price and high oil price, all of Range's key projects generate attractive rates of return. 75% of our 2012 capital is going into liquids-rich projects, almost all of which is wet or super-rich Marcellus or the horizontal Mississippian oil play. The rates of return on these projects range from about 70% to 100% at strip pricing. Almost all of the remaining drilling capital is going into the Northeast Marcellus, where the rate of return is in the mid-20% to low 30%. We'll be decreasing our rig count in the Northeast to roughly 1 rig by the end of this year and refocus more of our capital into the higher-return areas.","Historically, it was important to be in the core part of a particular play. Given the disparity in oil and natural gas prices, it's now not only important to be in the core part, but you've got to be in the wet core. Also, not all the plays are created equal. Some plays don't have wet cores or wet areas at all. Other plays do, but are higher cost and lower return. Fortunately, Range has a huge acreage position in the wet part of the core at one of the best rate of return plays in the U.S., which is the southwest part of the Marcellus.","We also have a large position in what we believe is the core of the horizontal Mississippian oil play in Oklahoma and Southern Kansas. This is one of the highest rate of return plays in the U.S. Plus, we have tremendous upside in the super-rich and wet Upper Devonian, wet Utica and the Cline Shale oil play.","Including only our 5 enhancement areas, we have about 800,000 net acres in the liquids-rich portfolio -- in our liquids-rich portfolio that are prospective for wet gas, super-rich gas or oil.","Differentiation between companies at this point in our industry is key. The key question is, which companies can make good returns in today's price environment? At Range, we expect to drive up production and reserves per share on a debt-adjusted basis for years to come, with strong returns and low cost even in today's commodity price environment. We'll do so while staying focused on safety and being good stewards of the environment.","At the IPAA Conference in New York last week, there was a lot of interest in Range from fund managers and analysts. Some of the feedback that I heard from the meetings was that in this environment, investors are seeking E&P stocks that offer both significant downside protection and significant upside per share, and Range is one of them. That's great feedback to hear in any environment, and we're proud to have earned that trust.","I'll turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.","Ray N. Walker","Thanks, Jeff. My comments today will cover several topics. I'll talk about cost, efficiencies, well performance, production guidance and give some operations updates from our divisions.","Like Jeff said, we're off to an excellent start to meet our production growth targets in 2012. Our plan to shift more of our resources and capital investment to liquids-rich and oil projects is on schedule, and we can see this already beginning to pay off.","As we stated in our earnings release, the first quarter production came in at 655-point (sic) [655.5] million cubic feet equivalent per day, which was comprised of 512.5 million gas, 17,152 barrels of NGLs and 6,682 barrels of oil and condensates.","I think it's also important to characterize the types of production specifically. While we do produce a lot of gas, I don't think most folks realize that 71% of our total production is coming from our liquids-rich and oil plays. All of that rich gas has significant Btu and liquids upgrades and, therefore, has significantly more value than the dry gas.","We had only 29% of our total production coming from dry gas areas in the first quarter. For example, looking at Slide 19 of our investor presentation on the website, which focuses on Southwest PA and not considering hedging, we would simplistically say that we're getting 3.2x the realized price for our wet gas versus our dry gas in Southwest PA. Again, the largest portion of our gas production is rich gas, with significant Btu and liquids upgrades from our liquids-rich and oil areas.","While this year approximately 25% of our capital budget is directed to the dry gas areas of our portfolio, if the current commodity price environment persists, you will see us cut our spending in the dry gas areas significantly at the end of this year once we've completed the majority of our HBP drilling in Northeast Pennsylvania.","Production guidance for the second quarter is 715 million cubic feet equivalent per day net comprised of 6,000 barrels of oil, 18,500 barrels of NGLs and 568 million cubic feet per day of gas.","In order to answer a few questions in advance that you would logically have, the liquids gross that we have projected for the year is heavily weighted towards the third and fourth quarter as it simply takes time for the new drilling in the liquids-rich and oil areas to kick in. You should expect to see the different components growing at different rates throughout this year.","In fact, you may notice that the oil rate for the second quarter is actually less than the first quarter. It's basically a result of timing for new wells and infrastructure coming online throughout the year. These fluctuations are simply necessary for all the advanced planning for our drilling program and infrastructure development that is underway.","In the Marcellus, we brought online some great wells in the first quarter. For example, sales from the 10-well pad in the wet area which had a working interest of 97% and an NRI of 82.4%, began in the middle of March. Initial production from that pad was approximately 30 million a day equivalent from 2 wells. However, the wells were constrained due to equipment limitations. Six days later after installing additional equipment, the rate off the pad was increased to 45 million a day from just 3 of those 10 wells. This flow period lasted about 28 days.","After changing equipment at the compressor station, production from the same pad was ramped up to approximately 75 million per day. This rate has been steady for 4 days. And at present, a total of 7 wells out of the 10 wells are producing, with the other 3 wells still setting in as we are still capacity-constrained to 75 million.","The average lateral length for these wells is 2,763 feet with an average of 10 frac stages each. And none of the wells have reduced cluster spacing completions. Again, reduced cluster spacing is simply a technique utilizing clusters of perforations that are placed closer together on the lateral. I'll refer to the reduced cluster spacing technique as RCS throughout the rest of my remarks.","This 10-well pad in the wet area of the Marcellus was a great example of our engineering and operating teams recognizing the potential production volumes and, in very short order, eliminating constraints in order to produce the additional volumes. These particular wells are also much better than the offsets, due to some reservoir and rock properties analysis that our team has come up with to determine the best target for the horizontal lateral in the Marcellus.","At no additional cost and by simply landing the lateral in a different part of the Marcellus, we achieved greatly enhanced production performance. As we combine this technique, along with RCS techniques, moderately longer laterals and increased conductivity frac designs, we expect to see continued improvement in capital efficiency and well performance going forward.","Shifting to Northeast Pennsylvania. In Lycoming County, we recently brought online 4 new horizontal wells that produce the sales at 24 IPs, up 26 million, 23 million, 21 million and 18 million a day, respectively. Those wells had an average lateral length of 3,000 foot and 10 stages and were 100% working interest in approximately 85% NRI wells.","As you can see, our technical teams are continuing to make great progress in enhancing our well performance in this area. We plan to bring online 45 more wells in this area in 2012. And again, like Jeff said, we'll decrease activity to the 1 to 1.5 rig level at year end as we HBP the majority of that acreage with this year's drilling program.","Now let me spend just a few minutes on cost and efficiency improvements. Our operating and technical teams in all the divisions continue to do a great job in driving down unit cost. Our LOE for the first quarter was $0.48 per mcfe, and we continue to see progress in that area. Roger will be giving guidance for the second quarter LOE in just a few minutes. ","As important as making improvements in cost and well performance, we are also making great improvements in operational efficiency. Significant gains in efficiencies will serve us well as we continue to learn to do more with less, especially in this gas price environment.","Year-over-year 2011 versus 2010, we saw drilling efficiency improvement in our Southern Marcellus operations of up to 50%. We drilled 34% more horizontal wells in 2011 with 11% fewer rigs. That's a huge improvement in anyone's book. On the completion side, we saw equally impressive metrics when comparing 2011 to 2010.","In 2011, we saw a 53% increase in frac efficiency compared to 2010. The improvement was a result of our key performance indicator process which focuses on equipment and location personnel. It simply utilizes GAAP identification to identify opportunities to work faster and smarter. This 53% improvement in frac efficiency translates to a 12% composite average of savings in our overall completion cost. ","We're also seeing very good improvement in service pricing. As an example, recently renegotiated frac contracts are expected to translate to a 4% to 5% improvement in total well cost and will literally save us millions of dollars going forward. We are really proud of those operating teams. These efficiency and cost improvements are truly great accomplishments that will play a significant role in maintaining and improving our low-cost structure while enabling improved capital efficiency going forward.","Now some updates from our liquid-rich and oil areas. We just brought online our first 3, 2012 super-rich Marcellus wells. And while it's way too early to talk about rates, the wells appear to be meeting our expectations. For some very recent and very noteworthy news, flowback operations on one of the wet area wells located on the 3-well pad just at the edge or the border between the super-rich and the wet area began just last week. We announced in our press release that the peak 24-hour production from that well, which has 100% working interest and 84% NRI, was 7.1 million cubic feet of gas, 108 barrels of condensate and 501 barrels of NGLs, not including ethane. If we were extracting ethane, that would translate to 6 million of gas and over 1,300 barrels per day of liquids. The well's lateral length is 2,752 feet, and it was completed with 14 stages using the RCS method and the new targeting of the lateral. The production from the well is approximately 1,340 Btu gas, which again puts it right in the edge of the super-rich area. ","In fact, the well has gotten even better as we've opened it up. I just got a report this morning and for the last 24 hours, the well made 168 barrels of condensate, 578 barrels of NGLs and 8.1 million of gas. That's almost 750 barrels of liquids not counting ethane. If we counted ethane, it would be 1,547 barrels of liquids with 7 million cubic feet of gas. This well certainly bodes well for the super-rich area potential. And based on this well's initial results, we believe the new targeting methods and the RCS-style completions could significantly improve performance in both the wet and super-rich areas.","We now have 7 rigs running in super-rich Marcellus and expect to have approximately 15 new wells in that area online in the second quarter. As we progress throughout the year, we plan to keep you updated quarter-by-quarter with results from this area.","According to our current development schedule, which is always changing and adapting, there will be approximately 50 more wells brought online this year in the super-rich Marcellus during the third and fourth quarter. This means that as of today, our plans are now to bring online approximately 65 wells in the super-rich Marcellus in 2012.","In addition to the 28 wells brought online during the first quarter in the wet Marcellus area, there are approximately 50 more wells planned to come online in the wet area during the next 3 quarters. And of course, there will be a handful of delineation and commitment wells drilled in other areas of Southwest PA throughout the year.","We're just getting started in the super-rich Upper Devonian Shale and have now frac-ed our first well and are literally commencing flowback operations as we speak. We're also currently drilling the second well. We have rotary sidewall cores in 2 super-rich Upper Devonian wells. And although we've not completed these wells yet, I'll give you some preliminary observations.","We see TOCs of up to 11%, cross fees up to 8% and permeability measuring all the way up to 700 nanodarcies. For those without ready reference to the technical data for comparison or, in simpler terms in English, this is very encouraging.","In addition, we saw the best mud loss shows [ph] that we've seen today across any Upper Devonian Shale. Now here's some really technical terms. One set of the cores was oozing condensate and the other cores from the other well were dripping condensate. Needless to say, everything we see today supports our hypothesis that the super-rich Upper Devonian could be a very nice liquids-rich play.","Shifting to the horizontal Mississippian oil play in Oklahoma, we now have 2 rigs running and have brought online our first 2 new wells. The average IP of those wells is 525 BOE per day, which is 320 barrels of oil, 117 barrels of NGLs and 530 mcf of gas. And although still very early, they are well above our performance expectations. These wells had an average lateral length of 2,700 feet and 15 stages with 100% working interest and 81.5% NRIs. We've also increased our acreage position to about 145,000 net acres. ","As it's still early in this play, and as we continue to closely watch our results, it's part of our overall goal to continue to shift our focus towards a very high rate of return projects across the company, and this is surely one of those. The infrastructure, both midstream and saltwater disposal, were coming together nicely. And we are on schedule to significantly ramp up production from this area as we move into next year.","Our technical team also continues to gather data and monitor activity in the wet Utica area of Northwest PA. Namely, we appear to be right on strike with several great wells that have been released recently by other companies. Offset leasing activity and drilling plans announced to offset operators that are all confirmation of a potential liquids-rich play. Proprietary log and core data that we've recently obtained continues to support that this area is highly perspective for liquids-rich and condensate production.","We feel our 190,000 net acres, which is primarily HBP-ed, is positioned well and we're still on track to drill our first wet Utica well this summer. We now plan to also drill a second well later in the year that you can now see located on our updated investor presentation map of the Utica wet area.","The Cline oil horizontal play at Conger is really picking up steam. We'll be moving a rig in this quarter to begin drilling 3 wells across that acreage. Devon has permitted 3 wells, directly offsetting our lease line to the East, is now illustrated in our investor presentation. One of those wells is just 2.5 miles from our lease line and the other operators in the area have 4 rigs running.","The IP of the second Cline well was 484 BOE per day, with 282 barrels of oil, 123 barrels of NGLs and 476 mcf of gas. And it was completed with 11 and 16 successful frac stages, with a lateral length of approximately 4,500 feet. The first well was also about 4,500 feet of lateral and had 7 of 10 stages successfully completed.","As you can tell, we're still learning and optimizing. Even though neither of these completions was 100% successfully completed, the results still fit right in line with our expectations. And as we test the acreage with different targets, lateral lengths, different completion designs, we believe our technical team can significantly improve results going forward. All of this information will be helpful in derisking our 100,000 net acre position which, again, is 90% HBP. ","Another point to make here, as well as in any area of horizontal development, is to compare apples-to-apples when talking about production performance from differing lateral lengths and number of stages per lateral. As always, what we do here at Range is continue to optimize lateral lengths and number of stages to obtain the best rate of return from the project. What we really compare when looking at different well designs is the resulting return on investment.","Our technical team has continued to do an outstanding job with their legacy stock-pay assets. In addition to the Cline Shale, the Permian team recently completed its second vertical Wolfberry well on our Conger field properties at an initial production rate to sales of 517 BOE per day, which was 212 barrels of oil, 144 barrels of NGLs and 969 mcf of gas. The first Wolfberry well had an initial production rate to sales of 495 BOE per day, which was 195 barrels of oil, 141 barrels of NGLs and 954 mcf of gas. These wells are 100% working interest and 75% NRI, with approximately 1,200 feet of stacked pay and were completed with 11 and 12 stages. The average 90-day production to sales for the first well was 204 BOE per day, which again, was 59 barrels of oil, 83 barrels of NGLs and 372 mcf of gas.","Range has the potential for an additional 100 to 150 vertical Wolfberry locations on 40-acre spacing at Conger. I should point out that some operators in the area are discussing the potential of, and some are already drilling, on 20-acre spacing. And we could certainly see that same potential here. As confirmation of the potential here, I'll also point out, that there are 33 rigs in the area drilling Wolfberry wells. ","We plan to drill 2 additional vertical Wolfberry wells this summer, while we have the rig out there drilling the Cline wells. We'll drill one vertical Wolfberry then the 3 horizontal Cline wells and then finish with the second vertical Wolfberry well.","Infrastructure, transportation and marketing are all on-track for all products in all areas. We currently believe we have plenty of firm transportation, plenty of sales and along with plans to keep our gathering, compression and processing capacity well out in front of our liquids-rich developments into the future. As much as our drilling results are a testament to our technical teams, I'm also really proud of their progress in the areas of safety and environmental protection.","We continue to make improvements in handling our fluids across all of our operations. For 2011, our spill rate when handling produced water, flowback water or oil and condensate was 0.0025%, or more simply said, 25\/10000 of 1%. While still not 0, which is our constant goal, this is indeed an accomplishment to be proud of. In fact, we've already seen a 17% improvement in that statistic during the first quarter versus a year ago. Our teams are absolutely committed to and will never be satisfied until we get the 0 spills going forward. ","At the same time, we achieved a 50% reduction in recordable incidents during the first quarter, along with a 60% reduction in days-away restricted and transferred instance, or what we used to call loss-time incidents. ","Our total recordable incident rate was a 0.76, which is well below our 2011 peer group average of 0.99. As always, we strive for no incidents, and we surely never want anyone to be hurt or injured. But we are very proud of the way our teams have continued their focus on safety and environmental protection, and are today maintaining a culture throughout the organization that truly supports one of our primary core values at Range.","All in all, we had a great first quarter and we're well-positioned for the future. Our employees continue to do a great job, and our shift over the past couple of years to liquids and oil plays is really beginning to pay off. Our already low-cost structure is steadily improving and we are continuing to recognize improving efficiencies along with improving well performance. We are right on track to meet our goals, and we plan to continue to deliver what we say we will. ","Now over to Roger.","Roger S. Manny","Thank you, Ray. Like last quarter, I'll start with the balance sheet and then work over to the income statement. ","Range strengthened its balance sheet in the first quarter through 3 actions, designed to bolster liquidity and reduce risk.","First, in February we issued $600 million of 5%, 10.5-year, no co-fi [ph] senior subordinated notes. Proceeds were used to repay bank debt and prefund a portion of our 2012 drilling program, with $123 million in cash on hand left at the end of the first quarter. These long-term fixed-rate notes helped insulate Range from the interest rate volatility and better match the average life of our assets to the liabilities that fund them.","Second, in March, we requested, and in April, received, a reaffirmation of our $2 billion bank credit facility borrowing base. And we increased the credit facility amount commitment from $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion. Lastly, we added 3 new North American banks to the credit facility. The addition of the 3 new banks, combined with the refinancing of floating rate short-term bank debt with long-term fixed rate notes, lessens our balance sheet risk, while the increase in the commitment amount increases our liquidity.","Turning to income statement. Cash flow for the first quarter was $163 million, roughly equal to the first quarter of last year. Cash flow per share was $1.02, $0.05 per share over analyst consensus estimates. EBITDAX for the first quarter was $198 million, also roughly equal to last year's figure. Cash margin for the quarter was $2.68 per mcfe, 19% lower than last year due to declining prices, outpacing declining cash expenses. The earnings calculated using analyst methodology were $24 million or $0.15 per share, that's $0.02 above analyst consensus estimates. Our website contains full reconciliations for these non-GAAP figures to GAAP, in addition to several supplemental tables breaking out results from Barnett discontinued operations.","Moving to the expense categories and second quarter guidance figures, we're pleased to report another quarter of reduced unit cost expenses. Direct operating cost, including workovers, was $0.48 per mcfe, 36% lower than last year's first quarter figure of $0.75 due to reductions in water handling cost, low service cost and equipment rentals. Operating cost also benefited from unseasonably mild winter weather. We expect unit cost operating expense to be in the $0.51 to $0.53 range for the second quarter of this year as we have scheduled some extended equipment rentals to bring on several new multi-well pads. Third-party transportation, gathering and compression expense is now broken out on a separate line item as opposed to netting the expense against revenue.","On a unit cost basis, transportation gathering and compression expense was $0.68 in the first quarter, up from $0.56 last year. It came in slightly over guidance on this item in the first quarter due to some prior-period adjustments. Second quarter expenses should be approximately $0.63 per mcfe. ","The DD&A rate for the first quarter was $1.68 an mcfe, that's $0.03 higher than 2011's first quarter due to the Barnett assets being held for sale last year. The DD&A rate may fluctuate a few cents up or down with production mix during the next quarter.  And a more significant downward change should occur later this year as we reevaluate our proven reserves.","The first quarter marks the debut of the Pennsylvania impact fee, which we are combining with the production tax and as one tax line on the income statement.","The character of the impact fee is somewhat different than traditional production taxes in that the primary driver of the fee is the number and timing of wells drilled. There's not yet a clear consensus among companies and accounting firms regarding the best way to account for the Pennsylvania impact fee. Therefore, you may observe differences in how the fee is recorded by other companies, and you may see differences in how Range presents the fee in future periods to conform to industry norms.","But in the meantime, we'll be providing quarterly guidance for the Pennsylvania impact fee on an absolute dollar basis. And production tax guidance for the non-Pennsylvania production on a unit cost basis spread across total company production.","The $24 million retroactive impact fee component for wells drilled prior to 2012 that we mentioned on the last earnings call is passing through the first quarter of 2012 as a special item. There's also a $6.2 million current year impact fee provision representing the first quarter accrual for wells drilled so far in 2012 and the carryover from wells drilled in prior periods. ","First quarter production and ad valorem taxes for the company's non-Pennsylvania properties totals $0.11 per mcfe. Now in the second quarter, based on currently projected drilling, we anticipate the Pennsylvania impact fee will be approximately $6 million. Total company production and severance taxes for the second quarter are expected to be $0.12 per mcfe plus the $6 million impact fee.","G&A expense adjusted for noncash stock compensation and other recurring items for the first quarter was $0.50 an mcfe, $0.05 below last year. Unit cost G&A in the first quarter benefited from a nonrecurring expense offset of $0.03 an mcfe. So we expect second quarter G&A expense to be in the $0.52 to $0.54 per mcfe range.","Interest expense for the first quarter was $0.62 an mcfe, down considerably from the $0.73 figure last year when our leverage peaked just before the Barnett sale. And due to the new fixed-rate notes bearing higher interest cost in the current closing rate bank debt, we anticipate second quarter interest expense to come in right around $0.66 an mcfe.","First quarter exploration expense, excluding noncash compensation, was $21 million, $5 million below last year due to the timing of our seismic expenditures. The second quarter should see exploration expense between $23 million and $25 million, due to increased seismic spending that was originally slated to occur in the first quarter. Please remember that Range does not capitalize any of its exploratory or developmental seismic expense. ","Unproved property and abandonment and impairment for the first quarter came in at $20 million. That's up $3 million from last year. Second quarter unproved property impairment is expected to be between $20 million and $22 million. ","As Jeff mentioned at the opening, approximately 75% of our 2012 natural gas production is hedged at a floor price of $4.45 an Mmbtu. Also we swap additional 2013 natural gas volumes during the quarter, bringing our 2013 natural gas hedged volume to 343 million per day at a floor price of $4.41 an Mmbtu. We increased our 2012 NGL hedges to 12,000 barrels per day at a price of $96.28 per barrel. A summary of all of our hedge positions appears in the press release tables, and full hedging detail may be found on our website.  ","The first quarter saw continued improvement in our cost structure and balance sheet, with available liquidity at a record high. While everything is on track for the year, because of the timing of leasehold expenditures, the first half of 2012 we'll see a front loading of capital spending, while the back half of 2012, we'll see stronger production growth.","In summary, despite significantly lower natural gas prices in this year's first quarter, we kept cash flow even with last year while hitting all our marks on the operating side.","Jeff, back over to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Mr. Singer, are you there?","[Technical Difficulty]","Our next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond from Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","You spent $75 million on land this quarter. Is that onetime in nature? Or could that bias total CapEx higher throughout the year? And then how is that allocated? Was that all in the misc line?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","No, on capital, we're confident we'll stick to the $1.6 billion for the year. So we'll be at that number, along with the 30% to 35% production growth and 40% increase in liquids. So we're on track there. That land is all targeted, either towards the wet or super-rich part of the Marcellus. Of course, that stacks with the wet and super-rich part of the upper Devonian or the Mississippian. So that's where we're spending all of our money.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then with the announcement of your prolific vertical Wolfberry wells, would you consider reallocating additional capital to that play this year? And then how did the economics in that play compete with some of your other areas?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, I mean, it's been good news. The team did a really good job of coming up with an opportunity. And I'm going to step back for a minute, I think a lot of what you see, it's typical across our areas. We get in the areas that have stacked pays, rich hydrocarbon charge and really good technical teams working in those areas. And what that allows is for opportunities year after year after year, because those guys figure out new things and new ways to increase recovery factor. So that's very typical of the Range portfolio. It's a great opportunity, the wells are performing strongly. In fact, if you compare them against other operators and other analogous production out there you'll see -- granted it's just the first 2 wells, but they compare very favorably. The rates of return looks strong. We were actually debating whether to do more on this call and decided to wait maybe another quarter, maybe do them on the second quarter, but they're strong rates of return. We'll drill a couple more wells this year. Like Ray said, it's an exciting opportunity, 100 to 150 locations at 40-acre spacing. I feel comfortable in time, it's probably more likely will be double that because it's more likely 20s or lower spacing, given the fixed section and high amount of hydrocarbon in place. But I think we'll stay on track. That's an exciting opportunity, but the Cline is equally exciting in that the Cline covers the entire 100,000-acre position. At 50-acre spacing, that's potentially 2,000 wells. And you can see knowledgeable Permian players all around us are now targeting and drilling it. So the more we understand and unlock the Cline, both are great opportunities, the Cline just has a lot more  running room.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then one final question, which is you addressed in your prepared remarks the decline in oil volumes from Q1 to Q2 based on your guidance. Can you put a little more color around some of these infrastructure constraints that are leading to that?","Ray N. Walker","Yes, and that's a good question. Basically, it's just an artifact of wells coming online and timing with the infrastructure that's being planned. I mean, like we talked about in the last quarter, a lot of these projects we've been working on for a couple of years and part of that is putting together midstream deals and things like that. And so to make a long story short, it really is just an artifact of the point that even though we're bringing out some of the new horizontal Mississippian oil wells, they're just not coming online. And we're just not going to see a lot of that increase in production until we get into the third and fourth quarter. And a lot of that is going to be driven by the increased amount of activity that we've got in the wet and super-rich Marcellus area. And that stuff is just simply artifact of the wells coming online. So what you're seeing is the wells are going online in the first quarter just naturally declining off, and we're just not adding that many wells in the second quarter.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","The important point though is we're still on track for 40% year-over-year growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Couple of questions. First, on the -- with regards to your reduced cluster spacing, can you just talk about how widely you expect to use that across your Marcellus acreage? And then what that does in terms of well cost relative to your standard completion?","Ray N. Walker","Great question, Brian. The reduced cluster spacing is a technique -- it's really 1 of 4 different things that we're working on right now. There's reduced cluster spacing. There's going to moderately longer laterals. There's increased conductivity frac designs, which is simply putting more higher conductivity fractures that potentially could be smaller jobs pumped and then better targeting of the lateral in the rock. And so it's -- we very seldom, as much as we would want to, just try one of those things at a time. You really -- never really get that opportunity to do that. So it's really hard to say that a certain amount of cost increase is associated with RCS versus smaller frac jobs because we'll be combining all of those going forward. And the answer is yes, it does cost more to put the perforations closer together because we're doing more of it. And it does cost more to do more frac jobs along the lateral. And in some cases, if we're steering the well a little more, it may cost more to steer the well while we're drilling. But what we're really focused on, like I said in my prepared remarks, is when we get to the production results looking at the return on investment of all those various combinations. And with the -- we got 7 rigs running in the super-rich today, we'll be adding a lot of data to analyze over the next coming months and quarters. So I think, really, we'll have a good feel for how all of those things affect our results going forward. But the important thing is everything we've done today says that we're getting better results. But I'm reluctant at this point because it's so early to tell you that a certain amount is attributed to RCS versus lower laterals or whatever else we're doing.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I'd just like to add on to what Ray said. I think the important part is if you look at the economics we put for the Southwest PA and wet Marcellus under strip pricing or what's out there on the website, that generates a 73% rate of return. And we're -- the actual economics, and that doesn't incorporate all the things that Ray are saying. So there's a chance as good as 70% -- 73% is that can get better. Same thing when we announced the 8 wells in the super-rich originally, and that's the economics set on our website that you can look at. They're actually even better. They went up to a 95% rate of return at the strip pricing that's on the slide there. But there's a chance you can enhance that because we did not apply all those things to either of those. So as good as it is, the opportunity exists that the economics could be really enhanced in both areas.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And do you expect that -- given that these wells are producing at twice the initial rates, do you expect a normal course decline curve that would then lead to twice the EUR? Or do you expect a steeper decline curve?","Ray N. Walker","Well, we can certainly hope for twice the EUR. But I think at this point, it's just too early to know. IPs are not necessarily as good a judge of the character of the wells' performance long term. It's what they used to be in the old days because -- one simple reason certainly in the Marcellus is, there's very few wells that ever come online that aren't constrained somewhat due to compression or gathering or whatever. So the answer is we're really encouraged with what we see. And like Jeff said, the important thing is every decision we do here is driven towards trying to get a higher return on the investment that we make. And all of these things we're trying we believe will drive those returns that we've got in our investor presentation up even higher. And that's what we're really shooting for.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And another key thing there. When you look at those economics like I just referred to, in the super-rich, we have the 8 wells originally that we announced on the last call where I gave you a little more color this time. But those original 8 wells have been online for an average about 1.5 years. So those aren't 24-hour IPs or 7-day or 30-day. That's 1.5 years worth of data.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then very quickly, in Bradford County where you've got the non-operator position, is that the acreage that's held by production? Or do you see any acreage exploration issues given the lack of drilling because of pricing?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, one I'd like to point out, that whole position is about 14,000 acres. So it's really small, it's relative to the over 1 million acres net that we have in the state. It's a tiny, tiny fraction. And a lot of it's held -- maybe a little bit of the 14,000 goes away. Now that's in the dry gas area and they've actually gone down to 0 rigs in that area.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ron Mills from Johnson Rice.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Ray, just a quick follow-up on Brian's question on the RCS. Can you give us a sense in terms of what -- how many more clusters are you doing per stage under the RCS method versus your prior method?","Ray N. Walker","Well, I don't know that we're locked into a specific spacing between clusters yet. But I can tell you, I think most of the recent stuff we're doing is we've gone from 3 clusters -- originally in our completions we were 3 clusters spaced 100 feet between. Basically, 3 clusters in a 300-foot interval. Now we are 3 clusters in a 200-foot interval. But that could change. We've experimented, I think, all the way down to 150 and we've actually even got longer than 300, again trying to figure out what the optimum is.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And from a lateral placement, can you talk about what you're doing differently and add a little bit -- maybe provide a little bit more color on what the analysis suggested in terms of why you're changing the placement of the lateral? And how much of an impact do you think that the simple lateral placement could have on the EURs or well performance?","Ray N. Walker","Well, I think, being a guy that's frac-ed a bunch of wells in my career, a year or so ago, what I said, it wouldn't make any difference where you land the lateral because we're going to bust it all up when we frac it. But today, I'll tell you that the guys have made a real impression on me that it does make a big difference. And I think it has to do with a lot of complicated things, which I won't go into here because it would take the rest of the call and we don't want to give away our secrets. But essentially, it's a lot of analysis of rock mechanics and characteristics of the rock that determine how the fracture initiates and actually how it produces in the early stages of the well life and so forth. So we're confident that we are seeing definite improvements by better targeting. It is going to be different across the play. Again, the Marcellus is a huge play. And just driving from one side of wet to the other side of the super-rich is -- that's an hour drive in a car. So it's a big area and it's going to change a lot. What's critical is, just like Jeff talked about earlier in his remarks, is just seeing that the technical team, given more time and more data and allowing them to use the tools and the diagnostics that they want to, has really paid off for us. And I fully expect that we'll keep seeing improvements going forward.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And then shifting down to the Permian. Is it fair to assume based on the comment that the Cline covers the whole position that this -- that the Wolfberry portion of the play is combined to the Western portion of your Conger field?","Ray N. Walker","That's exactly right. That is fair.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","That's why we gave you a well count rather than acreage. We think it's 100 to 150 at 40s and obviously, 200 to 300 at 20s.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Indeed. Do you think there's something going on as you're at that eastern portion of the basin that's different than what the industry has been doing in -- whether it's rocks or whatever given that those wells versus a typical Wolfberry well is significantly higher? Or was there something Range-specific, in terms of operations, that you think drove those results?","Ray N. Walker","Well, we've only done a handful of wells. And so I would hazard to say that we're any better than anybody else. But I do -- it's probably more of the rocks than anything else right there. But again, like Jeff said, that's why we put the well count out there. It's not huge, but it's definitely significant and it's a great opportunity and something our technical teams did really well. They looked at a concept and figured out a different way to approach it and made us some great rate of returns. It's a great way to ramp up some oil production and we're excited. Once we get in there drill a couple of more wells, I think we'll have a great opportunity going forward to really ramp up some oil production there.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, to me there's 2 things that are exciting. Regardless of the reason, I'm always excited when our wells are performing really well. And like Ray said, initially, it's probably the quality of the rock and the fact that we hopefully can repeat that across multiple opportunities. In aggregate, when you look at -- say, we have 300 wells to drill, it's not going really to drive our reserves or resource potential but it can really significantly drive our oil production over the next 1 year or 2 or 3 or 4. And that's the exciting part about it is more high-rate opportunities are really working in today's environment. Plus it's, in essence, free acreage. It's back to having stacked pays high-quality technical team. It's nothing we acquired. It's something we had. And then you got all the efficiencies. We've got a field office out there. We've got pumpers, people on the ground. It's the same technical team, so it really helps economically.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from RBC Capital Markets.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'm just wanting to see if you had any thoughts why the latest 4 wells of Northeast Pennsylvania and average 22 million a day were so still strong here?","Ray N. Walker","Well, I think our -- I think it's several things. I think our technical team is just getting better and better at understanding the rock and where to land the lateral and just all of the things that go with that. And I think the rock is just phenomenal. I mean Northeast Pennsylvania has probably got the best, in my personal opinion, it's not a Range opinion, my personal opinion, the best dry gas rock in the world. I mean, there's some huge wells up there. And again, those wells are only 3,000-foot lateral lengths and with 10 stages. If you -- there's no doubt that if we were drilling 5,000- or 6,000-foot laterals, I mean, those wells will be incredible. So I think that it's just a combination of all those things. But again, it's primarily just a rock. The rock rules, and understanding that opportunity and how best to capture it is a real testament to our technical team. We took a really experienced technical team out of the Barnett and we assigned that project to them 1.5 years ago or so. And they've literally gone from essentially 0 to where they're at today, bringing on wells. Those 4 wells is just unbelievable amount of volume. That was almost where we were at the Barnett after 4 or 5 years. So it's pretty phenomenal to see that happen.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, I think just a fact to that simple comment, not only you need to be in the right place but you need to be in the right part of the right place, in the core area. So we've got a huge position and really dominate the wet part of it, or super-rich, where the economics are strong. But even in the dry, we've got, I think, some of the best acreage out there coupled with first-class technical team working it. And a pretty good Chief Operating Officer, too.","Ray N. Walker","And a great CEO.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And did you guys use RCS on those wells? And what were the costs associated with those [indiscernible]","Ray N. Walker","We did not use RCS on those wells.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","So yes, there's upside in terms of, like Ray said, longer laterals, more stages, RCS, can we land them in an even better spot, all those types of things.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And what did those cost you to drill?","Ray N. Walker","Those will also -- they'd be right in line with what you're see in the investor presentation. And as I got so many numbers in my head, I can't pull it off at the top of my head. But $6.2 million on a lot of them.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, that means we're -- they were like 3,000-foot laterals. So you're probably ballpark-ish $5 million...","Ray N. Walker","$5.5 million. $5 million to $5.5 million, I guess.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","The economics are right on the website like we said.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess just looking out South of Pennsylvania, you talked about capacity constraints there. And can you give us a little more color on what you guys are doing to address that?","Ray N. Walker","I'm sorry, say that question one more time.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you give us more color on what you guys are doing to address capacity constraints in Southwest Pennsylvania?","Ray N. Walker","At Southwest Pennsylvania, look, the capacity strengths -- constraints that I was talking about on that one particular pad -- by the way, let me retract on the 2,600-foot laterals with 9 stages are $4.3 million. So we're probably just a little above that actually, on those particular oil wells that we're just talking about. But the capacity constraints in Southwest PA that I was referring to on that one example I was talking about in my prepared remarks, that was really associated with that one pad. We just really never anticipated that strong wells coming out of one pad. So they had not put enough compression capacity there to handle that, and that's what it was. So essentially, the guys added some more equipment, piped some things up to different ways, put some more separation equipment online and that sort of thing. And that got us going forward. Overall in Southwest PA, we're in great shape. I mean, Mark West has just done a fabulous job. Of course, there's certain things that we'd like to have faster and certain things that they would like for us not to change our mind so often. But to make a long story short, they've done a great job, they're out in front of us. And the most important thing I can say to you is we're well on track to meet our goals this year. We don't see any issues in the infrastructure side that will keep us from getting there.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's great. I guess, what are your well costs right now in Southwest PA on average in the different areas?","Ray N. Walker","The straightaway laterals, just like we heard got in the investor presentation are running about $4 million. Of course, we are working on longer laterals, we're also working on the RCS completions. We're putting more frac stages in. So you're going to see those prices go up and down as we incorporate those different techniques in the well designs. But the standard well today is about $4 million. What's important is, is with the efficiency improvements that we're seeing and the reduced service pricing that we're recognizing in that area, we expect those prices to continue to go down. But as typical, what the guys will figure out how to do is use the money that we're saving to invest back in more wells, more frac stages and more perforation clusters or all of those things. And again, all of that, we've seen what they've done over the last couple of years and they just continue to get better and better return on investments. And that's what it's all about.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes and just referring again to the presentation, you can go online and look at it. And we give you a couple of examples, for like Ray said, say a straightaway well down there, it's about a 3,000-foot lateral in 10 stages, it's about $4 million. And then in the super-rich example, which was the average of the 8, they were about 3,700-foot laterals with 14 stages, and they're about $4.7 million. But like Ray said, that will -- how we complete the well will dictate what the cost is. But the good news, even if the cost -- if we go towards longer laterals reduce cost during higher well cost, we're doing that because it generates higher rates of return.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Magner from Macquarie.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","We recently saw you all do a farm-out transaction of some acreage in the East Texas Eaglebine play. Is that something that we might see more of in the future? And if you can give us an update on your appetite around or interest in JV transactions as you look to accelerate or optimize development some of what might not be near-term priorities for Range?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, I think if you'd stand back and look at us, we've been pretty open-minded about what to do with our assets. To start with, from 2004 through 2011, we sold $1.8 billion worth of properties. The biggest piece of which last year was the Barnett for $900 million, and we did roughly a year ago. And like Ray said, importantly through our technical teams and the robustness of our portfolio, we basically made the production out by the end of last year. We're open-minded on what to do. The example you gave, we had some properties down in Walker County. We had identified an opportunity, got out in front of the pack, leased some acreage and probably all in for under $200 an acre or less. When we drilled one well on it, we never were able to put together a sizable position in the play. And it ended up being fairly deep and fairly expensive wells. When you stand back and look at it before we did the deal, it was an area we were never going to fund probably. So what we did is we fund it out, kept the 25% interest. We have a carry-through tanks, we have a override across the entire position. And that's more important to somebody else than it is to us right now. Just like the Barnett, it got to the point in our portfolio -- if you go back to 2006, '07 and '08, it was a big driver. But it got to the point last year, we never were going to fund it. The rates of return were so much better in the other areas, we weren't going to get to it. So we've been very open-minded in terms of farm-outs, selling properties and whatever we think maximizes our share price.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. And would JVs be of interest? In the past, there's been some reluctance to look into those types of transactions, but is that going to change hereon?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I think, again, it's just a matter of what the opportunity is. So to the extent we think things like that make sense, we'd consider it. So far we haven't seen an opportunity that we think is the right thing to do, therefore we haven't done one.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. And just any updates on spacing assumptions? Any of your sort of top 5 plays with discussions around increased lateral lengths and changes to some of the completion designs. Like on the last call, you provided kind of a rundown of at least near-term spacing assumptions. I'm just curious how you're looking to make any changes or tests, any down spacing opportunities?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I think that's a really good question and it has far-reaching implications, and I'll sort of walk through some of the areas. If you start with the Marcellus, we're basically drilling the Marcellus on 80-acre spacing. And when you look at the resource potential numbers in there, as large as the numbers are, 2 things I'd like to point out. A lot of our acreage is derisked. And in Southwest, you got over 90% of the acreage derisked from over 1,400 wells. And back to our discovery well for the play, production came on in 2005. So you got 7 years worth -- up to 7 years worth of history on 1,400 wells. We're drilling them on 80-acre spacing. And we put a couple of pilots in on 40-acre spacing down there a couple of years ago, so we got a plenty of data. When you look at the resource numbers that are in there, in aggregate, they're probably assuming in the Marcellus, roughly a 30% recovery factor, plus or minus. I would argue, if you look at that, when you look at recovery factor, it's going to come down to the quality of rock and the spacing that you've drilled on and the efficiency of the completions. If you use the Barnett, which is the oldest of these types of shale fields, as an analogy, in the best parts, in the core parts of the Barnett, people have drilled it down to as tight as 20-acre spacing, granted it's thicker, but they drill it down to as low 20s and got recovery factors on the order of 50%. We're at 80-acre spacing, it's not unreasonable to think that at some point in time you couldn't go to 40s and that our recoveries could double or we could drive through tighter spacing, better completions and all that type of thing. Recovery is up into the 50% range. That is an enormous upside given the amount of acreage we have. And it's in one of the highest rate of return plays in the U.S., tremendous upside. So I'm excited about that. As you go to the horizontal Mississippian, and again on our website, we talked about the first 8 wells. Ray just updated you with 2 more. And they're actually performing better than the first 8. As we get more data eventually, we'll update the curves like we have everywhere else. If you look at that slide, those 8 wells -- even those first 8 wells averaged 485,000 BOEs at a depth of about 4,200 feet. At strip pricing, that's a rate of return of 86% to 99%, tremendous rates of return. With that, under that current completion, it equates to a recovery of about 4% to 9% of the oil in place. And assuming we kept those laterals, it's a little -- it's about 55-acre spacing. So do I think -- and this is oil, not gas. So in oil, typically, it's more viscous fluid. You can drill on tighter spacing. You got a lot of oil in place. I think that it's not inconceivable in an oil play to maybe even drill tighter and to double recoveries, maybe 4% to 9% becomes 8% to 18%. And then I think when you stand back and look at that, again, enormous implications. We have 145,000 acres. If you use a spacing like that, you could be talking about something as high as 2,800 wells, plus or minus 2,700, 2,800 wells. And then if you use 0.4 million, 0.5 million barrels per well equivalent, you're talking about over 1 billion barrels net of range. If you double it through tighter spacing, you generate some enormous numbers. We're not that big of a company. Again high rate of return play, really strong technical team, stacked pay area. So you're spacing question is a good one. And then you could take that into the Cline or the Wolfberry or other areas. But anyway, I'll just stop there. It's very exciting upside but we're really not counting much, so good question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit from BMO Capital Markets.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can you review for me the targeted economics of the vertical Wolfberry, just the recoveries and the drilling complete costs?","Ray N. Walker","Currently, what I did see in those wells, the vertical Wolfberry wells are at about $2.8 million. The technical guys believe they could get that down significantly to the $2.4 million range pretty quick. What we are reluctant to talk about yet is the EUR of those wells. It's just simply too early, and we're definitely excited about it. They compare favorably to the offset operators. But that kind of gives you a flavor for what we're doing. And again, our plan is to drill 2 more of those. Across the summer here, we'll drill one. We'll go drill 3 of the horizontal Cline wells and then back to drill a second to additional vertical Wolfberry well. But they're completed, 11 to 12 stages. Again, the vertical -- so that kind of gives you, I think, a framework of what we're looking at.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And we also -- we gave you the 24-hour rates of the sales, we gave you the 90-day rate on the older well. And if you compare that again, I mean it's only a 2-well data set and with not a lot of history. But it looks good. Right now, it looks very encouraging. But rather than put reserves, I would rather see at least another quarter's worth of data before we put it out. But so far, it looks great.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Got it. And then turning to Northeast PA, how much of the 180,000 net acres is held by production today? What's the expiry schedule look like, I guess, over the next 12, 18 months or so? And what's the capital commitment involved?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","We're really in good shape. If you got on the website, it will show you there's about 51% HBP currently. And those are big leases up there. We feel -- and they have -- what they have on them are continuous drilling clauses. I always use the example of biggest leases, 20,000 acres or more. And literally, you can drill one well per year and hold it forever as long as you do that. And most of the leases are 1,000, 2,000, 6,000 acres. So 1 to 1.5 rigs will hold all the acreage that we want to hold, which is the core part of it. So we're really in pretty good shape there. Really, if you think -- if you step back even further and look at what do we need to drill the hold, what we really need to drill the hold is Southwest PA in the wet and in the super-rich. Southwest PA in the dry is held by legacy historical production either from the Upper Devonian, Oriskany [ph] or wherever. So the dry part is pretty much held down there. Where we need to drill the hold is wet and super-rich Marcellus and the horizontal Mississippian. It also happens to be where our highest rate of return projects are. So fortunately, we're blessed and those are lined up. That's where we'd spent our money anyway because those are our best rates of return.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, and I'll just add on. Drilling in Southwest PA, when we drill the Marcellus though, we're actually holding the acreage for the Upper Devonian and the Utica below that. So we HBP everything when we drill a well there.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, I knew these wells to any depth holds all horizons. And obviously, the value in the Utica, we think, is going to be in the wet up in the Northwest, and we'll be testing that this summer down the road. I can't tell you whether it's X years, but there's a tremendous dry gas reserves underneath all that stuff down in the Southwest. A lot of that acreage is prospective for dry Utica that at someday will be worth a lot.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, we don't have any of that dry Utica in any of our numbers anywhere so...","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Right, I got it.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Nor do we have any of the wet Utica.","Ray N. Walker","That's true. We don't have any Utica.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, none in any of our resource numbers that we've released publicly.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then, what was the price deck the banks supplied in this latest redetermination?","Roger S. Manny","It starts at about 275 for 2012. That's the agent's deck and it escalates from that. So obviously, we'll probably see some adjustments to that later this year. But they will forward your first slug of production to the next redetermination date. So a lot of that 2012 price wasn't really germane.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Right. And can you speak to or maybe you can give some guidance on what the ratio of long-term debt to EBITDA actually look like over the balance of this year to 2013. What's your comfort level or your discomfort level?","Roger S. Manny","Yes, Dan, we're comfortable basically 3 and under. It eats up just over 3x right before we sold the Barnett. So when you see it get up with the 3 on the front, we are usually working on something to get it back down. Right now,  it's at 2.6. So I think you'll see it kind of hover around that 2.6 range for the rest of the year, maybe a little higher, just depending on how things drill out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neil Dingmann from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. After that phenomenal result, you talked about the 24-hour rate you're just reading on the 700 BOEs per day and then obviously the 1,500 if you include the condensate, does that make you at all think about changing the drilling schedule or anything for the remainder of the year, or is there still just too much to define there?","Ray N. Walker","Well, you know, wells like that's what actually started making us change or grow the schedule a while back. The drill schedule is continually getting optimized. And what we're trying to do, like we do in all areas is again, especially in this environment, it's critical just to try to get the best return wells that we can drill. And so every time we find wells like this, we of course will immediately look for offsets and look for opportunities, try to figure out how we can duplicate that as many times as possible. And if we have the ability to shift a lower rate of return well that was maybe not as rich or something like that back into this area, we would certainly do that throughout the year. But as we go further, your ability to change anything that's going to impact production this year becomes less and less, just simply because we're a much bigger ship than we used to be trying to turn and change directions very frequently. That's exactly what we're trying to do, is find more wells like that.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And it helps set up an exciting 2013.","Ray N. Walker","Yes.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Well, would you all say you -- it does sound like there is, if you do decide to ramp that up even a bit latter part of this year, there is enough capacity to do so?","Ray N. Walker","You mean as far as infrastructure capacity?","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Correct.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, absolutely. We are well ahead on process and capacity. And all of the gathering and compression, looks like it's -- I mean, we're -- the guys are continually working with the MarkWest team on that. And we're well out in front, so we're in good shape there.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay and then on -- switching over to Utica, what are you thinking as far as forecasting for well cost there?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I'd just say that's way too early. The guys are still working on the design of the initial well. But when we get all that, we'll put that out.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, we're going to do some science, of course, too, which would not be normal on this first well.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","But it's a really exciting opportunity. It's at the right depth, right thermal maturity and a big 190,000-acre blocky position that should be in the wet and condensate area.","Ray N. Walker","I'm just going to say in more confirmation, there's just a lot of knowledgeable people all around us up there. So we're at the point where we just left with the decision. We just got to drill some wells now and see what we got.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes. And the same thing, we got a great team on the ground. We have a field office that's a historical producing area for us, so we're in good shape.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last one just turning over to the horizontal mix, just wondering, it does sound like in the latter part of the year, you anticipate ramping the number of wells there. Just looking at the water disposal, how is that addressed? Or kind of how you see the costs for that going forward?","Ray N. Walker","We, today, are -- the horizontal producers are about $2.9 million. That's actually what they're spending today. We are allocating about $200,000 a well for saltwater disposal. And that could run between 8 -- one well can handle between 8 to 12 wells. And I think only time will tell as we ramp that project up. But we got a great disposal zone, we got a great infrastructure, we've been very disciplined in our leasing program to try to stay very consolidated. And what we know about that play is operating cost is really going to be a key thing there, so we've really been disciplined. And I think at this point, the saltwater disposal infrastructure is coming together nicely. We don't see any issues. But of course, we've only got first 2 wells online. So we're going to be watching that real closely. And certainly as we get towards the end of the year and into next year, you're going to see that ramp up significantly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Carver from Capital One South Coast.","Marshall H. Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. When will your acreage in Southwest PA, the wet and super-rich, be held by production?","Ray N. Walker","We should -- our plan is over the next 3 or 5 years, we'll get there. Some leases -- a big portion of the leasing capital that we have in our $1.6 billion budget goes to Southwest PA. And it's just simply filling in holes and blocking up, what I call blocking and tackling as we're drilling through that area. So it's hard to talk about absolute black-and-white numbers when things will be HBP because we'll be continually adding new leases as we get opportunities to bolt on. But we should substantially have all of that done in the next 3 to 5 years.","Marshall H. Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","And in terms of the new improved completion techniques and lateral placement designs this year, what percentage of the wells that you're drilling this year in the wet and super-rich would you say going to use this new improved techniques versus old techniques?","Ray N. Walker","That's a great question, Marshall. And to be just flat honest with you, I don't have an answer yet. Give me another quarter, and I think we'll have those plans locked down. What the team is physically doing today is going through and just seeing how much of that we can add into this year's program. But just like we talked about earlier, every time we do more of that, it does cost more money. So we -- we're going to stay within our $1.6 billion capital budget and we're absolutely not going to spend more than that. So it's really a juggling act of where does it make sense to do it. It's certainly -- we're certainly not at a point where we can say it just -- blank it, makes sense to do it everywhere we go. But we'll be doing enough of it. Well, let me say it in another way, we'll be doing as much of it as we can. And I think in probably another quarter, I could give you a range or a percentage of the wells that we'll be doing those techniques on going forward.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And I think the key, again remembering the old techniques in the wet area where 3 years worth of data on almost 200 wells generate about a 75% rate of return, which is pretty exciting. And in the wet area, based on the first day, it's about 95. These are enhancements to that. I think what you'll see in time, into 2013, '14, '15, like Ray said, you're going to see, I think, continuing improvement.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, let me add even more to that. We're also taking what we're learning there in the Marcellus and we're actually talking to the Oklahoma City division office about it and even the West Texas guys and seeing if any of those techniques makes sense to try in the oil plays in the horizontal Mississippi or the Cline.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes. And remember in the Cline, we're 2 wells into it on a 100,000 net acres.","Operator","We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Mike Scialla from Stifel, Nicolaus for our final question.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I think you said you had 7 rigs running in the super-rich area, and how many total do you have in the Southwest PA now?","Ray N. Walker","Today, there's 9 rigs total running in Southwest PA.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So are those 2 that are in the wet area, I presume, is that kind of a good run rate to hold that area going forward, and you'll continue to concentrate on the super-rich?","Ray N. Walker","It's going to go up and down, Mike. I mean, there's -- I don't have those averages because just like what we were talking about a little while ago, as we're -- as these new wells are coming online and we're starting to figure out what the potential is, you have to look at things like HBP, you have to look at infrastructure development and where does it make sense to change our plans in new rigs from the wet to the super-rich. So you're going to see that go up and down quarter-to-quarter. We may have more rigs running in the wet area for a quarter than we do in the super-rich going forward. So it's just going to ebb and flow. And so I don't think you could hold that flat. I think the only thing you could hold sort of flat would be in that 7 to 9 rig range throughout the year or so in Southwest PA.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then along those same lines, if I look at the resource potential numbers you guys put out there, it looks like you expect the Upper Devonian to have a higher liquids content than the Marcellus, kind of looks like 300 barrels per million versus 200 barrels per million. One, I guess, am I reading that right? And if that is right, is there a chance we could see a shift, more emphasis towards the Upper Devonian going forward?","Ray N. Walker","Well, I think it's apples and oranges because the Marcellus is the entire Marcellus, which is all the dry acreage in Northeast PA and along with the dry acres in Southwest PA plus the wet and super-rich areas. The Upper Devonian is really concentrated to the wet and super-rich areas. And we really don't have much of the upgrade in either for the super-rich types, as you know. We got -- simply we just got to see some more results before we do go that far.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And it's so early in the Upper Devonian. The recovery factor for using there is even significantly less. So until we get more data -- what we'll do is continually update it with time.","Operator","We've come to the end of our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for closing comments.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Okay. Before I give my closing comments, I'd like to note that we have several more questioners online that we weren't able to get to. So I would encourage you to give us a call, and we want to make sure we follow-up and answer your questions along with anybody else that might have some, so make sure to do that.","But for the closing comments, I'd like to close with what I believer are the 4 main takeaways for Range. First, we have a very large acreage positions in some of the best plays in the country. Given the acreage we have, we should be able to achieve double-digit growth in production and reserves on a per share basis, debt-adjusted, for many years. ","Second, given the high quality of our acreage in the plays that we're in, we should continue to be one of the lowest cost producers in our peer group. Third, as Roger just discussed, we have significantly strengthened our financial position and are in a solid position to fund our capital program. ","Finally, the 5 enhancements to our portfolio, the super-rich Marcellus, the super-rich Upper Devonian, the wet Utica, the horizontal Mississippian oil play and the Cline Shale oil play, all offer significant upside to the Range story. Additional news on all these plays will be coming on our second, third and fourth quarter calls. I believe these 4 keys will drive shareholder value for years to come. ","Thank you very much for participating on the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."],"17902":["Range Resources Corporation (NYSE:RRC) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call February 25, 2015  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Rodney Waller - SVP","Jeffrey L.

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. ","At this time I would like turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Rodney Waller","Thank you, Adam. Good morning and welcome. Range reported results for the 2014 with record production and reserves and a continuing decrease in unit costs which will set us up -- our operation for 2015. The order of our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, President and CEO; Ray Walker, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Range did file our 10-K yesterday with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on our website under the Investor tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition we have posted on our website supplemental tables which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and reconciliation of reported earnings to our adjusted non-GAAP earnings that are discussed on the call today.","Now let me turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thank you, Rodney. In 2014 Range achieved some key milestones that I believe position the company well for the future. Range recorded record level of production, reserves, revenue, net income, cash flow and cash flow per share in 2014. Thanks to continued cost structure improvements and steady production growth despite declining realized prices our cash flow and cash flow per share have increased. 2015 is setting up to be a challenging year. Fortunately, we did several things in 2014 that will help us in 2015. ","With the redemption of our fixed rate 8% bond with the proceeds from an equity offering coupled with the cash proceeds we received from our Conger for Nora swap we ended 2014 with less debt than 2013. Debt per Mcfe of proved reserves was $0.30 at year end 2014 compared to the prior year at $0.038. Last fall we restructured and extended our senior bank facility for five years to 2019 and increased our borrowing base from $2 billion to $3 billion. We have no bonds maturing until 2020. ","We have continued with our capital and operating efficiencies. In 2014 we improved our operating efficiency by decreasing our unit cost $0.35 or 10% versus the prior year and expect continued improvement this year. Our capital efficiency improved as we continue to drill longer laterals, and more frac stages per lateral and utilized improved targeting of the lateral. We believe this trend will also continue in to 2015. ","We currently have hedged approximately 65% of our projected 2015 natural gas production with a $4 floor and approximately 77% of our projected oil production with a $90 and $0.57 floor. ","On the natural gas liquid side Mariner East project is still projected to be on time with the start up in the third quarter of this year. When fully operational, even with today\u2019s pricing, given Range specific contracts and the combined benefits from propane and ethane this is projected to be approximately a $90 million uplift as compared to selling the ethane as natural gas net of all transportation and processing fees.","In 2014 we grew production 24%, we grew reserves 26% and we ended 2014 by testing our first Utica well in Washington County at a rate of 59 million cubic feet per day which we believe is a new record for any well in any horizon in the Appalachian Basin. ","As I previously mentioned we accomplished a lot in 2014 that will help us in 2015. We also have recently taken additional steps to help drive our performance in 2015 and 2016. We cut our 2015 capital budget to $870 million. This is approximately $700 million reduction from 2014. Given the quality of our assets and team, coupled with continuing improved capital efficiencies we are targeting 20% growth for 2015 even with the reduced capital. Importantly this growth occurred sequentially throughout the year which sets up Range well for 2016. ","We also made a tough decision to close our Oklahoma City office and operate our mid-continent properties out of Fort Worth, given that approximately 97% of our capital is currently targeted to Appalachia we believe this is the right decision for the company and it will lead to better capital allocation for Range and improved integration of technology coupled with cost savings. ","Range\u2019s advantage given our core acreage position in the Marcellus, we have approximately 125 million net acres of stacked pay potential in southwest and northeast Pennsylvania that is prospective for Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian. Plus our acreage position is further advantage in that we can selectively drill -- direct drilling capital towards the dry, wet or super-rich portion of the plays. Coupling this with our processing pipeline takeaway capacity and unique NGL marketing agreements, Range is well positioned for 2015, 2016 and beyond. ","Gas demand is projected to increase in 2015 from coal plant retirements, gas exports to Mexico and later this year LNG exports. Given the large capital cuts from a large number of companies in our industry which is resulting in a rapidly declining rig count and deferred completions we may see a production response in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids later this year. The combination of slowing supply growth coupled with increasing demand should help bring the market closer in balanced this year. I will now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.","Ray N. Walker, Jr.","Thanks Jeff. While we are focused on the headwinds that we faced in 2015 when we pause to look back at 2014, 2014 was a record year across many aspects of our operations. We set records in production, reserves, cash flow and earnings along with significant improvement in cost structure and capital efficiency. We continue to see great results in well performance in both Southwest and Northeast Pennsylvania and like Jeff said we completed our first Washington County Utica Well. While it\u2019s only a single well based on the early results and all the previous data we have approximately 400,000 net acres in what we believe to be the core of the dry Utica and gives Range another significant growth opportunity to add to our core positions in the Marcellus and Upper Devonian and Southwest Pennsylvania. ","In 2014 we also put together both [indiscernible] as the Nora field in Virginia, giving us control of operations and the early results were outstanding. We have the ability to significantly grow that asset in one of the best gas markets on the East Coast in the future and in the Midcontinent area we saw continued confirmation of the geologic modeling in the Chat play along the Nemaha Ridge leading to some of the best well performance to-date in that play. ","I am also really proud of all of our employees for working all of 2014 without a loss time incident; safety, environmental protections and regulatory compliance are a core philosophy at Range and I want to personally congratulate everyone across the company for a job well done in 2014. We had a great year adding reserves at record low drill bit, F&D cost while decreasing the pud percentage and the startup of Mariner East early propane was another significant step in our liquids marketing strategy in Appalachian further positioning Range with unique and advantage opportunities.","Recognizing the challenging commodity price environment that Jeff described in his remarks I know most of you today are primarily focused on our plans for \u201915. As we announced previously we set the capital budget at $870 million, which is 46% lower than our 2014 CapEx and we\u2019ve targeted year-over-year production growth of 20%. Nearly 95% of that budget is directed towards the Marcellus with over 90% of those dollars directed to Southwest Pennsylvania. 85% of our total capital is directed to the drill bit for 2015 as we significantly decreased our planned spending on land exploration and seismic. ","We are able to make these changes and still target 20% growth for several reasons. Let me walk you through just a few of them. Number one we have an experienced team and great leadership with a proven track record of growing production and reserves consistently with one of the lowest cost structures in one of best plays in the industry. This has been our philosophy at Range for many years. ","Number two most importantly and one of my favorite sayings, the rock rules, and this has proven to be the case throughout history across many plays and through multiple commodity price cycles. It simply means that where you find the best reservoir quality, meaning the best rock the economics are substantially better than non-core acreage. And when a company can maintain a low cost structure in the core play that company can sustain its growth at attractive economics across the up and down cycles of commodity prices.","Range has what we believe is a core position in the Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica allowing us to focus capital in those areas with the best economics, whether they are dry, wet or super-rich and continue to achieve production growth in 2015 and beyond. And number three Range has had a consistent strategy of 20% to 25% growth at a low cost structure for many years. This has allowed us to implement innovative, attractive and long-term marketing and midstream arrangements that position us well for what we face going forward. ","It has allowed us to keep our balance sheet strong and maintain liquidity. This strategy has also allowed our operating teams to achieve continued improvements in well performance and operational efficiencies while at the same time lowering our cost structure and we expect to continue to see those improvements going forward. ","So getting into some details about 2015 let me start with our Southern Marcellus shale division. For 2015 we\u2019re planning to turn the shales approximately 101 Marcellus wells, 35 dry, 40 wet and 26 super rich with average completed lateraling of over 6,000 feet with 30 stages. Well timing is expected to be similar to the prior years and therefore production growth profile is also expected to be similar with sequential growth quarter by quarter throughout the year giving us momentum as we go into 2016. To help investors in forecasting Range\u2019s production growth we\u2019ve updated our presentation for each area in the Marcellus for specific type curves that are representative of the wells planned to be turned to shales [ph] rather than the wells planned to be drilled as we\u2019ve previously shown. ","The 2015 type curves as you\u2019ll find in our updated presentation on the website correspond to how our wells are planned to be produced and support our expectation of 20% growth for 2015. As we\u2019ve described many times in the past it\u2019s our practice to focus on optimizing our gathering system based on managing our cost structure to provide the best overall project returns. This results in lower initial rates to sales and flatter at times as the gathering system is built out overtime and new processing plants and compressors are installed. ","Actual performance as it pertains to the overall project is what matters and in Southwest Pennsylvania in the current environment we believe our well performance and returns are some of the best. Importantly Range\u2019s EUR projection in each of the Marcellus area has increased in 2015 compared to the prior year estimate, while total well cost has come down again illustrating quality of our Marcellus acreage and the continued improvements in capital efficiency. ","In the past we\u2019ve made substantial enhancements to our completion designs such as improved lateral targeting, RCS, enhanced asset placement, greener additives, super surfactants and substantial reservoir modeling, both historical and predictive just to name a few. These enhancements have led to bigger EURs and lower costs year-after-year. We\u2019ll be continuing with that focus on the innovation in new technology going forward and I believe we\u2019ll continue to see positive changes in 2015 and beyond. ","Illustrating a specific example of this, I\u2019ll call your attention to a new slide in our presentation, slide number 35 which follows up on a couple of wells that we talked about several quarters ago. We drilled two in-fill wells on an existing Marcellus pad that has been provisioning for over two years. By applying the new designs and better targeting the initial sales of those new wells was significantly higher than the existing wells as we previously reported. After almost a year of production the new wells on average have yielded 53% more than the original wells and we should not forget that on a normalized basis the new wells were $850,000 less per well. This example illustrates just one aspect that the capital efficiencies, improved well performance and resulting economics that we\u2019ve demonstrated to-date and can expect to see in future years. ","I\u2019ll call your attention to slide number eight and slide number nine in our updated presentation to point out efficiencies that we\u2019ve achieved over the past several years. Namely in the Southwest Pennsylvania area, since 2011 as compared to \u201915 we\u2019ve seen a 114% increase on lateral lengths with a 57% reduction in total well cost per foot of lateral. For 2015 as compared to \u201914 we\u2019re planning 20% longer laterals with a 37% reduction in total well cost per foot of lateral. Even though our current 2015 plan turns to sales of few less wells as compared to last year we\u2019re actually planning to pump about the same number of frac stages. This illustrates continued efficiency improvements resulting in lower cost but also results in a consistent activity level allowing us to continue to capture improved service and supply pricing. ","Looking at pricing across the supply chain on an apples-to-apples basis, assuming no efficiency improvements we now have arrangements in place that have reduced our estimated 2015 well cost by 23% to 25% as compared to December 2014 pricing. We have seen reductions in pricing across all services and supplies and we believe we'll see more improvements as the activity continues to decrease across the industry. Let me point out again that we've embedded in our 2015 plan well cost improvements from high grading our program, continued improvements in designs, efficiencies and operations and the reduction in service and supply cost that we currently have in hand. ","When you add all these together you achieve the 37% decrease in total well cost per foot of lateral that I described earlier. If we see further reductions in service and supply pricing, our total well cost will decrease further. This of course combined with the diversity of our large core position in southwest Pennsylvania allows us to grow with good economics in 2015 whether it's ground [indiscernible]. As a further update on the Utica we're still planning to drill two more wells this year. We believe the total well cost for the second well will be around $13 million and we'll still include some additional science. It's still very early in the program but I believe as time goes on and we drill more wells we could see the cost come down another 15% to 25% as operational efficiencies and design improvements kick in. ","The play 11H, which holds a record IP of 59 million a day is now producing at our designed constrain of 20 million a day and albeit very early and with only a few weeks of production the well is meeting initial expectations. Just like I discussed earlier current production facilities for these wells are designed to optimize the long-term flow and project economics. The first well will be produced to sales on an interruptible basis until this summer when new infrastructure is completed. The second well is planned to come online about that same time and the third well is planned to be drilled later in the year. ","In Northeast Pennsylvania on slide nine, you can see that the lateral length has increased 100% since 2011 with a corresponding 63% decrease in total well cost per lateral foot. For 2015 as compared to '14 we're increasing lateral lengths by 18% with a 20% decrease in total well cost per foot of lateral. The team there had a great year and we saw a 44% increase in our 90 day rates with a 30% reduction in well cost totally attributable to operational efficiencies and improved well designs that were implemented in 2014. We're planning a one to two rig program this year resulting an about 14 well to sales and we expect those improvements that we saw in 2014 will continue. ","We\u2019ve cut the CapEx in the midcontinent division to approximately $26 million resulting in a CHAT [ph] well utilizing targets from the geologic model that has been developed over the past couple of years. As Jeff mentioned we've made the difficult decision to close the Oklahoma City division office and we'll now operating the property which is approximately 360,000 net acres and 80 million a day of production with our Fort Worth based operations team. The field officers across Oklahoma and in the Texas Panhandle will now report to Fort Worth. ","In Nora, we have the distinct advantages of an asset where we either own the minerals or sale by production combined with having a very flat decline and receiving some of the best gas prices in the country. Our plan for 2015 is simply to complete our inventory of wells drilled in late 2014 along with minimal maintenance capital resulting in a total spend of about $15 million with about 25 new wells turned to sales. ","In only a few short months since taking over the operations the team has implemented designs and techniques resulting in some of the best results we seen in that field and you can see some of those results on slide 45 in the presentation. 465,000 net acre position has a tremendous inventory of low risk projects combined with exploration potential for the coming years. Again this is an asset that we believe we can ramp to significant volumes with attractive economics in the future. ","In summary our message today is that we have a great team with a proven track record. We have a large and consolidated position in the core of one of the best plays in the world and history has proven over and over that rock rules. We continually improved our cost structure setting us up well to continue to deliver economic growth in the current environment. Our plan of growing at 20% to 25% for many years has enabled us to plan and execute innovative and attractive marketing and midstream arrangements that position us well. We have the balance sheet strength and liquidity to support the operational plan. And finally we have a plan for 20% growth in 2015 at great value by achieving growth consistently and sequentially quarter-by-quarter at attractive economics. All positioning us for growth into 2016 and forward as commodity prices improve.","Now over to Roger.","Roger S. Manny","Thanks, Ray. The fourth quarter closed down an excellent financial year for Range. Revenue, cash flow and cash flow per share were all sequentially higher than the third quarter of this year and also significantly higher than the fourth quarter of last year, while total unit costs were lower. For all of 2014 we set record highs for revenue, EBITDAX, cash flow and cash flow per share. And while we understand that everyone is keenly focus on current commodity prices and 2015 budgets we should not overlook these record 2014 results as they properly position Range for a more challenging 2015.","So starting with the income statement; the fourth quarter was much like prior quarters, where we offset lower oil, gas and NGL prices with higher production volumes and lower costs. Our net realized price per Mcfe was 17% lower than the fourth quarter of last year but production was 26% higher and unit costs were 11% lower and that drove our strong quarterly performance.","Reported net income was $284 million for the quarter benefiting from a $341 million pretax mark-to-market gains on our hedge book. Fourth quarter earnings calculated using analyst methodology which eliminate these non-cash mark-to-market entries was $65 million or $0.39 per fully diluted share.","Cash flow for the fourth quarter was $273 million, 8% higher than last year and cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.64. EBITDAX for the fourth quarter came in at $310 million, 5% higher than last year. Cash flow and cash flow per share for the full year of 2014 was just over $1 billion or $6.33 a share. EBITDAX for the full year was $1.2 billion and 2014 was the first year that cash flow topped the $1 billion mark. As Rodney mentioned earlier please reference the various reconciliation tables found on the Range website and earnings release for full reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP. ","On the expense side, all of our fourth quarter expense items came in at or below guidance, reflecting heightened focus upon costs, as oil gas and NGL prices waned during the quarter. Special mentioned is the continue decline in our DD&A rate. DD&A rate for the fourth quarter was $1.20 per Mcfe, down from a $1.36 per Mcfe last year and $1.46 per Mcfe a year before that.","The fourth quarter DD&A rate represents a 48% decline during the past five years from the peak rate of $2.41 in Mcfe back in 2009. We expect the DD&A rate to continue falling as we high grade our asset based and become even more capital efficient. While there are several non-material positive and negative non-recurring items passing through the income statement in the fourth quarter there is one item that is highly non-recurring. This item relates to the closing of Oklahoma City office that Ray and Jeff mentioned and the resulting $8 million accrual for severance costs.","The office closing will reduce our total company wide headcount by approximately 8%. There are other overhead costs associated with the office closing besides severance and the first quarter results will likely include an additional accrual of approximately $8 million to account for these costs. When the closure is completed we expect an annual G&A reduction of approximately $15 million to $18 million or $0.04 per Mcfe. With these savings layered in, beginning in the second quarter of 2015.","Jumping over to the balance sheet, the first number you may notice is that we ended the year 2014 with less debt than the end of 2013. Aggregate debt and leverage are both down from last year even though we added 2.1 TCF of proved reserves and grew production by 26%. The steps taken mid-year in 2014 to reduce leverage and interest carry by calling our highest cost notes has positioned us well for the current more challenging environment.","Looking forward, our revised $870 million capital budget results in a very modest cash flow overspend which is easily funded by our recently renewed bank facility. At year-end 2014 we had over $1 billion in liquidity available under our $2 billion commitment and over 2 billion in available liquidity under our $3 billion borrowing base. ","Another balance sheet number that you may notice is our retained earnings topping the $1 billion mark for the first time, considering that for six consecutive years we have seen our realized price per Mcfe come down, our cash flow and cash flow per share for the past six consecutive years has gone up we view retained earnings growth as yet another indicator of our improving capital productivity, the quality of our assets and our relentless focus on growth at low cost.","Please reference our fourth quarter earnings release for detailed expense item guidance for the first quarter of 2015. The earnings release also contains summary details of our hedge positions on both commodities and basis for 2015, 2016 and 2017. Additionally detailed hedge volumes and price information may be found on our website. ","To summarize 2014 brought record high revenue, operating income, cash flow and cash flow per share with record low cash unit costs. The progress we made in 2014 places us on firm ground as we enter 2015, with additional capital efficiencies and cost reductions still to come we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver consistent growth for many years. ","Jeff back over to you. ","Jeffrey L. Ventura ","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Ventura. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronic. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ron Mills of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead with your question. ","Ronald Mills ","Hey, Ray you talked about slides eight and nine and it shows that the cost improvement particularly adjusted for lateral length, it was a big decrease as expected, a much bigger decrease is expected in \u201815 versus \u201814. Can you talk about how much of that is related to the lower overall service cost environment versus ongoing efficiencies. I am just looking at the last bar and the well cost per lateral length and the pace of the decline is much greater in \u201815. ","Ray N. Walker, Jr.","Yeah, good morning Ron. Good question. The difference, when you look at those charts on page -- slides number eight and nine, what you've seen from 2011 to 2014 has pretty much been a factor of well design improvements, longer laterals, operational efficiencies and the capital efficiency that we have seen during that timeframe. ","From 2011 seen through 2014 we really have never seen service and supply chain cost reductions. So the difference in the slope of that line, if you want to look at it that way, going from \u201814 to \u201815 is the service or the supply chain side of the pricing reductions that we're seeing. We're seeing discounts across all of the sectors, across all -- from drilling rigs all the way through every piece of it and I think the jury is still out on how much more of that we'll see during the year. But I think it will depend on activity across the industry but certainly with all of the capital reductions that we've seen across all the different plays we're taking advantage of those every opportunity we get. ","But that's the big difference, so that what I quoted in my remarks, the 37% reduction that we're seeing from 2014 for the planned average in 2015 is really a combination of well design improvements, operational efficiencies, like we've seen in the past and we'll continue with of all those innovations and then the other is -- the thing this year is really the difference in well cost from the supply chain side of things. ","Ronald Mills ","Okay, great. And then later in the presentation you show each of the areas and you have the 2014 actual production versus the unrestricted type curves. Can you just give us a little bit color on what the restrictions are and is it just the build out of gathering and right-sizing the gathering for the long term as opposed to flowing unrestricted? And I assume your guidance is based off of how you are actually flowing them I suppose to the unrestricted type curves?","Ray N. Walker, Jr.","Right, right. Another great question. We have done a couple in our presentation this time. One is in 2014 we were showing you an unrestricted, unconstrained how you want to say a type curve that was based on the wells that we plan to drill that year. Going forward we are giving our predicted forecast for the wells based on all the other system that we have out there, the timing and so forth and we are basing on the mix on the wells that we are actually going to put to sales. So it will actually help the investors more correctly model our production forecast going forward and that is the big difference in the curves.","Alan W. Farquharson","Yeah, and Ron this is Alan Farquharson. With that I think we have covered a couple of things that and really talked about we are trying to make the forecast easier for people to model one. Two, I think at the end of the day what it looks -- what you are seeing is well EURs on a per normalized basis are exactly the same as what they were before. Overall, we are going to have higher EURs because that will be driven by longer laterals and we are also realizing the benefit of lower well cost. ","With that this is the constrained situation if you want to call or restricted is really the result of success of the drilling programs that we have had over the last several years. It\u2019s, traditionally you design systems to maximize the overall value of the whole product as opposed to individual well economics. So with that we have kind of modeled everything from that standpoint. That\u2019s not to say we are not going -- we are going to stop to not plan improvements. We still think that they are going to able to realize some improvements going forward in terms of looping lines, additional compression. We have a plant coming on scheduled to come on in 2016. We are also looking at improving the pipeline hydraulics that are out there. ","So we think with that there are also going to some improvements that hopefully we will be able to see over coming in 2015, 2016 and beyond but with that we believe this is great model to be able to get to the 20% growth that we have.","Ronald Mills ","Great. And then the optimized versus original curves on slide 35, is it fair to assume that the plan is to really do the 700 foot spacing going forward or are you still in early days?","Ray N. Walker, Jr.","What you will also see Ron in our presentation, the slide before that, on slide 34 is an update of the 500 foot space test that we had talked about several quarters ago, probably over a year ago and we are updating that. We now have basically five years of production almost and our original projections of about 80% of the thousand foot examples is still holding very true. What slide 35 -- what the example I called out in my remarks does is show you not only a version of that, but it also shows you the improvement in well designs and operational efficiencies and just better targeting, you know all of those impacts basically showing the two new wells on a normalized per foot of lateral basis produce 53% more production you know over a year\u2019s timeframe, then the original wells which were only two years par. ","So I think going forward we have a mix of both of those cases. Now whether the spacing is 500 foot or 700 foot or 900 feet or what the ultimate space is going to be I think when you look at our core position at Southwest Pennsylvania it is very large and is very diverse. We go from super-rich all the way to dry and I think as we develop overtime you are going to see some areas in the liquid, I would think we are probably going to get wells closer together there and maybe not as close in the dry are but I don\u2019t think at this point in time we could say it is going to be only 500 because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the case. ","But it\u2019s certainly going to be a lot more well in-fill well drilling and when we go back on those existing pads, what\u2019s -- it is really important to point the improvement in well performance that we are seeing but you can\u2019t also -- you can\u2019t forget the decrease in well cost. When you are looking at $850,000 less per well those economics are going to be outstanding going forward as we go back and redevelop those areas to fill in the gathering system as we get more room. Gathering costs will come down in those areas, those -- there\u2019s going to be some real upside for us going forward.","Ronald Mills ","Great. Thank you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Just to summarize that a little bit, that slide 34 all those wells were drilled at the same time. So you had a pilot of 500 foot wells versus opposed to a thousand all drilled with old technology of five years ago and in-fill looks very attractive. However when the wells were wider spaced divisionally and then we\u2019ve gone back years later and in-filled rather than that in-fill well getting 80% of the original well it\u2019s actually better because the longer laterals, RCS, all the better landing, all the things that Ray said. So the in-fill wells rather than being a fraction of the original well are actually better. ","Ronald Mills ","Thanks again. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is John Attis [ph] speaking for Doug Leggate. We just had a couple of questions; apologize if they had already been asked. With regards to Mississippi Line is that even considered core anymore and if it\u2019s something that you can potentially consider divesting? And considering and what -- and if so when you look at Nora, I mean is there a possibility of -- what would you need to see in order to pick-up activity? And then my follow-up question is it looks like based on your new program for 2015 budget there is the possibility that you may generate free cash flow. If so where would you allocate the cash? Thank you. ","Jeffrey L. Ventura","This is Jeff. Let me start and I would imagine you\u2019ll hear from two or three more other than me. Yeah, I think what you\u2019ve seen us do is focus our capital on the Marcellus where we have very strong returns, the ability to dry, wet and super rich. So we get -- and we get strong returns, we get good growth. It\u2019s also an area where there is an infrastructure ability to grow it, there\u2019s contracts in place. We have to hold acreages, a lot of different factors that blend in to that decision to focus in the Marcellus. ","And I think if you step back and look at it, I would argue there are returns in the Marcellus there as good any play really in the U.S. today. So strong returns and yeah that\u2019s an area we need to drill to continue to hold to acreage which we\u2019ll do. But when you look at Nora it\u2019s a totally different decision. It\u2019s all HPP in fact it\u2019s better than that, in that we own the minerals under the bulk of it. So it has strong returns, strong economics and good gas markets but that\u2019s an area we have the ability to ramp up, when we\u2019re ready to do that, great asset. ","I think we created a lot of value by putting it together. Again it\u2019s all the strength that Ray said. We put the two pieces together that creates value, we try new technology, there\u2019s some great slides in the book that show what those new wells look like in the appendix. And we still get a premium to NYMEX there and we have the ability to grow and ramp that and probably one of the best if not the best gas market in the U.S.","In the mid-continent the decision to slowdown there was given the returns that we have in the other areas, we were putting like I said in my notes approximately the number was, 97% or so plus or minus more capital in Appalachia. So we thought the most efficient thing to do is to really operate those properties out of Fort Worth, there\u2019s significant G&A savings that Roger mentioned, several million dollars a year in savings. We still think the properties have potential, big footprint stack play, a lot of that\u2019s controlled. ","Let me switch gears a little bit and just talk abstract, in the abstract you talked about -- when you look at asset sales, clearly over the last several years we have sold almost $3 billion worth of properties. So if we ever get to the point where we think those assets are worth more to somebody else than us then clearly we\u2019ve done that multiple times. ","And to be honest with you, it\u2019s early in the morning and I don\u2019t remember all the other questions. I\u2019ll turn it over to Ray now. ","Roger S. Manny","Yeah, John this is Roger, yeah, your free cash flow question, I think your modeling is correct. It\u2019s a very, very modest overspend by projection, the lowest overspend we\u2019ve had that I can remember. And the interesting thing about it is it\u2019s not contingent on some asset sale. So there\u2019s not sale risk in that number. It\u2019s not contingent on some capital market transaction, so there is no market risk in that number. And you\u2019re right more cost savings and\/or higher prices could easily flip us to cash flow positive and if we find ourselves in that position we\u2019ve got a lots of places to put the capital and we\u2019ll take that decision at that point in time. ","Unidentified Analyst","I appreciate it. Thank you. ","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thank you. ","Ray N. Walker, Jr.","By the way a little color, we\u2019re sitting here looking at the window in Fort Worth and it\u2019s an intense snowfall. It\u2019s extremely rare for those of you that don\u2019t know Fort Worth, it\u2019s very beautiful. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Holly Stewart of Howard Weil. Please go ahead with your question. ","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Hello?","Operator","I'm sorry. Our next question comes from the line of Phillips Johnston with Capital One. Please go ahead with your question.","Phillips Johnston","Hey, guys thanks. In your prepared remarks you've referenced sequential production growth throughout this year and I'm wondering how the quarterly progression of that growth is expected to look like in the second, third and fourth quarter. Is it expected to be fairly smooth at close to a 5% sequential per quarter growth rate or would you expect some lumpiness in the progression?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yeah, Phillips, it's a great question, and I think it's -- we still feel very comfortable with the 20% growth for the capital that we said. We have given you the first quarter guidance. So by definition it\u2019s kind of backend loaded. I think if you look at the company historically it's looked that way for the last decade. So I would just look at the last few years and model it that way. ","Phillips Johnston","Okay, and then as we sort of look into next year it sounds like, Jeff you're pretty confident that you can sort of maintain that 20% growth rate. Obviously drilling efficiencies are a tailwind for your growth rate and you have some mix shift from the mid-cont Appalachia, but can you give us some comfort as to how you can continue to grow at that level despite the fact that your planned well count this year is down more than 25% year-over-year. ","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yeah, well I think it's fixed to when you look at the well, the quality of the wells have gotten better year-after-year and we've talked about that a lot. For longer laterals this year we're targeting 6,000 foot on average roughly and I think you'll see the laterals progress with time to longer laterals better technology, better landing, better capital efficiencies. And if the pricing, share pricings holds in there with this and I think we'll be in pretty good shape. ","So I think the other thing is our probably like other, a lot of other companies for 2015 our production curve will progress throughout the year towards backend loaded. So it gives us a good start on 2016. So I think that coupled with capital efficiencies puts us in a position where gas today, we still feel that targeting 20% growth is very reasonable. ","Phillips Johnston","Okay, thanks Jeff. ","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Now our next question comes from the line of Holly Stewart of Howard Weil. Please go ahead with your question. ","Holly Stewart","All right, let's try this again, can you hear me?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes.","Holly Stewart","Okay great. Maybe just switching gears to NGL realization, because you guys talked about in your presentation, how in the second half of the year there will be a higher percentage based off of natural gas and obviously the fourth quarter NGL realizations were a lot better, I think than everything was expecting. So could you just maybe walk us through how to think about that in 2015 and beyond?","Chad L. Stephens ","Yeah hi, Holly, this is Chad. So there is probably three things that affected or influenced fourth quarter NGL realizations or improvements. One, you got to realize or remember that range has a PLP processing arrangement with Mark West. So as prices come down the fee we're paying Mark West comes down, which improves our realizations. October, November the market saw little bit colder temperatures so demand for propane, heating demand for propane increased. So propane prices improved a little bit. And approximately half our NGL barrel is ethane and 80% of our ethane is currently tied to natural gas index as we sell on our Mariner West project, all of the ethane is sold on a gas equivalent and some of the ethane on ATAX [ph] is sold at a gas equivalent price. So that's why you saw that realizations improve in fourth quarter. ","Holly Stewart","Okay, that helps. And then maybe just kind of a bigger picture question for Jeff. You've laid out in the slide deck, you kind of going from 1.4, I think it is to 2.5 Bcf a day of transportation agreements between 2015 and '18. So maybe strategically can you reconcile that growth in sort of ST capacity to the growth in expected production, should kind of prices remain weak. ","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yeah, I think one thing we've had for a number of years now is a long range plan. So we have a very integrated process when we look at that production profile that we expect and well integrated with the Chad and the marketing team in terms of the amount of firm transportation that we need to hit those targets. And it's not just on the gas side but on the liquid side as well. We do have -- so we have good plan, capital efficiencies like we said will continue to improve. I think you'll see us move out to longer laterals, more frac stages, all those types of technologies that help on that side, so our capital efficiency should improve. ","I think another key thing to think about too is really think natural gas demand is going to improve with time as well. And I mentioned it in my notes early on with the mass retirements on power plants start kicking in, in the spring of this year, increased exports to Mexico and LNG starting up later this year, we think demand will be up 1 to 2 bs this year and then we think for every year thereafter demand increases 3 to 4 bcf per year and there is a slide in our book that points that out, peaking out we think the incremental gas demand could be 20 bcf by 2020. ","So we think there is going to be a lot of gas demand and gas is going to be a good place to be and we're in the highest quality, in the core of the highest quality best gas play out there with the ability to drill wet, dry and super rich as well as Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian.","Holly Stewart","Thank you, gentlemen. ","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. ","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning. ","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Good morning. ","Ray N. Walker, Jr.","Good morning. ","Brian Singer","Just one question on how you're thinking about longer term, Marcellus production relative to your takeaway capacity. What scenario do you see relative to the very large takeaway that you have lined up to get gas out of the basin for you to be producing above that number versus below that number and how are you thinking about scenarios in what to do with, in terms of contracting additional takeaway capacity, if your plans are to produce above that in 2018 or what you would do with any excess takeaway capacity if you're producing below that?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I think if you look at us now that we're basically fully covered and well integrated for the plan that we have. And right now there is a benefit to having all that from transportation, there is value to that portfolio and yeah I think we have a very forward thinking team that's been able to line up pieces and let me flip it over to Chad to talk about that a little bit more. ","Chad L. Stephens ","Yes, thanks. So getting to where we are today the firm transport capacity we have through 2018 has been a very thoughtful methodical process getting with our drilling teams and understanding what our volumes are going to be up through 2018 and beyond. And when you look at slide 37 in our presentation we show regionally where that firm transportation is and what we deem is relatively cheap firm transportation costs, that dovetails or fits real well with our projected volumes. ","Going forward we think that there is release capacity markets we've already been involved in and getting again relatively cheap or inexpensive firm transport to layer in to the areas we want to get our markets too. Obviously slide 37 shows our main objective is to try to get as much of our volume out of Appalachia into other areas Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast and in the future we want to try to do that as well. We think that with rig rates coming down, CapEx budgets being cut, volume -- projected volumes will be coming down in those companies that committed to firm transportation volumes will not be using all of that capacity. ","So we're going to take advantage of that and get into the release capacity markets and when needed speak up for some of that released capacity. We're also in discussions with some of the midstream companies about adding layering in additional strategic firm transportation projects they would fit our volumes and our needs again getting the volumes out of the Appalachia basin to other areas of the country where the basis has not been quite as volatile and we don't think it will be in the future. ","Brian Singer","Got it. Thanks. And then with regards to the cost reductions that you seem to be showing here at least on per thousand foot of lateral basis in the super rich and southwest wet Marcellus plays. Can you talk to how much of that's lower cost and what the split is in terms of what you would call -- we would call cyclical service cost reduction that maybe in a higher oil and gas environment would go away versus what you would consider secular. ","Ray N. Walker, Jr.","Sure Brian. It\u2019s Ray. In my remarks I tried to do that as best we could. But one of the things I said was that on an apples-to-apples basis if you look at the contracts that we -- I call them arrangements, if you look at the arrangements we have in place today with all our folks on the -- or our partners on the supply chain side of things and you look apples-to-apples compared to December of 2014 through today which is what we have in hand again, our well costs are down 23% to 25%. ","The operational efficiencies, design improvements renewed technology all those things that we have done over the past four years are going to continue going in \u201915. So when you add those together that\u2019s where you achieve that big change that you are seeing from \u201914 to \u201915 which is a bigger decrease then the slope of that line have been previously adding those two together gets you a 37% decrease on a per foot basis. ","We haven\u2019t put that in our total well cost basis just because all the lateral lengths are different and it is just too difficult to talk about from that standpoint. But again the service price reductions and supply side of thing reductions, those add up to about 23% to 25% on an apples-to-apples basis compared to December of \u201914.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And I think if you look on slide eight and nine there is a lot of detail and you can kind of see like Ray mentioned earlier there wasn\u2019t much of change in service industry cost from 2011 to 2014.","Ray N. Walker, Jr.","If anything it went up.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yeah, so those are pure operational efficiencies.","Ray N. Walker, Jr.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from -- GMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Sameer Uplenchwar","Thanks for squeezing me in guys and congrats on a great quarter.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thank you.","Sameer Uplenchwar","My first question it relates to slide 17, if I look at the IRRs now, I understand the upcoming balance between the super-rich and wet gas window driven by the oil pricing but how does this change the plan longer-term plan for Range going forward with gas competing well with the super-rich and rich window? And then I have a follow-up.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, let me start and Alan might have some follow-up. But one of the advantage we have is we do have a big acreage position in Dry, Wet and Super-Rich and again across those three things as well as up and down through the various horizons, Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian. So we have some ability to shift capital back and forth to try to drive further capital efficiency and better returns. So that is an advantage of the portfolio and the size of the footprint that we have and we will do that with time. ","Obviously as prices swing, as oil swing high to low or gas swings high to lower NGLs it is going to affect the economics and we will do our best to capture the most optimum returns that we can. Alan, do you want to add to that?","Alan W. Farquharson","Yeah, really I think comes down to -- it\u2019s kind of - to add on to what Jeff said we have the opportunity to be able to drill in any one of the three areas, number one. Number two, you saw that in 2014 as well that we had a balanced portfolio. We talked about that early in the year last year and so you saw a mix of wells that are going to be in there. I think it still comes down to well performance is still really strong, recoveries are still on a normalized basis still the same but overall EURs are going up cost are coming down so as we continue to work to that process we are going to continue to put the capital in the area in the areas it is going to give us a best return that we can realize. But I think you see those two things really coming at the end of the day and it just allows us more enhancement to the portfolio.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And that is an advantage of having a really large footprint in the core deploy with high quality mark with a strong team. Through multiple years but you can make those kind of continue to improve.","Sameer Uplenchwar","Okay. And the follow-up is, middle of last year there was plan to get to investment grade by middle of \u201916 maybe late \u201816 how has that plan changed with the commodity coming down now?","Roger S. Manny","Yeah, hi, Sameer it\u2019s Roger. Yeah, I don\u2019t believe we have put a date on which we desire to be investment grade and agencies tend to take -- their customer telling them that. So there was never a firm date but you are exactly right we are on a trajectory and still are to become investment grade in the future, with sort of the lowering of the tide effecting oil companies it appears that it\u2019s going to take a little longer than it otherwise would have us to be there. When we look at our core metrics and the fact that were our bond trade. I mean every one of our bonds, even though coupons are like 5%, all of our bonds are trading over 100 cents on the dollar. I mean our spread to treasury on our longest notes are about 298. So our bonds are trading right at the crossover mark. ","So I think the people that really understand credit liquidity are voting with the market and we know we\u2019re still on that trajectory. But again we\u2019re not going to project when that might occur in the future.","Sameer Uplenchwar","Perfect. Thanks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We are nearing the end of today\u2019s conference. We\u2019ll go to Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley for our final question. Please go ahead with your question.","Drew Venker","Good morning, everyone. Was hoping to get a little bit more color on the Utica program. You mentioned building out some infrastructure. Are you expecting to produce that well at a higher rate once the infrastructure\u2019s in place?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Good question. We\u2019re excited about the Utica, the first well, it\u2019s only been on line a few weeks. We purposely designed the production facilities to basically limit that well at 20 million a day, because again we tend to focus at Range on the long-term project economics and not initial production rates or anything like that, because the projects at the end of the day is what\u2019s most important. For the first half of this year that first well is actually producing on an interruptible basis as we have room to kind of [indiscernible]. ","We are currently building a new pipeline segment that will take it directly to the big pipe essentially, that will be finished sometime this summer and that is also corresponding with about the time we believe -- and all this is plus or minus a month at this point. But that corresponds with about the same time that the second well is ready for initial production. We will design those facilities for that second well to also limit it to about 20 million a day, but we do expect for the last half of the years that both those wells will be able to produce at their full rate which is going to again be limited to 20 million a day each, but we think they\u2019ll come online this summer time and produce the rest of the year on an uninterruptible basis.","And the third well we\u2019ll drill later in the year. At this point it\u2019s too early to tell we are kind of in the planning process and permitting process to know if it will actually produce this year or not, but it will be somewhere around the end of the year or beginning of next year when the third well\u2019s ready. Second well, we think we can do at about $13 million, we still got some science in it and again I am fully expect and I think our team is pretty pumped about what we see so far and they think we believe that as we go into that program that we can lower those costs another 15% to 25% and now as we take in well designs and different things that we learn and going through first couple of wells. And I\u2019ll also point out that third well, it will be in that same area, but it will actually be on a different pad, is the current plan.","Drew Venker","Okay, understood. So it\u2019s obviously very early. How much production history or well control would you want before moving the Utica into development mode or before your let\u2019s say allocating a significant amount of capital to the play?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, we have a lot of information about the Utica. We had, as we talked about in quarters past, a lot of old trend Black River tests and a lot more test wells that were done back in the very early days before the Marcellus even. So we have a lot of log data. Industry has certain drilled a lot of Utica wells all around at this point. There is enough production history now to prove out some other things on pressure and the reservoir parameters that we were looking at. ","So the Utica is a lot different than the Marcellus, we won\u2019t have to be stepping out and delineating acreage like we did it in the early days of the Marcellus. This is going to be more of a manufacturing tied process. We\u2019ll actually be able to just to put existing pads with existing infrastructure and start layering those wells in overtime.","We generally like to see, I mean we\u2019ll update you quarter-b y-quarter as we see the production from these wells, just like we did in old days of the Marcellus and I think once we\u2019ve seen three six to nine months of production on these various wells we will be pretty comfortable with what we have going forward and at that point I think it's going to be a factor of the economics. It's going to be pretty easy to grow with those kind of wells. It's got to be -- the economics are going to be very competitive and I think that we'll have to look at what the market is telling us at that point, \u201816 and beyond as we develop these plans as what we do next. But it's another really strong option for us and that's what we like. ","Drew Venker","Thanks for the color. ","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for closing remarks. ","Jeffrey L. Ventura","2014 was a record year for Range. Cash flow was over $1 billion for the first time in the company's history, reserves reached a new record level of 10.3 Tcfe with the Conger-Nora swap we now have operational control over essentially all of our property. We ended the year with lower debt and improved bank facility with plenty of liquidity and no bond maturities until 2020. 2014 was also a challenging and difficult year with falling commodity prices that have continued into 2015 with our current plan to spend approximately $700 million less in 2015 and 2014 and still target 20% growth, we believe that we'll be one of the most capital efficient companies in our industry. ","These capital efficiency coupled with our large footprint in the core of the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian and the optionality of being able to drill dry wet and super rich acreage have us well positioned for 2015, 2016 and beyond.

[Operator Instructions].","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Laith Sando, Vice President, Investor Relations at Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Laith Sando","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range's first quarter earnings call. The speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Degner, SVP of Operations; and Mark Scucchi, Chief Financial Officer. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we've posted on our website. We also filed our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the investors tab or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.","Please note that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. For additional information, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of EBITDAX, cash margins and other non-GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Ventura","Thanks, Laith, and thanks to everyone for joining us on this morning's call. Range is off to a great start in 2019 delivering on the operational and financial objectives to drive our 5-year outlook. In the first quarter, Range generated $53 million of free cash flow and reduce debt by $48 million. We achieved this result through a commitment to capital discipline and a focus on driving higher margins through prudent cost management. This strong start to 2019 builds upon 2018 results is Range's transition to generating free cash flow in the second half of last year and completed our 2018 drilling program for $31 million less than our original budget. This compares favorably to our industry peers as the majority of E&Ps outspent their original capital budgets in 2018.","Range's commitment to capital discipline is unwavering, so we reiterate, Range will not outspend our $756 million capital budget for 2019. I also want to reiterate Range's commitment to generating free cash flow if strip pricing improves over the course of the 5-year outlook, we will not increase growth but will instead look to generate additional free cash flow and reduce debt faster, which could position us to return cash to shareholders sooner in the form of buybacks and\/or increased dividends.","Speaking of the balance sheet, our commitment to organic free cash flow and asset sales have strengthened our financial position considerably and allowed us to reduce debt by $419 million over the past 3 quarters, a reduction that represents approximately 10% of total debt. We intend to build on this momentum through the remainder of 2019 and beyond, translating our high-quality asset base into being full free cash flow generation, while further accelerating our financial targets through asset sales. We believe this will narrow the disconnect we see between our share price and the intrinsic value of our assets.","That disconnect is in part demonstrated by our year-end 2018 proved reserve value in strip pricing net of debt which is over $24 per share and does not account for the large high-quality inventory of core Marcellus wells that will remain beyond the 5 years of development included in proved reserves.","Accelerating our financial targets remains a top priority. For evidence of management and the Board's commitment to balance sheet improvement, you can reference the 2019 compensation incentives in the proxy that we filed earlier this month. The 2019 targets for both debt reduction and leverage improvement reflect our focus on derisking the balance sheet in the near term.","Like we've talked about for the last few quarters, Range has completed what we called our commissioning phase of the Marcellus, which now positions us to deliver free cash flow and improve returns going forward. We have the vast block up acreage position that is largely held by production. This allows for highly efficient development of our assets with the ability to drill long laterals, utilize existing pads and infrastructure and effectively source and recycle water. These efficiencies are evidenced in our peer-leading F&D costs and low maintenance capital requirements.","Our processing and transportation capacity is rightsized for our production, while providing diversified market access for various products. We see opportunities to improve margins going forward by marketing incremental production in basin, thereby limiting additional transportation expense and supplying growing Southwest Appalachia demand for both natural gas and NGLs. And given the massive infrastructure build out that's occurred in the Marcellus and Utica over the last 10 years. We expect it will be ample takeaway to other markets allowing us to optimize sales without incremental commitments or take advantage of the narrow Southwest PA basis in several years.","Importantly, we're not pressured to grow in order to meet current transportation agreements or satisfy the competing interests of the midstream affiliate. This provides Range with the flexibility to develop a capital program going forward, that optimally balances an efficient development cadence, free cash flow generation and unit cost improvement. Range's ability to generate sustainable free cash flow in current strip prices is underpinned by our high-quality assets, which drive our low corporate base decline and low maintenance capital requirements. Range's base decline entering 2019 was below 20%. This relatively flat base decline supports low D&C maintenance capital of only $525 million and differentiates Range versus peers.","When we look at the dollars it takes to add or replace an Mcf of production, we couple that analysis with the underlying base decline, we see Range as the only producer in Southwest Appalachia capable of generating free cash flow and modest exit average growth in 2019, as true maintenance capital for peer companies chews up a significant percentage of the cash flow.","Not only does this analysis demonstrate Range's high-quality asset position, I believe it's one of the many indicators that strip prices do not reflect fundamentals. From that perspective, there's going to be a significant call on Southwest Appalachia to help supply the coming increase in demand for North American natural gas, both for domestic use and for export. If most companies in Southwest Appalachia can't grow within cash flow with current strip pricing, we see this as a positive sign for the macro.","Range's ability to generate free cash flow in this commodity price environment is driven by capital discipline and efficiency, asset quality and cost control. The team's performance on cost controls in the first quarter was outstanding as nearly every category came in at the low end of or below our expectations. Mark will spend some time discussing this trend in more detail, but we're thrilled to see unit cost headed down for the first time in 6 quarters and like we discussed for some time, this is a trend we expect to continue over the course of the 5-year outlook and beyond.","In addition, I want to make everyone aware of Range's corporate sustainability report. We plan to release in the next couple of weeks and this report will detail Range's efforts and commitment to responsible natural gas development and doing what is right for all stakeholders. Some highlights in this report include a 6% reduction in total emissions in 2018, while growing production approximately 10% year-over-year.","Additionally, Range achieved a 153% water recycle ratio as Range recycles effectively all of our produced water and utilizes recycled water from over a dozen operators in the surrounding area. We encourage everyone to read this report when it's published. And in the meantime, I will emphasize Range's commitment to sustainable business practices and developing positive, long-lasting relationships with all stakeholders. This commitment is not only the right thing to do but also represents a win-win as we believe it generates enhanced shareholder returns over time.","In summary, Range will continue to focus on responsible, capital and cost-efficient development to drive sustainable organic free cash flow generation. That free cash flow will be used to reduce debt and begin to position the company to return cash to shareholders. We will strive to accelerate the organic balance sheet improvement with asset sales in the near term. And given our peer-leading inventory of high-quality Marcellus locations, we believe we're in a great position to extend this program and deliver investor returns far beyond the 5-year outlook into a market that will see other producers exhausting their core inventories and looking for their next act.","I'll now turn it over to Dennis to discuss operations.","Dennis Degner","Thank you, Jeff. Our operating teams are off to a strong start for the year with first quarter production on track and capital spending projected at\/or below our 2019 plan. First capital spend came in at $214 million or approximately 30% of our 2019 budget. Production for the quarter came in at 2.256 Bcf equivalent per day as a result of strong well results and incremental [indiscernible] quarter.","As we discussed on the prior call, our capital spending program is front-end loaded for the year. As we look forward and similar to past years, we expect our second and third quarter capital spending to each be approximately 25% of the annual budget this year. First, let's talk about the well results. Similar to prior quarters, Q1 generated some exceptional well performance, which played a key role in exceeding guidance. One example is in our Appalachia dry gas acreage where we turned to sales 14 wells on two different pads. With average IP's exceeding 30 million cubic feet per day from an average lateral length of over 13,000 feet. Both pads have produced at\/or above 100 million cubic feet per day for 60 days and continue to produce at this level as of this morning.","On the other side of our acreage position in the last week of the quarter, we turned to sales three wells in the heart of our super-rich acreage. The average initial production from these wells was over 20 million cubic feet equivalent per day from an average lateral length of just under 7,000 feet. Despite the shorter lateral lengths on this pad, the first 3 wells produced peak condensate production that exceeded 3,000 barrels per day, solidly pointing to the quality of the acreage and results from the team's technical work.","Flow back operations in this site will continue into the second quarter as we clean up the remaining four wells on the pad. We expect the performance of this pad and other near-term activity in the liquids-rich area to increase condensate production back to a level above 11,000 barrels per day during the second quarter. Now let's look at field run time. For the past several years, our production team has conducted a thorough look back on the winter season with a focus on improving run time for the year ahead, especially the winter. This process, coupled with our ability to monitor production realtime has allowed the team to hone in our freeze prevention solutions such as heat trace and focus our lease operating team on sites requiring their support, ensuring production volumes flow as planned with downtime remaining low.","Similar to the team's approach on 0 vapor protocol, this extensive effort between both the operations and technical teams translates into an improved run time and played a key role in our production performance in Q1. The first quarter closed out with 26 total wells turned in line, consisting of 20 wells in our dry acreage, 3 super-rich wells and 3 wells in North Louisiana. As we look ahead, we are setting our second quarter production guidance at 2.27 to 2.2 Bcf equivalent per day, which aligns with our 2019 production plan to deliver approximately 6% production growth, while delivering meaningful free cash flow within our capital budget of $756 million.","Now let's turn to some of the team's operational highlights. The past year has showcased several accomplishments by the Appalachia drilling team as they drilled our longest, fastest and most capital-efficient wells. The team's first quarter results continued this trend as they successfully drilled 3 of Range's Top 5 longest Marcellus laterals with all 3 laterals exceeding 18,000 feet. As discussed on prior calls, Range has been able to reduce drilling cost per foot during extended lateral operations by as much as 30%, a contributing factor to our underspend last year and an important component in allowing us to deliver on this year's financial objectives as we deliver peer-leading normalized well cost. We look forward to sharing the production results from these long laterals in the upcoming quarters.","On the completion front, the team pumped over 1,300 frac stages in the quarter, while seeing a 20% efficiency increase in frac stages per day compared to the same time just 1 year ago. Both operational accomplishments point to the quality of our team, coupled with the strength of our service partner relationships, especially considering this was accomplished during winter conditions.","As Jeff mentioned earlier, water recycling continues to play a significant role in our sustainability efforts as we execute on our 2019 program as efficiently as possible. You've heard us talk about how we recycle 100% of Range's water in Southwest Pennsylvania. But through the team's creative efforts, we have partnered with other operators to recycle their produced waters as well. In the first quarter, third-party water comprised over 20% of our water usage.","Range's water management program not only contributed to an efficient first quarter capital spend, but it also contributed to Range's first quarter corporate LOE of $0.16 per Mcfe, which is approximately 16% below our LOE when compared to the same time last year. I think this is a great example of the team working tirelessly to find the next incremental step and efficiency gains, cost reduction and overall improved program results, and it's a great example of the team working collaboratively with other operators to be thoughtful stewards of the environment and pushing the standards for the industry.","Shifting over to our liquids marketing efforts. As we've shared on a prior call, the Mariner East 1 pipeline was temporarily taken out of service in late January, following a subsidence appearance along the pipeline route. Since that time, the marketing team has worked diligently pursuing options to secure our production flows. For propane, we have utilized available capacity on Mariner East 2 and other outlets to move our barrels to the Marcus Hook terminal and other markets.","In the case of ethane, we have utilized various options for marketing our production to the quarter, including both normal extraction and selling ethane as natural gas. Overall, despite the temporary disruption on the Mariner East I pipeline, Range has successfully engaged transportation and market alternatives to keep its natural gas liquids otherwise transported on ME1 flowing to both domestic and international markets through the utilization of rail and other infrastructure in the region. Based upon the latest update from Energy Transfer, start-up procedures are underway with the Mariner East I pipeline returning to service over the balance of the next few days.","During the first quarter, Range resumed its waterborne butane export program that began last year. This was enabled via the newly operational Mariner East 2 pipeline in associated infrastructure at Marcus Hook. Going forward, Range has also positioned a portion of its butane volumes for export using an additional East Coast terminal giving our products another outlet for accessing premium markets.","Including hedges, Range's first quarter NGL realization was $23.17 per barrel, an increase of 15% year-over-year. Based on recent strip pricing, Range expects pre-hedge NGL pricing for 2019 to average 34% to 38% of WTI. On an absolute basis, expected realizations are now slightly better than our original 2019 pricing guidance of February.","There has been some market confusion around NGL prices recently, so I want to repeat that, while the relationship to oil prices temporarily weakened, our forward strip based on NGL price per barrel expectations are now slightly higher than when we had our year-end earnings call. Propane and heavier products, which represent over 75% of the NGL barrel's value continue to be well supported by international export demand.","Currently, U.S. export terminal capacity is tight and the U.S. propane and butane market is seeing the strongest international export orders in the past 5 years with prompt spot cargoes loading at over $0.10 per gallon net of shipping costs. We expect this to cause max possible export of NGL products over the course of 2019 and ultimately support Range's decision to gain access to Marcus Hook or other East Coast export capabilities in the future.","On the gas marketing side, the first quarter saw the full utilization of the recently commissioned Mark West Harmon Creek I gas processing plant. This facility, along with the restart of the Houston gas processing plant following fourth quarter outages saw strong run times for the first quarter and supported processing for first quarter wells focused in our liquids-rich acreage. As discussed on the prior call, the new plan allows us to maximize the utilization of newly available long-haul infrastructure.","With a significant amount of downstream takeaway capacity that has come online over the last couple of years, local Appalachia pricing has improved. Additionally, with the slowdown in Southwest Pennsylvania production growth for the industry, we believe this local pricing trend will continue.","Further, with the combination of additional downstream takeaway capacity and local generation demand growth, we expect this will provide additional in-basin liquidity and market growth opportunities with less transportation cost associated with incremental natural gas production.","Range remains actively engaged in developing in-basin markets and optimizing our infrastructure to existing in-basin points of liquidity. Evidence of the team's work in optimizing the portfolio can be found in the $6 million net gain from the brokered gas marketing activities in the quarter.","I'll close out the operation section with this. The team has done a great job with our first quarter results, highlighting exceptional well performance, capital discipline and operational efficiencies from long lateral development. This really helps set the stage for delivering on our capital budget and production targets in the year ahead.","I will now turn it over to Mark to discuss the financials.","Mark Scucchi","Thank you, Dennis. During the first quarter of 2019, Range continues to execute on a free cash flow generating plan through efficient operations, diligent capital deployment and stringent cost management. From capital to production, revenues to expenses, Range met or beat guidance and has made early progress on the 2019 business plan. On the back of solid operational performance, Range generated cash flow from operations of $261 million compared to capital spending of $214 million resulting in free cash flow of $53 million before dividends and corresponding debt reduction of $48 million. As discussed on the last earnings call, we made the transition to free cash flow mid-year 2018. We've continued that trend and expect to generate meaningful free cash flow for the full year 2019.","Focusing on the Range's cost structure for a minute, I'd like to discuss trends and specific components of our unit costs. Our focus on expanding margins includes efforts to consistently realize competitive pricing for our production and to strategically manage costs such that our margins maximize full cycle returns over time.","Starting with the largest cost line item, gathering, processing and transport expense was $1.49 per Mcfe in the first quarter. This cost consists of in-field gathering, processing plant expenses and long-haul transport for natural gas and natural gas liquids. Long-haul transport is largely a fixed cost with all of our contracted gas capacity online. Infield gathering has both fixed and variable elements. Much of the gathering system is fully utilized and as cost recovery hurdles are met, the fixed-rate component will decline over time. On the processing side, this is predominately structured as a percent of proceeds from NGL sales and will vary with our pre-hedge NGL realizations.","For context, per Mcfe, gathering represents roughly $0.50, transport roughly $0.50 and processing around $0.45. Over the next few years, we anticipate per unit GP&T expense will decline driven by incremental in-basin sales, declines in gathering costs due to reuse of existing facility and the rolloff of capital recovery.","Range's lease operating cost per unit of production has declined 16% from the first quarter last year. Are competitive with liquids producing peers and on a more granular level, our cost in dry gas areas are also competitive with best-in-class dry gas only producers. G&A is an item of particular focus as we continue to adapt the company to current business environment and our anticipated activity levels. Cash G&A per unit has improved 22% since the first quarter last year. As disclosed in the proxy statement, 2019 estimated senior executive compensation is expected to decline approximately 30% compared to 2016. Additional savings have been identified in areas such as consultants, data subscriptions, insurance brokers and software among others.","On the matter of equity compensation expense, it should be noted that even though potential stock grants, specifically performance shares are expensed, that did not mean the shares were issued. In fact, significant forfeitures have been experienced, which is evident in the 1\/2 of 1% change in diluted shares outstanding over the last year. While steps have been taken to optimize spending, we continue to focus on all expenditures to enhance profitability and resiliency.","Turning to the balance sheet. Free cash flow from the first quarter resulted in a $48 million reduction in revolver borrowings. While the business is seasonal, we expect to generate material free cash flow over the balance of the year. In addition, divestiture processes continue on multiple fronts. As we look at our debt profile, we have balances readily repayable under the revolver without early redemption costs. We remain focused on reducing debt, maintaining a comfortable maturity layer and strengthening our balance sheet over time. As it relates to asset sales, we are currently marketing several opportunities. These processes are in various stages from data rooms to active negotiations to diligence. We're working conscientiously and will continue to evaluate opportunities to prudently monetize inventory. As evidence of this goal, absolute debt reduction was added as the incentive performance metric detailed in the proxy.","As we look forward to the balance of 2019 and beyond, the framework through which we allocate capital remains a daily focus. The focus on creating economic value, we evaluate each reinvestment decision, weighing relative returns and optimizing for total free cash flow, absolute debt reduction, leverage ratios, capital efficiency, unit cost, margins and base decline rate.","In balancing objectives to maximize the value from the 2019 capital program, we developed a $756 million capital plan. This budget is a 20% reduction from prior year, and we are on track to remain within this target.","In summary, we remain focused on converting consistently efficient operations on top-tier acreage into tangible shareholder returns through the application of a disciplined capital allocation framework, coupled with continued cost management efforts.","Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey Ventura","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Marshall Carver with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Marshall Carver","On the year-end call, you discussed spending approximately 35% of full year CapEx budget in 1Q, but spending came in below that. Was that due to well timing or well costs trending below your forecast? Do you have any color on that why the 1Q spend came in lower?","Dennis Degner","Marshall, this is Dennis. I'll start of by saying we tried to highlight this morning a couple of key themes on what helped us basically have the capital spend results that we did in the first quarter and a big portion of it clearly is our operational efficiencies. The drilling team continues to really do a great job of advancing the ball on our ability to drill long laterals, and we see that translate into a significant reduction in our drilling cost per foot. The other part is as we saw some efficiency gains this quarter versus last year through our fracturing operations, 20% is a pretty strong move much to our operating team, that helped us harvest some capital savings as well. And then thirdly, the waterside. I mean, it's an area that we continue to see good cooperation between other operators on top of the 100% recycling effort that we have and it translates into significant savings, as you look across the quarters and the balance of the year could translate into more savings on what we're seeing today. So pretty encouraged by that. The 1 pad that we had at the end of the quarter that we referenced in the superrich that we turned in line the 3 wells. There are some wells that moved into the first weeks of Q2, but the majority of those dollars are already spent. So we're going to get the advantage of seeing those volumes show up in Q2, which we're encouraged to see, but there will be a few capital dollars that also show up in Q2.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.","Ronald Mills","Dennis, you referenced NGL prices and I know relative, given the move up in WTI, it looks like you brought down the low end of the range, but your comments are pretty telling that even when using the strip, the absolute prices are higher than -- are actually looking for trend higher. Any additional color, whether it is about strip or your thoughts on NGL markets as we look through the rest of the year, particularly fourth quarter when the seasonality starts to benefit NGLs even more?","Alan Engberg","Ron, thank for the question. This is Alan Engberg, I'm the Vice President of our Liquids Marketing team. So I'll see if I can give you some color around liquids. Absolute prices are actually similar to what we guided back in February, there are up for the quarter actually, roughly about $3 per barrel. Now as you know and as you pointed out, crude is up quite a bit more. Crude is up about $15 a barrel for the quarter. Typically, NGLs will always lag crude on the way up and on the way down. However, this quarter there are a couple of one-off events that caused it lag more than usual. So if I start with LPG or starting with propane and butane. Exports, in particular, were one of the big drivers. They were negatively impacted by an unusual amount of fog this year along with Houston Ship Channel. Added to that, there was a big fire at ITC's tank farm that caused contamination of the water way and that further slowed down all traffic on the Houston Ship Channel. And by our estimates, there was approximately 20,000 barrels per day that were impacted over a 45-day period. So 9 million barrels that didn't ship. So that was just a big kind of change to the market that the market wasn't expecting. ","And note that the rest of the world has really come to depend on U.S. exports, and those delays actually caused a spike in overseas prices, both in Europe and in Asia, that have resulted in -- right know, what we're seeing is the highest LPG arms in roughly 4 years. Going forward, we expect things improve. This was a one-off event, it's over with. The ship channel is pretty much cleared. But on top of that, we've got new export capacity coming on. So as we mentioned in the call, ME 1 is backup but also up in the Northeast, you have ME 2 running, and that's transporting roughly 150,000 to 165,000 barrels per day to Marcus Hook for export. Last year at this time, those barrels were going into local storage. This year, they're going overseas. So it's a big impact of supply\/demand balance up in the Northeast.","Shifting down to the U.S. Gulf, Targa is debottlenecking their capacity, most of that will be next year but some of that has actually already happened. They've added a butane pipeline that adds roughly 30-a-day of new capacity. And then Enterprise is debottlenecking their capacity, they're adding 175,000 barrels per day with new export capacity. That will be starting up in the third quarter. So if you add up just that new export capacity, we've got 355,000 barrels per day that's going to be going into international markets that are actually hungry for the product. And for just for reference, 355,000 barrels per day, U.S. produces gas plant production of propane and butane is roughly 2.2 million barrels per day. I'm just citing EIA data for the most recent month that was published, which is January of '19. So 355,000 out of 2.2 million a day is 16% of supply that's going to be additional increment that's going to be going offshore. So for those reasons, we expect things to improve as we continue on through the year.","For ethane, things were a little bit different there. We had ethane prices come off during the second half of the first quarter. A big part of it is a story that we are already familiar with, there's this big new crackers coming online that have been delayed. So they were delays from last year, and then in the first quarter, we learned leaned of further delays. So we have 5 new crackers that are coming on but they're coming on later in quarter, sorry, later in this year. The fog also impacted ethane -- ethylene prices. So ethane is the main feedstock for making ethylene. Ethylene prices dropped down quite a bit down to $0.13 per pound, that put some pressure on ethane prices.","On top of that on supply-side, cooler weather allowed more pipeline flow from various locations to Mont Belvieu. It also allowed more fractionation capacity. We've got a little bit of new infrastructure, new pipeline came on in February, Chinook's pipeline from the Permian and Lone Star added new fractionator. And then finally, on the Permian, natural gas has been painful to watch. Actually, we've had WAHA index trading at negative values. And when it's trading at negative values, the Permian producers have every incentive to recover as much ethane as the pipelines can take. So we've seen that happening as well. But going forward, on ethane, the story does improve there as well. So out of those 5 new crackers, 2 of them are starting as we speak, and then that's roughly 90,000 or -- sorry, yes 90,000 barrels per day. And then we've got the other 3 are starting during the third quarter, and that will add 215,000 barrels per day of demand. Added to that, there will be more ethane exports with ME1 backup as well as some of the capacity that's freed up on ME1 due to ME2 starting up, there'll be more ethane moving on that pipeline. ","And then our friends at INEOS actually are bringing online a new VLEC. It will be the world's largest ethane carrier. It's actually moving towards the Houston ship channel now. That thing will be able to hold 850,000 barrels per load, and that will add roughly 15,000 barrels per day of demand, that product will be going to new steam cracker that's starting up in China later on this year. So overall, with roughly 320,000 barrels a day of new ethane demand coming on during the next 3 to 4 months, we expect to see some improvements in ethane prices, and for the reasons I mentioned earlier in propane and butane prices.","Ronald Mills","Great. And then one quick one. In terms of completion timing, is there any seasonality in terms of driving so many of the completions being weighted to the dry gas area in the first quarter? Or is it just a function of just moving through your acreage position given the shift in gas in superrich over the remainder of the year?","Dennis Degner","Yes, Ron. The planning team looks not only at the next 12 months but they'll be looking at the next couple of years. And based upon our type curves and our internal production forecast, we'll be looking at where we have available capacity in our infrastructure and gathering system. The goal will be to maximize utilization of that. So when we see a change in well mix, most of the time, it's going to be tied directly to those drivers. And I think an example of that I'd point to would be toward the end of last year, as we brought on some compression in the northern part of Washington County to support Harmon Creek 1. You saw us then of course through Q4 bringing on several wet gas wells that was then going to utilize that infrastructure that then ties to our long haul takeaway at Rover. So you'll see some fluctuations at time, but it tends to be tied to the infrastructure at how we can best utilize it and keep costs low.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rehan Rashid with B. Riley FBR.","Rehan Rashid","Two quick questions. One, the 20% improvement in frac efficiency I think that was mentioned earlier, kind of what changed and kind of how does that drive CapEx per well? If I could get some color on that, that's one? And two, maybe a little bit more color around kind of the divestiture timeline and any particular area that's focus in terms of divesting?","Dennis Degner","Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll start with the frac efficiencies and hand over to Mark. On the frac efficiencies, we had exactly quantified how all that savings will be translated into our cost per foot as of this morning, but we know that as you look between winter and I'll just say, non-winter operations, they're substantial savings and mainly because of some of the supporting hardware that goes along with our operations during the winter, whether it's supporting equipment, et cetera. When you look at our cost of completing and drilling wells, what we see is that over the balance of time, it translates into reduced cost per foot for us. So when you look a year ago, efficiencies were starting to kind of stabilize at that point. This year, we're seeing through the balance of continuous operations with some of our crews and also increase in our knowledge base on location, we're seeing that performance translate into it really improved performance on location. So really like what we see and expect that this should continue throughout the balance of the year. Now, with some seasonal differences, you might see little bit of a fluctuation, but the crews have performed extremely well, pointing back to our service partner relationships.","Mark Scucchi","This is Mark. On the divestiture front, as we've talked about before, we have a number of processes underway. And again, there are in various stages from negotiations, there's the data rooms to diligence with a variety of efforts underway. We're not good to pin down the timing, but what I can point to is a few facts that hopefully gives us some comfort and some guidance into what we're striving to achieve. So obviously, we were successful last year in closing on the royalty sale and closing October of last year. We will consider royalties again, we've mentioned northeast PA, we mentioned noncore acreage as potential candidates, all those dialogues are ongoing. Another read on the sense of urgency, not just kind of our alignment of interest but the importance of the factor as well as the timing is the addition of an absolute debt-reduction target in the management performance measurements and incentive program as you can see in the proxy. So there are specific targets there for us to strive to achieve at the high end to maximize that metric, that would be a $700 million reduction in debt for 2019. So while we're not going to give specific guidance on timing or dollar amounts of specific transactions, those are in broad strokes how we're thinking about it and what we're striving to achieve.","Rehan Rashid","Okay. Just maybe a different way to ask the same question on the divestiture thought process. Your cost of debt is so much more lower than implied by your cost directly, but when you're thinking of kind of acceptable pricing, what -- would you expect to be more closer to your cost of debt as you kind of divest these assets and the cash flow limits? Or kind of how much deeper would you have to go away from your cost of debt and closer to cost of equity, think about kind of what multiples you would get on your cash flows or anything else associated with it. Does that question makes sense? I'm not sure if I asked you properly.","Dennis Degner","Sure. I think I understand where you're headed. So the answer would depend on what type of asset you're talking about. For example, some of the acreage is nonproducing so there is no cash flow. So we're talking about a portion of our asset base or inventory does not reflect it clearly and no value in our equity. So that type of valuation metric might not be the most applicable. As it relates to others, you can look at that asset value, full-blown just kind of cash flow valuation and of course, we will look at cash flow in multiples as well. So based on the markets and the interested investors in each of these or acquirers in each of these packages, I would say that these are all we fully expect to be deleveraging type transactions and very reasonable relative to our corporate cost of capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","You mentioned that your ability to continue to push out lateral lengths with some of the 18,000 feet lateral test, can you remind us year base expectations for how you see well cost per foot, and EURs per foot evolving? And then how long do you think you can push out those laterals until you would either see sufficient operational risk or acreage limitations?","Dennis Degner","Brian, at this point, we're really confident in the 18,000-foot lateral length that we've been able to drill. I think on the prior call, we referenced that we certainly had a substantial number of laterals that were in excess of 15,000 feet. When you look at -- and we've been able to do this across as we think about our acreage position, both in the core of Washington County where we had historical wells, but we've also been able to do it in areas where maybe we have a cleaner sheet of paper in fewer wells that we're drilling around. So by having a blocky acreage position, the way we do and it being continuous, it really affords us an opportunity, coupled with the gathering system to really -- to maximize that lateral length opportunity. We've typically been a incrementing type operating team. So rarely will you see us go from 5,000 feet to say 20,000 feet in any kind of operation because we understand that we want to manage the risk. And part of being us -- part of us being successful in an unconventional resource play is being repeatable.","So getting to the 18,000 feet point that we've gotten today, we really like the results we're seeing. As we look back on the performance of these wells, I'll shift there for a quick second. The wells that we reported toward the end of last year that we drilled. One, it was at 17,800, and the other one as at 18,100, both of those wells are at\/or above the type curve, super rich type curve still today. We looked at those results just over the last few days. So we really like what we see on a normalized basis out of the wells. The drilling team continues to push down cost per foot. We've seen, as we've mentioned earlier, as much as a 30% increase. So we really like the direction we're headed. Average drilling length this year, I believe we reported was going to be about 13,000 feet for the program. But when you look at a lot of our references, it's not uncommon again for us to point to 10,000 feet, we feel like that's a good spot as well, but we will have those cases like a few of the super-rich wells we've pointed out that IP'ed at 7,000 feet, so we will have some filling space. But our goal will always be to maximize on the lateral length because we see that is the most capital-efficient approach.","Brian Singer","Great. And then to follow up on the divestiture question. Given that this has been an area of focus for some time, can you just broadly discuss how the market environment and marketing interest in Appalachia upstream assets either directly or via royalty compares today relative to 12 to 18 months ago?","Dennis Degner","Sure. So I'd say, depending on area, the evolution of investor interest and the bid-ask spread has evolved. So for example, in North East Pennsylvania with Atlantic Sunrise coming online, seeing actual sales curve, basis tightening, not just in the forward curves but in the spot market and the actual physical transactions, that gives potential buyers greater confidence in the economics that they're forecasting. So that I would say is an improvement. The variety of interested parties and types of investors remains pretty diverse and strong, there are multiple potential parties in each data room. In Southwest Pennsylvania, I would say that those discussions continue to evolve. Just as an example, after we announced last fall successful Royalty sale, we actually received several inbound phone calls of party saying, \"Hey, I wish we had known that, that something that you would consider.\" So in general, I would say that the A&D market is alive and functioning.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jane Trotsenko with Stifel.","Yevgeniya Trotsenko","In the press release, you mentioned that Range is actually engaged in developing in-basin demand to support the use of natural gas in local markets. Could you please expand a little bit on that?","Dennis Degner","One of the things that we see, as you can imagine, with the kind of, let's just say, resource certainty that you have in a place like Southwest PA, you're now starting to see more and more discussions around industry development. An easy example to point to would be that with utilized demand. An easy example to point to would be the Shell cracker as an example. We're seeing more and more inquiries now come in for industry development that could be right there on top of our acreage footprint or at least in a very, very close proximity that would allow for us to have some in-basin liquidity as we move forward. Whether that's power generation again or other industries that have a strong interest in moving to the region. We are going to continue to look at those opportunities and make sure that they have a good thorough scrubbing and how they can potentially fit with reducing our cost and be a part of our portfolio going forward.","Yevgeniya Trotsenko","And my second one is on Northeast Pennsylvania, I'm curious, which pricing point that gas is priced at?","Jeffrey Ventura","Much of our gas sold out of Northeast Pennsylvania is priced like Leidy.","Yevgeniya Trotsenko","Leidy. Okay. Got it. And maybe the last question is on Terryville. Maybe you can update your current thoughts, update us on your current thoughts on Terryville, how we should be thinking about activity levels going forward, and if you are marketing this asset as well?","Dennis Degner","Yes. On-the-go forward, I'll try to take a step back and see. From a Terryville activity standpoint, in the beginning of the year, we've kind of laid the groundwork that it's a area where we're going to spend around 10% of the capital this year with the 90% going to Appalachia. We have some technical thoughts that we're continuing to explore throughout the year and continuing to test. We've got a drilling rig that's been operating there for the past few months and we'll most likely start to wrap up sometime mid-year, pending our results we see over the months ahead. The asset really has to be at the place where it competes on a risk-adjusted basis, and we've got to find repeatability in the results that we see there. As you would imagine, as we look over the balance of 2018 and '19, there are things that we really like and are still excited about from the asset standpoint. But it still has to compete with the Marcellus, and that's what we're trying to work through here in the months ahead.","Yevgeniya Trotsenko","But just to clarify, you are not marketing those assets as of right now, right?","Mark Scucchi","This is Mark, no. It is not being actively marketed right now but to Dennis' point, you can see the strengthening capital allocation, the approach, the science that's being done there and just assuming out as we evaluate the inventory and think about it -- and think about the purpose of the almost 10% of the capital budget allocated to that property this year, it was around managing that client profit and managing the cash flow from that asset. So just in terms of how we manage the portfolio overall, we'll continue to optimize and do everything we can to maximize the value.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Panjwani with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Sameer Panjwani","I was hoping you could reconcile the debt-reduction target with the leverage targets for 2019 and I think you mentioned earlier that $700 million was your top-level target for debt reduction, which I believe implies about $600 million of asset sale proceeds given your organic free cash flow expectations for the year. But on the leverage side of the proxy, it looks like you have 2.5x as your top-level target and my math would imply over $1 billion of assets of proceeds to kind of hit that without assuming any EBITDA loss. So can you just reconcile the difference between the two or provide some context of that how we should think about those 2 metrics?","Mark Scucchi","So the two are conceptually linked, of course, in producing absolute debt but they're not mathematically hardwired because the leverage ratio can change based on commodity prices and other outside factors frankly beyond our control. We will hedge at over 80% on the cash side this year, so that certainly helps add certainty to the trajectory. But the idea there is we evaluate credit holistically. The debt-to-EBITDA ratio was certainly one measure of improving and strengthening the balance sheet. But just an example of why it's important to look at it from an absolute debt perspective as well, you could improve the leverage ratio as debt-to-EBITDA by growing faster and having no absolute debt reduction. So the concept behind pairing those 2 is to demonstrate the fact that we are talking about debt reduction in the absolute as well as improving an entire host of credit metrics among them, debt-to-EBITDA. So they're intended to function together as the holistic evaluation of the balance sheet is considered.","Sameer Panjwani","Okay. Yes. I guess, my read into it was that the leverage target was implying that expect the additional asset sales beyond what's kind of implied in the absolute debt reduction target, is that not the right way to think about it?","Mark Scucchi","We haven't given any hard dollar amount associated with either individually or any aggregate, the asset sales processes we have underway. So I'll defer that to you to assign whatever evaluations you'd like to the packages, but suffice it to say, again, it's about crystallizing the value of non-core assets or assets where that capital can be better deployed elsewhere in Range.","Operator","We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Kashy Harrison of Simmons Energy for our final question.","Kashy Harrison","So I had a quick follow-up for Alan. You gave some really great color on incoming ethane demand. I was just wondering, in your opinion, and just your global experience in the field, do you find the forward market trend sales to be more, to be fairly efficient? And do you think there is properly pricing in that demand? Or do you find the forward market could be or maybe perhaps a bit more volatile? And then kind of tagging onto that, does the 36% of TI assumption bake in your expectation for improving ethane demand? Or is that just based on whatever you are seeing in the forward market?","Alan Engberg","This is Alan. It's a good question. Forward curves for natural gas liquids -- speculating on natural gas liquids aren't quite as liquid as, let's say, natural gas or crude oil. And similar to natural gas though the activity down the curve is largely producer driven activity. The chemical players in the market, those that are naturally short and that are physical buyers of the products aren't active hedgers maybe because they have a spread that they would need to hedge and the polymer markets are even less liquid, let's say, than the NGL markets. So for that reason, the shape of the curve often is dictated by the trading activity in people's view of the market but to a large extent also by hedging activity of producers. So to answer your question, no, I don't believe it's always a good guide of what forward prices are actually going to be. It shifts what today's value is that you can get the market for that forward strip. So our guide is based on the strip and I would say with reference to the numbers that we've published, we believe that there's upside to that guide for all the reasons that I mentioned in my -- in answering that previous question around ethane, propane and butane. Does that answer your question?","Kashy Harrison","That does. thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.","Jeffrey Ventura","I just want to thank everybody for participating on the call this morning and feel free to follow up for any questions that you might have with our IR team. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"18468":["Range Resources (NYSE:RRC) Q4 2012 Earnings Call February 27, 2013  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Rodney L.

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Rodney L. Waller","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported outstanding results for the fourth quarter, with record production and a continuing decrease in unit cost. Both earnings and cash flow per share results were greater than First Call consensus.","Know that our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also, Mr. Pinkerton, our Executive Chairman, is on the call today. After the speakers, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","Range did file our 10-K with the SEC and is available this morning. It should be available on the home page of our website, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. And additionally, we posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed. Detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter are also included on the website.","Now let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thank you, Rodney.","We accomplished a lot in 2012 that really helps to set up 2013 and beyond for Range. We continue making progress with our plan of driving up production and reserves on a per-share basis while driving down costs. This is beginning to significantly flow through to our bottom line and will do so in an even more impactful way in 2013.","Looking back at 2012, we sold $600 million of 5% senior subordinated 10-year notes. We also entered into an agreement with Sunoco and INEOS on Mariner East. To the best of my knowledge, Range will become the first company to export ethane from the U.S. by ship to international markets. This project also enabled us to export propane or to sell propane into the East Coast and North East U.S. markets. Importantly, Mariner East, along with our first 2 ethane projects, Mariner West and ATEX, enables Range to grow our Marcellus volumes in the wet portion of the play.","In 2012, we sold our Ardmore Basin assets and some other miscellaneous assets for approximately $170 million. Last evening, we announced that we entered into an agreement to sell our New Mexico assets, plus the Powell Ranch property for $275 million.","At year end 2012, our proved reserves increased 29% to 6.5 Tcfe. We replaced 773% of our production from drilling at an all-in cost of $0.86 per mcfe. Crude oil and NGL reserve volumes increased 64%, while natural gas reserves increased 20%.","Our percentage of proved undeveloped reserves at end 2012 was reduced to 47%. Our unrisked unproved resource potential increased to 48 Tcfe to 68 Tcfe. This is comprised of 35 Tcf to 46 Tcf of natural gas, and 2.3 billion to 3.5 billion barrels of NGLs in crude oil.","As a result of our development activity, we have moved 4.7 Tcf of unproved resource potential to proved reserves over the last 3 years. To put that in perspective, 4.7 Tcfe is more than our entire company's total reserves just 2 years ago. Because of this excellent performance, our total DD&A rate has declined from $2.32 per mcfe in 2009 to $1.62 in 2012, and the fourth quarter of 2012 was $1.46.","Looking at the same time period, our operating expenses per mcfe declined from $0.83 to $0.41 in the fourth quarter of 2012 with $0.38. We've also made significant progress with our other unit costs, which Roger will discuss.","Range turned in a very solid, profitable performance in 2012 marked by 36% production growth, a 32% reduction in unit lease operating cost and a 9% reduction in total unit cost. We increased reserves per share net adjusted by 22% over 2011 and increased production per share net adjusted by 29%. The bottom line is that Range is becoming much more capital efficient, and the results are beginning to flow through to net income.","Looking forward into 2013, we believe the bottom line results should be even better. The lower DD&A rate for the full year, along with a lower per-unit operating expense for the entire year, coupled with improving well results should result in a substantial increase in Range's cash flow and profitability for this year.","As we've previously announced, we're expecting production to grow at a rate of 20% to 25% for 2013. More importantly, we believe that we have line-of-sight growth of 20% to 25% for many years. All of this projected growth is in our existing plays. The reinvestment risk is low, and the projected rates of return are very good.","The growth is mostly driven by our approximately 1 million net acre land position in Pennsylvania, specifically by low-risk, high-return drilling in the Marcellus Shale. In addition to the Marcellus Shale, we're projecting impactful growth from our approximately 160,000 net acre position in the Mississippian oil play in northern Oklahoma and Kansas. Given the high rate of return of our plays, which is led by our liquids-rich and oil plays, our cash flow should grow at a faster rate each year than our projected production growth of 20% to 25% per year. With our projections using current strip pricing, we reduce our leverage with time as we drive up production and cash flow.","In addition to the Marcellus and Mississippian plays, we believe that we have great prospectivity in the Upper Devonian, Utica, Cline Shale and Wolfberry. Ray will update you on the progress in all of these plays.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.","Ray N. Walker","Thanks, Jeff.","Our technical and operating teams have positioned us with large, high-quality acreage positions in the core sweet spots of some of the highest-quality plays with the best economics onshore U.S. We're continuing to see improvements in well performance, cost, LOEs and margins, resulting in increasing cash flow and higher returns. We're seeing significant growth in reserves in a time where reserve write-downs are common. We've made some highly innovative and strategic decisions in the midstream and downstream arenas that have opened up and solidified our logistics for marketing our oil, gas and NGLs with market-leading economics.","The result is a portfolio of opportunities represented by large-scale, low-risk, high-quality acreage positions that allow for long-term economies of scale. We believe these opportunities will yield consistent and significant growth for many years to come.","Let me start with a few comments on reserves. I think it's critical that we point out that even in light of greatly reduced natural gas prices, we had exceptional growth of reserves in 2012. We recognized a 29% gain in total reserves year-over-year while decreasing our PUD percentage by 10% and increasing liquids reserves by 64%.","We decreased the ratio of PUDs to proved developed in the Marcellus from 1.7 down to 1.2. We think all of this speaks volumes about our asset quality, especially when considering that we've moved 4.7 Tcf equivalent of potential to proved reserves over the past 3 years and yet we still increased our resource potential in 2012 by 12%. Again, it's a true reflection of our large de-risked and high-quality assets, as well as the exceptional performance of our teams.","Now let me point out a few things about the Marcellus. I'd like to make 4 points. Let me summarize first and then I'll go through in more detail.","Number one, we have a large, high-quality position that we control; number two, our position is largely de-risked; number three, well performance and economics continue to improve; and number four, our marketing team has us well positioned for future growth.","So now let me expand on those points.","Number one. Not only do we have approximately 1 million net acres in Pennsylvania, of which a large portion is prospective for the Marcellus, we believe our acreage encompasses very high-quality reservoir rock in both the dry and liquids-rich areas. We've been working for years now to consolidate and high grade our acreage positions and, in essence, we believe not only have quantity, we have exceptional quality in core areas.","Number two. Our position is largely de-risked in Southwest and Northeast Pennsylvania. To illustrate, in 2006, on my very first trip to Pennsylvania, I was up there to work on the very first horizontal well, which was the fifth well ever spud in the Marcellus. Today, there are approximately 7,000 Marcellus wells that are either drilling, completing or producing. Marcellus is producing close to 9 Bcf equivalent per day and is now the largest-producing gas field in the U.S. and still growing. For the last couple of years, Marcellus operators have begun exchanging data, analyses and results on a regular basis, resulting in everyone going up the learning curve a whole lot faster.","If you look at Slide 12 and also at Slide 30 in our presentation on the website, you can see why we say that our acreage is largely de-risked by thousands of wells with now up to 7 years of production history. This is a large part of why we believe we have line-of-sight growth and can consistently grow at 20% to 25% corporately in the future.","Number three, we are continuing to see improving well performance, better efficiencies and are implementing well designs that continue to improve our returns all across the Marcellus. In our investor presentation, we've updated our economics for the wet and super-rich areas, reflective of our 2012 performance. The wet area wells went up to 8.7 Bcf equivalent, which is made up of 712,000 barrels of liquids and 4.4 Bcf of gas, which calculates 49% liquids. And for the super-rich area, our EUR is now 1.44 million Boe, which is 824,000 barrels of liquids and 3.7 Bcf of gas, which is 57% liquids. Importantly, in the super-rich area, the condensate is 109,000 barrels as compared to 27,000 barrels in the wet area. Also, the new economics for the wet and super-rich areas now reflect full ethane extraction as we will commence extracting and selling ethane this year.","Of note, let me point out a 3-well pad in the super-rich area that came online since our last call at a combined rate of over 6,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's an average of over 2,000 Boe per day each. The wells on that pad had an average lateral length of 3,358 feet in 18 stages, and the combined production was 1,200 barrels of condensate, almost 3,000 barrels of NGLs and 11.7 million gas, which means the production is over 68% liquids, of which 29% of the liquids is condensate.","Just last month, we brought online another super-rich area pad with just 2 wells that averaged 3,356 foot laterals, with 17- and 18-stage completions that produced a combined total of 6,866 Boe per day, which is 793 barrels of condensate, 3,200 barrels of NGLs and 16.9 million of gas, which is 59% liquids, of which 20% of that was condensate. I think these 5 wells clearly illustrate the exciting potential of the super-rich area. We're continuing to see improving well performance and EURs as we implement better landing targets, RCS completions, longer laterals and more efficient frac designs. Our teams are continually introducing innovative technologies and strategic analysis techniques, and we still believe we'll see significant additional improvements in the future.","And number four, we have midstream infrastructure, transportation arrangements, sales contracts and marketing deals in place to handle our production well into the future. Our team has literally been working for years on highly strategic and innovative solutions for all of our products. The recent ethane arrangements are excellent examples of these types of innovative solutions, which opened up entirely new markets like the international markets via Mariner East. These solutions position us with industry-leading returns and some of the lowest fee arrangements, connecting us to some of the best markets, including the premium-priced international markets.","So in the Marcellus, number one, we have a large, high-quality position that we control; number two, it's largely de-risked by thousands of wells and actual production; number three, well performance and economics continue to improve; and number four, our marketing team has us positioned strategically to move our products with industry-leading terms for years to come.","In summary, we believe we're positioned for line-of-sight growth with great economics for many years.","In the Mississippian play, we have approximately 160,000 net acres located along the Nemaha Ridge. Like the Marcellus, we believe it's really important where your acreage is located, and we believe our position on the ridge is highly prospective. Please refer to the press release for the details of the wells brought online in the fourth quarter.","I'd like to point out that we're still seeing great results, and we recently brought online a well at over 810 Boe per day. Also, we're announcing the 30-day rates of the 2 fourth quarter wells, and those wells are averaging over 800 and 600 Boe per day for the 30 days. We have 5 rigs running, and the current plan is to bring online 51 wells and 17 salt water disposal wells this year.","We will deploy the majority of our capital and resources in 2013 in the wet and super-rich Marcellus and the Mississippian oil play, with the split being approximately 80% to the Marcellus and 15% to the Mississippian.","I'd like to now move on and bring you up to speed on the other projects in our portfolio, namely the Wolfberry, the Cline and the wet Utica in Northwest Pennsylvania. Our position in all 3 of these plays is predominantly HBP. And therefore, we fully control the timing of development.","While we had to bear essentially all the cost of the learning curve in the Marcellus and, to some extent, in the Mississippian, we can enjoy a less risky approach in these 3 areas. Because we are largely HBP, we can allow industry to move up the learning curve and bear those costs while we focus our capital and our resources in our lower-risk, lower-costs and higher-rate-of-return projects like the wet and super-rich Marcellus. This is a great position to be in.","So in West Texas, the Wolfberry and Cline continue to see significant activity offsetting our Conger Field. In the Wolfberry, we drilled and completed 5 wells in 2012. We saw the cost of the Wolfberry wells decrease by over 30% in just those few wells in 2012. Our plan in 2013 is to drill 5 additional Wolfberry wells and do a few recompletions while we monitor the considerable offset activity throughout the year.","Our third Cline well had a max 24-hour rate of 620 Boe per day, and it was a 4,000-foot lateral with 16 stages. Industry is drilling quite a few wells in the area with much longer laterals and more stages. In fact, if you look at Slide 53 in our presentation, you can see there's a lot of activity directly offsetting our position. In the Cline, we believe there will be close to 50 wells drilled all around our Conger Field this year by Devon, Oxy, Apache, Laredo, FireWheel and others. Our team is actively working with the offset operators to exchange data and better understand the play. Importantly, there are now significant tests near our position with impressive production rates, indicating that the play could have significant upside.","In summary, we're excited about the potential, and it appears we'll learn a lot more about this play throughout the year.","Let me now update you on the first test well of the wet Utica in Northwest Pennsylvania. It had 285 feet of thickness, it's got all the right liquids-rich characteristics, good reservoir pressure, and the initial test rate was 1.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Along with the cores and logs, we did perform a significant amount of diagnostics during the completion. Those diagnostics determined that our completion was not optimal as it frac-ed mostly out of zone. However, there is good direction as to how we optimize the next step in order to achieve a better completion by moving the target and changing our frac designs. We have seen this in other areas like the Marcellus, and it certainly indicates a really good way going forward. We're working closely with our partner, Cabot, and offset operators to exchange data and results.","If you look at Slide 46 on our presentation, you can identify this well and our 181,000 net acre position, along with significant offset activity by operators like Halc\u00f3n, Hilcorp, Seneca, Shell and Chevron. We believe there will be approximately a dozen wells drilled, offsetting our position this year, and we'll, of course, be monitoring closely as we work on the timing of the next test. Being this is a new area, we have a lot to learn, and the good news is we like what we see. The area has all the right ingredients, the right TOC, the right liquids characteristics, the right pressures, and we have a lot of science indicating what the next step should be.","I continue to be very proud of our efforts in safety, environmental protections, community stewardship and communications. On the safety front, for example, our OSHA incident rate for 2012 was 19% better than the peer group, and our lost time rate was 21% better than the peer group. Although the only acceptable rate is 0, we are seeing steady and measurable improvement. It's a core value here at Range, and we definitely see it translate to the bottom line.","Like Jeff said, 2012 was an important year and it sets the stage well for a terrific 2013. We believe that with our assets and our great team, we can grow significantly and consistently for many years to come.","Now over to Roger.","Roger S. Manny","Thanks, Ray.","Any way you look at it, the fourth quarter was a great one, both operationally and financially. Strong production growth, improved capital efficiency, lower unit costs and better realized prices led to significant top line and bottom line growth.","The fourth quarter of 2012 saw a notable improvement in cash margins and cash flow from the prior quarter. Cash margin was $3.12 in mcfe, up 22% from the third quarter, and cash flow was $248 million, up 31% from the third quarter figure.","Cash flow per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter was $1.54, $0.18 above analyst consensus estimate and 14% above the fourth quarter of last year. EBITDAX for the fourth quarter was $287 million.","For the entire year, cash flow totaled $756 million, 2% higher than the 2011 figure, and EBITDAX for all of 2012 was $910 million. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter and full year 2012 was $53 million and $13 million, respectively.","Fourth quarter earnings, calculated using analyst methodology, were $73 million, or $0.46 per fully diluted share, that's $0.17 above the analysts' consensus estimate. As Rodney mentioned, the Range corporate website contains detailed non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations of these non-GAAP figures that I just referenced.","Looking closely at the income statement, there was a line item reclassification this quarter. As our Appalachian production volume has grown, we have engaged in limited third-party gas purchases and resales solely to accommodate seasonal swings in regional supply and demand. To better reflect this activity, we have reclassified the associated revenue and expense under the income statement caption Brokered Natural Gas and Marketing. This activity previously netted into other revenue and it's conducted to support our marketing effort, and it's not intended to operate as a separate profit center. We expect this activity on its own will at best be breakeven and seasonal.","Moving to the cost structure performance in the fourth quarter, cash direct operating costs, including workovers, came in at $0.38 per mcfe. That's $0.02 below last quarter and $0.07 below the fourth quarter of last year. One of the truths in the E&P business is that it costs more to operate an oil or gas -- wet gas well than it does a flowing dry gas well. So with our liquids production rising, sooner or later, our unit operating costs are going to flatten and possibly begin to increase slightly. Fortunately, quarter-after-quarter, our production teams have done such a terrific job reducing operating cost. We have thus far enjoyed the higher profit margins that come with liquids without the higher unit costs associated with greater liquids production. And if we're able to continue this trend, the first quarter 2013 cash direct operating cost, including workovers, should be relatively flat at $0.38 to $0.40 in mcfe.","Third party gathering, transportation and compression expense was $0.71 in mcfe. That's the same as last quarter, and $0.11 higher than last year, reflecting the continued build out of our gathering lines and related systems. This expense is anticipated to be up slightly in the first quarter to between $0.75 and $0.77 in mcfe.","Production in ad valorem taxes for the fourth quarter totaled $0.12 per mcfe, $0.02 higher than last year due to higher Pennsylvania impact fees. The Pennsylvania impact fee amounted to $6.5 million during the fourth quarter, or $0.09 per mcfe based on total company production.","Now first quarter 2013 production taxes, including a $6.2 million impact fee estimate, should be in the $0.14 to $0.15 per mcfe range, reflecting both higher prices and first quarter Pennsylvania drilling activity.","Exploration expense in the fourth quarter, excluding non-cash comp, was $17 million, or $7 million below last year, mostly due to lower seismic expenditures. Now based on our 2013 seismic budget, first quarter 2013 exploration expense should be in the $18 million to $20 million range.","Abandonment and impairment of unproved property during the fourth quarter was $21 million, and we anticipate this quarterly expense to decline in 2013, with a first quarter estimate of $15 million to $17 million.","Cash G&A expense was $0.40 in mcfe in the fourth quarter, $0.06 lower than last quarter and $0.17 lower than last year's fourth quarter.","We continue to see improvement in unit cost G&A as we gain economies of scale in our high-growth, large-scale plays. We expect first quarter cash G&A to be around $0.40 to $0.42 in mcfe.","As last year's Range capital program was heavily front-end loaded, our fourth quarter production increased much faster than our debt, which effectively reduced our interest expense per mcfe in the fourth quarter down to $0.58 in mcfe. First quarter 2013 should see this figure decline further to approximately $0.55 to $0.57.","The highly favorable 2012 drilling results reported in our January 30 reserves release have already begun flowing through the income statement. Reflecting continued improvement in our capital efficiency, our fourth quarter DD&A rate declined to $1.46 per mcfe. This rate is $0.23 lower than last year and places Range among the very best of our peer group that employ the Successful Efforts Accounting method. The DD&A rate will vary slightly from quarter-to-quarter based on production mix. And we expect the DD&A rate in the first quarter to be between $1.46 and $1.48 in mcfe.","Now turning over to the balance sheet for a moment. There are 2 items to highlight. First, in late December, we used $259 million of our revolving bank credit facility to fully redeem, including expenses, our $250 million of callable 7 1\/2% senior sub-notes that were scheduled to mature in 2017. The early redemption will reduce interest expense. And with over $1 billion in available borrowing capacity remaining under the bank borrowing base, the redemption does not materially affect our liquidity.","Second, during the fourth quarter, we closed on our Ardmore Woodford asset sale. And as Jeff mentioned, most recently, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portion of our Permian Basin assets for approximately $275 million, subject to usual closing adjustments.","Now adjusting our year end 2012 debt balance for the completed and expected asset sale proceeds reduces our debt to trailing 4-quarter EBITDAX ratio to a pro forma figure of 2.9x. As we have said before, while we are comfortable with our leverage in the low 3x range, bringing the ratio back below 3x in 2013 has been one of our objectives. And when the Permian asset sale closes, we should be back below the 3x level.","Now for many years, Range has relied upon a disciplined hedging program to provide certainty of cash flow so that we may more effectively plan and execute our capital program. And from 2009 through 2012, our hedging program has provided just over $900 million in revenue to help fund our projects. During the fourth quarter of 2012 and year-to-date 2013, we have continued to add to our hedge position with approximately 70% of our 2013 natural gas hedged at a floor price of $4.18 in Mmbtu, and over 80% of our 2013 oil production hedged at a floor price of $94.65 a barrel.","Please reference our press release and website for detailed hedge volumes and prices for 2013 through 2015.","In summary, thanks to the hard work of our employees, the fourth quarter was -- of 2012 was an outstanding quarter by all measures, significant increases in production at lower unit cost, driving improved cash flow and earnings. With one asset sale closed last quarter and another under contract, leverage has declined from its third quarter 2012 peak. Going forward, continued capital discipline, cost control and production growth should lead to another year of success.","Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Dan, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ron Mills of Johnson Rice.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Just on the Mississippian. You've talked about your portion of the play, and the results in your portion of the play along the Nemaha Ridge have been different and a little bit better than to the western part in terms of EURs and potential spacing. When you look at your Mississippian and the 80-acre spacing and the longer laterals, can you talk about some of the variability? And how much of that is driven by the chat and how the presence of that chat in -- if that creates variability, how you work through that?","Ray N. Walker","Yes. Sure, Ron. This is Ray. It's a good question. The Nemaha Ridge -- well, let me back up and kind of step out broader. The Mississippian, and Jeff said it before, and I think most of us agree, is a huge stratigraphic play and it's going to have structural enhancements. And we believe one of those structural enhancements is the Nemaha Uplift. And one of the enhancements on the Uplift is the fact that there is more chat present in general, and the chat has a lot higher porosity, better perms. So i.e., more storage capacity for hydrocarbons there. It is a very diverse and unconventional type structure, so we are still really, really early. When you look at the amount of acreage that we have in our 160,000-acre position there, just a few wells literally that we've drilled to date. So what we've done is very similar to what we did in the Marcellus, and we're going to show you what the wells are doing, good, bad and ugly as time goes on. So what you see in our presentation is what the wells look like that we did, the early vintage, 2009 to '11, which were primarily shorter laterals, and came in at around, I think, 485 Mboe-type wells. And then the 2012 wells, which look like they're on -- around a 600 Mboe-type curve, and all of that is in our presentation, so what we'll continue to do is set that out there. But literally, we don't have enough wells yet to understand or be able to predict what the whole thing will do. So we're going to take again an approach we did very much like the Marcellus and just tell you what the data looks like as time goes on. So quarter-by-quarter, we'll continue to update those curves, and we'll just put that data out there. And you'll know what we know going forward.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes. Let me tack onto that a little bit. I think -- if you look on Slide 48, it's on our website, and what it shows is the historical cumulative oil production per well from the Mississippian. This is looking at all the historical vertical wells, and there's a lot of them. And by far and away, the best vertical wells in the play are on the northern part of the Nemaha Uplift in Kay County, Cowley and Sumner up into Kansas, right through that little area. The vertical wells in Kay County are the highest. They're at 85,000 barrels per well. If you think about a horizontal well, really, it's a multiplier of a vertical. So a horizontal could be, in any play, really 3x a vertical, 4x, 5x, 6x or whatever. So one good indication of where the best horizontal wells are going to be is look where the best vertical wells are. So -- and to compare that, if you go way off to the western side of that map, or that stratigraphic trap shown in green, as Ray mentioned, the vertical wells, say, in Woods, Barber, Comanche counties are 13,000 barrels, 22,000 versus 85,000. So they're significantly different. And then there's a slide right next to it, on 49, that shows -- as you go far west, the other thing that happens is the play gets gassier. So we are, there's better vertical wells, higher oil cuts. Then the question is why, and it's back to those things that Ray said. We think when you're up on the Uplift, or the things you mentioned, Rod, early on, when you're on the Uplift, you're -- one, you're higher structurally, which we think is a positive; two, you have a chat component that when you're on the uplift that you have, but when you're off it, you tend to lose. In fact, it's not just being on the uplift, you've got to be on the northern part of the uplift to have that chat component, plus, you have a higher degree of fracturing up on the uplift which enhances permeability. So we think that's what supports better vertical wells, so far, or better horizontal wells. And then like Ray said, we'll just update you with time as they are just like we did in the Marcellus.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And is that also driving a little bit tighter spacing on your portion or what's driving the potential for tighter spacing versus...","Ray N. Walker","Yes. If you go to Slide 47, and what drives that, because you have that chat component, you have higher porosity, you have better storage and you have a higher oil cut, you have more hydrocarbon in place. On Slide 47, when you look at where we are, the EUR under those various types of completions, even if you use 600,000 boes per well, we're only recovering 6% to 11% of the oil in place, so a very reasonable recovery with that kind of well, so that's what drives the tighter spacing is really 2 things, it's higher hydrocarbon in place, and then just simplistically, we have a higher oil cut. Again, going back to where we are on Slide 49, in Kay County and Cowley County, Kansas, those 2 areas, 92%, 95% of the wells are oil wells. So if you go up to the west side of the map, somewhere between 38% and 47% of the wells are oil wells. So it's a lot gassier. And generally speaking, the gassier you are, the wider the spacing. The oilier you are, the tighter the spacing. The more hydrocarbon in place, the tighter the spacing, the less, the wider the spacing. So that's why we think what we think and it's supported by the wells we've drilled so far and we'll just keep updating you.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And then just to clarify on the Utica, it sounds like technically, it has all the characteristics you want. Is it just a matter of finding where within the 285-foot of pay is the optimal place to land the lateral to allow you to effectively stimulate the Utica\/Point Pleasant? And is there something, if I look at your map, it looks like a lot of industry activity to this point is really focused on the central to southern part of your acreage through Crawford, Venango, and Mercer County. Is that just because we have more core data from vertical wells in that area or is there something that you think changes as you move North and East into Warren County?","Ray N. Walker","Well, let me start with the first question. I mean we are very encouraged by what we see. It's the first well in a pretty big area. And when you combine what we learned on this well with what we're -- the little bit of data we have so far from working with the offset operators, it's a very encouraging area. I mean, we saw TOCs by volume in the 10% range. We got a good pressure. We got 63 gravity condensate. Everything is lining up exactly like it should. But when you drill a first well like that, we went up the learning curve and we spent a lot of money in the Marcellus trying to figure out the ultimate best landing target. And here we are, several years later, we're still optimizing that and making big improvements. And a lot of these recent well improvements that we see in the super-rich and wet areas is very much that, it's landing the target in the right place and pumping the right-sized frac job so that you optimally stimulate what you're trying to go after and not stimulate a bunch of other rock and connect up a bunch of rock that does you no good. What we saw in the Utica was we simply put the target in what we thought was the best spot at that point with the data that we have. But clearly, when it frac-ed, we now know that the frac did not go where we wanted it to. So that means we take that data, we have a lot of right mechanics data, full core data, all that stuff that tells us we need to put our target in a different spot in the next test. So our plan, again, is to HBP so we can kind of sit back and we can kind of control our own destiny, and we've talked with our partner, they're very much on board with this. They also are very encouraged by it. And so we're going to sit back and trade information with some offset operators, see what some of their experiences are, and then we'll kind of figure out what the timing of our next test should be. But the good news is, I can't say it strong enough, I mean we're really encouraged that we think we know exactly what to do next time. And 1.4 million cubic feet a day equivalent test, while disappointing, is not a bad test. I mean it did make 1.5 million a day, so it's a pretty decent well. So we're pretty encouraged by the area. But again, it's HBP, we can sit back. We don't have really hardly any capital allocated to it this year. This year, we're really focusing on the super-rich and wet Marcellus, that's where 80% of our liquids are going. And our 80% of our capital and resources are going. And I always want to direct you back to -- did I tell you about those 5 wells that we just brought online? And then if you're looking in the super-rich area, in 2012, we've brought online 51 wells there and we're saying the average is 1.44 million boe per well. I mean that's phenomenal stuff and that's where we're focusing our time and resources and science this year in that area, because it's really phenomenal and with these recent wells, we're getting real excited about what we've got there.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Let me, again, add on a little bit to what Ray is saying. To look at that first Utica test, 285 feet of pay, and we got 1.4 million, 63 gravity condensate, good pressure, all that kind of stuff. Go back and look at the initial Marcellus wells. To put it in context, the Marcellus in Washington County is about a 80 to 100 feet thick, 110 feet thick where a lot of the stuff we're drilling. Here, it's 3x thicker. Going back to the first 3 Marcellus, and I've told the story several times and it's sort of fun telling. The first 3 wells, if you just look within that 100 feet, one of those wells was landed at the bottom, it made 20 Mcf a day, the one in the middle made about 200, the one at the top made about 700. And that was our first 3 Marcellus tries. We ended up just moving the fourth well. Actually Bill Zagorski, the -- now considered the father of the Marcellus, drew a little 3-point correlation, and said, \"Hey, move it up a little bit, change where you landed it within that 100 foot interval, just move it up at the top a little more,\" and the fourth well was 3.4 million a day. And then now when we're drilling and completing with what we learned right in that same area, the wells are 10 million a day plus a lot of liquids, I'm going on an equivalent basis. So you think about here, now you've got instead of a 100-foot to play with like in the Marcellus, you got 285 feet. So the fact that we've got 1.4 million a day from something that's really ineffectively stimulated if we land it properly and stimulate it effectively, what could the well be? Clearly, in the Marcellus, we cracked the code, and now it's the largest producing gas field in the country, that we have a million net acres in the state, a lot of which is prospected for. So we're excited about the position, 190,000 net acres, it has all the right ingredients. And it's part of our dream factor. Now, we're part of the upside. Like Ray said, we're going to be driven by that 1 million acre position that's going to give us the 20% to 25% line-of-sight growth for many years. I'm going to be delevering with time, even with the little bit of outspend, it puts us in a great position. And we've got great upside in all those in the Utica, coupled with all the things that Ray said earlier. We're still excited about the Cline, the Wolfberry, the Upper Devonian, looks very, very encouraging, and in the Mississippian as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've got a couple. If I could go back to the Mississippian real quick, when you think about capital allocation, you guys have talked about moving up to 10 rigs and maybe 15 rigs over the next couple of years, hold acreage, how should we think about how you're allocating capital in terms of -- does that take money away from something else in terms of activity levels? And this is as a follow-on to Ron's question, can you just confirm that you are using geoscience down at the Mississippi at this point?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","What was the last sentence? We heard you up to the last sentence.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Are you guys -- there's been a lot of debate over the effectiveness of using geoscience in the Mississippi. I just wanted to check where you guys are in that side of the debate.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Define what is geoscience -- using geoscience?","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Seismic to avoid faulting basically.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes. Let me start with capital allocation. We've always been driven by the same strategy. And our strategy is we want to consistently grow production and reserves per share on a debt-adjusted basis, with one of the best cost structures out there, build and high-grade the inventory. We direct our -- simplistically, we direct our capital into our highest rate of return, best economic projects that we have that are large-scale and repeatable. Clearly, that's right now the Marcellus. And no matter what happens, it's almost hard to think that it would be anything other than the Marcellus because we have a million net acres in the state of Pennsylvania, all of which is not only highly prospective for the Marcellus but it's highly prospective, a lot of it, for the Upper Devonian and the Utica. So really, because it's a little bit stacked pays in areas we're in, you can argue that instead of having a million net acres, we have 3 million net acres or 2.5 million net acres or something like that. And again, I mean, the Marcellus has up to 7 years' worth of history. And like Ray said, 7,000 wells now that define when we drill in there, we have great upside and great prospectivity. And just to drive home the point, when you look at Slide -- and I'm flipping through the package, when you look at just the south -- or when you look at Slide 13, and this just considers the southwest portion of our position. It ignores -- just looking at 540,000 net acres, using 80-acre spacing, which I think is extremely conservative, I would argue and we have pilots we haven't talked about, you can down space that and we've got good evidence, we just haven't put it out yet. And some of those down space pilots are 2 years old. But ignoring that, we still have 6,750 wells to drill. So if you look at what we've drilled so far, we've only drilled 6% of our acreage. So as of roughly year end, on a net basis, we have 470 million per day coming from 6% of our acreage. If you do the simplistic math and assumed it was all the same and you can argue, there's enough data down there to tell you there's going to be high-quality wells all through there, and you divide 470 million by 0.06, that's 7.8 boes per day. I've said many, many times, I think our Marcellus position is, again, just looking at a part of it, without down spacing, has the potential to get us to 2 to 3 boes per day. And we said corporately, we're going to grow line of sight 20% to 25% for many years, which gets you to that rate in relatively short order when you're growing at that kind of compounded rate. So our capital is going to be driven -- our capital allocation is driven by high rate of return, large-scale repeatable projects. That's why 80% roughly of our capital is going to go into the play, and then a high percentage of our capital will continue to go in there. That being said, if you look at the Mississippian, what we said, we have 160,000 net acres, we think is very well positioned up on the Nemaha Ridge for all those reasons we just said, that I won't repeat, when Ron asked. So we think all that acreage is highly prospective. The difference is the Marcellus has 7 years' worth of history with brand new horizontal wells and high quality data and there's 7,000 new wells that define it. In the Mississippian, we're just starting. We started there in 2004, but we started in the Tonkawa and then we started with our vertical program. We drilled a number of good vertical wells. Then we converted in 2009 to '11 and drilled a handful of good horizontal wells. And we reported those, over 485,000 boe. They're still hanging in there, they look good. Last year, we drilled a handful of wells, more horizontal, but it's still a handful of wells. And those wells were 600,000. And we'll update you with time. But when you look at -- so it's new drilling and it's really just across the southern part of our play, almost spans the width of the ridge, but it's not 7 years' worth of history and 7,000 wells, it's a couple years' worth of history and 20 or 30 wells. So as with time, if the Mississippi continues to drill out, and it may or may not as we go north. Hopefully, it's just like the Marcellus and it does, and if it does, then we'll continue to ramp up our drilling, 5 to 10 to 15 rigs, and we'll do that. But again, the big driver, the big gorilla is the Marcellus. It's the largest producing gas field in the country. We've got the dominant position in it. And we've got line-of-sight growth to grow for many years. And these other plays were all enhancements to that. If the Cline drills out or the Wolfberry, you'll see us allocate a little capital, and the capital allocation is really driven by rate of return, by economics, large-scale and repeatability.","Ray N. Walker","That was a long-winded answer but it was a great question, and that's how we think about it.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess my follow-up, hopefully, is a little quicker.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Alan Farquharson just reminded me, I want to answer one of your questions. It was -- you brought up the geoscience or seismic. So still want to answer the question. We do use seismic in a lot of the areas we drill and we use them for different reasons. So early on, and it goes back to the history of Tonkawa field, we got in Tonkawa, which is the big part of our Mississippian position. It's that group of wells on the southern end. And when you look at that position on the southern end, it was the largest light oil field back in the 1917, 1920, in that era. And what we did is start reactivating it by drilling Tonkawa wells. After successfully doing that, a couple of years later, we shot a 3D over it, which, at the time, amazed me as Chief Operating Officer, and those guys, after a great sales pitch, said, \"Hey, we wanted to 3D it.\" I said, \"How in the world could you have missed anything?\" There's a gazillion wells out there and being an engineer, I'm thinking that -- and but sure enough, when you look, it has that same characteristic like a lot of our plays. It's stacked pay. It's not just the Tonkawa, it was the Mississippian below. And remember the Tonkawa was at 2,700 feet, the Mississippian is at 4,000, then they had some neat stuff in the Red Fork, and then the Wilcox. And then the Woodford. And so even though basement's relatively high and it's -- you're looking at that interval from 2,700 feet to 5,000 or 5,500 feet, there's 20-some stacked pays in there that are all oil charge. So we started drilling deeper and the seismic was actually useful to help identify all those different upsides and targets. Again, on a broader basis, if you look at the other areas we're in like Pennsylvania, great stack pay potential, and we talk a lot about the Upper Devonian, we talk about the Marcellus and we talk about the Utica, but I guarantee you, there's tons of conventional pays that are stacked in there. So seismic helps us identify, look at those other targets, it helps us target wells. So it's useful as a tool. It's not critical. It wasn't -- I won't say it's critical in the Marcellus or it's critical in the Mississippian, but clearly, it adds value not only in those horizons but helping us understand the full section in the hydrocarbon charge and what we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan McSpirit of BMO Capital Markets.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The question is often asked of producers, when will operations turn cash flow neutral or cash flow positive? Is that in itself a goal of Range Resources or important to the company? And if it is, how do you balance that with accelerating the resource capture and bringing the value forward?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","That's a great question. And I think if you look at our plan and what we're saying today and I think what we're saying consistently is, we believe we have 20% to 25% line-of-sight production growth for many years, and it's all that stuff and part of the answer to the previous question. And based on our modeling and based on current strip pricing and with all the assumptions that go with it, but a very bottom's up driven plan based on thousands of wells and all the guys in the divisions and led by Ray and Alan and others. When you look at that plan, we can outspend cash flow by $250 million to $350 million per year, still grow at 20% to 25%, but importantly, we're delevering with time, and I'm going to talk a little bit about it, then turn it over to Roger. So when you look at like debt to EBITDAX, our debt to EBITDAX, even with that outspend, continues to drift down with time. If you think about NAV and pulling the value forward, okay, I'm just simplistically, again, if we're growing at 20% to 25% on a compounded basis, roughly, every 3 years, we'll double. So we would double in 3 years and double again. So if you take our fourth quarter volumes at -- roughly, I'm rounding down to 800 million or 0.8 boes per day net, in 3 years, you're looking at roughly 1.6 growing at that compounded rate, if we can successfully do that and we've got the database and all those wells to say we believe we can, led by our million-acre position in Pennsylvania, then we're doubling from 0.8 to 1.6 in roughly 3 years. And then in roughly another 3 years, we'll be at roughly 3 boes per day, which is a number that I talked about earlier. To me, that's pulling forward a heck of a lot of value. And then what's great about that, it's in largely low risk plays with strong economics and strong returns and a very low cost structure. When we talk about our resource potential being enormous and we put a number out there, but it's based on a ton of data and a ton of support in the best play -- best gas play, clearly, out there, I would argue one of the best plays overall. So we think we're pulling forward a lot of NAV. We think we're aggressively driving up production with time and delevering by outspending by $250 million to $350 million per year. Roger, do you want to tack on with that?","Roger S. Manny","Yes. Yes, I will. Thanks, Jeff. Yes, Dan, I think becoming cash flow positive or cash flow neutral in and of itself is not real high on our priority list. We're much more concerned about bringing the NAV forward, drilling up our high return projects. I mean, there's a lot of companies out there that are cash flow positive because they don't have anything economic to drill right now. We're not that company. So deciding where we set the drilling throttle, where we allocate capital. As you probably know, having followed the company, every AFE over $200,000, is signed off on by Alan, Jeff, me, Ray, all individually. So we're very granular and very thorough in our capital allocation decisions. So at this point in our growth cycle, I think just as Jeff described, you're going to see us keep the drilling throttle at we consider an optimal setting, where we're probably still slightly overspending but still delevering and keeping leverage in check.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Got it. I appreciate that answer. I look at cash flow neutral state more of a result than a goal myself, so in agreement there. Another subject often discussed is the difference between returns at the field level, and of course, those at the corporate level, there being a disconnect between the 2. Where do you see returns at the corporate level maybe measured by return on capital employed trending over the next several years?","Roger S. Manny","Yes. That's a good question, Dan. I mean return on capital employed is a tough one, because you can reduce your capital spending and you look like a rock star and you're not really bringing NAV forward and painting the value that you could, it's a suboptimal way to develop your resource base. So I think it's a troublesome measure in and of itself. I think in my case, it's a little like NAV. You want to adjust the inputs and see what happens to the outputs, it's the relative measure that counts. And when you look at the relative measures at Range, the DD&A rate falling, I think is a really key and underappreciated metric. When you look out there over the last year, there -- it used to be the DD&A rates of the E&P sector moved somewhat in tandem, albeit, differences between the full costers [ph] and the successful efforts guys. But lately, what we've seen is companies with big feelings it has to write down. So its DD&A rate actually went -- goes up, which is very odd. And Range is one of the few that has consistently seen our DD&A rate go down, and that's clearly an indication of our improved capital efficiency and lower cost structure, which, to your point, will flow to the bottom line. It's why we just had our second year of consecutive profitability on a net income basis despite really low, low prices the last 2 years.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I think as we continue to build volumes in high-quality plays like the Marcellus, more and more of that's going to flow through to the bottom line or the net income. You're seeing it now, you're going to see it a lot more this year and off in to the future.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Understood. And one last one for me, if I may. Do you have the itch to sell more Permian Basin properties based on the attractive price received in the recent deal here? I ask simply in the context of present value. Why not monetize the asset today and recycle the cash, the capital into higher return drilling opportunities found, say, in the wet gas Marcellus or the Mississippian?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, that's a great question. We look at that stuff all the time and we constantly look at what we think adds the most value for the company. Well, I think we're in a great shape, again 20% to 25% line-of-sight growth. We got great balance sheet, Roger does a fantastic job monitoring that. And periodically, I mean, look back, we've sold $2.3 billion worth of property so we're not in love with our assets. We're trying to be one of the best performing companies out there, not just growth for growth's sake, but it's better is better, not necessarily bigger is better. But when you look -- so we have great opportunity. And where we're positioned now, we have the ability with that small outspend to continue to grow significantly with time. That being said, we've cleaned up, and clearly, New Mexico for us was only 7,000 net acres. It was a relatively small position. We got a great price for it. We didn't see a lot of upside. It wasn't going to move the needle for us. The Ardmore Basin sale was the same thing, I think it was 14,000 net acres. What we really we have left in the Permian is Conger. Conger is different, I think, and it's something to look at, and we need to understand a little bit better. Conger -- our Conger -- basically 100,000 net acres, but in essence, it's almost all of which is held by production. Goes back, it has those same characteristics. We own all depth rights, it's stacked pay, rich hydrocarbon charge. It worked well for us in the Canyon. And if you -- for the people that have been with us for a while, it works well. In the Cisco, it's worked in the Wolfcamp, it's worked in the Leonard. We've drilled some great, strong wells. Now, we're looking at a couple of other horizons or techniques. One is the Cline. The Cline has roughly 300-foot of net thickness across the entire 100,000 net acres. And like Ray said, it's really important. There's going to be a lot of data points coming out this year. We have really high quality operators surrounding us who are going to drill roughly 50 wells that are going to impact our position. The results of their wells will be very meaningful for what we have on our property. Like Ray said, we carried 100% of the R&D in the Marcellus. We don't have to do it out in Conger. But to the extent that works in the Cline, we got 100,000 net acres and you could drill oil wells, could you drill oil wells on 80-acre spacing? I think, clearly, and you could argue, maybe it ought to be tighter, 40 or something. If you used 80-acre spacing, that's over 1,000 wells. If you use 40, it's over 2000 wells. And you can pick numbers. What if the Cline works and the Cline -- the wells stabilize at 50 barrels a day a year out or something, even on the low end, that's over 60,000 barrels net and it's predominantly oil. On the high end, it could be double that. The Wolfberry, stacked payer out there, we're doing a lot of interesting things in the Wolfberry. Our Wolfberry wells are better than competitors so far, again, it's HBP, we're learning a little bit, but that could become a very repeatable play and really even expand beyond what we've talked about publicly so far. So it has a lot of upside. And we want to understand what that is before we decide what to do. I can tell you as a shareholder in the bulk of my net worth, I'm rooting that it works, that's another great opportunity for us. Because going back to that simple strategy of growing production and reserves on a per share basis, net adjusted, and building and high-grading the inventory, who knows, it may be a high-grade. The Marcellus for us, back in 2004 and '05 and '06, was a huge high-grade than what we were doing and really helped to drive results. I think Conger has the ability to be a significant high-grade and it's clearly oil, which could be beneficial.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","How should we think about lateral length in the Marcellus and the balance that Range has to strike between holding acreage and maximizing well economics? Essentially, do you think your laterals in the Marcellus will increase further over time or lateral length kind of remain unchanged but frac spacing will narrow?","Ray N. Walker","We have definitely seen horizontal lateral lengths increase over time. And I think it has to do with a lot of different factors in southwest Pennsylvania namely. In northeast Pennsylvania, I think it's a little easier to drill longer laterals. You have much bigger tracts of land and it's easier to put those together. It's dry gas. But in the wet and super-rich area, I don't know, did I tell you guys about the 5 wells that we just brought online? They're pretty darn good for 3,300 feet or so. And this year, I think our target -- we put in there, in the economics, our -- what we expect our average laterals to be this year and going into next year. Right now, we rather than look at, like I've said in previous calls and so forth, rather than look at well-by-well economics, and IPs and such, we're much more interested in the total project and how that -- how we ramp that up with the infrastructure so we keep our transportation costs down and our compression cost down, and we fill up the plant at the right level at the right timing, and we HBP acreage all at the same time. Our teams are getting really good at drilling multiple pads from a single surface -- or multiple units from a single-surface pad and different things like that. So we're getting more and more efficient every quarter, every year that goes by in HBP and acreage, and we're beginning to see that focus more to a development mode-type well. I mean we're still a ways away from that. We still have a lot of infrastructure to build. We still have a lot of that kind of thing to happen. But we -- I would forecast that our lateral lengths probably continue to get a little longer over time. I don't see them getting a lot longer anytime soon. But we -- I mean we have drilled a lot longer laterals and we will drill some and in special cases whether it's a land situation or it's just a science test or the reservoir characteristics are a little bit different, where we think we need to drill longer. But right now, we're pretty happy. I think what we're seeing in the super-rich area, we're just knocking it out of the park there. I'm just overly excited about that. And I'll probably tell you about those 5 wells again before the meeting is over.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then my follow-up is just staying in the Marcellus, on how tight a spacing are you drilling in the Marcellus right now and how tight do you think it can go?","Ray N. Walker","We, on average, I think in Southwest PA, us and most of the offset operators in that area are pretty much anywhere between 1,500 feet to down to 700 feet between laterals. We typically, when we drill multiple laterals today on a pad, will not generally get closer than 1,000 feet. Now like Jeff said earlier, we have some pilots out there that are 500-foot spacing, which would basically be a 40-acre-type pilot. And those have a couple of years. We haven't released the data on that yet. But I think, today, we're more interested in trying to HBP acreage, while at the same time, building production as efficiently as we can. And like those 5 wells, I told you I'd say that again, those 5 wells, that was 3 wells that's holding a 6 40, and then the other one is 2 wells holding a 6 40. So they're clearly more than 1,000 feet apart. But in general, if we're drilling multi-well situations on a pad, there will be about 1,000 foot today. And I do think that there is significant potential at least in some areas that it's going to go denser than that. And I know EQT and CNX, from time to time, have talked about that also. And so I think there's clearly no question we'll be there. When you look at the Barnett, the granddaddy of all of them, where it all started, I mean there's literally some areas where they're 125 feet apart and they still think there's more gas in play. So who knows where it will eventually go. But the one thing I can say is it they won't be the same everywhere. We sometimes get caught in a trap of thinking the Marcellus is the Marcellus everywhere, and it's considerably different. When you just look at the map of our acres position in the dry and the wet and the super-rich, they're significantly different between those 3 regimes, and even from one edge of one area to the other edge, you see a lot of difference. So I think they'll get longer, but again, we're pretty happy with what we're doing today. So it's pretty exciting.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes. And like Ray said, I mean I think, clearly, we're in a core area. There's other core areas. And then at the end of the day, whether you can infill, just comes down to what's the hydrocarbon you're getting out of the wellbore versus hydrocarbon in place. And there are some areas based on that ratio that will support 40 acres. I won't get into all the details. If you want, call us later, and we'll talk about it.","Let's go to the next question and I believe final question. That was it? Okay. I apologize. I see a lot of other people teed up. So let me say then for all the people that didn't get to ask questions, that we want to make sure we talk to you, make sure to call the IR guys. Our team will be on call. We want to make sure we get to all the people who didn't get a chance to ask questions. And I'll just go with my closing comments then, which is a lot of what I've been saying, is given Range's large high-quality, low-risk acreage position and drilling inventory, we believe that in addition to growing production, 20% to 25% this year, we have 20% to 25% line-of-sight growth for many years. Given the high returns in our liquids-rich and oil plays and assuming current strip pricing, our cash flow is expected to outpace our production growth. We're also projecting that with current strip pricing, we'll be reducing the leverage of our company with time as we drive up production and cash flow. Led by our approximately 1 million net acre position in Pennsylvania, we project that we'll consistently drive up both production and reserves on a per-share basis, debt adjusted for years to come. Plus, we continue to be one of the lowest cost producers in our peer group and are still improving. We believe that this plan will translate into substantial shareholder value in the months and years ahead.

[Operator Instructions].","Statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions].","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Laith Sando, Vice President, Investor Relations at Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Laith Sando","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range's year-end earnings call. The speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Degner, SVP of Operations; and Mark Scucchi, Chief Financial Officer. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we've posted on our website. We'll be referencing some of those slides this morning. We also filed our 10-K with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the Investors tab or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.","Please note that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. For additional information, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of EBITDAX, cash margins and other non-GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Ventura","Thanks, Laith, and thanks to everyone for joining us on this morning's earnings call. Looking back at the fourth quarter of 2018, Range continue to make progress on key strategic objectives, generating organic free cash flow, reducing leverage and completing our 2018 drilling program safely and for $31 million less than originally budgeted.","Investors have been clear in their request for capital discipline from E&P companies, and most companies' spending plans have moderated as a result. We believe this is the right direction for the industry, and it makes sense for many E&P companies given their stage of development. For Range, this is a natural progression as the Marcellus has gone from a concept in 2004 to what is now the largest gas field in the country, if not the world. That conditioning phase, if you will, can take a long time, particularly if you're trying to capture a sizable acreage position in more than 0.5 million acres like Range has in Southwest Pennsylvania.","The greatest thing for Range is that our conditioning phase is now complete. Range's block up acreage position is largely held by production, which allows for increasingly efficient operations as we draw longer laterals, utilize existing pads and effectively source and recycle water. These operational efficiencies are evidenced in our peer-leading development costs.","Range's transportation and processing capacity is also in place as of year-end 2018, which allows us to move products to markets throughout the U.S. and abroad. This results in more predictable differentials going forward for both natural gas and NGLs. And with projects like the shale cracker and various in-basin and power projects being contemplated in and around our core operating area, we are seeing demand come to Pennsylvania, which is exciting for Range and for the commonwealth.","In this next phase of development, we expect that returns in free cash flow yields for top-tier E&P companies can compete with the broader market and that's certainly what Range will be targeting. We also expect that continued capital discipline from Range and our peers can allow a broader base of investors to recognize those competitive yields and bring their investment dollars back to the sector.","When we talk about capital discipline, it's more than a spreadsheet example of how a company can spend within cash flow in the future at some arbitrated price. We think capital discipline also means sticking to the capital plans that we set at the beginning of the year and communicated to investors.","In 2018, the overwhelming majority of E&Ps did not do this as most companies either increase their capital budgets mid-year or simply outspent their plans. In some cases, companies did both. Against that backdrop, I can't say enough how pleased I am with the team's commitment to efficient, safe operations and for not only meeting our capital budget in 2018, but coming in $31 million below our original budget. This commitment to disciplined spending is what you can expect from Range in 2019 and beyond.","Looking back on 2018, Range's core assets continued to deliver in terms of productivity and efficiency gains, which drove another solid year of reserve additions. Proved reserves increased 18% and drove its finding cost for only $0.22 per Mcfe. The quality of our resource was further evidenced by a long track record of positive performance revisions. The positive revisions in 2018 were the result of extending laterals and improvements from optimized targeting and completions as the team continues to do an outstanding job developing our Marcellus resource.","The underlying value for PV-10 of Range's reserves was nearly $10 billion using future strip pricing at year-end 2018. After backing out the year-end debt balance of $3.8 billion, this equates to $24 per share, which speaks to the disconnect we currently see in the value of our equity.","In addition to SEC proved reserves, which account for only the next five years of development, Range has approximately 3,300 additional undrilled core Marcellus wells. This provides Range a class-leading inventory measured in decades that serves our foundation for delivering sustainable free cash flow possible at today's strip prices. Many of our peers have based their go-forward plans on higher prices than what are available today. We agree that commodity prices will ultimately trade above current strip pricing but we've taken a relatively conservative approach of showing what our assets are capable of at today's prices, which approximates $2.70 per MMBtu for natural gas and $55 for WTI for the next five years.","As shown in our updated presentation, at current prices, Range is capable of consistently generating free cash from the plan with modest annual growth over the next five years. This balanced approach towards capital allocation provides Range and its investors with near-term free cash flow and continued improvement in returns, margins and balance sheet strength over the five year outlook, generating cumulative organic free cash flow of more than $1 billion over the next five years at today's strip pricing. This equals nearly 40% of today's market cap. To the extent that we have asset sales or prices improve above these levels, that will simply accelerate the timeline for returning capital to shareholders. Unlike some of our peers that have hinted at higher growth at higher prices, Range will remain committed to a balanced approach towards capital allocation although we do not have acreage at the risk of expiring a midstream component, excess transportation agreements or other forces that would drive us to favor outsized growth over free cash flow.","Range's ability to deliver sustainable free cash at strip pricing is underpinned by our low corporate base decline and low maintenance capital requirements. Range's base decline entering 2019 was below 20%. This competitive base decline supports a low maintenance capital of only $525 million. For $525 million in drilling and completion capital, Range can hold fourth quarter production flat, which is really the starting point for our capital allocation process that Mark and Dennis will cover in more detail. We believe this low maintenance capital is a differentiator for Range as additional cash flow beyond that level will be used to bolster the balance sheet, invest in our high return inventory or be returned to shareholders. And given our vast inventory of high-quality Marcellus locations, we believe that we're in a unique position to not only deliver on our plan of free cash flow and capital-efficient growth over the next five years, but we can continue this program far beyond the five year outlook into a market that will see other companies exhausting their core inventories.","I'll now turn it over to Dennis to discuss operations.","Dennis Degner","Thank you, Jeff. Production for the fourth quarter came in at 2,149 million cubic feet equivalent per day. This contributed to an annual 2018 production number that was approximately 10% year-over-year growth and includes the impact of both the mid-continent asset sale and the override interest sale during the year.","As previously disclosed, fourth quarter production was materially impacted by an unfortunate incident at MarkWest Houston processing facility. Throughout the ensuing outage, Range's Southwest Pennsylvania volumes were curtailed while necessary repairs could be made, resulting in an approximate 10 Bcf equivalent reduction in production for the quarter, the majority of which occurred during the month of December. Repairs to the MarkWest facility have since been completed with full operations restored during the first week of January. As Jeff mentioned, capital spending for 2018 came in $31 million below our original guidance set at the beginning of last year, resulting in a total spend of $910 million. We're proud of the team's dedication to safe, efficient operations and capital discipline that led the spending below our plan budget. I'll go into more details on some of the achievements that led to this in a minute, but the board takeaway is simple: We expect capital spending at or below budget to be the rule, not the exception.","As we look forward, our 2019 capital budget is set at $756 million, with 90% allocated to the Appalachian-Marcellus program and 10% to North Louisiana. We expect this to generate year-over-year production growth of approximately 6%, including a 30% liquids contribution, while generating an excess of $100 million in free cash flow. We earmarked 93% of the capital to be directed towards drilling completions, facilities and pipeline infrastructure, which is a slight increase compared to last year's budget and helps to improve capital efficiency per unit of production. The program will consist of 96 wells being turned to sales during the year. In Appalachia, liquids-rich wells will comprise of approximately 60% of the expected activity. And similar to 2018, up to 50% of the wells turned to sales are expected to be from pad sites with existing production.","Average lateral lengths per well are projected to increase this year with turn-in-lines averaging approximately 10,500 feet, while the average drilled horizontal lengths will increase to over 12,500 feet, a year-over-year increase of 1,600 feet and 2,500 feet, respectively. We see this plan setting us up well for 2020 and in line with the path ahead illustrated in our five year outlook. Similar to 2018, our 2019 capital spending is expected to be weighted to the first half of the year with approximately 35% of the capital being spent in the first quarter and sequential production growth projected to throughout the year.","Honing in on the fourth quarter, the Appalachian team remained operationally focused and turned to sales 16 wells in the liquids acreage, taking the 2018 total to 86 Marcellus turn-in-lines. Similar to our last discussion on the prior call, this total is slightly lower than the original number of wells planned to turn-in-line for the year. The 2 drivers for these were 7 wells that were completed in the fourth quarter with first sales pushing into early Q1 along with extending lateral lengths on wells throughout the year. In any given year, we will aim to turn-in-line the budgeted lateral footage with fewer wells and longer laterals to maximize efficiencies.","In North Louisiana, we completed and turned to sales one well during the quarter. In 2018, the North Louisiana team's charge was straightforward: drill our best picks, evaluate the impact of the structure and completion design and lastly, deliver on production targets within the capital budget. Looking back on the year, we've enhanced our understanding of structural influence in the area and have seen benefits from an increased completion design. When evaluating the wells from last year, the average production is in line with our expectations but not where they need to be on the competitive return spaces. The early part of 2019 will be key as the team test the latest structural aspects for the Cotton Valley and will assist in determining the asset's overall direction going forward.","Now let's look back on some of the key achievements for the year that drove our capital underspend. A key theme for Range in 2018 was our ability to drill long laterals in the Marcellus, resulting in a lower cost per foot. The Southwest Pennsylvania team was able to increase the average lateral length drilled by 8% in 2018 while drilling the longest Marcellus well at 18,600 feet. Along with the drilling three more of the basin's top longest laterals to date.","In addition to drilling our longest laterals, we also saw our drilling efficiencies continue to improve. The drilling team was able to increase footage drilled per rig by 20% versus 2017. And with these efficiency gains, along with 18 wells successfully drilled beyond 15,000 feet, the team has been able to reduce the drilling cost per foot during extended lateral operations by as much as 30%, a key component when looking at our capital underspend and in improving our overall capital efficiency.","Water recycling also continues to play a significant role in our program, and 2018 was no exception. By recycling 100% of Range's water in Southwest PA, the team played a large role in achieving our corporate LOE of $0.17 per Mcfe for the year. And by taking third-party water, they reduced the per stage water costs by 10%, resulting in one of the largest drivers in our capital underspend. These are just two examples of where the team's creative efforts, combined with our high-quality asset and contiguous acreage position, have strongly impacted the program efficiency.","On the marketing side, fourth quarter marked the first full quarter where Range had access to all of its contracted natural gas transportation, as Energy Transfer's Rover project provided additional outlets to the Midwest and Gulf Coast in September. The quarter also saw the commissioning of MarkWest's Harmon Creek 1 processing plant, which reached full capacity in early December. As we discussed on the prior call, fourth quarter wells were focused in our liquids-rich acreage near this new processing plant, allowing us to maximize utilization of this newly available infrastructure.","The fourth quarter natural gas differential of $0.08 under NYMEX was the best Q4 differential Range has seen since 2012, due in large part to the addition of transportation out of Appalachia. Going back a few years to the 2013 to 2014 timeframe, the Appalachia basin took on significant commitments to have natural gas transport built to the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast, enabling the current market environment of improved basis.","It seems to have been a long time coming with various pipeline delays but overall, it ended up aligning perfectly with Range's revised production profile. Compared to our original 2014 plans, we reduced our production trajectory and corresponding capital spend, but we're able to fully utilize each firm transport project shortly after its in-service date. Range's early strategy of creating a diversified market portfolio, inclusive of in-basin exposure, has been and is expected to continue to be beneficial to realize natural gas pricing and managing cost structure. To that end, going forward, Range expects to keep its natural gas transportation full and sell incremental gas production in the local markets, which have improved as infrastructure has been built out in the Southwest part of Appalachia.","On the liquid side of the marketing, as the only producer with propane capacity on Sunoco's Mariner East I, Range has been able to capture premiums to the Mont Belvieu index price by exporting the majority of its propane to international markets since early 2016. In addition, the company sent the majority of its normal butane and remaining propane volumes during the summer to Marcus Hook for export via local rail. The majority of those same volumes are being sold locally during the winter months. In total, Range markets over 70% of its corporate NGL production each quarter.","As we continue to develop our liquids acreage, additional outlets for NGL production are beneficial in providing stability to NGL price, especially during the summer when in-basin demand is low. Given the added purity volumes that could be supplied to Mont Belvieu over the coming years, we believe additional exposure to international NGL prices are warranted. As a result, Range has taken capacity on Mariner East 2 for a combined 20,000 barrels per day of propane and butane starting in April 2020. Importantly, we have the ability to fill that capacity with propane and butane volumes we produce today, leaving flexibility to sell incremental NGLs in-basin on a go-forward basis.","In January, we lost access to capacity on the Mariner East I pipeline, following the appearance of a subsidence along the pipeline route. As a result of the outage, we are utilizing available capacity on Mariner East 2 to continue moving propane to the Marcus Hook terminal. For ethane, we have multiple options for marketing production, including the ability to sell ethane as natural gas. While not materially altering corporate cash flows, the delayed restart of MarkWest plants and the Mariner East outage have reduced production volumes. And as a result, Range's first quarter guidance of 2,225 million cubic feet equivalent per day reflect the estimated production impact.","Before handing over to Mark, I'll close out with this: We're extremely proud of the team's accomplishments in 2018 and are excited about what's in-store for 2019, as we continue to deliver on the capital budget and our production targets while we drill and produce our most cost-effective and operationally efficient wells.","I'll now turn it over to Mark to discuss the financials. Mark?","Mark Scucchi","Thank you, Dennis. Results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 demonstrated the quality of Range's assets, the efficiency of our operations and the company's commitment to budget and capital discipline. Driven by the strong operational results Dennis just described, Range was able to achieve full year cash flow from operations of $991 million, a $174 million year-over-year increase driven by cost controls, improving prices and rising production. The $991 million in 2018 cash flow compares to $910 million of capital spending, which was $31 million below budget. The transition to free cash flow midyear 2018, combined with the execution on asset sales, allowed Range to reduce absolute debt and reduce leverage from 3.7x at year-end 2017 to 3.1x at year-end 2018.","Again, I would like to point out two key accomplishments for Range in 2018 that sets us apart from our peers. First, we began generating free cash flow. And second, we came in under budget. 2018 results also include noncash impairment charges taken against goodwill and unproved properties. These charges are a result of our strategic focus on the highest return projects and rightsizing our capital program to generate free cash flow. As described fully in the 10-K, noncash impairments taken in the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion for goodwill and $436 million for certain North Louisiana unproved properties.","The decline in Range's stock price late last year triggered a quantitative assessment under GAAP rules, and that evaluation conclude that goodwill was impaired. The fourth quarter impairment of unproved property related to value originally allocated to the extension area outside Terryville in North Louisiana. As part of our stringent capital allocation process, we determined we no longer had the intent to develop these properties. The competition for capital within Range is substantial, and these potential drilling locations were dropped as a result of strong returns elsewhere in the portfolio.","As we look forward to 2019 and beyond, the framework for which we allocate capital is paramount in understanding the near and long-term value the Range business can generate. As described last year, borne out in our results and reiterated today, our focus is on creating economic value. We begin by estimating cash flow at strip pricing, assess maintenance CapEx and then consider the economic investment of cash flow via drilling, debt reduction or return of capital to shareholders. Evaluating reinvestment options includes weighing each plants' potential impact on total free cash flow, absolute debt reduction, leverage ratios, capital efficiency, unit cost, margins and the change in base decline rate.","For 2019, Range developed a plan focused on balancing the goals of generating meaningful free cash flow at strip pricing, reducing absolute debt, maintaining capital efficiency, managing leverage and efficiently utilizing existing infrastructure. In balancing these objectives to maximize the value from the 2019 capital program, we developed a $756 million capital plan that is focused and efficient, with approximately 90% of the capital going towards the Marcellus. This 2019 budget is 20% or $185 million lower than the 2018 budget, generates free cash flow well over $100 million of current strip pricing, reduces debt, maintains capital efficiency, enhances margins and results in an estimated 6% production growth.","At strip pricing, Range estimates free cash flow in 2019 that equates to a yield over 4% at current share prices. After including expected changes in working capital, Range estimates the 2019 free cash flow yield approaching 7%. This outcome demonstrates our commitment to strategic principles, combined with the efficiency of our operations and the quality of our assets.","While the 2019 plan allows us to reduce outstanding debt, we remain focused on asset sales to accelerate balance sheet improvement. To reiterate our philosophy on capital structure, we believe that a balance sheet with less than 2x leverage is the optimal position for our business. As we progress towards that target, we've become more willing and able to return capital to shareholders, with the intention of announcing durable programs such as share buybacks or increased dividends. We would expect these programs to also be opportunistic when we see substantial disconnects between the intrinsic value of Range's assets and its stock price, such as what we see today.","In summary, we remain focused on converting consistently efficient operations on top-tier acreage into tangible shareholder returns through the application of a disciplined capital allocation framework. We believe our 2019 plan demonstrates that focus, highlights our asset quality, improves the ability and commitment to delivering sustained and meaningful free cash flow.","Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey Ventura","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Holly Stewart with Scotia Howard Weil.","Holly Stewart","Maybe, Jeff, we could just start off by talking about just kind of the overall M&A landscape out there, whether it's in the Appalachian Basin or elsewhere, just thinking about your pursuit to continue selling assets.","Jeffrey Ventura","Oh, well, I think, since you're talking about asset sales, not corporate M&A, is that the question?","Holly Stewart","Correct.","Jeffrey Ventura","Yes, just clarifying. Yes, I think in this market, the key is it's a tough market to sell assets, but I think to the extent you have a quality asset that people are looking for, it's possible as evidenced by our 1% royalty sale last year that we probably got fair price or a good price for. So I think it comes down to this market. If you've got the right assets and you're patient, of course, it will be as -- not that we're very patient, we'll be as aggressive as we can to get them done. So I think we have the opportunity. I think we've laid out a great plan that has -- that balances moderate growth with good free cash flow yield and it's free cash flow positive now and at strip pricing. We're not relying on a higher deck. But to the extent we can get asset sales done, sure, we'd like to accelerate our plan in full value forward.","Holly Stewart","Okay, great. Then maybe, Mark, if you could just touch on -- I know you talked about the optimal kind of below 2x leverage targets out there. But if you could just touch on maybe what you'd like to see sort of near term before deploying capital back to shareholders.","Mark Scucchi","Sure. I think the guidelines we laid out last year still hold. Our immediate goal is below 3x. And I think as you approach 2.5x, the likelihood, the size and the frequency of a return of capital increases. The interest in our ability to do that increases substantially. And then, certainly, as you approach 2x and below 2x our long-term target, that becomes, I think, a recurring core element of the strategy. So it's opportunistic and scaled appropriately, as we approach that long-term target. But as you execute asset sales, accelerate the balance sheet improvement and again approach that 2.5x, I think that becomes a more meaningful element of our strategy and a conversation amongst the management and board members.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","I was wondering if you could help us understand, on the Mariner East 1 outages, maybe the operating and financial impact in 1Q and 2Q and thoughts on when capacity would be restored.","Dennis Degner","Yes, this is Dennis. At this point, it's still a little unclear on when the operations will be restored on that particular line. We remain in close contact, as you would imagine, with the folks at Energy Transfer around operational status of that line. The good news is, is we have optionality. We have other outlets that we use on regular basis to basically transport our ethane to other markets. We continue to look at those options through the first quarter to both capitalize on pricing environments but also minimize impact when it makes most sense, so we'll continue to do that through the first quarter. From a financial and production aspect, I don't think we have something that we're prepared to share at this particular point other than the guidance that we've shared here in the call today. We feel like we're on track with the 2,225, and it also puts us in line with our growth profile of 6% for the year.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. And just the cost and the capacity, you have capacity on Mariner East 2. Could you maybe discuss that cost?","Jeffrey Ventura","That's the kind of detail that we've not typically provided, whether it's Apex or Mariner East I or Mariner West. But, Alan, perhaps you can talk about the strategy behind taking ME2 capacity?","Alan Farquharson","Sure. And I'll point out this, there's published tariff rates on the pipeline, so it's available on the Internet. People can look that up, but the details of our own deal is, as Laith was just saying, are confidential. Overall, though, the reasons for taking on ME2 capacity, the Northeast market is -- it's a great market, it's very seasonal. It has wonderful winter demand. But unfortunately, in the summertime, there is not a preponderance of local demand. And to make it a little bit more challenging, actually, there's not much storage in the local area. So kind of like our strategy in natural gas, if we're marketing our products directly, we like to build up as much optionality in our portfolio as we can so that we can get to diverse customers and industries with our product and realize the best overall prices. So what we've taken out of actually is 20,000 barrels per day on ME2 starting next year, and we'll actually be able to fill that volume with existing capacity and we'll have optionality on the remainder of our capacity to continue to sell to local markets or actually to put it on lockup space, let's say, on ME2. So the ME2 capacity, again, as we see it, it provides a good option for the summer markets and actually provides a price forward to enter markets. It's all the way around. It's a good thing to have.","Jeffrey Ventura","Arun, I might add that the cost of the ME2 is embedded in the cost guidance that we provided in the five year outlook when you see the step down from 4Q '18 to 4Q '19 and then a further step down in the five year outlook, and it's also in embedded in the pricing guidance that we provided that shows about 40% of WTI in the years 2020 through '23.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And my final question, what are the next steps here for Terryville as you evaluate this asset? And I was wondering if you could help us with the breakdown, I think you have a $6.6 billion PDP valuation. If you can help break that out between Appalachia and North Louisiana, that will be helpful.","Mark Scucchi","So I'll refer you to the 10-K and the reserve reports in the back to give you the valuations. As it relates to the plans for North Louisiana, I think the starting point there is to look at our capital allocation for the 2019 plan. And with 90-plus percent of the capital directed at Marcellus, we are focused on risk-adjusted returns and maximizing the returns and the value of that capital. That being said, some element of capital is allocated to North Louisiana. The allocation of that capital is to optimize and preserve the value of the asset and the cash flow and to explore that here this year, and we will continue to evaluate and allocate capital again based on that framework I described during the scripted portion. And the allocation of capital to the division is designed to optimize the value and the cash flow, as I said, no matter the path forward for that asset.","Operator","Your next version comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","On Slide 11, what's the major drivers of the unit cost reductions as to invest more capital and grow more in your maintenance versus balance versus full reinvestment scenarios? How much of this shift moving from underutilization to full utilization of transportation contracts versus potentially selling more into the local market that would result in lower transport cost or maybe there are drivers of that?","Mark Scucchi","Sure, Brian. That's a good question. I'll actually direct you to Slide 12, where we lay out the components of unit costs, and you can see just where the magnitude and where the savings are coming from. So as we look at the trend in cost from Q4 '18 out over the course of the five year outlook, we estimate roughly $0.30 in Mcfe savings. It's driven in large part by savings on gathering, processing and transport. If you think about the components of gathering, processing and transport, a significant element there is the long-haul transport that, as of year-end, was fully utilized. As we go forward, as Dennis described earlier, we would expect and intend to sell in-basin for incremental volumes. So simplistically, you're spreading that existing cost over a larger volume and base, and you have the ability to continue fully utilizing that and drive down that on a per-unit basis. I would also point out that given the early start or the kick-off at the Marcellus with our early contract, you begin to have smaller contracts come up on maturity. And we have the option to allow some of those to expire, so there's optionality embedded there to optimize the portfolio over time should that be the most economic outcome. We also have some processing capacity that rolls off as early as next year. So there are multiple elements in terms -- and multiple paths relative to some modest growth driving that down over a five year outlook or just optimizing the contracts depending on what our ultimate path forward is. You also see savings driven pretty much across the board. Some savings are possible through a little bit of the LOE front. You also have savings in interest expense as we pay down debt. And then, of course, there's some savings in driving down G&A on a per-unit basis as well.","Brian Singer","Got it. So I guess, in comparing that 4Q '23 column on Slide 12, as you referred to, relative to the scenario analysis for the full year 2023 on Slide 11, it's really more of the transportation and the ability for skill to -- and the higher production scenarios to lower the G&A, perhaps, do you see?","Mark Scucchi","In the scenario that we have laid out here as an example, yes, it is predominantly we're gathering and transport. But if you were under a different scenario, again, you have the optionality around managing those contracts that are coming up on maturity, so there are multiple paths to achieving that same objective.","Brian Singer","And then my follow-up is in regards to CapEx in 2019. Can you just talk about the trajectory that you see across the quarters?","Dennis Degner","Yes, Brian. This is Dennis. When you look at -- we talked about earlier in the call, Q1 is going to be front-end loaded while the year will be -- with Q1 being around 35%, it could be just a little bit less than that actually but close to 35% for the quarter. Then you'll see us start to have a little bit of a tail off but then good consistent activity for the rest of the year. It's going to be very similar to 2018. It's an approach that we've taken over the past few years actually, but it also aligns us with the growth that we're talking about in our five year outlook for 2020 toward the end of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.","Ronald Mills","I was calling -- just a quick question, if you talk about -- I guess, it's Slide 11, where you talk about the balanced approach in a $2.70 gas environment and the impact you can have on leverage despite delivering the same free cash flow. I know the company is trying to get away from talking about growth but when you think about growing free cash flow on an annual basis, is there something where you think kind of the mid- to upper single-digit growth is a pretty likely output given that balanced approach to free cash flow and growth?","Mark Scucchi","Thanks, Ron. That's a good question. And I think you obviously see some differences in how we laid out the five year outlook this year as opposed to last year. Last year, we gave a specific example of a case that had a stated growth number in it. It was an example. But what we were intending to do this year was focus more on the framework and how we were allocating capital and the thought process behind it and how we go about balancing the difference and sometimes competing objectives or metrics in measuring success, and that's what you've got here. So the case we've laid out and at the price deck currently out there that generated our 2019 plan, the results within 6% year-over-year production growth but was predicated on the free cash flow and a free cash flow yield achievable, you do end up at single-digit type production as a fallout of that thought ball process. So to your point, some elements of growth does present advantages and improve certain metrics. It improves your unit cost. It does allow you to maintain and grow cumulative free cash flow, which is the focus on the primary input to the process. So at a point in time, at this price deck, I would say, yes, the mid-single digits type production growth number would be the fallout, but that's not to say that's the dedicated path. If prices are lower, we would scale back that reinvestment rate to preserve free cash flow, and the gross number would fall out at something less than that. And if prices are higher, what I would point out is that there is no acceleration in production growth or reinvestment in drilling activity, it's an increase in free cash flow.","Ronald Mills","Okay, great. And then as it just relates to particularly on the ethane side, you talked about either selling into local markets in the meantime and\/or keeping in the gas stream. Can you just remind us of your contracts in terms of pipeline quality? Are you at the point or do your contracts allow you where you can keep the gas in the stream and still stay within standards?","Dennis Degner","Yes. Good question, Ron. With the volume that's impacted on ME1, we don't see any issues with pipeline quality spec, if we were to inject that volume. So if that's the question, there really isn't any issue with that. And typically, what we're looking at is just the overall value of the broader portfolio of recovering the ethane or leaving it in the gas stream.","Ronald Mills","Okay. And then from the guidance, in terms of the way you talked about guidance, does that assume you moved to rejection or you're staying in recovery mode?","Mark Scucchi","Ron, we've kind of done both. When you look back over the course of Q3 as a good litmus tests, when we saw an opportunity to take advantage of some better pricing, we certainly will look to do so. When we have other drivers maybe, whether it's an upset condition or maybe a swing in pricing in other direction, we may actually look to reject into the natural gas stream. Because we essentially don't move to max extraction as part of our base plan for year-over-year basis, we have that optionality, which we really like as we look at our plan on an annual basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Grigel with Macquarie.","Paul Grigel","Could you please provide an update on the ETP process? Is that still a hire that is being contemplated by Range?","Jeffrey Ventura","Yes, let me give you an update on that. And do to that, let me back up a little bit. As we announced last summer, jointly with SailingStone, we agreed to have four directors go off the Range board and 2 directors come on. As of right now, 3 of those four directors have stepped off the board, and we added Steve Gray as one of the two new directors, and Steve has been a great addition to our board. He was the former CEO of RSP. So we're still in the process of filling the other slot and working closely with SailingStone to make sure we get another high-quality director like Steve. The board has decided to wait until we get the final board in place and then let a little time pass and then let that newly revised board whether we need that slot or not.","Paul Grigel","And then could you elaborate on the directional change in the decline rate over time on the five year plan? And as a corollary, are there any constraints in the system that are balancing out some of the overall corporate decline?","Alan Farquharson","Yes. Paul, this is Alan. The overall decline is I think very, very consistent with what we have provided historically to you. We said in about five years or so historically that we'd be down 10%. This is very similar to that. One of the things you saw last year was low-20s initial decline, and that was because we had a very large ramp in activity in the fourth quarter of 2017 that caused that ramp. I think historically, just quality of the assets, is there some constraint? Yes, there are, but it's not really material to the overall decline. It's really quality assets. And I think the other thing you're also seeing is the benefits of continued longer laterals and a lower decline rate from those wells because of the systems they're flowing into. But historically, it's very, very consistent with what we've seen other than just the first year, which is just a function of activity in the fourth quarter of the previous year.","Jeffrey Ventura","I think that's the key part of the Range story is the low corporate decline rate. Below 20% I would argue is -- it isn't at the head of the class, it's near the head of the class for -- even all the Appalachian gas producers, let alone Permian producers and Haynesville producers, that will have base declines that are maybe almost double that. So that low corporate decline really leads to low maintenance capital, which allows us to be free cash flow positive and generate good free cash flow yield now, where several of our competitors are still negative free cash flow and so on. So I think that puts us in a great position, quality or low base decline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein.","Robert Brackett","I had a question around lateral length. I noticed in the five year outlook economics, you took the lateral length from 11,500 to 10,000. Everything scaled with that. Can you talk about -- was that done to make the math easy for us? Or is there something going on there? And where do you see your typical lateral lengths kind of this year and in the five year plan?","Dennis Degner","Yes. Bob, this is Dennis. As we look at the plan ahead for 2019, the drill plan for us is to average across both divisions 12,500 feet. And really, when you look at Appalachia though, that number, as you would imagine, is going to be a little bit higher than that just given some of the track record and also records that we've announced just here with the 18,600-foot lateral. Really, this is upside in the numbers. As you look at how we're communicating the five year outlook and what we are saying is the plan going forward in our financials versus what we're executing, we're always going to strive to extend lateral lengths where it makes sense and where we are able to do so in the field. So you should expect just like in prior years, our ability to extend laterals as we continue to improve the efficiency of our asset.","Robert Brackett","Okay. So that should just increase over the five year, so I shouldn't use that reduction in the back to mean anything except that's an easy way to do the math.","Dennis Degner","That's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Panjwani with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Sameer Panjwani","Some of your peers have been moving towards lighter spacing in the Marcellus, and Slide 22 of the presentation seems to indicate you're moving on some of the same concepts. So can you provide some color on your 2019 spacing design versus what's baked into your inventory count?","Dennis Degner","Yes. Sameer, as we look at our acreage position and the spacing, we like the plan that we have. And as you look across the field, you're going to see our range be anywhere from 750- to 1,000-foot inner well spacing. We like how that lines up when you look at the well performance and the 1,000 wells that we've studied over the past several years. But as you would imagine, when you go to the eastern side of Washington County, you've got everything from dry gas to the western side of Washington County, where you have 1,350-type BTU-type gas structure. That means the rock could be different. So we continue to test and look at what is the most optimum path us and plan. But when you look at the prior historical well results and how we've also had positive revisions of type curves over the course of time, we like the position that we're in when you look at our inner well spacing.","Jeffrey Ventura","I would just add to that a little bit. When you look at our wells on our per thousand -- recovery per thousand foot of any of the operators in the southwest part of the play or the highest, look at our cost per thousand foot in the southwest part of the play, really in the whole trend they're the lowest. So that's a great combination where we're. But there may be upside and certainly that could be good upside that comes with time.","Sameer Panjwani","Okay, that's helpful. And then I also just wanted to clarify some of your earlier thoughts regarding Terryville. It sounds like while you're still allocating capital today, there's a keep versus sell decision coming in the back half of this year. Is that the right way to interpret your comments?","Mark Scucchi","This is Mark. I would just say that, first and foremost, our commitment is to creating value, and Range has a long track record of evaluating rates on return on all assets. And that approach to evaluating assets that can compete for capital has led to a long history of hydrating the portfolio. So as it stand today, we leave allocating a very modest element of the capital budget to North Louisiana preserves the value and optimizes cash flow, again, no matter the path forward. So I'll just leave it at that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rehan Rashid with B. Riley FBR.","Rehan Rashid","Just one or two quick questions. One, on the balance sheet, the next big tranche due is not till '21, right? $500 million and almost $1 billion in '22. When do you start planning for how to kind of address that -- those maturities? That's one. And two, unrelated question, but on the overriding royalty sale, what context, what setup would you have to see to do another one or two, those -- that type of a transaction?","Mark Scucchi","Sure, Rehan. So first, starting with the balance sheet, you're right, it's June 2021 is the first bond majority. We are in good shape in that we have a fair amount of time to enable us to be proactive in dealing with those maturities. So the liquidity under the revolver is ample and as we execute having full-on asset sale, that frees up additional optionality and choices to refinance those bonds. We can also be proactive in accessing the high-yield market and terming those out. So you can expect us to deal with those maturities well ahead of time as things unfold, frankly, over the course of this year. As it relates to the override, that investor demand for yield-oriented instruments is high, especially when you think that a high-quality asset that also has a growth component to it, a potentially modest growth component. So there was more interest in that override when we executed and closed on that sale October of last year. So we believe that there is more depth there in that market. We were in a good starting point with Range's high net revenue interest. We had an 83% NRI prior to that 1% sale. So at 82%, we're still well above the average producers in the area. So we would be willing to consider an additional 1% to 2% at the right valuation. We see that as potentially yielding good cash flow upfront, realizing and crystallizing good value for shareholders while also repositioning the balance sheet.","Rehan Rashid","Just one quick follow-up on that. How would that just stack up against, let's just say, a sale of the kind of Louisiana asset? Are these independent decisions? Or if one gets to leverage point, you'd be happy enough with what should be happy. You won't do something like this overwriting royalty sale.","Mark Scucchi","The market is very unpredictable without finding a meeting of the mind between buyers and sellers. So as we proceed, much as we did last year, on divestitures, we proceed down multiple paths at the same time to try to increase the probability of getting a fair transaction completed in a timely fashion. So I would say that they are dependent on each other, each of the asset sale packages, be it acreage, be it an override, be it Northeast PA or ultimately, other assets in the portfolio. So we are moving down multiple paths at the same time.","Operator","We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets for our final question.","Bradley Heffern","A couple on the guidance. So look at the CapEx, it looks like the well count year-over-year is pretty similar. The lateral lengths are longer. It doesn't look like the well costs have changed that much, but the CapEx is down 20%. So I was hoping you could reconcile that. And then additionally, the 30% liquids guidance seemed a little low to me. I mean, in the fourth quarter, it was 31% and I assume that, that was artificially reduced by the Houston plant downtime. So any color on that as well?","Mark Scucchi","Brad, I'll start with really the activity. When you look at the turn-in-lines and you look at the drilling activity, really, the story for 2018, as we talked about, was drilling efficiencies and long laterals. You'll continue to see that from our side as the activity progresses through 2019. So as you look at rig count and number of wells, it may not always be in some ways the best proxy for what kind of activity and also inventory we would carry into 2020 to stay in line with our five year outlook, so we feel good about how all that's coming together. From a liquid standpoint, really, we see some flexibility when you think about, again, as we talked about extraction versus rejection into the natural gas stream well mix. So as we start off maybe at any point or any given quarter, we may see well mix influence also that liquids contribution. We've got some exciting dry gas wells that we recently brought online that we'll talk about in the next quarter call. All of that influences that liquids percentage. But as you look at the percentage we shared earlier in the call notes, essentially, it's going to be a heavy focus for us in our processable gas window to utilize that infrastructure that we've committed to over the past few years.","Operator","Thank you.

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Laith Sando, Vice President of Investor Relations at Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range's third quarter earnings call. The speakers on today's call are, Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Chief Financial Officer.","Hopefully you've had a chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we've posted on our website. We'll be referencing some of those slides this morning. We also filed our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.","Before we begin, let me also point out that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. In addition, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of these non-GAAP measures. The supplemental tables also provide calculated natural gas differentials for the upcoming quarter and detailed hedging information on all products.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, Laith, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. As we approach the close of 2017, Range is nearing a very important and exciting point in the company's Marcellus development. We are clearly at an inflection point in what has, in essence, been a decade-long commissioning of the largest gas field in the country.","Range has been a leader in finding and developing the Marcellus play and now is in a position to capture additional value. Major projects, such as LNG facilities, power plants and the like, have long construction periods of capital-intensive work. For Range, this commissioning phase is nearing an end, with the last of our three natural gas infrastructure commitments slated to come online by early 2018.","The culmination of this build-out provides Range substantial deliverability of gas, NGLs and condensate to markets across the U.S. and internationally. This infrastructure will enable us to continue developing our Marcellus inventory in an increasingly capital-efficient manner.","The portfolio of takeaway projects that Range has secured over the last decade enables us to move natural gas production of almost 2 Bcf per day to meet our customers' growing demand, both outside and within the Appalachian Basin. The completion of this infrastructure foundation in concert with a high-quality inventory we believe will deliver strong returns on capital for many, many years.","For Range specifically, as a result of this infrastructure, we expect continued improvement in our realized natural gas prices as a result of gas transported into higher-priced markets and improved local pricing. Based on strip pricing, we expect that improvement could result in a corporate natural gas differential to Henry Hub of only about minus $0.15, or better, for 2018, offsetting increased transport costs in 2018.","We also see positive market conditions on the NGL side as well, with fundamentals coming back into balance due to increased domestic use and significant exports. Range has participated in the market improvements, as evidenced by our higher reported NGL price realizations and guidance.","Looking at ethane first. Range's ethane portfolio continues to accomplish two important goals for us. One, we're increasing cash flow versus leaving ethane in our gas stream. And, two, we can meet natural gas pipeline specs even with substantial growth. In fact, we're extracting and selling such a significant percentage of our ethane that Range could theoretically double its wet gas production from current levels, leave all the additional ethane in the gas stream and still have no problems meeting pipeline spec. That's an enviable position to be in as one of the largest NGL producers in the country and it provides us of the flexibility of finding additional ethane agreements in years to come that are cash flow accretive.","On the propane side, as the only producer with capacity on Mariner East 1, we continue to sell almost all of our propane production into international markets. So far this year, the Range team has been able to realize Mont Belvieu-plus pricing. Again, an enviable position among NGL producers as we have the ability to see how the Appalachian NGL market continues to develop with projects like Mariner East 2, in-basin steam crackers and other projects and make decisions about the additional transactions based on the economic benefits to Range from those transactions rather than operational constraints.","As a result of the projects Range has in place and the improving fundamentals in the NGL market, we're projecting that Range's NGL realizations as a percent of WTI will reach the highest levels that we've seen in several years for the fourth quarter of 2017. Based on strip pricing, we expect our 2018 realizations to be in the 30% to 32% of WTI range, despite a very backwardated 2018 strip that we believe have the potential to improve.","Operationally, I'm pleased that the Range-designed and drilled wells in North Louisiana are performing well, and we expect to get similar strong results from the wells we're bringing on line in the fourth quarter and going forward. In Pennsylvania, the long laterals we're drilling are also performing well, and we continue to drill some of the best wells in the company's history, which Ray will cover here in a minute.","Regarding capital allocation, our expectation is that we'll allocate additional capital to the Marcellus to utilize the additional firm takeaway capacity coming online. Both areas of operations have seen recent drilling success, but using North Louisiana cash flow to fund additional Marcellus drilling will drive better overall corporate returns next year as we optimize capacity, and it demonstrates one of the benefits of having two high-quality resource plays.","For 2018, we have not yet finalized our budget and, as a result, we will not give formal guidance at this time. What I can say is that, at strip pricing, we would expect to spend at or slightly below our projected cash flow. This will result in volumes sufficient to satisfy our transportation commitments on the pipelines coming into service during 2018.","Beyond 2018, when our transportation commitments are satisfied, we will have more flexibility to achieve moderate growth in production while spending less than cash flow and de-levering our balance sheet in the current commodity price environment. To the extent that commodity prices improve from current levels, it's our current intention to use the excess cash flow to reduce leverage rather than accelerate growth.","Looking at the balance sheet, we're committed to reducing our debt to EBITDAX to less than 3 times as swiftly as we can and, in the longer term, we will strive towards an investment-grade profile. In order to reduce leverage, we're pursuing various asset sales, which includes our remaining Mid-Continent properties in our Northeast Pennsylvania assets. In addition, we will look at ways to pull forward value on some of our acreage that we would not otherwise develop in a timeframe that drives our valuation.","By efficiently allocating capital to our best projects and spending below cash flow, Range can de-lever over time, given the quality of our inventory. The magnitude and timing of this method to reduce debt is clearly very sensitive to commodity prices. However, given our peer-leading recycle ratio, Range's capital efficiency, our growth per dollar spent should remain among the best in the industry. While we're proud of that metric, we're equally focused on improving our leverage metrics.","Many of our stockholders have been loud and clear that they expect the industry to rapidly focus on the next stage of the shale play development, which is focusing less on growth metrics, and instead focusing on return on capital, cash flow and returning cash to shareholders when it makes sense.","We agree. We think it's right for Range and our investors as well, and this fits well with our current stage of development in the Marcellus. I think it's also worth pointing out, for the last decade, Range has been one of the very few E&P companies with its executive compensation tied to debt-adjusted per-share metrics and not absolute growth targets. In addition, this year Range added a drilling rate of return metric to our compensation. We think this clearly evidences our board's and management's commitment to return-based metrics.","We have deployed or redeployed billions of dollars of your capital and, in doing so, we achieved a strong position in one of the best shale basins in the world. Going forward, we expect Range's combination of assets and infrastructure will permit the flexibility to continually optimize returns from drilling capital, balance sheet improvement and returns to shareholders.","What distinguishes Range is both a very high quality and a very large inventory. We have core locations that will last for many years beyond that of most other companies. As gas demand continues to grow with time and if gas trades more like an international commodity, Range will have plenty of high-quality inventory, which we believe will create significant free cash flow and shareholder value over the long term.","I will now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. Production for the third quarter came in at 1.99 Bcf equivalent per day, which is a little over our guidance of 1.97 Bcf equivalent per day. And guidance for the fourth quarter remains at 2.17 Bcf equivalent per day, resulting in annual growth of 30%. Organically, this represents about 10% year-over-year growth.","This expected $200 million a day ramp of new production coming online during the fourth quarter fits well with our anticipated incremental pipeline capacity, expected improving pricing differentials and sets us up well for 2018, consistent with Jeff's description of next year and beyond.","Looking at some of the operational highlights for the quarter. We'll start with Appalachia and bring you up to speed on some exceptional well performance from seven different Marcellus pads spread across our acreage position in southwest Pennsylvania.","Starting in the super-rich area, we reported a seven-well pad last quarter with an average lateral length of 10,685 feet completed with an average of 54 stages per well. At the time, we reported five of the seven wells were flowing to sales with strong results.","The remaining wells were brought to sales in the third quarter, generating an average IP per well for the seven wells of over 30 million cubic feet equivalent per day, or 5,000 BOE per day per well being greater than 70% liquids.","These wells continue to be high condensate producers, with the pad producing over 5,000 barrels per day of condensate for over 30 days, which was a main driver behind our 21% quarter-over-quarter increase in condensate production for the company.","The wells have been transitioned to permanent production equipment, which by design constrains the wells and, after 90 days of production to sales under these constrained conditions, are performing well above the type curve on a normalized basis.","Also in the super-rich portion of our acreage, we completed two four-well pads turned to sales in the third quarter. The average lateral length for the eight wells is 9,652 feet completed with an average of 49 stages per well.","The average IP from the two pads were both greater than 40 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well and more than 60% liquids. One of the pads came online early in the quarter. And after 90 days to sales, again under constrained conditions, continues to perform significantly above the normalized type curve.","Moving to the east in our wet gas area, I want to update you on a three-well pad turned to sales last quarter near the Houston plant. Having been online for about 180 days and under constrained conditions, the wells are performing 77% above the wet area type curve on a normalized basis. These are clearly outstanding wells and highlight improved well productivity from an area that we began drilling over a decade ago.","Also in the wet gas area, we recently completed a five-well pad and a six-well pad with average lateral lengths of 11,416 feet averaging 58 stages per well. We're currently flowing the wells under constrained conditions through our permanent production equipment, with two wells still cleaning up on flowback. And the average IP per well on each pad was over 30 million cubic feet equivalent per day with over 50% liquids.","Moving further to the east, to the dry gas area. On the last call, we discussed a four-well pad in our dry gas acreage with average laterals greater than 11,000 feet. At the time of the last call, this pad had maintained a flow rate of 100 million a day for 40 days. Updated numbers show this pad maintained 96 million a day for 99 days, with production at the end of the third quarter still well over 80 million a day for the pad. These are incredible results. And we're presently offsetting this pad and expect to bring the new wells online by the end of this year.","All of the pads I just discussed are pointed out on a new slide on page 9 in our updated presentation on the website. These highlighted pads are a reflection of the quality and repeatability of our asset, our large de-risked inventory and our exceptional team in Appalachia. I believe they also reflect our technical team's ability to significantly improve well results by incorporating Big Data analytics and, therefore, applying the appropriate completion strategies and technologies.","Range currently holds four of the top-six highest reported rates to sales in the entire Marcellus play. We literally have thousands of these types of opportunities left to drill across our acreage position, representing many years of value-creating development.","We continue to make improvements in operational efficiencies across the board in Appalachia. Let me go through some quick examples comparing the third quarter of this year to the third quarter of last year.","On the drilling side, we drilled one well in the third quarter of 2016 that was greater than 10,000 feet of lateral length. We drilled 19 wells greater than 10,000 feet in the third quarter of this year. The average drilled lateral length in the third quarter of 2016 was 6,171 feet. The average in the third quarter of 2017 was over 11,700 feet, representing a 90% increase.","Importantly, drilling costs per lateral foot in the third quarter of 2016 was $302 and in 2017 is $202 per foot, which is a 33% decrease. This means we drilled 90% longer laterals at 33% less cost per foot than a year ago. And five of the company's top-10 longest laterals were drilled in the third quarter of this year.","The completions team successfully completed 1,730 fracs stages in the third quarter, which is a record amount of stages representing 31% more stages than the previous record while only utilizing three frac crews.","Year-to-date, lease operating expenses in Appalachia are 15% lower on a unit basis as compared to the same time period last year. Water sharing agreements with outside operators and the redeployment of production facilities have been large contributors to saving millions of dollars by reducing our capital cost and operating expenses and are a key part of our strategy to compete in what is currently a difficult commodity business.","While it's early and we're still working on the plans for 2018 budget, in Appalachia we believe the average lateral length of wells put to sales next year will be over 10,000 feet versus an average of greater than 9,500 feet for the second half of this year. The mix of dry wells versus wet wells is expected to be slightly higher in 2018, and we should be approaching around 50% of our wells on existing pads versus around 30% this year.","Again, it's early, and this can change throughout the year as the team optimizes our plan, as they always do, striving for the best economics and more capital-efficient operations. I'm pleased to report that the permitting process has run very efficiently these past few months and we don't foresee any issues with permits going forward. Our team, along with the Pennsylvania DEP, has done a tremendous job getting us back on track.","Shifting now to North Louisiana. Our plan for the remainder of the year remains consistent, focusing on Terryville while strategically testing and delineating the extension areas. In Terryville, we've made great strides in improving cost while driving operational efficiencies and we're continuing to delineate the stacked pay potential of the field. In Terryville, we announced the first three wells located, designed and executed totally by the Range team in early September.","The two Upper Red wells have averaged 30-day rates to sales of $25.8 million and $20.7 million public feet equivalent per day, respectively, with lateral lengths of 7,427 feet and 6,827 feet. Both were completed with typical fluid intensity and both wells are in line with the type curve, as expected. A good example of the stack pay potential at Terryville is the Lower Deep Pink well on that same pad, which is a 7,400-foot lateral completed with 25 stages. The well averaged 20.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day for 30 days for sales and is the best Pink interval well drilled in the field to-date. We have more wells planed in this area for 2018 and beyond.","We did not bring any new wells online during the quarter after these three. On the last call, we were hopeful that we would have had a couple of more Terryville wells to discuss on this call, but the frac crew showed up a few weeks later than we had predicted. We just started the flowbacks on two Upper Red wells and are in the very early stages of cleaning these wells up. Currently, we have three frac crews working and this activity will, of course, drive the big ramp in production during the fourth quarter as the remaining 2017 wells will be coming online in November and December.","In the extension area, we currently have work going on a three new fault blocks that look promising. We recently finished completing a well in a new fault block to the north of Driscoll Field, which is south of Terryville. The lateral was completed in three phases to study different completion designs and to get detailed information in order to model the reservoir. The early production data is very promising, with peak 24-hour production rates on a normalized basis being over 3.5 million per day per thousand-foot of lateral.","Also the horizontal wells offsetting our early extension area horizontal test in separate salt (20:50) blocks to the east and west of Vernon Field are underway, with one rig drilling and the other rig moving in next week. We expect to see production from these two wells late this year or early next year.","Switching to marketing. By the end of the first quarter of 2018, Range will have incremental gross transportation capacity of 900 million a day out of southwest Pennsylvania, with over 70% reaching the Gulf Coast, which currently receives near NYMEX-based pricing.","These projects include TransCanada's Leach and Rain (21:29) Xpress Projects and Enbridge's Tetco Adair Southwest Project, which are both projected to be in service prior to year-end, and then Energy Transfer's Rover Project, which should reach full completion by the end of the first quarter of 2018. When all of these are online, Range will have the ability to transport greater than 90% of its production out of southwest Pennsylvania to markets which we believe will continue to provide better pricing.","Of the additional capacity, Range plans to immediately fill more than half by, first, rerouting our existing local production and then, second, we'll be sending volumes from the fourth quarter production growth to these projects. By the end of 2018, we should essentially reach full utilization of our transportation.","Importantly, these additions to Range's portfolio reduce basis volatility, especially during seasonally weak months and should increase the predictability of Range's corporate natural gas differential going forward.","As it relates to the near-term macro for natural gas, the in-service of these Appalachian projects does not always mean that production will immediately increase to fill the new capacity. I understand that this has been the case in the past, when capacity additions were anywhere from two-tenths of a B per day all the way up to a close to a B per day, and the industry seemed to immediately fill those new pipes.","However, with between 13 Bcfs per day and 14 Bcfs per day of new capacity additions happening between now and the end of 2018, we believe industry cannot support the production increases equivalent to the capacity added from these projects in southwest Pennsylvania, especially given where the strip is today combined with sweet spot exhaustion. Unless we see a significant uptick in rig additions, we think the Basin will see significant displacement of gas from local markets over the next few quarters as production has simply moved to better markets rather than an instant wave of new production.","Moving to liquids. Range reported NGL pricing of 35% of WTI during the third quarter, which, for Range, is the highest realization as a percent of WTI in several years, primarily led by the increases we've seen in propane prices both domestically and internationally.","Propane prices slowly increased throughout this past summer and achieved multi-year highs in September as inventories versus the five-year average remained below normal, especially when adjusting for current demand and export levels based on days of storage. Slower than expected domestic propane supply growth and strong export demand have continued to pull storage down. That, coupled with low stocks in Asia ahead of winter and the start-up of additional PDH plants in the last part of 2017 and into 2018, should keep U.S. and global propane prices elevated into next year.","As the only producer with propane capacity on Mariner East 1, Range has been exporting the majority of its propane out of market since early 2016. By doing so, we've been able to capture above-Mont Belvieu prices in Europe and Asia and expect to see opportunities to replicate this success in the future.","Looking into 2018 and 2019. As additional NGL projects start up in Appalachia over the coming quarters, Range is well-positioned to benefit financially, as local NGL supply is sent out of Basin, improving local liquids pricing. Range will have the optionality of selling both internationally and taking advantage of improving local markets.","As a result of these anticipated improvements to NGL pricing, we expect to see a percent of WTI differential for Range's fourth quarter NGL price of around 35%. And though still early, 2018 appears to be at a much better starting point than how 2017 began. Again, we believe this will be a unique advantage for Range as one of the largest NGL producers in the U.S.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials.","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, Ray. In the third quarter, revenues and cash flow were higher than the prior quarter and significantly higher than the third quarter of last year. We hit our marks on production and total costs were in-line with guidance.","Natural gas, NGL and oil revenues, including cash-settled derivatives, were $524 million or 47% higher than the third quarter of 2016. Third quarter cash flow was $204 million, 66% higher than last year. Year-to-date cash flow totaled $656 million, a 108% increase from year-to-date 2016. Third quarter EBITDAX was $251 million and year-to-date EBITDAX totaled $794 million.","Fully diluted cash flow per share for the third quarter was $0.83, 22% higher than the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date cash flow per fully diluted share was $2.68, 46% higher than year-to-date last year.","As cash revenue is growing faster than cash costs, our MCFE cash margin for the third quarter was $1.09, which is in-line with the second quarter and a 33% improvement over the third quarter of last year. With strengthening NGL prices and new pipeline capacity coming on later in the fourth quarter and early next year, we anticipate noteworthy improvement in our cash margins going forward.","Net income adjusted for non-cash and non-recurring items, using common analyst methodology, was $12 million, while GAAP net income was a loss of $128 million due to several extraordinary expense items. On the recurring item expense side, direct operating unit cost expense came in $0.02 above guidance due to higher work-over costs, while production taxes came in $0.01 over guidance due to higher-than-anticipated ad valorem and severance taxes, including the Pennsylvania Impact Fee. Other unit costs were below or in-line with guidance.","On the non-recurring expense side, we had a bit of noise in the quarter. First, we took $73 million in proved property impairments to the Mid-Continent cost center as we prepared our remaining Mid-Continent properties for an active sales process. $9 million of this total represents an exploratory dry hole expense also booked to the Mid-Continent cost center.","Second, under successful efforts accounting, leases that we did not anticipate renewing upon expiration in future periods must be impaired in the current quarter. As a result, we impaired a total of $43 million of unproved properties in the third quarter as we have begun to rightsize and further high-grade our anticipated 2018 leasing activity.","Turning to the balance sheet. As Jeff stated, we are intently focused on bringing down our leverage below 3 times over the near term, with additional reductions to follow. We have active asset sales process underway. But as usual, timing of these sales is difficult to predict. Until sales are consummated, our liquidity remains ample, with over $600 million in committed availability and no long-term debt maturities until 2021.","The third quarter was an active quarter for our hedging program, with additional 2017, 2018 and 2019 volumes hedged across most all of our products. In particular, we added significant hedge positions to our projected 2018 natural gas production. The specifics of these new hedges are too numerous to mention, but are detailed in the earnings release, 10-Q and supplemental tables found on the Range website.","In summary, third quarter was solid and steady. We hit our marks and look forward to the fourth quarter, which should bring higher production, improving margins and an excellent base to build from in 2018.","Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Ventura. And your first question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Morning, guys. Hey, Jeff. Just as you talked about the generalities of 2018, I know you can't talk specifics, but curious if you could just provide a little bit more description by how you may think about capital allocation between the Marcellus and Louisiana and maybe anything that may cause you to change that allocation thought process?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Okay. Great question, Ron. We haven't finalized our 2018 plans yet, but let me try and come at it from a little different angle to see if I can help frame it a little bit.","As you know, we have additional firm transportation coming on in Appalachia into 2018. And it makes strong economic sense to utilize as much of that capacity as we can as quickly as possible.","A good portion of that capacity, more than half, will be immediately used by simply redirecting volumes out of the current local sales to better markets. Also, we have flexibility in how we can allocate capital. And by allocating additional capital to the Marcellus, we expect to fully utilize the new capacity by the end of next year.","To do so will only require corporate growth of approximately 10%. At current strip prices, we believe we can achieve that 10% year-over-year growth while spending less than cash flow. That's a great starting point for 2018 because, theoretically, any increases in commodity prices or proceeds from asset sales could go straight to paying down debt, and we would still fill our new firm capacity. And I'll reiterate that at current strip pricing, spending within cash flow is embedded in our plans going forward.","The important thing to note is that we're in a very good position coming into 2018. We feel we're on track in north Louisiana, as you've seen with our recent wells, and we continue to drill phenomenal wells in Pennsylvania with longer laterals.","Hopefully, that provides a little context. And we're looking forward to providing a full update later this year or early next year.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","And then I just want to follow-up, just as it relates to Louisiana. As your Upper Reds are now tracking your curve, can you provide a little bit more details maybe, Ray, on the Deep Pink and your early thoughts from that well? And how development of that zone could fit into the Upper Red?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Well, sure, Ron. Clearly, that Pink well is the best well in the field to-date from that interval, and we're going to continue to study that. We're definitely making plans to offset it, of course. And I think we'll do some wells in 2018 and 2019 and beyond in that area again.","We think there's several cases throughout the field where there's some stacked pay potential like that. It's hard to talk about until we've tested them and fracked them and completed them and so forth, but we're very encouraged with that.","We're also very encouraged that the Upper Red wells are right on track. We've got I think 16 more to put online in the fourth quarter that we have really good expectations for. And we look forward to reporting on all of that as we get some of that production history probably at the next call in February.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","A quick follow-up on the 2018 capital allocation. You mentioned in some of your prepared comments a focus on dry gas. Is the idea there that gives you the biggest volume to fill that new takeaway capacity?","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Well, I think that what I said was I think right now the plans are really early, so this is not formal guidance by any means. But in the current plans that we're putting together, it looks like our mix of dry gas versus liquids and super-rich gas will be slightly higher. But I think that's more of a timing at looking at what's available as far as existing pads to drill on and capacity in the gathering systems at the compressor stations and so forth and so on rather than just trying to optimize.","Now, given that everything else is equal, clearly, we would drill the dry gas well to create more volume faster and the economics are still a little bit better there also. So, it's sort of all of that worked in together. But right now, it does look like it will be slightly more dry than next year, but, again, that probably will change. It always does.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Gotcha. And then a quick follow-up on north Louisiana. As you move south to Driscoll Field, it looks like that Cotton Valley interval gets awfully thick. Do you think that, number one, are there multiple zones in, say, the Red there? And, two, will the cost of those wells rise? Is it more over-pressured? Any thoughts?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Well, it's a great question, Bob. And, yes, you're exactly right. As you go deeper into the Basin or south of Terryville, we do see a good thickening reservoir. And, in fact, on slide 11 in our presentation is a cross section that illustrates that very fact.","You go from a focus on Upper Red in Terryville around 100 Bs per square mile to some of the areas down in Driscoll and around Vernon are close to 400 Bs per square mile. You go from one pretty much identified target in the Upper Red to where the Upper Red down in the southern part of the Basin there might have three targets in it. The Lower Red, Vernon Field is primarily a Lower Red development, so that has about three targets in it.","And so, like we talked about on the last call, we've got a couple of vertical tests going and we're going to go slow and be very strategic and thoughtful about what's the best way to approach these fault blocks, but, again, we're very encouraged. We've announced another encouraging result in this new fault block to the north of Driscoll Field, so we've got three fault blocks now that look very encouraging and we're going to look forward about talking about the results of some more tests in those wells as we get into next year.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. And just looking, Jeff, at that slide on page nine, obviously, some fantastic results, particularly on those two in the four-well pad, over 41 a day, and then that four-well pad over 40 a day. I see the lateral lengths there.","Can you talk about, is there anything else special on those wells that, as far as the surfactant, or just the fluid that you did on those, those obviously, stuck out a little bit. I didn't know if you had any more color around those.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. Neal, this is Ray. And I'll fill in that one and Jeff can add some color, too, or Alan. But, clearly, I think the biggest change is that we've continue to optimize our reservoir models and we continue to look at things like targeting, cluster, perforation cluster placement, the amount of proppant that we're putting in there, fluid, injection rates.","Again, we present to the public three type curves: super-rich, wet and dry. But the reservoir team up there and the completions team has about 30 different models that they're working on at any one given time. So I think it's just a refinement of that.","I think another big influence, really, really big influence, over the last three, four years, has been basically, as we've incorporated the Big Data analytics and starting to look at a whole slew of different variables and using machine learning. And what's important is, taking that machine learning and then doing predictive analysis with it and doing some things that weren't necessarily apparent to an old frac engineer like me, for instance, things that were totally different. And clearly, it's paying off.","If you go back and look at my remarks in the last conference call where I talked about we had some areas that were over 4 Bs per 1,000-foot, clearly all these wells we just talked about. And the slides that illustrate the fact that it's across the whole position; it's not just any one particular area. And we literally do have thousands more of these to do and the lateral lengths are getting longer and the teams are getting better and we're using more predictive analysis in analytics and so forth.","And so, I think this is a trend you're going to continue to see and we look forward to updating all these economics and curves and costs and everything, like we always do about first of the year, so I think we'll come out with that probably in February. And we're pretty excited about what we see going forward. The economics are looking really, really good.","And I think it's a great timing, like Jeff talked about in his remarks, that we're at that point where all of these big projects are reaching commissioning. We said we don't have any more big projects coming online. We believe there's going to be a very viable market there locally and we're going to be able to take advantage of that. And I think is a strategy that we've been 10 years putting together and it's coming to fruition. And I'm, for one, really glad to see it.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","And just add a little bit. I think Ray and Dennis and really the entire team that we have working on that technically are just doing a great job of continuing to drive performance up.","But the other thing at a higher level, and just \u2013 and Ray said it, but it's an important point when you look at that slide on page nine, we have a big blocky position in the core part of the play. And there's a lot of advantages to that, and particularly now that we have all that infrastructure in place. It just demonstrates, that slide, coupled with where we've been trending over time that that position is high-quality across northeast, southwest and the center part of it. We have a big blocky position that enables us to continue to drill longer laterals, continue to drive efficiencies and experiment.","And, again, Ray said it earlier, we think the cores of these plays are defined. And the key is what company has core, and you're going to start at some point to see that sweet spot exhaustion. Range will have plenty of inventory to drive well beyond that and to continue to drive efficiencies.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","One more point I wanted to just emphasize again is the pad number five on that map is a pad right by the Houston plant. For those of you that have followed us for a long time, the Discovery Marcellus well was basically right by the Houston plant there. And, of course, we built some of those early systems there. And those wells have been really good from decades \u2013 from a decade ago, and that system has been packed for years without the ability to add anything to it.","That pad has been online for 180 days and it's almost 80% above the type curve on a normalized basis. And if you look at the IPs, it stacks up well and it's a 30% shorter lateral on average than most of the other ones in there. So we're really, really excited about the potential locations that we see going forward. And I think that's a great example that we don't want to over gloss it.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great details, guys. And then just one follow-up if I could. Ray, you and Roger mentioned about, obviously, the focus on getting that debt down to about 3 times and getting it to investment-grade. Being cognizant of not having that 2018 plan out there, would that entail trying to get to that \u2013 I'm just trying to look at the general overall activity with given prices today, given your hedges and given the plant capacity coming on. Would that mean would you potentially accelerate or think about going the other way as far as trying to bring that leverage in line?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Let me start. But when would you look at leverage, and, in fact, that might have been noticed that I gave originally and then the answer to Ron's question initially, the important part is we think to fill pipes requires approximately 10% growth, which we think we can do at current strip price. And we can do that, get 10% year-over-year growth, spending less than cash flow.","In addition to that, we have active asset sale underway. So it's really a combination of those two things, of that asset sales coupled with the ability to fill pipes and get growth below cash flow that would drive delevering.","The pace of that then depends on where oil and gas prices and liquids prices end up coupled with the speed of the asset sales. And we know with asset sales it's important to find the right buyer, to be patient. It was important for us in Nora. And sometimes it's hard to predict that exact timing, but we have those things in place and the ability to do that.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, guys.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit, BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you, folks. Good morning. Just wanted to revisit your remarks on transport costs and the commissioning phase coming to an end here. When exactly do transport costs peak at $1.20 per M? And what's the progression in unit costs from that point forward? Asking really in an effort to get a better sense of whether the capacity additions are truly a competitive advantage here and what that means for margins and recycle ratios going forward.","Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.","Dan, this is Laith. Looking at the transport costs, that will peak at a time when Rover comps on. So if you're looking at that being sometime in the first quarter, it would peak around first or second quarter. And then how quickly we drive that down will simply be dependent on the growth numbers that we've got for 2018, which we'll come out with probably early next year.","But it sets us up really well, like Ray had mentioned, it gets 70% of our gas headed to the Gulf Coast. And you start to see the benefit of that additional transport really in the fourth quarter. And our fourth quarter differentials improve to $0.28 from $0.51, which we saw in the third quarter. And then looking forward into next year, it improves further to $0.15. So, a massive improvement in differentials, which, to your point, serves to offset that increased transport.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the answer there. North Louisiana DNC costs, a question on that. Wild Horse WRD as well as MRD, that was acquired, stated completed well costs well above the $7.4 million that the company now estimates. What explains the difference in your view? That is, are there any above-ground costs not included in your estimate? Or if the comparison is really apples-to-apples, then what inefficiencies do you think have been squeezed out since taking over operations that would explain the lower costs here?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Well, it's a great question. And I think when we first looked at the deal, over a year ago, it was at $11.3 million, or I can't remember exactly, but over $11 million well cost. And we predicted early on we could get down to $8.7 million, close to $8 million I think in the acquisition, S-4, or whatever it's called. And essentially, we've been able to get it down to $7.4 million for a 7,500-foot lateral.","I think a lot of that is people. We brought on board Scott Chesebro, who has a world of experience in high-temperature high-pressure drilling and has optimized some big drilling programs for some big operators in a lot of different basins. So it was a big focus on changing out the team and the people. It was a big focus on implementing some new technologies, new motors, new bits, new mud systems. A lot of that on the drilling side.","And then the completion side, I would say was more just getting back to a point where \u2013 we just do it different than a lot of them do. We weren't necessarily focused on 30-day IPs and pullback procedures similar to what they had done. So we're doing things differently. I think we're approaching the stimulation designs in execution, especially more like we do in Appalachia, 24\/7 operations and a lot of different things like that.","So I think it's just an overall different long-term approach, much more focused on trying to smooth out the activity level. You can do a much better job when you have a frac crew working for you continuously, rather than bringing them in for two or three weeks and then letting them go for two months and then bringing them back and so forth and so on.","And I said early on when we announced the deal that we would really be going into 2018 before we could kind of smooth it out and do it \"the Range way.\" And that's really where we are. I think we'll be moving into next year.","What's important right now is that we've got three frac crews running. We've basically got them fired up just in the last week or two. Everything's right on track in north Louisiana. Third quarter looked good, we just didn't put very many wells online. And so I think we're pretty pleased with what we see going forward there.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Appreciate it. And one last one maybe here just on asset divestitures. What more can you tell us about the contemplated divestitures of the Mid-Con and northeast PA assets, in particular timing? And use of proceeds here? Guessing that it goes right to the balance sheet.","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, use of proceeds to the balance sheet. We have active processes underway. We're actively working on divesting in the Mid-Continent as well as northeast PA. And like I said in my prepared remarks, we'd also consider \u2013 we've got a big acreage position in Pennsylvania, 900,000 surface acres. And in some of those stacked pay areas, if you just look at southwest PA, 1.5 million net acres when you consider not just Marcellus, but Upper Devonian and Utica.","So we have the Mid-Continent, we have northeast PA. And then to the extent somebody is willing to pay us what we think is a good value for something we're not going to get to for a while and pull some of that value forward, we'd consider that as well.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Appreciate it. Have a great day. Thank you.","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. You had mentioned that to fill the total capacity by year end next year in the northeast, that would imply corporate growth of 10%. In that 10% corporate growth, what does that imply for the Terryville growth for Louisiana?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Again, by late this year and early next year, we'll give actual more distinct guidance. But what we're saying is, this year, we allocated about two-thirds of our capital to PA and about a third to north Louisiana. We expect good results and we're having good results in both areas.","But given the new pipes coming on, we'll probably over-allocate capital to the Marcellus. Use some of that north Louisiana cash flow \u2013 again, the advantage of having two areas \u2013 to help fill pipes.","So the growth would be disproportionate to PA next year, because we'll be allocating more capital there. We'll give you more color late this year most likely, early next year, which is our typical timeframe for coming out with the budget.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then in the Terryville Field in north Louisiana you took some write-offs for acreage you expect will expire. How many rigs do you need to keep running there to hold the acreage you now anticipate going forward in 2018? I think you're running, is it two or three frac crews and then how many rigs now? And how many do you need to average next year to then hold the acreage and not incur any further write-down on expirations?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Sure, Bob. I'll see if I can hit all those points. I think in Terryville this year, we'll probably average around five rigs. We've had up to three frac crews at different periods. But, again, they've kind of been in compressed timeframes when it's happened. So right now, currently I think we have five rigs running right now. We have three frac crews running there. I do know that for a fact.","I think next year it will \u2013 like Jeff was alluding to, I think it's probably a little less than that. And hopefully we're at more of a steady pace for frac crews, where we would average something around one crew running most of the year, but probably not all year. Appalachia activity will probably be similar to now, if not a little more.","Again, we're just formalizing those plans right now. And we'll come out with formal guidance in late this year or early next year, but that's kind of where we see it right now.","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, Bob, this is Roger. Yeah. The expirations, again, we're taking these impairments ahead of the expirations, so these haven't actually expired. So we have a lot of optionality going forward if the drilling results or whatever changes our direction of capital.","But I would point out that when it comes to acreage, when you look at our proxy peer group, there's four of our peers that have market caps higher than Range whose total acreage positions are less than what we have in north Louisiana. So we have plenty of acreage there to move the needle for us. We're not at all concerned about that.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Sure. I understand that. I was just wondering how many rigs you needed just to hold what you do anticipate not expiring there, but that's good.","And then I guess just one last quick question. You said that the frac crew showed up couple of weeks late. Is that any indication that the results of just tightness in the market and that crew having to come from, say, some other place like the Permian? Or is it other factors that caused that to be late?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, there's no doubt that the activity levels were up and there's a lot of tightness. There's crews that have probably left from every basin that have hauled on to West Texas, New Mexico, over the last months. Don't expect that's going to change a whole lot. Right now, we're going through the process of putting prices together and bids and awarding contracts. And that will happen for us over the next 30 days or 60 days or so. That's part of putting our formalized plan together to present to the board in December and so forth and so on.","So I think it's definitely indication of that. And that's simply what it was, the frac crew just tied up for another operator longer than we thought and didn't get to us as quickly as we had thought when we talked about it 90 days ago. As you know, in this business things change a lot in 90 days oftentimes.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, great. Thank you.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","All right. Thanks.","Operator","We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc for our final question.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just under the wire here. Thanks, guys. I guess I'll round out the call with maybe more of a philosophical conversation. Jeff, I wanted to understand a little bit more around your comments. Once you fill the 900 million of incremental pipe capacity coming out of Appalachia, you said a couple things. One, you want to stay below 3 times levered. But, two, that you're going to be focusing more on perhaps under spending cash flows at that point and continuing to delever.","I guess should we think about it beyond 2018 for Range, that the philosophy will be just to hold that full capacity steady unless commodities would dictate otherwise, where you'd want to significantly start ramping up capacity?","At that point, should we just be thinking there's obviously the in-Basin option to accelerate. But is the long-term plan here once you get to that full capacity on pipelines to start harvesting some free cash as opposed to even considering growth beyond that full capacity?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","I think the key is, one, again, we'll come out late this year, early next year, with our 2018 plans and maybe a little clearer vision past that. But the important part is I think we're in a great position and we have great flexibility. Again, to fill the pipes next year, 10% year-over-year growth, we can do that for less than cash flow at strip pricing.","And when you look forward then, we have a lot of flexibility with no new projects coming on. Like Ray said, there's 13 Bs of additional pipeline capacity coming in just to the southwest part of the play over the next couple of years.","So, we think there's plenty of availability either to sell product in-Basin, which will help reduce and drive down our unit costs that way, or perhaps to pick some of that up and move it to better markets. But because of the high-quality position, peer-leading or one of the best recycle ratios in the business for an oil or gas company, we think we're in a great position with a lot of flexibility.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that. And then the comments around perhaps bringing the value forward outside of non-core assets I guess within the core. Are you considering some pruning within the core of outright sales? Or are you also considering developmental JVs or is it everything is on the table to try to maximize MPV?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, I think what we're saying is we are open and we're open-minded to what that would be. Of course, we've got the asset sales in the Mid-Continent, northeast PA. But to the extent there's some method or some opportunity out there to pull value forward, we'd certainly be open to that.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys. And best of luck in Q4.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for closing remarks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","I just want to say we really appreciate everybody taking time to be on the call with us this morning.

Such statements are subject to risk and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.","After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer period.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Laith Sando, Vice President of Investor Relations at Range Resource. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Laith Sando","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range\u2019s first quarter earnings call. The speakers on today\u2019s call are Jeffrey Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Chief Operating officer; and Roger Manny, our Chief Financial Officer.","Hope you\u2019ve had a chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we\u2019ve posted on the Web site. We\u2019ll be referencing some of the new slides this morning.","We also filed a 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It\u2019s available on our Web site under the Investors tab. Or you can access it using the SEC\u2019s Edgar system.","Before we begin, let me also point out that we\u2019ll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. In addition, we posted supplemental tables on our Web site to assist in the calculation of these non-GAAP measures and to provide more details on both natural gas and NGL pricing.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Ventura","Thank you, Ray. Since our last call, we continue to make progress on several fronts. On the marketing side, INEOS is now routinely picking up ethane at Marcus Hook and shipping it to Norway. At the same time, we are now loading propane on VLGCs and shipping it to various international markets. The ability to ship ethane and propane out of Marcus Hook is a significant competitive advantage for Range. As an E&P company, we\u2019re now able to connect a large percentage of our NGL production to end markets, the buyers and consumers.","As represented in our guidance for 2016, it has a meaningful impact on both NGL production and pricing. Given our transportation contracts for 2017, approximately 70% of our natural gas is projected to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachian Basin, further improving Range\u2019s expected natural gas differentials going forward.","By the end of 2017, we expect to increase the amount of natural gas to be sold outside of the Appalachian Basin to about 82% of production. On the asset sale front, we recently closed the sale of our Bradford County acreage in Northeast Pennsylvania. The sale price was approximately $112 million. This was our only non-operative position in the Marcellus.","We have also recently signed a purchase and sale agreement for a southern acreage package in the stack play in Oklahoma. We have agreed to sell around 9,200 net acres and approximately 5 million cubic feet equivalent per day of net production from approximately 200 wells in Blaine, Canadian and Kingfisher Counties for about $77 million. We expect to close by the end of May. ","The remaining northern acreage packages predominantly in Major County, Oklahoma consists of approximately 19,000 net acres and is on trend in north of the existing stack play and is in the emerging Osage play. Given that this play and other plays are moving in a direction of our position, we believe this acreage will increase in value with time and additional drilling results. Our plans will be to keep it for now since it's primarily HBP and we\u2019ll look at the possibility of selling it at a more opportune time in the future.","Importantly, with these two asset sales of approximately $190 million, we expect no increase in absolute debt in 2016 as compared to year-end 2015 based on current pricing. This type of neutral budget preserves our balance sheet and liquidity, while allowing the macroenvironment time to improve.","On the operations front, our team continues to optimize our development. We continue to improve both capital and operating efficiencies. Ray will discuss this and give some specific examples in his discussion. The Marcellus, specifically in Southwest Pennsylvania, will continue to be the focal point of our activity this year. As Ray will mention, we drilled some outstanding new wells and the performance of some of the older wells continues to impress.","Our third dry Utica well is performing better than the first two wells and appears to be one of the top wells in the entire Utica play. It's great to have 400,000 net acres of dry Utica potential beneath our Marcellus acreage, which gives us options down the road. The deciding factor for Range will ultimately be what are the economics of the Utica versus the Marcellus. We will allocate capital to the wells with the best economics. And right now, that means our Southwest Pennsylvania Marcellus development.","In 2016, we\u2019re projecting lower well cost, the impact of improved price realizations, better transportation capabilities, and lower all-in unit cost. The capital efficiencies our team is achieving are very significant. This is particularly impactful when efficiencies are combined with the quality of the rock we have.","We believe this is one of the key differentiating investment attributes of Range and one of the reasons we\u2019re able to replace production so efficiently with maintenance CapEx of approximately $300 million or less. We believe Range has the highest expected EUR recoveries on a per lateral foot in the southwest portion of the Marcellus play combined with the lowest cost per lateral foot. ","For 2015, our expected finding costs, using current development cost to recover pud reserves, was $0.40 per mcfe, significantly lower than the expectations of other natural gas producers. In the price environment the industry is facing today, the ability to develop reserves more efficiently is a key advantage for Range. Utilizing a finding cost of $0.40 or better, coupled with our projected 2016 all-in cash cost and looking at 2017 strip prices, our projected unhedged recycle ratio approaches 2. As Ray mentioned on his last call, in our best areas, our projected unhedged recycle ratio was over 2.","In summary, the first quarter was meaningful for Range. We had a significant marketing project become operational. We\u2019ve got non-core assets sales that further high-grade our assets and keep debt unchanged at year-end, and we continue to see improving well results across our acreage in Southwest Pennsylvania, all of which sets up Range well for 2016 and into 2017.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations.","Ray Walker","Thanks, Jeff.","What I\u2019ll do this morning is cover our production guidance, provide some examples of cost reduction and efficiency improvements, give some color on well performance, and talk about some of the potential opportunities that we see going forward.","We continue to remain focused on capital allocation and our production growth is a result of high quality properties being developed by a strong technical team. Production for the first quarter came in at 1.38 Bcf equivalent per day with 33% liquids. And for the second quarter, we\u2019re setting guidance at 1.41 Bcf equivalent per day, with 32% to 35% liquids. Of note, during the second quarter, we expect to fully replace all the production sold from our three sales and our annual guidance moves to the high-end of our previous guidance and is now expected to be 1.41 to 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day.","We believe this year will look very similar to previous years with sequential quarterly growth and our exit rate will be higher than it was at the end of 2015, setting us up well for 2017.","For the first quarter, we continued to drive down our overall unit cost, resulting in a reduction of 10% from the prior year's quarter. Basically, all of the categories beat guidance.","One particular item that I would like to call your attention to is the LOE. Our operating teams continue to operate more efficiently. And when coupled with recent asset sales, our LOE per mcfe is 37% lower than a year ago and 14% lower than the prior quarter. ","Capital efficiency continues to improve. I\u2019ll go through just a few examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. On the completions front, we completed 1,324 stages with 2.25 crews during the quarter, setting another record. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, with the same number of crews, this is a 28% improvement. March was a record month, with 526 stages. We averaged 7.1 stages per day per crew, which is an improvement of 9% from a year ago. And in spite of completing longer laterals, we completed 15% more wells in the quarter than a year ago.","You\u2019ve seen our water costs dramatically improve as a result of logistics, planning and some creative new management tools, resulting in savings of over $350,000 per pad. These efficiency improvements resulted in a 31% reduction in total completion cost per foot of lateral compared to a year ago.","On the drilling side, for the first quarter, we achieved a 20% reduction in drilling costs per foot as compared to last year, while drilling 50% more lateral feet per day per well on average. Said another way, we drilled 50% faster and saved 20% on our drilling costs.","All of this helps us on two very significant fronts. First, we get better pricing from our service partners as they can count on very high utilization rates. While we don't make the terms of our service contracts public, what's important is that we believe that Range has the lowest cost per thousand foot of lateral in the basin.","And secondly, we get our wells to sales faster, reducing the time from capital spent to sales, therefore improving our capital efficiency. Essentially, with the same number of crews, we completed 15% more wells in the first quarter than we did a year ago. I'll refer you back to slide 8 in our updated presentation illustrating the improvements in capital efficiency that we\u2019ve achieved over the past several years. These examples that I've just covered should clearly illustrate why we expect to continue to improve into the future. And most importantly, we continue to work safely and environmentally responsibly.","Our cost savings have not been at the expense of well performance. We continue to achieve outstanding well results. We recently brought online five wells on a new seven well pad in our super rich area. The wells had an average lateral length of 6,000 feet and were completed with an average of 31 stages. The wells were produced under facility-constrained conditions and had an average 24-hour initial rate to sales of over 3,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 65% liquids.","Earlier in the quarter, we brought online a three well pad, also in the super rich area, with average initial production to sales of over 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 63% liquids. It\u2019s early, but clearly these pads may significantly outperform the averages and they represent examples of areas where we can focus more capital in the future.","In our dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania, we brought online two different pads worthy of mention. Together, these pads include ten wells, averaging 7,500 foot laterals, completed with 39 stages, with nine of those ten wells online, again under constrained conditions. The nine wells achieved an average initial rate to sales of about 16 million a day per well. These two pads represent opportunities in our dry gas areas where we have fairly new and low-cost gathering systems with ample takeaway and many more multi-well pads and long lateral wells that we can develop going forward.","On the last call, we discussed the flexibility of going back to existing Marcellus pads to drill additional wells. This morning, I\u2019d like to get into more specifics on a few particular examples. The first example is the pad that has been described in our presentation for some time now and is currently on page 39 of our updated presentation.","About two years ago, we went back on to a two-year old Marcellus pad and drilled two new infill laterals between the existing laterals. In this particular example, because the pad, road, water infrastructure, production facilities and so forth were already in place, the wells were $850,000 less expensive per well on average than the original well, even though they were 50% longer laterals. The new wells were landed with improved targeting technology and completed with updated frack designs. And after 600 days, the new wells produced 53% more than the original wells. And importantly, the new wells, which were spaced at 700 and 900 feet, respectively, did not impact the production of the original wells.","A second example is in our dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania where we went back on to an existing three-well pad and drilled three laterals. You can see this example on page 41. The original wells had an average lateral length of 4,800 feet completed with 25 stages and the average initial 24-hour rate to sales, again under constrained conditions, was 22.6 million a day per well. The new wells were drilled about one year later, averaging almost 8,700 foot laterals completed with 45 stages, and under facility constraints have an average initial 24-hour rate to sales of over 34 million a day per well. That's a 50% improvement in initial rates over the older wells. This is one of our very prolific areas that\u2019s performing well above our average type curve, with many opportunities to drill additional wells on this pad and nearby pads.","A third example is our wet area of Southwest Pennsylvania where we went back on to a two well existing pad and added five new wells with longer laterals and again newer completion technology. You can find this one on page 40. The original wells were completed in 2010 and had an average lateral length of 3,700 feet completed with 13 stages. And the average initial 24-hour rate to sales was 6.7 million a day equivalent per well. Five years later, in 2015, we completed five new wells averaging 1,500 foot laterals completed with 27 stages and these new wells had an average initial 24-hour rate to sales, again under constrained conditions, of 28.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well, which is over 300% improvement in initial in initial rates.","While we still have many new pads to develop, to restate what we said on the last call, we also have 124 pads with five or fewer wells in addition to 59 pads with 6 to 9 wells. This represents over 180 pads where we have the potential to go back and drill additional wells in any of our stacked pay intervals, whether it's Marcellus, Upper Devonian or Utica. While all these pads represent unique and different opportunities, it\u2019s important to point out that we have the potential to drill wells with reduced capital as significant infrastructure is already in place, lower operating costs as we develop new efficiencies, less gathering and compression as limited incremental infrastructure is needed when you're on an existing pad, potentially improved performances in the previous examples, and very little to no impact on the existing production. All of this results in a step change improvement in capital efficiencies and an even lower F&D like I discussed on the last call.","Another added and significant benefit is the much shorter execution time. And we avoid the need for any additional surface disturbance. Again, it\u2019s very early in our planning cycle, but we could potentially drill about 50% of our wells next year on existing pads and we believe the savings per well could range from $200,000 to as high as $500,000, depending on each particular situation. Some cases could be more. Again, we believe this is a unique advantage for Range.","As you know for years now, we've been showing type curves in our presentation on a normalized lateral length basis for the average of the actual wells that we\u2019ll bring to sales in a given year, all under the actual constrained conditions. We believe our average EURs per 1,000 foot are the best in the southwest portion of the play and that\u2019s among a strong performing group of our peers. We also believe our average cost per 1,000 foot are the lowest in the entire play. Again, these are the averages expected in a given year and we've always presented the prior year's production performance to support those type curves. ","What I\u2019d like to do now is steer away from the averages for a moment and point out a couple of specific areas. Let me began with an area in the dry gas portion of Washington County. This example consists of 22 wells from four separate well pads, in which we are projecting the average recovery is 3.1 Bcf per 1,000 foot. These wells have an average lateral length of 6,300 feet and the EUR is 21% better than our average dry gas area type curve. These wells have a minimum of 180 days and as much as two years of production history.","Based on the current cost to drill and complete these wells of $5 million, using a flat $3 NYMEX price, the internal rate of return is 61%. We\u2019re planning on turning to sales this year an additional 23 wells from five pads in this area with an average lateral length of approximately 7,000 feet.","Referring to the previous example I described in the wet gas area, we turn to sales five wells, again, which is illustrated on page 40, will be drilled on an existing pad. The new wells have a projected EUR of 3.6 Bcf equivalent per 1000 foot of lateral. This is 22% higher than our average EUR for the wet area type curve. These wells have been online for 11 months.","Based on the current cost to drill and complete these wells of $5 million, the return on these wells, using a flat $3 NYMEX price, is 34%. We\u2019re planning on turning to sales over the next 12 months an additional nine wells from two pads in this area, with an average lateral length of over 5,800 feet. We expect to continue with longer laterals going forward.","In 2014, our average lateral length drilled was 4,915 feet. In 2015, it was about 6,300 feet. And this year, we expect the average to be about 7,100 feet. While it's still early in our planning cycle for 2017, we expect to drill wells that average around 8,000 feet of lateral lengths. Ultimately, we expect we\u2019ll be drilling 10,000 foot laterals on average in the dry area and probably slightly less than that in the liquids areas.","Just as a point out, we\u2019re planning to turn to sales two wells later this year in the range of 9,500 foot laterals and we\u2019ll also drill three laterals over 13,000 feet this year with the longest planned for 16,220 feet of lateral length.","Importantly, our HP efforts are largely behind us after this year. Our land budget in 2014 was over $200 million. In 2015, we spent approximately $70 million. And this year, our land budget is reduced to approximately $20 million. Our development plan has positioned us to increase our flexibility going forward by allowing us to focus our capital on the very best return projects.","While our 2017 plans are still under development, the important things to remember are: We have a large core position, low-cost structure, strong capital efficiency, drilling longer laterals, an attractive transportation portfolio, ability to drill on over 180 existing pads as well as new pads, ability to focus on our best and most prolific areas, ability to increase liquids production when economically warranted, a low decline base production, very low maintenance CapEx, and finally strong operations and technical teams with a proven track record.","To the answer the common question about maintenance CapEx, if you consider what I've discussed here this morning regarding our ability to drill on existing pads, along with targeting some of our better areas, and couple that with our low base decline rate of approximately 19%, we have the ability to hold our 2007 production flat to this year's expected exit rate for $300 million or less.","We believe this low level of maintenance CapEx makes our production incredibly resilient if prices were to stay low, while providing us a solid base to grow from when the supply and demand equation improves and prices move higher. The point is that whatever prices do and wherever we set the drilling throttle, having a really low maintenance CapEx works in our favor.","Shifting to marketing, utilizing our Mariner East transportation, Range loaded the very first VLGC from the East Coast with 550,000 barrels of propane on March 19. Range also saw the first INEOS ship set sail from the East Coast during the first quarter. Both ethane and propane ships are now leaving Marcus Hook on a regular basis and having international exposure for our products is expected to benefit our net back pricing going forward.","Looking ahead, our next transportation option coming into service is the Texas Eastern Gulf market\u2019s expansion project expected to start later this year. This project will allow us to ship more production to the Gulf Coast region, anticipating a positive impact to our sales portfolio.","By the end of this year, we\u2019ll have about 70% of our gas sold outside the Basin. And like Jeff said earlier, by late 2017, we\u2019ll have over 80% of our gas sold outside the Basin, which we expect to result in better net back pricing.","As a further update, on our third Utica well, the DMC 10H is currently shut in for facilities build out and an extended bottom hole pressure buildup. We expect to bring the well to sales in about 60 days. The just over 30-day flow-back test initiated immediately after completion, again with no aging, averaged 18.3 million a day to sales with the gas rate essentially held flat with high flowing pressures. You can see how this well\u2019s performance compares to some of the nearby and noteworthy Utica wells drilled by our peers on page 35 in our updated presentation.","Early data indicates that this well could be one of the top wells today in the play. Our current expectations are that the well will be put to sales at approximately 12 million a day. The first phase of the reservoir modeling suggests it should hold that rate flat for approximately 500 days before declining. We\u2019ll know a lot more in a few months once we complete the next phase of our data acquisition and modeling and the well is actually put to sales. But, again, early indications are good.","As most of you know, the Utica cost almost 2.5 times more than our dry Marcellus. And while the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential, even with anticipated efficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells currently far exceed Utica returns.","Given limited production history thus far, on a risk-adjusted basis, it\u2019s clear to us that our high quality Marcellus wells are the superior investment. Our Utica potential is held by our Marcellus development and over time we expect that Utica can be a complementary development opportunity. But, for now, our plan for the rest of this year is to monitor our three wells along with the offset well, while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine the path forward from there.","In the meantime, we\u2019ll remain focused on high-graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible. As we continue to lower costs, improve efficiencies, drill longer laterals, and develop our core assets, we remain well positioned to create value.","Over to Roger.","Roger Manny","Thanks, Ray.","There were many successes in the first quarter of 2016 as Range continued to effectively position the company for the current economic environment and a future with higher takeaway capacity and better pricing.","Starting with the balance sheet this time, we ended the quarter with less debt than we entered and our capital spending plans are right on track to produce prudent growth in production and reserves with improving capital efficiency.","A major highlight of the quarter was the unanimous reaffirmation of our annually-determined $3 billion bank credit facility borrowing base. Beyond the committed liquidity it provides, looking behind the numbers at the approval process reveals three significant positive read-throughs.","First, the reaffirmation excluded the collateral value associated with the December 2015 Nora sale and the two more recent asset sales, which in aggregate exceeded $1 billion in sale proceeds in the unique portfolio of value-added marketing arrangements we have for our natural gas, NGLs and condensate, which will improve future pricing.","Our recycle ratio, based on our year-end 2015 reserve report F&D cost, projected 2016 unit cost structure projected 2016 basis to NYMEX and current unhedged strip price for 2017 is approaching two times, ensuring that we can continue to grow our reserves and production within unhedged future cash flow. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we believe, an underappreciated element, that balance sheet strength and preservation is having an unhedged recycle ratio above one times which allows for both growth and debt reduction at the same time over time.","Our first quarter ending debt-to-EBITDAX ratio for the past three years has been 3 times, 2.8 times, and 2.9 times respectively. The ratio at the end of this year's first quarter is a very manageable 3.3 times. As a reminder, Range has no debt-to-EBITDAX covenant, no bond maturities till 2021, $1.3 billion in freshly committed liquidity, low maintenance capital requirements, complete control over our capital spending level and timing, and a robust recycle ratio well over one time.","With prices improving, our recycle ratio will also continue to improve and the debt-to-EBITDAX ratio will eventually crest over or decline with no negative impact to our operations.","Turning to the income statement, comparing the first quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of last year, the impact of 45% lower realized prices could not be offset through production growth and cost reductions. First quarter net loss was $92 million, largely prompted by a $43 million pretax impairment of certain Oklahoma properties.","First quarter earnings based on analyst methodology, which eliminates non-cash and non-recurring entries, was a loss of $17 million or $0.10 per fully diluted share.","On the cost side of the ledger, cash unit cost were down $0.01 from last year and total unit costs, including DD&A, was down $0.29 from last year. All cost categories came in below guidance with direct cash operating costs at $0.19 per mcfe, breaking the $0.20 level for the first time. The main reason for the large operating cost beat was the absence of a severe winter and the avoided cost of tending to our wells with added shifts during periods of extreme cold.","Transportation, gathering and compression were also well below guidance at $1 per mcfe. This positive variance to guidance may be attributed to lower costs associated with our production mix and also lower transportation costs that were avoided due to the delayed full system startup of the Mariner East project.","Second quarter expense guidance may be found in the earnings release and other useful costs and hedging data, as Laith mentioned, may be found in the supplemental tables posted to the Range Web site.","Cash flow for the first quarter was $99 million and cash flow per fully diluted share was $0.59. First quarter EBITDAX was $135 million.","Range remains well hedged in 2016, with more than 80% of our 2016 gas production carrying a floor of 3.22\/MMBtu. As 2017 and 2018 NYMEX gas prices have improved and because our full cycle cost structure is so low, we have commenced limited natural gas hedging in these years to reduce downside price risk and ensure cash flows available for growth.","We\u2019ve also added to our NGL hedge position during the quarter, the details of which can be found in the 10-Q, earnings release and on the Web site.","To summarize the first quarter, we\u2019ve continued to successfully shed non-core assets, decrease debt, reduce our cost structure and improve our capital efficiency, while delivering consistent growth. Looking ahead, we see continued disciplined growth with even better capital efficiency, plus improved pricing from our new ethane, propane and condensate marketing arrangements. As Ray described in his remarks, this really sets us up well for 2017 and beyond.","Jeff, I\u2019ll turn it back to you.","Jeff Ventura","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Ventura. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Ventura","Good morning. ","Doug Leggate","Jeff, first of all, congratulations on another very strong operating quarter given the circumstances. But, I guess, the question that seems to be getting asked to a lot of your oily peers is, is there a level when you would consider putting rigs back to work? Now, I realize $2 gas price may be a little premature or certainly irrelevant in this market. But just conceptually, given the efficiencies that you have baked into the system, given the continued improvement you delivered for the last several years, what is your philosophy in terms of how you see Range\u2019s longer-term targets evolving, assuming that gas prices do improve? And I\u2019m thinking back to when you used to talk about 20-plus growth as an annual run rate in the longer-term.","Jeff Ventura","That\u2019s great question. Let me talk about it in a very conceptual way. Again, I think we\u2019re in a great position. We\u2019re in the highest quality gas play that\u2019s there with economics, I think, that really rival any play. It\u2019s a stack pay area. By the end of this year, it\u2019s predominantly HBP, so we\u2019ve got a lot of optionality not only in drilling Marcellus, Utica, or Upper Devonian, but drilling wet or dry.","We\u2019ve got really low maintenance CapEx, which I think is important. And I think is \u2013 if it isn\u2019t best-in-class, it\u2019s clearly right up there. Coupled with really good marketing agreements. Now, there are a lot \u2013 our newest piece that\u2019s in place, Mariner East. So the ability to move ethane, propane or natural gas really to multiple markets around the US or even internationally, the ability to go back on existing pads, those are all key things.","So I think what you\u2019ll see is too is we\u2019re in great shape in a low-price environment. We believe that a lot of good fundamentals are setting up for natural gas to improve. We think this will be the first year natural gas supply rolls since 2005 or something back like that, coupled with a time where demand is coming up.","So in a lower \u2013 for a longer scenario, we are well-positioned. In a higher price scenario, we have a lot of optionality. Ray has talked about it and can continue to talk about. I think when you look at our fracking efficiency, it\u2019s probably best-in-class or right up there, our drilling efficiency and wells. So we have the ability to ramp when need be. But we\u2019re going to be very returns-focused. We\u2019ll be sensitive to balance sheet and those types of things. So we have \u2013 we have a lot of optionality to push the throttle forward or to pull it back, which is, I think, the position that we want to be in.","So that\u2019s kind of a long-winded answer, but I think philosophically we\u2019ll think about the returns we\u2019re getting. We\u2019ll think about the balance sheet and all those types of things. But we have a lot of optionality with what we have. The team continues to get better, better and better as evidenced by the capital efficiency and we have tried to slice and dice that in multiple ways, everything from a high-level graph that shows our capital efficiency to some of the specifics. And, again, feel free to ask Ray about some of those. I think when you look at them versus peers, they are impressive numbers.","So that\u2019s kind of philosophically how we look at it.","Doug Leggate","I guess what I\u2019m kind of struggling with this if you assume any kind of modest recovery in gas prices, you could pretty much make your growth rate whatever you wanted it to be. So I\u2019m just trying to think how you would trend limits around that, whether it would be balance sheet or some kind of EBITDA coverage ratio or\u2026?","Jeff Ventura","Yeah, yeah. Clearly, balance sheet is important. Spending typically is going to be \u2013 I think, philosophically, is going to be at or near cash flow \u2013 or at on your cash flow. But I\u2019ll basically leave it at that. Roger, do you want to add on to that a little bit or\u2026?","Roger Manny","I think, Doug, it\u2019s going to be game time decision when we move forward and we\u2019re just going to read the market and we\u2019re going to look at all the dials and adjust the throttle accordingly. I just don\u2019t think it makes any sense to try to lock into a number right now. It\u2019s too dynamic.","Doug Leggate","Absolutely, I understand. My other question is really just a little bit more \u2013 it\u2019s less about the operations and more about the disposal program. You held on to the stack, Jeff. I\u2019m just wondering what we should read into that. Are you looking for a better market? Or are you thinking \u2013 if that\u2019s something you might want to put your own capital to work in at some point?","Jeff Ventura","Let me clarify that one. We marketed that in two pieces. The southern package was actually in the stack play. It was about roughly 9,000 acres of \u2013 scattered across three counties, kind of small broken up pieces, but in the play, collectively producing about 5 million per day equivalent net from 200 wells \u2013 200 all legacy, vertical wells. You can do the math there. So the price that we got for that, we thought, was a very strong price for that kind of position, particularly in today\u2019s market.","When you looked at the northern piece, which is bigger, and about 19,000 net acres, it\u2019s mainly in Major County \u2013 predominantly in Major County, which is north of the stack play. But the play is clearly moving in that direction and there\u2019s rigs coming right up to us. And it\u2019s also in the emerging Osage plays and there is other plays. So we actually have eight rigs drilling in and around us. It\u2019s all HBP. So our thoughts are to just wait, watch some of the drilling results that we expect will be good and just sell into a better price. So we have \u2013 because it\u2019s HBP, we have the optionality of time. So I think you\u2019ll see us sell that and market it in due time.","There\u2019s a lot of drilling activity. You can take a map of our acreage. It was up on our Web site at one time or the IR team will give it you. You can look at the active rigs, I\u2019m sure, if you subscribe to those services. There\u2019s a lot of activity around us.","The remaining stuff we have in the Panhandle and up in the northern Oklahoma, I think you\u2019ll just see us sell us with time, but we\u2019ll do it at an opportune time. It\u2019s similar to the Nora sale. We didn\u2019t just \u2013 Nora, we had to find the right buyer at the right time. We were very pleased with the sale. Hopefully, it\u2019s a win-win for both sides. But it\u2019s finding that buyer that really likes the asset. Bradford County was the same thing. I know people that follow us, we had that for sale for a long time. We\u2019re very disciplined and we finally found the buyer that paid us what we thought was a price.","I think if you look at both of those cases, the price we got was about double what most of the people thought Nora or Bradford County was worth. So I think the remaining stuff in Oklahoma, particularly that northern part of the acreage in Major County, it\u2019s just picking the right time and the right buyer. But you\u2019ll see us sell that with time.","Doug Leggate","Great stuff, Jeff. Yeah, we\u2019re watching you very closely, as you say. I\u2019ll let someone else jump on. Thanks a lot.","Jeff Ventura","Thank you, Doug.","Ray Walker","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Neal Dingmann","Morning, guys. I certainly would echo Doug\u2019s comments. You were great operationally. Jeff, one question for you, and then more to Ray on the efficiencies. Just on that last question, Jeff, additional non-core sales, just kind of wondering what else you\u2019re seeing out there besides, obviously, you had two strong sales here recently. Are there other things you could tee up here shortly?","Jeff Ventura","Clearly, I think the Major County package, it\u2019s probably marketable. I hate to always put time frames on them. But I think, later this year, or at the optimum time, we would definitely consider that stuff. In the Texas Panhandle, we have a nice position that. It\u2019s non-core to us. There\u2019s other people that really like that area. Mississippi, and again, and you can even \u2013 we carved off Bradford County, so it was a little slice of the Marcellus that wasn\u2019t key to us that was important for somebody else. You can envision things like that with time.","Neal Dingmann","Okay. And then, maybe for Ray, I was definitely intrigued by our comment that 50% plus of you wells, as you mentioned, next year could be on older pads. And so, I\u2019m looking at that, plus, obviously, just doing the bigger pads, the six to nine-well pads. Ray, based on that and those type of efficiencies, what type of cost savings are potential? It looks to me like it could be quite large.","Ray Walker","It\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s more of a continual process. If you look at page eight in our presentation, we show what we\u2019ve been able to do literally and what I think that matters at the bottom line is the total cost per lateral foot. And you look at that over the years and you\u2019ve seen really good improvement. And even the cross years where service costs were actually going up, we were making significant improvements. A lot of that\u2019s driven by drilling longer laterals. It\u2019s just the fact that our teams and our service crews are getting more and more experienced, all of those things factoring in, are allowing us to keep doing what we\u2019re doing. And I think that we\u2019re going to see probably half of our wells \u2013 could be less, could be more \u2013 we\u2019re really, really early in the planning cycle at this point. But some of the things I talked about in my prepared remarks \u2013 and when you couple the savings or the fact that you don\u2019t have to build pads and roads and production facilities, other things that we don\u2019t talk a lot about, or things like survey, land, title curative, we\u2019ve got water infrastructure and depending on where that pad is in relation to the current water infrastructure we have in place, all of those things you could save couple of hundred thousand dollars a well or you could save up to $850,000 a well depending on the particular situation.","And I think those kind of savings are real. I think it\u2019s taken us lots of years to develop a very large core asset area. We\u2019ve got a great low base decline rate which allows us to build very efficiently with the capital that we allocate. We\u2019ve got some \u2013 clearly some really high prolific performing areas, like I went through them in my remarks. Couple of examples there that we can focus on. We\u2019ve got new infrastructure that\u2019s always continually still being built, like some of the new dry gas stuff I talked about in my remarks.","So I think it\u2019s just all \u2013 and you roll all that together, the fact that we\u2019ve got a great transportation portfolio, we\u2019ve got diverse outlets for operational aspects and as far as pricing aspects, a lot of these things have taken years to develop. All of our HBP concerns are covered this year. And so, we\u2019ve got a great future going forward. And I think we can just continue that capital efficiency. The service contractors can continue to give us great pricing because of the high utilization rates. We don\u2019t think anyone else in the Basin is operating at the number of fracks per day that we are or anywhere close. So I think there is a lot of things out there like that that just give us a pretty unique advantage when you compare us to all of peers.","Neal Dingmann","Great, great. And then one last one, if I could. I love that slide 15, your gas and plays. I know you and Bill were probably the first ever to put that out there. And I\u2019m just wondering, number one, is that continuing to grow? Obviously, you look where that red area was and, to me, you guys have been dead right here now for the last couple of years on that. Two questions, I guess, around that. One, do you see that expanding at all or are you pretty content there? And then secondly, when you do some of these dry Utica gas wells there, in order to keep the cost down, what things can you do? I guess because of the pressure, do you still have to use the ceramic versus the sand? I\u2019m just wondering what things you can do in that area to keep the cost down on those dry Utica wells?","Jeff Ventura","All right. Two great questions. I think the gas and plays math, we\u2019ve had for a long time internally. And then, of course, we made them public, I guess, two or three years back. And they\u2019re actually holding very true. I think, as we\u2019ve seen, more and more development occur in the Utica and in Upper Devonian and, of course, in the Marcellus. I think they\u2019ve held really true. I think it\u2019s going to be like \u2013 most plays, historically, have been where the true core sweet spots tend to shrink and so forth. I think that\u2019s a big reason behind our low base decline rate, is I think we have better hydrocarbons \u2013 better hydrocarbon content, I should say, better perm, better porosity, better pressures. So we get better desorption of gas in the long run, a lot of those things help us. But I think they\u2019re going to hold pretty true. Clearly, the Utica is really early, especially on the Pennsylvania side. But we\u2019re pretty pleased about that.","Going forward on the Utica, we think when we get ready to do the next well and we\u2019re not sure when exactly that\u2019s going to be yet, but we can do, based on what we know today, a 6,500 foot lateral for around $12 million \u2013 probably less now. An 8,000 foot lateral or so, we can probably do for about $14 million or less. We think that\u2019s probably an industry-leading cost already. We\u2019re a little bit shallower than some of the other wells. So there\u2019s a little bit less cost there.","We, in our last well, completed it with \u2013 I think it was 5,800 feet with 38 stages and we were 500,000 pounds per stage and it was 50\/50 100 mesh and 40\/70 premium white sand. So we don\u2019t think ceramics is going to be necessary, at least in our acreage. That\u2019s going to keep cost way down.","Of course, every well that you get under your belt, you learn a lot more, so a little bit less science is required. We will continue to drill these wells on existing Marcellus pads. So you\u2019ve got a lot of savings there, like we\u2019ve talked about previously. And I think all of those things set us up well. We\u2019re pretty convinced, the 400,000 acres is going to be really high-quality stuff. But at this point in time, as good as we can do, it\u2019s still 2.5 times more expensive than a dry gas Marcellus well in the eastern part of Washington County. And when you look at that, some of these Marcellus wells that I talked about in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re making about the same volume, if not more, in a year\u2019s time. And we can get it for 2.5 times less dollars. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to focus our capital, especially in this market.","But do we believe the Utica can be a big deal going forward? Yes. Do we believe it can be influential? Yes. Do we believe it\u2019s going to be competitive? No. We think it\u2019s going to be complementary because it\u2019s something that\u2019s stacked with our Marcellus stuff. So I think that\u2019s where we see that going forward. But we\u2019re very encouraged. And again, I\u2019ll refer you to page 35, I think it is, in our presentation and look at how it performs versus some of our offset peers\u2019 wells that have been real noteworthy and they\u2019re all great wells. No doubt about it. But I think what we\u2019re seeing is our acreage can be right up there among the best acreage that there is in the play.","Neal Dingmann","Very helpful, guys. Thanks so much.","Ray Walker","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Kistler of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","David Kistler","Good morning, guys. And great work. This goes back to kind of the existing pads and the cost savings that you talked about there. Obviously, the low-hanging fruit is the fixed cost component, the pads that are there, the tanks, the roads, et cetera. But can you give us a little bit more breakdown in terms of how you guys think about it in terms of what it does to the actual operating cost metrics and the gathering side of the component and how that will flow through and whether that's truly captured in this $250,000 to $850,000 well savings you talk about?","Ray Walker","Yeah. Dave, this is Ray. It\u2019s a great question. Again, the savings \u2013 the $200,000 to $500,000, let\u2019s say, or $600,000, whatever it might be in a particular case, that\u2019s going to be the dirt work, things like building the pad and the road, then you\u2019ve got the actual production facilities which, as you know, the separators, the production tanks, the heater treaters, all those different things. They\u2019re going to be different in the super rich versus the wet versus the dry area. They\u2019re all different. I think people tend to group this together and say, it\u2019s going to be the same all the way across and they forget that, number one, we have a really large position and, number two, it\u2019s really diverse. So we\u2019ve got lots of different designs of facilities that we deal with. But it\u2019s going to be all of the meter taps, things like that. Then you\u2019ve got things like damages that you pay the landowners, survey cost, title curative, you\u2019ve got a lot of different things like that that we don\u2019t talk a whole lot about, which are really significant.","You\u2019ve got water infrastructure. If it\u2019s a pad that\u2019s right near an impoundment or right on a pipeline network, of course, the water cost could vary by several hundred thousand dollars on a pad. And some of the new things that we\u2019re doing lately, today, we\u2019re saving, on average, probably $300,000, maybe $350,000 per pad on water cost. It\u2019s that significant when you\u2019re drilling a new four-well pad. It\u2019s really significant if we just go back and add one or two wells on a pad. So I think those things are \u2013 all the capital costs that roll in there.","If you think about going back on to an existing pad and there is room in the gathering system, which is why we would go back on to an existing pad, you don\u2019t have to add any more compression or low pressure pipe. And when you do that, that\u2019s a significant part of the cost in our gathering, compression and transportation line, which is \u2013 I think it was $0.99 or whatever it was for the first quarter. Significant piece of that is that low-pressure gathering and compression charge.","When you go back with an existing well, you could see those numbers be a lot less. I\u2019m not going to quote a number because they\u2019re all different. But it could be \u2013 most of that cost goes away essentially. You\u2019re really only looking at the variable cost of fuel and a few little things like that, of putting that new production online into that existing system. So there are a lot of things like that that help us.","And as far as LOEs and things, the way it helps you there is, basically, you\u2019re not adding new equipment and new infrastructure that you have to add new lease operators for to cover. In other words, going back on to an existing pad doesn\u2019t cause us to add more personnel, it doesn\u2019t cause us to really add a lot more chemicals or maintenance or anything else like that. It\u2019s the kind of stuff that\u2019s already there and being operated.","So I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a long-winded, roundabout way to talk about some of those things. But all of that helps us reach the capital efficiencies that we are with. And again, this has been a process that we actually talked about in the very early days, way back in 2007 and 2008 when we started drilling and building some of these pads. And it\u2019s been a goal all along to build these pads where we can go back and drill as many as 10, 15, 18 wells in some cases. We were always really focused on the fact of having diverse outlooks, diverse pricing scenarios for our products, and not being dependent upon any one situation or project. All of those things have really helped us. And this year\u2019s really a turning point here for us because of some of the big projects like Mariner East coming online. Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City was a pipeline project that we worked on for years. Later this year, we\u2019ve got the Gulf Coast project coming online. All of those things have taken years to put in place. And I think that\u2019s a very unique part of our story going forward.","David Kistler","I appreciate that color. That\u2019s fantastic. Maybe kind of building off on the last point there, when you guys start selecting which pads to go back to, can you talk a little bit about how much maybe closest proximity to highest price markets factors in? You already indicated a little bit in terms of how important it is to be closer to various infrastructure just in terms of being able to get that gas or NGLs to market. But how much of that factors in also to the decision of how you select the pads and the timing of when you\u2019ll be going back to various areas, whether it be super rich, wet, dry, et cetera.","Ray Walker","That\u2019s a great question, Dave. And it\u2019s really all of that. Plus, I would add in there, it\u2019s not always going to be going back on existing pads because we have some \u2013 in some of the stuff I talked about in my prepared remarks, some of these wells that \u2013 I talked about the recent performance and then some of the existing wells that we\u2019ve done and following up, like that example of the ten different wells from several different pads. When you look at that, the economics on that stuff \u2013 even if you build a new pad is probably better than going back on the existing pads in today\u2019s world in the wet and super rich area. So we\u2019ve got that flexibility to go both ways. And it really comes down to what gives us the best overall project return for our capital in a year\u2019s time. Where are we going to be able to \u2013 if you put a dollar in, where are we going to get the most dollars out? And it\u2019s really that simple. But we have to factor in all those things you talked about, whether it\u2019s markets, proximity to infrastructure, timing of sales that we\u2019ve done with customers, all of those different things factor into that.","David Kistler","I appreciate the added color and great to see the scale and scope is now really starting to kick in on the asset base.","Ray Walker","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Dan McSpirit","Thank you. And good morning, folks.","Jeff Ventura","Good morning.","Ray Walker","Good morning. ","Dan McSpirit","Couple of questions quickly, if I may, on cash margins. Regarding your guidance on differentials in NGL pricing, what potential do you see for that to change either the back part of this year or periods beyond that? Can we see narrower differentials on more gas leaving the basin and better NGL pricing on barrels being shipped than what\u2019s guided?","Jeff Ventura","I will maybe tag-team that. But I think if you look on slide 14, it shows projected average differentials in 2016 versus 2017. So we were expecting those differentials for the year to average $0.40 to $.45 less from NYMEX. Into 2017, the expectation is that could improve to $0.25 to $0.35. We expect significantly better NGL pricing this year as a result of new contracts and movement \u2013 Mariner East starting up, plus some of the early things where we have kind of that optionality to either export or move in the US markets. Again, being a competitive advantage being the only producer who has capacity on Mariner East. But when you look at slide 14, coupled with some of the slides in there about the NGLs, we think that we\u2019ll see significant improvement.","Dan McSpirit","Okay. And then a follow-up to that, just confirming that your guidance on transportation costs capture the increase in production being priced outside of the Appalachian Basin, just inquiring, again, just to assess the risk to cash margins here going forward.","Ray Walker","This is Ray. I\u2019ll answer that. All of those projections that we put in there going forward are based on the current deals and transportation deals like Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City, cost some money to send the gas over there. But we, net-net, end up with a much better revenue because we got a much better realized price for our gas.","Same thing on the NGLs. We\u2019re now transporting 75% of our barrel, ethane and propane, out of Appalachia. The VLGCs on the propane is saving us a nickel a gallon. On a $0.50 a gallon product, that\u2019s a big deal. We\u2019re hedging international spreads on probably a third of our second half of 2016 production and that\u2019s looking really good. Shipping rates have come down to $0.04. They could go lower. We\u2019re hearing lots of good things about the propane market and we\u2019re hearing lots of good buzz about the ethane market. So we\u2019re pretty encouraged going forward. Can\u2019t peg down exactly when it happens, but I think, again, with us focusing on our low-cost structure, multiple outlets not being dependent upon any one particular project, we\u2019re set up really well going forward.","Dan McSpirit","Got it, thank you. And many thanks for taking my questions. Have a great day.","Jeff Ventura","Thank you.","Ray Walker","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached the end of the time limit for our Q&A session. And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.","Jeff Ventura","Thank you very much for participating on our call.

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Rodney L. Waller","Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome.","Range reported results for the first quarter 2015 with record production, a continuing decrease in unit cost and some outstanding well results. The order of our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, Chairman, President and CEO; Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ray Walker, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Range did file our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of reported earnings to our adjusted non-GAAP earnings that are discussed on the call.","Now let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thank you, Rodney. I'm going to begin my remarks with some macro comments about our industry and then focus specifically on Range.","Starting with the macro, as you all know, U.S. gas supply has increased ahead of demand causing low gas prices in most of the U.S. and negative basis differentials in the Appalachian basin. We believe that over the last year, the U.S. gas market typically has been oversupplied by about 2 Bcf to 4 Bcf per day. However, we see positive things that are happening on both the demand and supply sides of the equation. On the demand side, I believe that most people would agree that additional natural gas demand is coming and coming in a very meaningful way.","In our presentation on our website on Page 19, we have a projection on natural gas demand with time. The good news is that gas demand is expected to increase about 2 Bcf per day this year. This projected 2015 increase in gas demand as driven by the conversion of coal-fired power generation to gas, increased industrial demand, plant exports of gas to Mexico and LNG exports from the Gulf Coast coming online.","For 2016 through '20, natural gas demand is projected to increase by about 3 Bcf to 4 Bcf per day each and every year. It shows about 20 Bcf per day of incremental natural gas demand by 2020. There are multiple other reports that project natural gas demand with time in the report we reference as consistent with our internal work and within the range of other reports that I've seen.","The other side of the equation is the supply side. The supply side can be broken into 2 pieces: natural gas associated with oil wells and natural gas from gas wells. We believe that prior to the recent oil rig count reduction, there was approximately 16 Bcf per day of natural gas being produced associated with oil production. That's almost the equivalent of the Marcellus and Utica combined. Of the 16 Bcf per day of natural gas production associated with oil, about 8 Bcf per day is estimated to be associated with shale oil or unconventional oil plays.","For the first time in a long while, oil isn't $90 to $100 per barrel, it's roughly half that. The industry's response has been to cut their 2015 capital programs to about 40% to 50% of their 2014 budgets. Given these reductions so far, the oil rig count is down about 56% and appears to be going further. Given that moving oil through low permeability rock is harder than moving gas through low permeability rock, the first year declines of unconventional resource oil wells are much steeper than gas wells and typically are in the 70% to 90% range. Given the continuing steep drop in the rig count and typically steep first year declines of those oil wells, I believe that we'll see a production response in the second half of this year. Some are predicting that we'll see it before then and they may be correct. Not only will this help on the gas supply side, but since about 40% of all NGLs are derived from natural gas associated with oil production, it will help with the NGL supply as well.","The other big piece of the supply equation is in Marcellus and Utica. Even in these plays, operators have typically cut their 2015 capital spending plans by about 40% to 50% versus 2014. The rig counts for both of these plays are down by about 42% and 44%, respectively. By late summer, some are forecasting that the rig count in the Marcellus and Utica may be down to about half of what it was last year. Cutting capital spending and cutting the rig count will affect production. In addition, the infrastructure is significantly constrained in the far Northeast portion of Pennsylvania. One pushback I get from this argument is that when the gas rig count plummeted in the second half of 2008 and beyond, the production response was unaffected and it kept going up into the right. I believe that it's different this time for multiple reasons. Back in 2008 timeframe, there were still vertical rigs drilling for gas. The operators dropped their vertical rigs first, and those rigs were not driving production. It was the horizontal rigs that were doing so. Today, there are no vertical rigs drilling the Marcellus or Utica, so decreasing the rig count should have an impact.","The second thing that happened is the lateral lengths back in 2008 and early on were short, maybe 3,000 feet or less. As operators dropped horizontal rigs, they drilled longer and longer laterals with some operators now consistently drilling 8,000 to 10,000-foot laterals. In addition, the number of frac stages increased and the spacing between stages decreased and same concentrations went up. All of this led to higher production. I believe that today, operators who have consistently been drilling 8,000 to 10,000-foot laterals with reduced cluster spacing and high sand concentrations are in the later innings of the game.","Combining the coming growing natural gas demand with the probable response on the supply side, the outlook for supply and demand coming in to balance and improving natural gas prices are on the horizon. In addition, given the significant infrastructure build-out underway in Appalachia, coupled with multiple companies moving their gas out of the basin and improved demand outlook, we believe the basis differentials in Appalachia should narrow and improve. Therefore, I believe pricing should get better later this year and on into 2016. Range is well-positioned for this upcoming event. We have the largest position in the core portion of the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian. This is the area where all 3 horizons are stacked on top of each other. It's also the area where there's an option to drill either wet or dry acreage. In total, we have about 1.6 million net acres of stacked pay potential. About 900,000 acres are dry and about 700,000 net acres are wet. We have some ability to move our drilling between these areas and horizons.","Looking at the economics with strip pricing on Page 17, although the economics for the wet wells are good, currently the dry well economics are better. For 2015, we've moved more of our planned drilling into the dry area.","The other key on the same page is the date in the second row, which speaks to the quality of the acreage. Range's EURs per thousand foot of lateral are best in the southwest portion of the play. And when considering the total Marcellus play, they're second only to Cabot. It's interesting to note that Range's and Cabot's lateral lengths are both about 6,000 feet, which is less than most everyone else in the play. Both companies EURs are tops in the play, which speaks to the quality of the rock. One upside for Range is that we only drilled a small number of our potential locations. And as we continue to drill longer laterals with time, our capital and operating efficiencies should continue to improve given that we are in the earlier innings of the game.","Utica could be another enhancement to our capital efficiencies and returns. On Slide 14 of our presentation, there are 2 new bullets that we added to this slide. We, along with multiple other Utica operators, are members of the consortium for the Utica. We record our well and contributed the data to the consortium. The Utica well we drilled in Washington County, Pennsylvania, was calculated to have the highest gas in place of any of the analyzed consortium wells in Ohio, West Virginia or Pennsylvania. It also has the highest reservoir pressure of any horizontal Utica well drilled and some of the best permeability in the play. This combination of high gas in place, high pressure and high permeability for the Utica led the Range testing to Claysville Sportsmen's Club well at 59 million cubic feet per day, which is a record 24-hour rate for any well in the Utica or in the Marcellus. About 2 weeks prior to Range announcing this test rate, Hart published a summary of the top 10 shale wells in any play at any time. If our well had been included in the study, it would have been the #1 well. More importantly, this was -- been online at 20 million cubic feet per day on an interruptible basis for about 12 weeks and has produced about 1.2 Bcf so far. It's extremely early in its life but the performance so far is encouraging.","As I mentioned previously, on a stack-pay basis, we have about 900,000 net acres of dry gas potential to drill and about 700,000 net acres of wet gas potential. I've seen some analysts paint all Appalachian NGLs with the same brush and value them all the same. Fortunately for Range, that's not true. There are 2 key items to consider: The first is a richness of the gas and the second is the sales contracts, the NGL they're sold under. Because we have the richest gas in the basin and what appear to be more favorable contracts than others, we receive a significant revenue uplift from our NGLs as shown on Page 18 of our presentation. Our peers might say their ethane should stay in the gas stream. And if their gas is leaner and if their contracts are not as favorable, maybe they should.","For Range, we continue to build on our portfolio of agreements for all products, which spreads the market risk of our products across multiple pricing structures, multiple outlets and with multiple counter-parties. For 2015, the strategy is serving us well as more than 80% of our Range's ethane is tied to gas or oil-linked indices rather than Mont Belvieu. When Mariner East comes online in the third quarter, Range will be further advantaged as a producer exporting NGL products outside North America. In addition, our propane will be transported more efficiently on pipe rather than trucks and rail adding approximately $50 million to cash flow annually just on propane transport savings.","Going forward, as we continue to grow in size and scale, we'll have the opportunity to find new markets, and I expect our teams will continue to find innovative ways to maximize cash flow. I'll now turn the call over to Roger.","Roger S. Manny","Thank you, Jeff. Winter weather usually brings higher oil, natural gas and NGL prices paired with higher operating costs. Despite a colder than average winter, the first quarter of 2015 did not follow this pattern.","Realized price for mcfe is 28% lower than last year's first quarter. However, 26% higher production and 15% lower unit cost combined to generate $423 million in first quarter revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales including cash-settled derivatives. This top line figure was only 10% below last year's first quarter, despite the headwind from 28% lower prices. The operating and administrative expense story for the first quarter is an exceptionally good one effectively bearing the brunt of much of the decline in prices.","As I mentioned earlier, the winter weather of each year usually brings higher expenses as our field professionals cope with the challenges of an often brutally cold operating environment in Appalachia. This year was even colder than normal, but our operating teams really delivered. Not only did we beat all of our unit cost guidance figures, direct operating expense was lower than last year on an absolute basis as well.","The same applies to G&A expense and interest expense during the first quarter, all below unit cost guidance and all below last year on an absolute dollar basis. Cash flow for the first quarter was $207 million and EBITDAX for the quarter came in at $244 million. Cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.24. These figures were 21%, 20% and 23%, respectively, lower than last year due to realized prices. First quarter book net income was $28 million, and earnings calculated using analyst methodology was $31 million, generating earnings of $0.19 per fully diluted share.","The non-GAAP measures that I just mentioned, including EBITDAX and analyst earnings, are fully reconciled to the GAAP numbers in various supplemental tables, which may be found on the Range website under the Investors tab.","Looking forward to the second quarter, please reference our first quarter 2015 earnings press release for detailed expense item guidance.","Now turning to the balance sheet, our first quarter trailing 12-month debt-to-EBITDAX ratio was 2.9x, roughly equal to last year's figure of 2.8x and below the 3x figure from the year before. Despite lower realized prices, our first quarter leverage is essentially the same as prior years. Range added additional natural gas, oil and NGL hedges during the first quarter for the remainder of 2015 as well as additional hedge volumes for 2016 and 2017. Details of these additional hedges may be found in the earnings release, the 10-Q and the Investors tab on our website.","The first quarter of 2015 reflects the impact of lower year-over-year prices for all of our products. However, the quarter also reflects an appropriate response to this environment by the company: strong production growth, significant reductions in cost on both the unit and absolute basis, additional hedges and continually improving capital efficiency regarding some of the best well results in our history.","Ray, over to you.","Ray N. Walker","Thanks, Roger. At Range, we believe there are 3 key facts that differentiate us from our peers: Number one, we have a large and high-quality position that is low risk and repeatable. Having stack-pay potential of 1.6 million acres in the core of the highest hydrocarbon in place in the Appalachian basin opens many doors for us in the market. And historically, throughout this business, the rock rules. And our results indicate we've captured some of the best rock in North America.","Number two, our team continues to lead the way in innovation while delivering great well performance and capital efficiency. And we believe our track record over the past several years supports that. And number three, we have product diversity with large positions in both liquids rich and dry gas. Coupled with our first mover advantage, low-cost transportation and favorable sales contract, this gives Range a unique and significant competitive advantage. Execution is the key in 2015, and we're on track with our planned $870 million CapEx budget and to achieve our targeted annual growth of 20%. Maintaining our low-cost structure and continuing to improve well performance is a core focus at Range. And even though Range is already one of the lowest cost operators, our cost metrics continue to improve. As Roger pointed out, our cost structure is improving on both an absolute and unit basis. Our operating teams are continuing to find ways of increasing efficiencies, enhancing our well designs and lowering cost, while achieving better and better well performance, all allowing us to get 20% growth from a bigger base with $700 million less capital than last year.","For the first quarter, our production averaged 1.328 Bcf equivalent per day with 33% liquids and represented 4% growth over the fourth quarter of '14 and 26% growth compared to the first quarter of '14. Our growth profile for the next 3 quarters shows production being more heavily weighted to the third and fourth quarters, just as it has been in the past. And it should set us up well with momentum going into 2016. Guidance for the second quarter is 1.345 Bcf equivalent per day with approximately 30% liquids.","In Southwest Pennsylvania on the drilling side, Range is in an excellent position regarding the terms on our drilling rigs. We're presently on well-to-well contracts on 6 of our 9 rigs. Of the 3 rigs that aren't well to well, all contract terms will expire within the next 4 months. This has allowed us to capture significant reductions in day rate and other services along with providing us flexibility in shifting rigs and capabilities around to optimize our fleet. We believe this gives our operating team a huge competitive advantage in driving down costs, introducing new technologies and improving the overall performance of the fleet.","On the completion side of our operations, the team pumped over a thousand stages in the first quarter averaging over 6.5 stages per day. That's 84% more stages in the quarter and 43% more stages per day than the same quarter last year with 2 crews versus 1.6 crews last year. In March, they set a new record of 424 stages for the month with a new one-day record of 23 stages. I want to offer my congratulations to the team for an outstanding job. These types of games promote high utilization rates for our service providers allowing us to work together with them to achieve some of the lowest cost and best value services in the industry. These operational gains also shorten the time between capital being spent and the realization of production revenues, translating to better use of our capital and quicker returns at the bottom line. It simply allows us to do more, do it quicker and do it for less cost and will allow us to grow more efficiently in 2016 as these improvements continue.","Late in the first quarter, we brought online a new Southwest Pennsylvania dry area pad with the first well going to sales at 31.3 million a day with a lateral length of 7,906 feet with 41 stages. We've been flowing this well now for 20 days at an average rate of 21.4 million a day. And there's still 2 more wells on the pad to be brought online in the second quarter.","And just last week, we brought online a new well in our wet area with an 8,668 foot lateral completed with 45 stages. And it produced the sales for 24 hours at 43.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day. That's 19 million gas, 520 barrels of condensate and over 3,500 barrels of NGL. We believe this well has now set the record for the highest 24-hour production rate through sales in the entire Marcellus play.","As a quick reminder, I want to make 3 important points. Number one, the production rates that we report, whether they're initial sales, 30-day averages or production reported over any length of time have been and will always be reported at actual conditions as constrained by the production facilities and the gathering system. Number two, the wells on the pad tend to come online at staggered times, very rarely are we able to bring more than 1 or 2 wells to sales off the same pad at the same time as we simply don't design a system to handle those high and short-term initial rates. What we've demonstrated over the years is this is the most cost-effective way to manage the compression and gathering system for the long term.","And number three, while these are outstanding and record-setting initial sales rates, they are not appreciably different from what our team forecasted that these wells would produce. In other words, wells like these were built into our model and production forecast, and I believe our team is one of the best out there in understanding the rock and getting the most out of it. The initial sales rates only tell part of the story. What's really important is how these wells perform over time.","Just about a year ago, we announced a record 5-well pad in our super-rich area that came online with a per well average of 28.6 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 4,773 Boe per day with 65% liquids. And they had an average lateral length of 6,635 feet and 34 stages. The record well in that pad that we announced a year ago and still the record liquids-rich well in the basin, meaning wells that have more than 60% liquids was $38.1 million a day from a 7,065 foot lateral with 36 stages.","As of the end of March this year, that pad has produced 10.6 Bcf equivalent, which is 5.7 Bcf of gas, 223,000 barrels of condensate and 831,400 barrels of NGL. I believe if you look at that pad on an absolute or normalized basis, it's among the top performers in the region. Also, about 6 months ago, in the Southwest Pennsylvania dry area, we announced a pad with 3 wells that had an average -- 30-day average rate of $17.4 million a day per well, averaging 5,364 foot laterals in 28 stages. As of the end of March, those 3 wells have produced over 6.1 Bcf with the largest well at 2.6 Bcf. Again, in the dry gas area, we believe these wells are clearly among the top performers in Southwest Pennsylvania.","In addition to the quality of the rock, we believe these examples of long-term performance also illustrate the diversity and highlight our ability to manage long-term sustainable growth at very attractive economics whether it's dry or liquids-rich gas.","As Jeff referred to in his remarks, our first Utica well in Washington County, Pennsylvania, has now been online since late January, constrained at a designed maximum rate of $20 million a day and has produced 1.2 Bcf of gas thus far. Albeit early, the well is meeting all our original expectations. It's producing on an interruptible basis, meaning it's up and down and not at a constant rate. And before anyone asks, it's still too early to make an EUR prediction.","The second well, which is an opposing lateral on the same pad, is being drilled and is still on target to be ready for sale this summer, which is about the same time that our permanent facilities will be ready. And the third well is still on schedule to be drilled later this year. Costs for the second well are still targeted to be approximately $13 million gross, which still includes some science [ph]. And as we get a few more wells under our belt, we believe those costs could come down another 15% to 25%. We expect that the Utica will be different from the early years of our Marcellus play and that it can be drilled on a true development mode right from the beginning. Most all our Utica wells are expected to be drilled on Marcellus pads making use of the existing infrastructure.","Step-out wells won't be necessary, since we have deeper penetrations, lots of offset wells and 3D seismic over most of the area. Essentially, we can drill the wells like a very efficient manufacturing process. The Utica infrastructure will be easy, as it's dry gas. And we have existing right-of-ways in which we can lay additional pipes. Considering that early results indicate we have 400,000 net acres of core dry gas Utica potential under our Marcellus position in Southwest Pennsylvania, we believe this play gives us another attractive option for significant growth in value creation going forward. Our team is working on options to begin a Utica drilling program as early as next year if the market conditions support.","Shifting to Northeast Pennsylvania, our team continues to lower cost and bring online really impressive wells. And we expect to continue the year with 1 to 2 drilling rigs. Of note, our most significant well in the quarter had an initial rate to sales of 26.1 million a day with a 30-day average rate of 21 million a day and a 60-day rate of 19 million a day. The well is completed with a 5,514 foot lateral and 28 stages for a total well cost of approximately $5 million. And we expect an EUR of over 3.3 Bcf per thousand foot of lateral. Following up on our top well in the same area that we announced about a year ago, the initial 30-day rate to sales on that well was 25.1 million a day, and it produced over 4 Bcf in 12 months. Again, in this area, we're also seeing significant operational gains, along with up to 25% lower cost. Like the super rich, wet, dry, Upper Devonian and Utica in Southwest Pennsylvania, this area offers yet another highly attractive area for long-term and sustainable growth.","Like Jeff said in his remarks, 2015 is a challenging year for commodity prices, but I'm happy to report that Range is continuing to work safely, improve our operational efficiency, lower our cost structure, and at the same time, continue to improve our well performance.","I also want to note that we have relayed to all of our employees that a tightened budget does not mean cutting corners. In fact, despite current market conditions, we've increased our focus on environmental compliance and safety. Safeguarding the environment and our employees, along with our contractors and the communities where we live and work, is a core philosophy at Range. When you think about the fact that we had our best operating efficiency gains today, combined with some of the best well results to date, this quarter again demonstrates our ability to grow value at the bottom line more and more efficiently. As I've often said, the rock rules. And we believe we've captured a large position with stack-pay potential and the best rock in the basin. Coupled with an experienced team, we've been able to achieve these results and have a consistent track record of growth with lower and lower cost. And we believe we're still in the early innings of the ballgame as we continue to drill longer laterals, implement improved completion designs and improve operational efficiencies. We still haven't drilled our best well yet. Now back to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jeff, clearly, I'm going to take Ray at his word. I'm not going to ask about the EUR and Utica. However, as clearly, the results are pretty stunning obviously. So I guess I'm trying to understand is, things are pretty well set up. It looks like they really move very quickly on this program. What gives that basically makes space for -- in other words, how would you prioritize what you're seeing in the Utica versus, for example, equivalent opportunities in the Marcellus? And I've got a couple of follow-ups, please.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Okay. Yes, what our plan is to -- we've got the first well online, 12 weeks, you're right. So far we're very encouraged. Permanent facilities for that first well will be there about middle of the summer. We've spud our second well. And our plans are to put both wells online in the permanent facilities at summer, and then we'll spud a third well after that. Obviously, we're doing a lot of preplanning for a success case. How would we move the gas and also -- the key then will be as we get to the end of the year, and we have 3 wells, and we have longer production history, what do the economics and returns look like versus the Marcellus? You're correct, it could be a change in capital efficiency or another way for us to grow with better returns or better capital efficiency. To the extent it looks like that in the end of the year and it could be, then you'll see us work the Utica into our 2016, '17 programs and beyond.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I appreciate that. I guess it's kind of a related question then. So you've obviously now got a very large opportunity literally under your feet. So lack of any mention in this quarter of the Mississippian, and I guess it really raises the question of what do you consider a core or rather what do you consider non-core now? And I would ask specifically about Nora and the Mississippian in terms of -- whether they're going to be able to compete for capital. And I've got one final one, if I may?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, I mean it's a good point. I'll answer it in this way. If you look at Range historically since 2004 when we sold roughly $3 billion worth of assets, that's done several things for us. It's allowed us to continue to focus our capital into our highest return, best projects that keeps us focused. It's driven down our cost structure. It's driven up our returns. It's been a source of funds. So clearly, when we see that other people value those assets higher than we value them, we'll do the right -- what we think is the right thing for the shareholders. In the Mid-Continent area, we have roughly -- I don't remember exactly. I'm going to say 75 million per day and about 360,000 net acres. So we have a big footprint, lot of production, and we'll do what we think is the right thing there ultimately for shareholders. And then we have $170 million per day and 460,000 net acres, basically in the Southern Appalachian Division, basically in Virginia. So yes, we always look at those things, and we look at how -- what competes for capital and what's the best way to manage those assets going forward.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Is it an active process underway at this point, Jeff?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","We're always active. I mean we're always looking at the opportunities and considering how to best to maximize the value of the assets for the company.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. My final one hopefully is quick, so OpEx and CapEx cuts, the prospect of our gas price recovery. If you're growing at 20%, having already cut your capital $700 million, what do you do with incremental cash flow, whether it comes from CapEx adoptions or better gas prices? And I'll leave it there.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, I think in the short term, if you're looking into 2015 to the extent we get service cost reductions or other things happen, I don't think -- we're not going to change our guidance for 2015. It's 20%, CapEx will be the same. To the extent we're more efficient, it might help us better set up 2016. Plus I think the other thing to remember that maybe helps to distinguish Range from its peers, we're one of, I think, several things, is our production profile is back-end loaded. And it's been that way every year for the last 5 years. So we see relatively little bit of growth in the second quarter, but the big growth in the third and fourth quarter. What that does and it's really helped set up 2016. And then with the portfolio we have, looking at 2016 and beyond, then it's a matter of -- we're in a fortunate position that we're in the core of the Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica. We have 900,000 acres of dry and 700,000 acres of wet. We can drill up and down that section and back and forth, so we'll be able -- we'll maximize returns as best we can going forward from there.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","You all replaced your debt-to-EBITDAX covenant with an EBITDAX to interest expense covenant. Can you talk about how easy or hard that discussion conversation was? And what the new covenant lets you do?","Roger S. Manny","Sure, Bob, it's Roger. It's a good question. It was actually a pretty easy conversation. As evident by the fact that all 29 banks unanimously approved the change. And on our part, a 51% vote, no bank chose to be carried. They all stepped up, doing the right thing. And we're very pleased and proud of them for doing that. So the reason is that the covenant really no longer fits. We redid our bank facility in the fourth quarter of last year. And in that process, we went to an annual Borrowing Base determination. A lot of folks really didn't pick up on that. But it was pretty big changes, saved us a lot of money. It helps us manage our affairs better over the long term. But when the banks do the Borrowing Base determination, they basically take all your cash flow until your next review date and toss it out. So in our case, when you went to a full 1 year redetermination, they took essentially over a year of our cash flow out through April of the next year, which encompasses a lot of our hedges and everything. So you can see, with the $3 billion-plus Borrowing Base that they approved, we're real pleased that, that ratified our liquidity and our position. The Borrowing Base is -- because that's their primary tool to manage leverage. And the reason is pretty simple, it's a forward-looking test. It's basically a PV-9 coverage test. So the best way to work your growth is to be looking out the windshield and working the brake and throttle accordingly. And that's why the banks rely on that test first and foremost. The debt-to-EBITDAX covenant, that's a rearview mirror test. So it's really not as applicable to managing leverage over time. So in our case, the covenant was kind of a no-harm-no-foul covenant. We're never anywhere close to that ratio, never intended to be anywhere close to that ratio. But looking at it after getting through the restructuring process, we just decided that an interest coverage test was more appropriate. We rely on the annual Borrowing Base determination to work with our banks to keep leverage where it needs to be. And that rearview mirror test just didn't make sense for us anymore. And the banks agreed with us, and we made the swap. And it just removes a source of potential concern from investors that may not have an in-depth knowledge of the process.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's great color. Quick follow-up, you talked about your rig contract roll-off in the strategy there. Can you talk about your completions contract and the strategy for keeping them busy? Do those contracts roll? Or are they longer term?","Ray N. Walker","Yes, Bob, this is Ray. We really don't have any long-term frac contracts. We have what we more commonly refer to inside the company as relationships. We've had, for instance, frac-ed the majority of our completion work in Southwest PA, really for almost -- since 2007. So that long-term relationship allows us to work with them on key performance indicators that help us work more efficiently, and then we're able to arrive at pricing, kind of based on the market and utilization that allows us to do things that a lot of our competitors can't do. And that consistent strategy over the years has allowed us to innovate with a lot of things like new manifolds that our teams designed and new liner systems to protect the pads. And all those sort of things that have allowed us to go forward. So we don't really technically have any long-term frac contracts. And that was one of the things that allowed us, like on the drilling rig side, to take advantage of what we were seeing happening back in December and January, work with our supply-side vendors and suppliers to create prices where they could still work and we could still continue on with some pretty significant savings. And I think that was way in advance of what a lot of our competitors were able to do.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Your lateral length in the 2 Southwest Pennsylvania, Marcellus that you highlighted today was in the 8,000 to 9,000-foot range, which is well above your average. Could you just update us on how significant your ability to drill wells of this lateral length in your southwest dry and wet gas acreage is from a contiguous perspective? Whether you see these type of results as repeatable? And maybe I'll ask an EUR question on this, what the impact on EUR and well cost per thousand feet of lateral is versus your base case Slide 17 assumptions?","Ray N. Walker","Yes, Brian, good questions. We have only -- like Jeff said in his opening remarks, we've only touched a small, small number of the total potential locations that we've got left to drill. We don't have -- while we do have a lot of units formed, we don't really have a lot of limits on the lateral length that we can do going forward. So we do expect to continue to significantly increase lateral lengths by year going forward. And I think eventually, you'll see our average up there in the 8,000 to 9,000-foot range. And of course, every area will have a different optimal at-lateral length depending on liquids and as [ph] well pressures and all the different things. Because remember, we have a huge position there in Southwest Pennsylvania. So the Marcellus is not the Marcellus -- it's not the same all across that property. We have super rich, wet, dry. We have thicker areas, higher-pressure areas, a little bit deeper areas. So all of those wells will be designed differently. But we do expect to get significantly longer each year. Those wells, longer wells that we talked about in the remarks today, they were in the plan. That's part of what makes our average go longer this year. And our team is continually able to push those wells out. We have, in fact, to drill the wells that are much longer than those. So technically, mechanically, from a land standpoint, there's really no limits to what we can do. What I would like to point out is, look at some of those wells, for instance, in that 8,000 to 9000-foot range and compare them to some of the offsets in the plank areas that aren't as good a rock. And I think you'll start to see what we get excited about talking about the longer laterals and how much more capital efficiency the well improvements we're going to see going forward. From your standpoint of...","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And totally to clarify that, I know what Ray means. When he's saying plank areas, he's saying our acreage is core. You can look at other operators who have drilled outside of what we feel are core areas who have already drilled longer laterals like that and then compare them on a rate basis or EUR per thousand foot or per stage. But sorry to interrupt, Ray. For listeners, I want to make sure that was crystal clear.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, good to point out. And then your point on cost -- well cost. I mean, again those were also forecasted into our model and our plan this year. But if you'll look on Page 8 in our presentation for 2015 in Southwest PA, we give you a cost per foot for those wells. That's for the average well that will turn to sales this year. And if you were to think about it from a standpoint, longer is certainly better because economies of scale kick in and so forth, so longer laterals do get cheaper on a per foot basis. And we have seen well performance hold rock steady. And in fact, I think these 2 wells will probably end up having some of the highest performance on a per thousand foot basis of any of the wells in the area. So we do see good improvements going forward. And the third point I want to make is we really did forecast -- our team is getting really good at understanding this rock. And I think our track record supports that. But they were forecasting rates pretty close to these in our model. So that's part of what was a significant point in allowing us to reach 20% growth this year to $700 million less capital. That's what we've been saying for many years is our capital efficiency is going to flow through as we drill longer laterals, and our team gets better at getting more out of the rock. And like I've said, you probably get sick of me saying it, but I'm going to keep saying it, the rock rules. And we think we've got a core position where all of this is possible. And we're in the very early innings of the ballgame, because we've got thousands and thousands of more of these wells that we can do as we get better and better.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And I'd just add again a little bit to what Ray said. I totally agree with what he's saying, the rock rules. But you want to have the high-quality rock in the core in an area of good infrastructure with favorable takeaway and contracts to external markets. And I'm sure Chad, at some point, will hit on some of those.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. My follow-up is that you highlighted in your opening comments the unique attractiveness of your NGL's contracts. Beyond the startup of ethane exports later this year, can you talk to what you see as differentiating your ethane and propane FX versus others? And whether you see a situation in the market whether to maintain pipeline stacked portions of your ethane, or propane production would at least temporarily be a drag to cash flow?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Let me -- I'd like Chad to answer that question. But, Chad, if you would, could you also talk about some of the gas contracts for second half of the year? Because it's all, really all 3 products, natural gas and NGLs and condensate.","Chad L. Stephens","Yes, this is Chad, Brian. As Jeff mentioned in his notes earlier in the call, 80% of our ethane is tied to either oil or gas index. So that's already reflected in the prices we show in our financials. Once Mariner East starts up, 20,000 additional barrels of ethane will be going to market, so it can go into international markets priced at a common Naphtha Brent crude sliding scale formula, which will again improve our cash flow. We focus more on improving our cash flow than we do our per unit metrics. So that's an important point we try to make in our slides on 37, 38 and 39 in our slide deck. Once Mariner East is in service and flowing in later this year, we, going forward, our LRP forecast, we don't need any more ethane projects to meet spec. We can grow our production under the LRP up to as much as 3 Bcf a day. So we don't need any more projects. Mariner East will also help in propane service because we can float 20,000 barrels a day and load ships at a very high rate once that's in service. Jeff referenced our gas contracts. As reflected in our slide deck, we show what our firm transport capacity projects are. And later this year, we have our specter Uniontown to Gas City project coming online, which takes 200,000 a day of firm capacity over to the Midwest, where we get much better pricing. It's -- the indexes over there are very stable. And then later in 2016 and 2017, we have other firm transport capacity projects coming online, which again will take our gas away from the Appalachian basin to more stable of indexes and help improve our cash flow.","Operator","The next question is from Dave Kistler of Simmons & Company.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, looking at the CapEx this quarter, it's down 45% quarter-over-quarter and keeping your full year CapEx guidance, which would imply that it continues to step down similar to kind of what you outlined with rigs falling off contract, et cetera. Can you break down for us how that CapEx declined both this quarter and going forward? It's split between lower activity, lower service cost and better efficiency gain.","Roger S. Manny","Dave, this is Roger. Let me answer the first half of your question. I'll switch it over to Ray to talk more about where the capital is going later in the year. Just one thing I wanted to highlight, there was a big working capital swing in the first quarter. So over $100 million of the incremental debt and spending was due to working capital. So there's a delta between the cost and current schedule and the cash flow. So please go through the queue or give our guys a call. They can walk you through that. So the CapEx increase, depending on how you measure it, is not as large as it first may appear, but I'll let Ray tell you where -- exactly where the money is going.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, we -- Dave, when we put together the CapEx plan for '15, we did plan in there some service cost reductions. And I talked a lot about that on the first call that if you looked at a well in Southwest Pennsylvania, the lion's share of our CapEx is gone. And if you looked at a well in February compared to December, on apples-to-apples basis, we're seeing 23% to 25% less total well cost as a result of service cost reductions. Those numbers were built into our plan this year, but it's also important to realize that all those savings didn't kick in on January 1. They really kick in towards the end of the first quarter, and then they start flowing through the rest of the year. So I think you'll see the CapEx will come down quarter-over-quarter because we tend to -- we have more rigs running at the first part of the year than we will at the last part of the year. And that's pretty, pretty much the same that it's been every year. So I don't see that as a whole lot different, but hopefully, that's a little more color on how that comes together.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And then to just reemphasize, we still feel comfortable and are confident with the 20% growth at $870 million.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great, I appreciate that clarification. And then maybe switching a little bit to some of your slides where I know you put some of this out last quarter as well, but you highlighted the benefit of the optimized completions and the down-spacing in the Marcellus and then in the optimized completions in the Nora area. And obviously, nice step uplift in production associated with those. Does that maybe argue for going back to existing wells and doing optimized completions or refrac on those existing wells, just given that they'd be even lower cost and probably generate with 50% uplift of production versus what you've done before, maybe even a better rate of return than drilling original wells?","Ray N. Walker","Yes, Dave, I mean we did talk about that example that we put in there last conference call on Page 36. And that was an exact case that you just described where we went into a well, a pad that had 5 wells on it that were 2 years old, had been online for 2 years and we put 2 new wells sort of in between the laterals. And there were really 3 things we wanted to test. We wanted to test how much less would the wells cost, drilling them on since all the existing infrastructure roads, pads, water, gathering system and all that sort of thing was already there. Number two, did the new wells interfere with the older wells? And then number three, how much better would the new wells be with the new completion -- newer completion technology. And number one, the wells were $850,000 a piece cheaper. And we think that number could even be higher as we begin to do more of this as we go forward. Number two, there was no impact to the older wells, which I think is very significant. And I think you've read a lot about our competitors that are in noncore areas. They have not been able to do that, where they've seen big hits on their offsetting wells. And then third thing, the wells produced 53% more production than the first year as compared to the older wells that had -- I think early on, the eyepiece were 4x higher. So clearly, we see that as unbelievable upside going forward, because we clearly have a lot of those pads already out there, some of them as much as 8 or 9, 10 years old on those. So I think that going forward, you're going to see us probably in about 2017, '18 as we get into our further plans down the road where a bigger and bigger percentage of our wells each year will be going back on to those existing pads. We see that as a huge step change in both well cost, efficiencies and well performance and then in -- also in gathering system cost. Because your gathering system's already there, already been mostly paid for. So essentially, those wells will produce at a much lower gathering fee. So we see that as big potential going forward. There's not really any of those wells planned at this year as we're still trying to really optimize our program to try to get the wells, the final HBP work done that we need to get done, the infrastructure buildouts that we're still doing over this year and next year. And I think that, that is big potential that we see going forward.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, appreciate that. But maybe one just clarification. Other than drilling in kind of a tighter spacing, would you look at going back to an existing well and refrac-ing it. We're hearing about recompletions from other folks that are seeing that as a positive, and obviously, from some of the service companies commenting on that. How do you guys think about that in your inventory? Or is it really, hey, we're going to finish HBP and then we'll consider those things?","Ray N. Walker","Well, our teams, I think it's probably technically one of the most gifted teams in the industry. And they are continually coming up with innovations and new ideas and concepts and sort of things. We have studied and talked about refracs for some time. I personally have a lot of experience with refracs, most of which was not that good. So we don't really see refracs as big potential going forward. It's certainly not anything we're counting on. But we will clearly study it as we go forward. And my overall statement for refracs, if you really mess something up the first time, then there's potential that you could do something if you went back in there. But we don't see that as big potential and it's not certainly -- not anything that we're counting on going forward.","Operator","The next question is from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a kind of follow-up on the Slide 36, that somebody was asking about the down-spacing, guys. Just a question now, is -- have you kind of looked at that as far as in the entire Southern Marcellus and the Northern Marcellus area? And are you confident now that, that's working -- going to work in most of the area? Or is that still isolated to kind of core areas of each of those respective regions?","Alan W. Farquharson","Neal, this is Alan Farquharson. I think that what we've seen so far is we've done a fair amount in -- we've done a fair amount of activity in the wet and super rich area. Our plans are to do some -- a little more testing in the dry. We're also looking at what some of our competitors have done as well. Obviously, we don't have to spend all the R&D work, but we believe fairly comfortable that you'll be seeing a significantly tighter spacing in the wet and super rich. We also believe, but we don't have yet the data to kind of really feel comfortable yet that we'll probably see some of that happen in the dry areas as well. And we think some of it has to do with just the quality of the rock that we have at the end of the day compared to what our other competitors have.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes, got it. And then obviously you've had 2 monster wells within the Southern Marcellus between this recent Washington County well, the 43.4 million a day test rate, and then obviously, on the heels of this one in December. I guess a couple of questions around that. First, on that, I noticed I think both -- or you mentioned I think in here that your Utica's flowing around 20 million a day. Could you just talk about how you see -- I mean given these monster test rates that you have, how you guys sort of think about the sales or the choke program that you have that once you see these huge test rates?","Ray N. Walker","Well, that's a good question Neal. And one thing I want to correct you on, those aren't just monster wells, they're monster pads. Because they both are multi-well pads, and we just simply hadn't been able to turn the other wells on yet. But we expect actually pretty similar results from other wells on the pad. Part of our long-term goal that the team works on, sometimes 3, 5 and 7 years in advance, is looking at the gathering system. And we have very intricate models of the gathering system. We're working with MarkWest on deliverability at any given point, compressor stations, upgrades, process and plant and so forth. So all of this has been built into that plan. And we don't have a choke management program as a gimmick or a fad or anything like that to manage the wells. We're simply trying to produce those wells of what we believe is the optimum performance that will generate the best economics for the project at the end of the day. It's a long-term look that we take at it. Initial production rates are great. They're fun to talk about. It's kind of a yardstick to compare wells. And these -- in a case like these 2 monster pads, you had a lot of facilities there for maybe 3 wells or 5 wells, depending on how many wells were on each pad. And what you end up doing is bring one well on and just let it produce through the facilities that all 5 wells might use to see what it's capable of. In actuality, we'll probably choke that well back and then start opening up the other wells and try to get them online. They'll all be produced or constrained conditions for quite a while in that case. But that's the way we designed it going forward. And we think that keeps our cost structure down. It's better planning with MarkWest, which allows them to keep their cost structure down, which in turn gets us lower gathering fees. And again, we're really focused on the years ahead and watching that gathering fee fall off as we go back in and fill in on these areas. We think that's the most efficient way to develop this project long term. Because again, we've only touched a very small portion of the total number of locations that we can drill going forward just in the Marcellus. On the Utica and places like that, the other stack-pay potential, we've got a long ways to go on that also. As for as the Utica well, when we get the permanent facilities online in the middle of the summer, those wells will be put online, and they will be uninterruptible. In other words, we'll be able to hold them at a constant rate. And these production facilities are designed to limit those wells at 20 million a day. And again, that's not necessarily for any sort of choke management or anything that we're worried about on that end of it as much as it is trying to optimize the cost for those facilities in that gathering system that we're putting in play.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Ray, if I can have just one last one. Just again, I know it's not just Washington County, obviously, that's where these huge pads where for this Marcellus and Utica, but kind of in this surrounding area. Near term, do you have -- I guess when you have the takeaway for each of the -- all this Utica production on top of the existing Marcellus production you have there, what do you have sort of near term, I guess? I mean could you flow it, I guess, in the same line? I guess you could, but you really don't want to, maybe you can just, maybe talk about takeaway if you would start with kind of Washington County, that generally, given these huge pads, takeaway for both the Utica, Marcellus in this specific area?","Ray N. Walker","Well, I'll start and let Chad jump in. But again, like Jeff brought up earlier, there's really 3 keys to a big successful play like this. One is, you got to have the rock, and we've clearly done that. Number two, you've got to have the infrastructure. And we request that 75 years plus of infrastructure was built right through this area. And we were able to tap into all of that. We were first movers in the play. And working with MarkWest, we've been able to put a huge system of interleaks and placed there for the wet gas. I think what a lot of people forget is there's clearly also a lot of dry gas lines in that system as there's a lot of residue gas that comes off the plant, a lot of meter taps into the different pipelines, Tennessee and Columbia and Line N [ph] and so forth. So we have all of that together growing over time. And then the third piece, the third cornerstone of it is the market and having actual customers on the other end to use the product. And that's also been a core philosophy of ours for years is to cultivate, not only the firm transportation and the actual infrastructure to get there, but also the consumers on the other end to use that. So in part of our plan that the team is currently working on today, to put an effective Utica development program together, which could begin as early as next year depending on market conditions. All 3 of those pieces have to be in place, and I'll let Chad refer to how we might expand going forward.","Chad L. Stephens","Yes, so to expand on that a little bit, because of all the existing infrastructure, we are currently working on a short-term solution to be in service, be it the late 2016 for what we're calling a header system, which is some pipe that would run through this particular area of Utica development to get the gas to our existing capacity that we have to take it to market. And then long term, that header system, we're going to be able to expand it to whatever direction the Utica and dry gas development takes us. So having the existing infrastructure allows the optionality to be able to quickly as we -- as the drilling teams come up with these new monster pads as you described them, we have the opportunity to build out the infrastructure, and we'll do so. So we have short-term projects that we're working on for mid 2016 and much bigger projects beyond that in later years to help get the gas out of there -- at good economics, at good prices.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","2015 is a challenging year for our industry. With our current plan to spend approximately $700 million less in 2015 and 2014 and still target 20% growth, we believe that we'll be one of the most capital-efficient companies in our industry. These capital efficiencies coupled with our large footprint in the core of the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian and the optionality of being able to drill dry, wet and super-rich acreage, as well as the shape of our 20% growth profile for 2015, which is back-end loaded, have us well-positioned for 2015, '16 and beyond.

Range's ability to consistently drill low-cost, high-return wells across our acreage in the Marcellus, as well as focus on driving down unit costs, resulted in strong operating results for the quarter.","Comparing unit costs realized during the quarter to this time last year, Range's LOE is down 44%, G&A is down 23%, interest expense down 17%, and DD&A was $0.95 in the second quarter, down 22% year-over-year. We continued to achieve operational improvements in the Marcellus and our wells continued to exhibit strong performance. Ray will discuss this in greater detail.","All three of our liquids projects are now fully operational and we have the ability to move ethane to Europe, Canada and the Gulf Coast. We have the flexibility to export propane from Marcus Hook to anywhere in the world, or to sell into the Northeast markets whenever it is advantageous to do so. All of the gas pipelines we're contracted on are either on-line or on schedule, including Spectra's Gulf Coast expansion in the fourth quarter of 2016, Columbia's Rayne\/Leach Xpress in third quarter of 2017, and Rover Phase 2 in the fourth quarter of 2017.","By the end of this year, approximately 70% of our natural gas is projected to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachian Basin, further improving our expected natural gas differentials going forward. By year-end 2017, we expect over 80% of our production to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachian Basin.","Gas pricing remained challenged during the second quarter, but pricing has improved since and there are signs that later this year and into 2017, supply and demand will be more balanced and pricing could significantly improve. We expect natural gas production in the U.S. to continue declining for the remainder of this year. In Appalachia, there are only about 30 rigs drilling for natural gas in the Marcellus and Utica formations, with the rigs about equally divided between the two plays. We estimate that it would take approximately 50 rigs to hold production flat in the Marcellus and Utica. An estimate to put 20 additional rigs back to work, including all associated costs to put the wells on-line, would result in additional of $4 billion of capital per year.","It's also important to note that the drilled uncompleted well inventory in the Marcellus and Utica combined continues to decline and appears to be down about 34% in 2016. The rig counts in all of the other U.S. gas basins are at historic lows, and productions in these basins is declining. In addition, total associated gas from the oil plays continues to decline on a monthly basis since December 2014 and is down over 5% year-to-date. This supply decline is happening while demand for natural gas is increasing, primarily driven by Mexican exports, power generation and LNG exports.","Looking into 2017, the NYMEX strip has moved above $3 and we believe it can continue to climb. There's also a brighter outlook for ethane and propane for 2017. At Range, if these prices -increases occur, we have the ability to ramp activity with increased cash flow. We have 231 existing pads that we can go back onto to drill additional wells, which increases capital efficiency and decreases the cycle time to ramp up.","Given our large footprint in Southwest Pennsylvania, we also have the ability to shift capital to drill in the dry, wet or super-rich areas. We are permitting wells across all areas and have the ability to allocate capital on a real-time basis to the highest return assets based on current market conditions. To the extent there's available space in a portion of the gathering system, we'll direct drilling there, which will reduce our gathering costs.","We are pleased to report that the merger with Memorial is moving along well, and we currently expect to close in mid-September. As we said when the deal was announced, we believe that combining two of the highest quality North American natural gas and NGL assets will create a premier domestic natural gas company with a resilient and flexible platform for sustained growth.","We believe that Range's Marcellus and Memorial's Lower Cotton Valley are the two lowest-cost gas plays in the United States and are strategically located near key demand centers. The combination creates a unique portfolio with more optionality for Range and an enhanced ability to serve our end customers. The product mix in both assets are similar, which enables us to utilize our marketing expertise for both natural gas and NGLs, and leverage our existing customer and transport relationships to find innovative sales arrangements, just as we've done in the past. Perfect examples include our relationships and agreements to sell ethane to NOVA Chemicals and INEOS as well as our marketing of international propane.","On the technical side, we continue to improve the economics of the Marcellus and have identified transferrable ideas that can enhance the economics of the Lower Cotton Valley, resulting in improved capital efficiency and returns. Lastly, the merger will benefit from the existing Range corporate infrastructure, procurement and other expertise, which is expected to achieve lower unit costs, enhance profitability throughout the commodity price cycles, and result in a better, stronger company.","In summary, we believe the combined entity offers investors five key positive attributes. The first is a very high-quality, low-cost asset base in two complementary basins. The second is improved capital efficiency, as illustrated by the opportunity to go back onto existing pads to drill new wells in the Marcellus and to drill highly prolific wells in the Lower Cotton Valley. Continuing to drill longer laterals and optimizing landing and targeting will also drive improved capital efficiency in both regions. The third key attribute is top-flight operational execution, as evidenced by a consistent track record of operational achievements.","The fourth is a strong marketing effort, highlighted by Range's ability to move ethane and propane to multiple domestic and international markets and to move natural gas to multiple markets within the U.S., with over 80% of our Marcellus gas moving to markets outside the Appalachian Basin by the end of 2017. Finally, the combined company will have an even stronger balance sheet with ample liquidity and a strong hedge position for 2016 and 2017. All of these attributes position Range to deliver strong operating results and build sustainable long-term shareholder value.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Jeff.","We continue to execute our strategy with notable success. We're focused on improving well performance, prudently allocating capital to our highest-quality properties, improving capital efficiency, and continuing to drive down cost in all categories.","Production for the second quarter came in at 1.421 Bcf equivalent per day with 36% liquids. And for the third quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.43 Bcf equivalent per day with similar liquids. Our annual guidance remains at the high end of 1.41 Bcf equivalent to 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day, which would represent growth of approximately 10% over last year. And we're still forecasting sequential quarterly growth with our exit rate being higher than it was at the end of 2015, which sets us up well for growth in 2017.","We've continued to drive down our overall unit cost in the second quarter, resulting in an 8% reduction from the prior-year quarter. As Jeff mentioned earlier, all of the categories were better than expected, but I believe they're worth mentioning again. Our operating teams continue to work more efficiently and our LOE per Mcfe is 44% lower than a year ago, and 21% lower than the prior quarter. G&A was down 23% and DD&A was down 22% year-over-year. All these are examples of our teams driving down costs and increasing efficiencies, while working safely with a focus on environmental responsibility.","Driving a lot of our LOE improvements is the handling of water. Remember, Range was the company that introduced the reuse of flow-back and produced water, and the first company to achieve 100% reuse back in 2009. With some very creative and innovative thinking, our team will save over $18 million in water handling this year, impacting the CapEx ledger while also lowering LOE cost.","This savings is driven primarily by three things: first, improved completion designs, meaning a greater focus on proppant placement and conductivity rather than water volume; second, a steady and highly efficient frac program, allowing us to work cooperatively with many operators in the area that supply reuse water to our sites at no cost to Range, thereby greatly reducing our cost; and third, we've been able to really focus on our infrastructure and water handling logistics, therefore developing advantages that are very unique to our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. Minimizing our cost for handling water is a huge advantage, and not having a water MLP that we would have to feed allows us to focus on the true bottom-line cost.","Capital efficiency continues to improve, and I'll go through just a few examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. On the completions front, we completed 1,067 stages. This is a 23% improvement over the second quarter of last year with the same number of frac crews as we had last year. We've reduced the total average completion cost per foot of lateral by 25% compared to last year.","Our top four pads completed in 2016 have averaged over 8.3 stages a day for a total of 173 stages. The best pad achieved a completion cost per foot of almost 15% below the average, which again was already 25% lower than last year. We're forecasting a 23% reduction in CapEx for production facilities, resulting in almost $9 million in savings this year as a result of design improvements, reductions in labor and materials, and redeployment of existing equipment.","On the drilling side, we achieved a 27% reduction in drilling cost per foot compared to last year, while drilling 6% more lateral feet in the quarter. The laterals drilled during the second quarter were 8% longer than last year, and seven out of our top 10 days for lateral feet drilled in a day were in the first half of 2016. This illustrates that we're still improving and expect to continue. Our best well drilled this quarter and our fastest well to-date was an 8,634-foot lateral drilled at a cost that was 38% lower than our average, again with our average during the quarter being 27% lower than last year.","As we've covered many times in the past, we believe our average total well costs per foot, including facilities, are the best in the Southwest portion of the basin. We believe if you look at some of our recent achievements, which are clearly more than just a few wells, you'll begin to appreciate the improving capital efficiency that we expect to see going forward. This, combined with the ability to go back on existing pads and infrastructure, as well as with drilling longer laterals, suggests we can build significant value going forward. Again, all of this is being done safely and in an environmentally sound manner by a strong operations and technical team and by all our folks across the company.","Today, we can drill a 9,000-foot lateral and complete it with 45 stages, averaging 2,000 pounds of proppant per foot of lateral in our wet area, with full facilities on a brand-new four-well pad, for approximately $7.7 million per well. If we did so on an existing pad, the well cost could be as low as $7 million a well. In comparison to our peers, our cost is less \u2013 over $1 million less on an apples-to-apples basis \u2013 and our well performance is better, resulting in better economics than any of our peers in the Southwest portion of the basin.","I should point out that this is not just theoretical. We have many of these types of longer lateral wells planned for the future. For example, we plan to drill a seven-well pad in our super-rich area later this year, averaging approximately 10,700-foot laterals, with the longest at 14,500 feet. These wells will be completed early next year, and we look forward to sharing the results of these and other long lateral pads in the future.","We continue to achieve outstanding well performance. I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through some of our recent top performing wells. We recently completed a seven-well pad, averaging 5,717-foot laterals in 30 stages in the super-rich area, near the end of the first quarter and into the beginning of the second quarter. The average 24-hour rate to sales under constrained conditions was 20.6 million cubic feet equivalent per day, or 3,434 barrels of oil equivalent per day since it was 73% liquids.","In the wet area, our top pad was a three-well pad averaging 6,782-foot laterals with 35 stages. The initial 24-hour rate to sales under constrained conditions was 27.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day. And in our dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania, our top pad was a five-well pad averaging 7,424-foot laterals with 38 stages per well, and the initial 24-hour rate to sales, again under constrained conditions, was 26.7 million cubic feet a day.","I'd also like to review some of the best wells we've drilled on a normalized EUR per 1,000 foot of lateral basis. All of these wells have been turned to sales within the last nine months. Let me start with the dry area in Washington County. This is the five-well pad that I mentioned earlier that was brought on-line in April of 2016, averaging 7,424-foot laterals. This pad is in the same area as the pad in the presentation on page 42 where we went back on the pad and drilled additional wells.","This five-well pad is similar in recoveries to that pad at over 3 Bcf per 1,000 foot, or over 22 Bcf per well. And the wells are projected to cost approximately $5.3 million each. Again, all of these well costs that are referred to include all of the facilities. Similar to the pad in the presentation, we can go back to this pad and drill additional top-tier wells along with wells on offsetting pads in the future.","In the wet area, we turned a four-well pad averaging 6,964-foot laterals to sales in the fourth quarter of 2015. This pad is in a similar area as the wet area pad on the presentation on page 41 where we went back and drilled additional wells. This four-well pad is projected to average 4 Bcf equivalent per 1,000 feet, or approximately 28 Bcf equivalent per well. Wells like these in this area would be projected to cost approximately $5.8 million today.","In the super-rich area, we brought on-line two pads with 10 wells in the first quarter with an average lateral length of 5,100 feet. These wells are currently projected to average approximately 2.8 Bcf equivalent per 1,000 foot, or 14 Bcf equivalent per well, costing $4.8 million.","On the last couple of calls, we've discussed the unique advantage we have due to our expansive inventory of existing pads and infrastructure, which allows us to drill wells at much lower cost, thereby significantly increasing capital efficiencies. Today I'd like to touch on another advantage. Currently, we have an inventory of over 230 pads that we could eventually utilize. This is comprised of new pads, pads that are in various stages of execution, 124 producing pads with five or fewer wells, and 59 producing pads with six to nine wells. All of these represent opportunities to drill more laterals.","We could go back onto the pads as needed when there's room in the gathering system and the infrastructure would be ready. We have in hand today all the permits necessary to drill 42 laterals on those pads if desired. This is critical when you consider our ability to quickly ramp up activity and volumes at much less cost than others that don't have a deep acreage and existing pad inventory. Consider in Pennsylvania the cycle time for a grassroots multi-well pad and all the permitting that goes with it; civil engineering, environmental permitting and title can take a long time.","On the execution front, from the start of the pad and road construction to turned-in line is around nine months for a four-well pad. For wells on an existing pad with permits in hand, that cycle time can be less than half that, depending on the number of wells. We believe this represents one of our greatest advantages and well positions us for future growth, and we believe it allows us to allocate our capital towards projects that will come on-line to sales in short order.","While our 2017 plans are still under development, the important things to consider are that we have a large core and high-quality position, our acreage is largely held by production, a low-cost structure, strong capital efficiency, we're drilling longer laterals, we have an attractive low-cost transportation portfolio, the ability to drill on existing pads as well as new pads, permits in hand to quickly and efficiently grow when the time is right, the flexibility of drilling in dry or liquids-rich areas, a low decline base production corporately of 19%, very low maintenance CapEx, and finally, strong operations and technical teams with a proven track record. Most importantly, we will continue to allocate capital to our highest-return projects across our large core, diverse and stacked pay portfolio as we develop plans for 2017 and beyond.","Switching to marketing for a few minutes, year-to-date, local Appalachia basis remains challenged. The good news is we have a portfolio of low-cost take-away capacity to markets that improve our price realizations. Later this year, during the fourth quarter, we will add to our portfolio 150 million a day of firm capacity on the Spectra Gulf Markets project at a very reasonable transport fee.","Additionally, we anticipate the Columbia Leach\/Rayne Xpress project to be in service by the end of 2017, which adds an additional 300 million a day in capacity. Both of these projects move our gas away from Appalachia to better prices in the Gulf Coast where demand is projected to dramatically increase over the next several years. As Jeff mentioned in his comments, once the Gulf Markets project is in service, approximately 70% of our natural gas production is projected to be sold outside the Appalachian Basin. Once Leach\/Rayne Xpress is in service, over 80% of our natural gas will be sold outside the basin.","We recently signed new condensate sales agreements which will improve our price by several dollars per barrel over first-half realized prices. On the NGL side, Mariner East began officially flowing ethane and propane to Marcus Hook on May 1. INEOS is loading their state-of-the-art Dragon-class ships with ethane and transporting it to Europe. And Range is marketing propane globally out of Marcus Hook and realizing prices above Mont Belvieu. These liquids marketing arrangements have significantly improved our NGL realizations compared to last summer, as reflected in our price realization improving to 24% of WTI compared to 14% of WTI last year.","We also wanted to provide a brief update on our third Utica well, the DMC 10H, for which we are currently in the process of conducting a production flow test. The test is part of a larger technical evaluation to characterize the reservoir and help crack the code on this play. It's still very early in the producing lifecycle for this well, but it continues to produce with a flowing pressure and rate within the top four wells in the Utica, which is consistent with what we reported at the end of the first quarter.","As I've said in the past, the Utica costs almost 2.5 times more than our dry Marcellus. And while the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential, even with anticipated efficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells currently exceed Utica returns. Given limited production history thus far, on a risk-adjusted basis, it's clear to us to that our high quality Marcellus wells are currently the superior investment. Our Utica potential is held by our Marcellus development, and over time we expect that the Utica can be a complementary development opportunity. But for now, our plan is to monitor our three wells, along with offset wells, while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine the path forward from there.","In the meantime, we'll remain focused on our high-graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible. As we continue to lower cost, improve efficiencies, drill longer laterals and develop our stacked pay core assets, we remain well-positioned to create sustainable, long-term value.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials.","Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Ray.","The biggest second-quarter story on the finance side is the dramatic decrease in unit cost, led by a 44% year-over-year reduction in our water handling and processing costs, which is largely responsible for the record low $0.15 per Mcfe cash direct operating expense. We also saw meaningful reductions in contract pumping, well-head treatment costs and utilities.","While not all of these cost reductions will be recurring, such as those attributable to the mild weather, the relentless focus on costs and the benefit of having shed significant non-core assets over the past year have moved our already low cost structure even lower. Aggregate unit costs were down by 8% or $0.24 per Mcfe from the second quarter of last year. Third quarter expense guidance found in the earnings release reflects our current view, which includes a significant drop in unit costs from prior guidance.","It's amazing to note that six years ago in 2009 our DD&A rate per Mcfe and direct operating expense combined was $3.16 per Mcfe. The next year, 2010, was the first year that the combined costs fell below $3 per Mcfe, and three years later in 2013, the combined costs fell below $2 per Mcfe. With the current DD&A rate at $0.95 and cash operating expense at $0.15, we have reduced the combined expense of operating our properties and recovering our capital by 65% over the past seven years, and are nearing the $1 per Mcfe mark. As Jeff and Ray have both said, these cost and productivity improvements speak to the unique quality of our assets and execution capability of our team.","Cash flow for the second quarter was $93 million and cash flow per fully diluted share was $0.56. Second quarter EBITDAX was $129 million, both slightly below the first quarter of this year. Year-to-date cash flow was $192 million and year-to-date EBITDAX was $264 million.","Turning to the balance sheet, for the third consecutive quarter Range ended the quarter with less debt than it started. The last time our debt was below the current level was May of 2012, a period when our daily production was 50% less than the second quarter of 2016. Our bank credit facility, which has a $3 billion borrowing base and a $2 billion commitment amount, had only $3 million drawn at the end of the second quarter. Our existing committed liquidity is anticipated to be sufficient to fund potential cash requirements for the Memorial transaction, and once approved by shareholders, no bank group waivers or other consents are required to effect the merger.","We continue to closely monitor our recycle ratio, as we believe it is a key forward-looking indicator of our ability to grow our reserves and production within unhedged future cash flow. Based on our year-end 2015 reserve report, F&D cost, projected 2016 unit cost structure, and unhedged NYMEX pricing for 2017, our recycle ratio is approximately two times.","Though the recycle ratio I just mentioned is based on unhedged NYMEX prices, we remain well hedged in 2016, with over 80% of our remaining 2016 natural gas production hedged at a floor price of $3.22 per Mcfe and just over 330 MMBtu per day of our estimated 2017 gas production \u2013 it's hedged at $2.94 per Mcfe. We've also added hedges to our oil and NGL position, which are detailed in the earnings release and company website.","In summary, from a revenue and profitability perspective, second quarter proved to be a lackluster story for us and the rest of the E&P industry, with low natural gas, oil and NGL prices coming off a mild winter and high energy inventories. Fortunately, industry production is declining and summer demand is upon us. NYMEX 2017 natural gas futures prices are much higher than 2016 historical prices, and our significant cost reductions and continued capital productivity improvements provide an added tailwind as we move into the last half of 2016.","With the new Mariner East marketing arrangements up and running and new take-away capacity coming on later in the fourth quarter, we will be entering 2017 well positioned for a future of disciplined capital-efficient growth, with the opportunity to accelerate as warranted.","Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Ventura. The question-and-answer session will now begin. And our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jeff, it's interesting you described the quarter \u2013 or Roger described the quarter as lackluster. But the outlook is obviously still fairly \u2013 could be whatever you want it to be in terms of growth rates. And I know I ask this question a lot, but what's the expanded asset base? Can you just help guide us a little bit as to how you think about where the balance sheet ranks relative to the two major new areas that you're going to have in the expanded portfolio? And do we think about Range getting back to the sort of legacy 20%-plus growth rate that you used to talk about? Just if you could frame how management's thinking about a longer-term picture.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me start shorter-term and then move out longer-term. But I think we've got, I think, two really high-quality assets and I would argue they're the two best gas assets in the U.S., with room to improve both marketing advantages, location, the whole thing \u2013 where the infrastructure is; differentials on Memorial, all those types of things, really positive. And the ability \u2013 not only are they good, but we think we can make them better. So we're in good shape this year.","But I think when you look forward, I think a couple of things will happen. One, I think you'll see continued improvement as we go forward. And we've got a great track record of doing that. It's really early. And Doug, as you know, we don't set our 2017 capital budget until December. But when we look at current forecasts and current strip pricing, where things are today, with our current estimates, we think the combined company would have an organic growth rate of about 10%, while spending at or near cash flow.","As we project forward, we believe \u2013 for some of the reasons that I've said, and I won't go into detail unless somebody wants me to \u2013 but if you look in our IR slides, there's a series of slides looking at gas production in the U.S., both supply and demand. And we think when you look at supply and demand, there's a good story brewing for gas: gas production declining, we're in the highest-quality pieces, but oil, gas \u2013 associated gas with oil declining at a time when gas demand is growing. And personally, and I think our team believes, gas is a cleaner, better fuel. So as you look forward and as gas demand grows, and I think your company's deck shows it, gas prices as you go out look better. So as our cash flow increases, we have the ability to reinvest and reinvest quickly, and to ramp up with increased cash flow as gas prices improve.","So right now, looking at where strip currently is, realizing strip is a bad predictor for our future prices, but even where strip is, I think next year somewhere around $3.10, that's organic growth of about 10%, allocated \u2013 and both sides can grow. Both sides, so I think the Memorial and Range both have strong economics right now. We see they're probably about equal. We expect to invest cash flow in both, and both can get organic growth of about 10% at strip prices for next year. As prices improve and we have the ability, cash flow increases, we can \u2013 our \u2013 we have plenty of places to drill to be able to ramp to get back to higher growth rates when prices warrant. So it was kind of a long-winded answer, but hopefully I answered your question.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, it's \u2013 spending within cash flow I think is the piece I was really trying to get at. So we should basically consider the balance sheet, the deleveraging of that obviously which occurs at the end of this year, are you then comfortable that the balance sheet is where you want it to be? I just kind of want to see how that ranks relative to your growth aspirations.","Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Doug, this is Roger. I'll take that one. And first of all, I just want to mention that my comment was that from a revenue and profitability perspective, it was a lackluster quarter. I think from an operations and cost control standpoint, it was a terrific quarter. I just want to make that clarification.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But as for the balance sheet...","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's kind of what I was getting at. Right.","Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. As for the balance sheet, I mean, we're real happy with where we sit right now. As I mentioned, debt is lower at the end of the quarter than the beginning, three consecutive quarters running. Aggregate debt lowest it's been in four years, even though production continues to grow healthily. I think you're looking at a balance sheet where, with the Memorial transaction, the leverage ratio, that's EBITDAX, will be well below four, and I think that's where it needs to be. And with positive recycle ratios of two times for both companies on an unhedged basis, what that's telling me is that we'll be able to grow within cash flow powerfully, and have the optionality to either bring the leverage down if that's what's called for, or expand growth if that's what's the better option.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, fellas. I'll let someone else jump on. Thank you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pearce Hammond with Simmons Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","My first question is, it looks like you're completing eight more wells this year, just curious what's driving that? And I assume that's not going to have an impact on your 2016 production, but is going to certainly help your 2017 trajectory.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's a good question, Pearce. And a lot of it is the operational efficiency and the reductions in capital that we're seeing. What I talked about for the water: $18 million savings; $9 million worth of savings in facilities. It's what we do every year, is we take those improvements, and whether it's drilling more feet of lateral for less cost, or whether it's fracking more stages in a day, or combined with the fact that the wells continue to do better than we project and flatter declines and shifting more to dry. All of that stuff helps us optimize our capital allocation, if you want to look at it that way.","And what we generally end up doing is we either drill more wells, complete more wells on the end of the schedule, which means we may turn those wells, those eight more wells in line, but they'll probably be really close to the end of the year, which really impacts our growth in 2017 and helps set that up much better. So that's typically what happens every year.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Well thanks for that, Ray. And then my follow-up, this is maybe a harder question to answer, but if we look at the forward gas strip, 2018 NYMEX is trading about $0.10 to $0.20, $0.15 below 2017. I'd love to get you guys' thoughts on that. Do you think that's the market basically saying, hey, in 2017 the industry is going to overdo it like it has done in the past and is really going to hurt 2018? What might the market be missing when you look out there? And does that affect any of your hedging plans?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think a key thing to look at, and there's been multiple studies and people have done it, is when you look at the forward strip and then you look at what actually occurs at that point in time, whether it's six months out, two, three, five years, and the strip is an extremely poor predictor of the future. So I think again, if you look forward, and we have stuff in our IR presentation, there's a lot of natural gas demand coming. I think power generation, ultimately long-term I think gas is going to be \u2013 continue to take market share. It's a cleaner, better fuel regardless of which administration gets in or what the laws are. It's just a better fuel.","Gas exports to Mexico have surprised to the upside; I think that will continue to happen. LNG exports, we think at least eight B's (39:09) per day go, and that's already started up. A lot of petrochemical demand coming on in 2017, 2018. And I think once the infrastructure gets built and gas starts moving around, it's a cleaner, better fuel. Roger just went to a little symposium with a high-powered professor from a university. He puts in differently. He says the world's moving to \u2013 will move to lighter molecules. Basically, there's gas, C1H4. There's more hydrogen atoms per carbon atom than there is for coal or oil or other fuels. It's a cleaner, better fuel. So I think the strip is just a poor predictor of the future.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you very much, Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah, hi. Slide 11, 2018 FT capacity, do you have a guide as to what that might look like?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure exactly what the question is. Well, I'm on slide 11, but...","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. So 2017 is an average of 1.375. Do you have an 2018? Early look?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, we...","Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development","It'll be the same. This is \u2013 Subash, this is Chad. On slide 11, you see average for 2017 is 1.375 Bs a day. 2018 will be the same, because that number includes Rover at the end of the year.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The...","Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development","It's average. So it would be higher, yes.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It actually goes up some, because Rover comes on line right at the end of the year. So this is a yearly average. So our yearly average would be higher and going up. I think the other thing our marketing guys have done a good job of is, we have kind of right-sized firm transportation, plus we were a first mover, so we have right-sized transportation at a lower cost than our peers. And I think we still think ultimately, long-term, capacity tends to get overbuilt in the basin. So we didn't over-buy. So I think we're in good shape for our projection. It's a good match of transportation to our growth profile and what we have.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And it's a very diverse set of take-away capacity, so that we're not dependent upon any one particular project, be it on time or not. I mean, we believe that all the projects we've got, looking at us going forward, are definitely on time, but we're not totally dependent upon any one of them. So I think our team has done an excellent job of spreading that out in that diverse portfolio.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","On slide 11, another key part of that bottom line. As transportation, as gas continues to move out of the basin, again, at the end of 2016, over 70% and at the end of 2017, over 80%, it's probably closer to 85% when Rover kicks on. You can see our \u2013 the estimated Marcellus differential to NYMEX improves. So we expect improving natural gas prices, better differentials, better net-backs going forward as we continue to move gas out of the basin. A lot of that incremental capacity goes to the Gulf Coast where the demand's going to be. And I think it's important to note as well on our NGLs, we only had a partial year, really; Mariner East started up May 1.","Unknown Speaker","First quarter.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Partial quarter. Partial year. So as you look into 2017, the pricing should get better for NGLs as well. We'll have a full year of Mariner East. We have a new condensate agreement, I think Ray mentioned, so we'll have a full year of that. The other thing is, again, we expect natural gas prices to get better going forward. But there's a good story brewing for NGLs as well. A lot of ethane demand coming on, Range being the first company to export ethane by ship with \u2013 in partnership with Sunoco and INEOS.","But Enterprise is starting to export a lot of ethane later this year, coupled with all the petrochemical demand that comes on in 2017 and 2018. So the U.S. is the biggest propane exporter, will be a large ethane exporter. And increasing demand. So there's good story brewing, not just for natural gas but for NGLs and for, specifically, for Range because of the specific agreements we have. Then back to the macro as more ethane comes out of the gas stream, it helps a little bit on the supply side as you take the ethane out of the gas stream.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right. If I could just ask you about Northeast Marcellus, the volumes were down. Understandably, there were no completions. I suspect that goes back into growth mode. And I guess what I'm getting at is, as you look at the optionality of your portfolio, should we read the increase in take-away as a desired growth rate over time? Or do you think of de-emphasizing Northeast Marcellus over time to where you really want more optionality instead of growth, if you have to rank one versus the other?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think if we rank anything it'd be returns. So we're not focused on growth as much as we're focused on returns. Growth just kind of falls out of that. Having a portfolio is good and having multiple choices is good, but it's a combination of where do we think we're going to get best returns with time. And we'll allocate capital that way. And when we close on Memorial, it will give us another good choice because there's high returns there. So we'll have the ability in the Marcellus Northeast, Southwest. We'll have the ability of what drives super-rich. We'll have the ability of Lower Cotton Valley. And I think having more high-quality choices ultimately will result in stronger returns with time.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Sorry. The three pads you highlighted with the EUR projections look to be around 20% to 30%-plus better versus your average curves in those areas. I think you mentioned two of them being near existing pads, and having permits to drill 42 more wells on existing pads. Is that the opportunity set for this type of high grade drilling in the near term? Or to what extent can you high-grade further in 2017 and 2018 to your best acreage where you'll find that kind of outperformance?","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, that's a great question, Jeoffrey. And we're really doing that all the time. We're continuing to improve completion designs and targeting and reservoir modeling, and I think you've seen that quarter after quarter after quarter where we've continued to develop better and better well performance on a normalized basis, or however you want to look at it. We have lots of opportunities in all those areas mentioned. And remember, we have a huge position across southwest PA. And we talk about super-rich, wet and dry, and each one of those by their selves are larger than most of our peers' total position. And when you break those positions down internally, each one of those positions has lots of different unique designs and unique reservoir models and unique targets and all that.","And so we're always trying to manage \u2013 trying to allocate our capital to the very highest return wells, but you also have to factor in the fact of, is there room in the gathering system to put more wells in that area? All of those things have to fit in; markets for how we're handling our firm transportation and all of those things work into this big master plan over the 5-year, 10-year outlook that we have. So I think you'll see, like we've done every year, I think our type curves will continue to improve. I think our averages improved.","And what I was trying to get across in this \u2013 in my prepared remarks is that we have areas that are continuing to get better and better and are significantly above the average. And I think as we drill longer laterals and continue to improve our completion designs \u2013 I mean, we're 12 years into this and we're still finding better wells, and we're going back into some of those areas and doing that. And we have opportunities to drill brand new pads that in a lot of cases may have better economics than going back to an existing pad. It just depends on all of those things. So it's a good point, and yes, I think we are going to continue to drive things up well performance-wise, capital efficiency-wise. Cost structure is going to get better. You're going to continue to see those step changes year after year after year.","Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the detail.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Uh-huh.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Say...","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","...Ray, you and Jeff and the guys seem to be highlighting a little bit more this time than in the past the return into some of the existing pads, like you mentioned on slide 42. I'm just wondering, how do you think about this just simply as far as improved potential well returns, and then versus the need to hold acres to drill? Because it certainly seems you have tremendous opportunity to come back and save costs and, obviously, improve returns here. So I'm just wondering, how do you balance this with the need to hold acreage?","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, at the end of this year \u2013 we've talked about for the last several years how we had a pretty significant land budget. And I can't quote the numbers off the top of my head, but we've significantly reduced our land dollars over the last couple of years for sure. At the end of this year we finally reached that point where we're largely HBPed. There's always going to be a little bit of acreage out there, but it's largely done. We virtually have no acreage at risk at the end of this program this year. So going forward, that is much less of a factor than it's ever been. And so we will do what we've always done, is first look at returns and quality and room in the gathering system and all of those different things we need to look at.","What \u2013 the point I'm trying to get across in talking about the existing pads is, we have an additional opportunity, and I believe a significant advantage over our peers in the area, in that we have all of that existing infrastructure that we can go back to. We, in fact, even have permits in hand, where we could almost instantly put rigs on those locations and in a couple of months have wells on-line. I think that's a very unique advantage. We're not saying that's exactly where we're going to go next year; I think you're just going to see a mix of that, plus new wells. We've also got some wells in brand new areas that are making four, four and a half Bcf per 1,000 foot, at $5 million in some cases.","That's pretty impressive economics, and those wells will greatly compete with going back onto an existing pad. You can save up to $800,000 or $900,000 on a well on an existing pad. It still may not compete with some of these really prolific areas that we're able to develop today. So it's always a mix of allocating that capital amongst that. But the good news is, going forward, we don't have that anchor of needing to HBP acreage around our neck any further, now going forward.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Wow, that's great to hear. And then just a quick follow-up. Just on that slide 47 you guys talk about that third Utica well appearing to be not only one of your best, but obviously one of the best plays. Even with that said, you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks that these returns you don't think are still competing quite yet with some of these great Marcellus returns. So is it just simply a return question to decide when you start or if you start drilling more Utica wells, given you are holding that with Marcellus? I guess my question is, are you looking at just simply returns, or is there more to that?","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","It's basically that, returns. We think we could do an 8,500-foot lateral in the Utica today for about $14 million. But again, that's two and a half times more cost for essentially the same reserves as our dry Marcellus, some of the really prolific stuff we're developing in the very same area. So we have a huge inventory of Marcellus left to do. We have hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands, of wells to drill. And so I think that it really is going to be a matter of returns. We're going to continue to look at it. We may or may not drill a well next year. We haven't made those plans yet. But I think we'll continue to develop the reservoir models.","And I think there will be a point in time where it will definitely be a complementary development. You'll see us kicking that in, whether it's a new contract to sell gas somewhere or whatever. But I think that for the current time, it's just simply, it can't compete with the Marcellus today for us. I think if you don't have Marcellus like we have and that's all you got, then that's what you do.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That makes sense. Great details. Thanks, Ray.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning. Hey, just a quick follow-up on ...","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","... an earlier question about the improved productivity per lateral foot in each of those areas you highlighted. How does that compare with your comment, Jeff, about able to grow about 10% out of \u2013 while being internally funded? In other words, is that growth within your cash flows based on what your average 2016 program is? Or \u2013 and do those results point to even a better 2017 to 2019 growth profile because of that recoverability?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's a good point. What I said in there is, I said based on our current forecasts and utilizing current strip pricing, we'd get growth of about 10%, spending at or near cash flow. As we continue to see improvements with time \u2013 and you're talking about going out there to 2018, 2019 and beyond \u2013 I expect \u2013 I agree with Ray. I think we're not at the end of our efficiency.","So I think as we continue to extend laterals and optimize and hone in on better areas and infrastructure build-out, all those things, I think we can get better with time. All of that would allow for increased cash flow for the same dollars spent, which would allow us to either accelerate production and growth rate or balance sheet or whatever we choose to do with that. But again, we also expect gas markets and NGL markets to improve with time, so that would say that we've got strong returns that we think will get significantly better into the future.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great. And then with the purchase expected to close towards the end of this quarter, but the slides you added on the over-pressured Lower Cotton Valley, really highlighting that position seems more expensive than just the Terryville field, is just \u2013 also in terms of foreshadowing, any comments on what the increased Lower Cotton Valley commentary can mean?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's a good question, Ron. Yeah. We're \u2013 we think Terryville is a great field and there's a lot of additional drilling to do there, a stacked pay potential. And just like we've been able to improve the Marcellus with time, and believe we still can, we think that there's things we can do to improve the different intervals in Terryville. So both high-quality fields. But your point's a good one that it's not just that, the Terryville, but there's 220,000 net acres that comes with Memorial, so that's a big footprint in a big position. And importantly, it's anchored by a couple of really high-quality fields, so Terryville in the North and Vernon field towards the south of that position.","And Vernon field, actually, production-wise, is better than Terryville in that the vertical wells were significantly better \u2013 in fact, so good that it was developed on a vertical basis. But at the point being, when you look at Terryville, Vernon and in addition, across that 220,000 acres, there's a number of vertical tests, and they show multiple things. One, with all that well control, vertical well control, it shows that those high-quality sands that exist in Terryville and in Vernon are present really across that 220,000 acres. So the sands are present and they're good quality. Another thing, when you look, there's multiple gas tests out there in those vertical wells. So not only is the sand present with good quality, it's also gas-saturated.","And then I think another key concept that's true, really, in the industry is that a horizontal well is a multiplier of a vertical. For instance, in the Marcellus, the old vertical wells, if they averaged in an area 0.5 Bcf per well and then in the horizontals you pumped a total of 30 stages, in essence then, 0.5 Bs times 30 stages, you end up with a 15 Bcf well. And we see in the Terryville area, not just from Terryville, but from some other fields in the area that it's the same thing where you have, that the horizontal is multiplier of a vertical and if you've got good vertical production in the fort, it should lead to good horizontal wells. Bottom line, we think there's significant potential, not only in Terryville, but we think there's significant upside to the 220,000 acres that comes with it.","Operator","Due to technical difficulties on the part of their service provider, Range Resources has elected to end the call at this time.

With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks, Laith, and thanks to everyone for joining us on this morning's call. Looking at our second quarter results, we continued to build on the operational and financial success with saw in the first quarter of the year. Our cash flow per year increased 22% over the prior year, driven by consistent results out of Southwest Pennsylvania, further unit cost improvements and better realized prices. I'll provide a few comments on the quarter and the progress we're making on our strategic goals and five-year outlook before turning it over to Dennis and Mark.","Reflecting on the quarter, we continue to see meaningful improvements in cash flow per share with production and cash margins both higher versus last year. The key driver behind this year-over-year increase in margins was the $20 per barrel increase in oil price which has pushed NGL prices to levels not seen since 2014. As one of the largest NGL producers in the United States with direct exposure to international markets, Range continues to be well-positioned to capitalize on an improving macro backdrop for oil through NGL production. And as a result of this price strength, coupled with our advantaged NGL capacity for ethane and propane, we are increasing our expected NGL realizations to the high-end of our previous guidance.","46% of Range's pre-hedge revenue for this quarter came from liquids, the majority of which was from our Appalachian NGL production. It's understandable that Appalachian is often seen as a gas play since the basin is one of the largest natural gas fields in the world. However, I think it's important to recognize the differentiated position Appalachia has within basin fractionation, control of purity products and access to international markets. This type of market does not exist in any other major U.S. liquids play as other basins typically send a y-grade barrel to the Gulf Coast. We think the unique nature of the Appalachian NGL model will become evident over the next year or so as purity products with access to international markets should garner premiums to typical wide grade NGL production you see from other plays.","Back to the quarter, and worth mentioning, Range's natural gas differentials are also improving compared expectations back in April as more of our gas is transported to strong markets and in-basin sales are seeing meaningful basis differential improvements. As a result of Range's guidance on calendar 2018 gas differentials, has improved to approximately $0.10 under NYMEX compared to $0.32 last year. These benefits are being realized as Southwest Appalachian gas markets start to benefit from new pipeline capacity after years of constraint.","Operationally, the team continues to turn in line high quality Marcellus wells which have increased the Southwest second quarter production up 30% compared to this time last year. As most of you know, the downtime we experienced on the Mariner East I NGL pipeline and the Leach Xpress natural gas pipeline created significant challenges but the team was able to work with our various midstream and processing partners to maintain production in the field. I'm incredibly proud of the team's achievements, delivering a solid quarter despite these challenges. We believe that substantial year-over-year growth expected out of the southwest area while living within cash flow demonstrates what our core assets are capable of and gives us confidence in the long range outlook which is underpinned by our Marcellus assets.","Turning to the five-year outlook, let me reiterate again what the outlook represents. It represents what our assets are capable of year-end 2017 share pricing under what we believe are conservative estimates as Range has a long track record of improving well productivity and extending lateral lengths, which is not included in this forecast.","Looking at our base case five-year outlook we see expanding margins through a lower cost structure as Range leverages its high quality inventory and infrastructure. These improvements are led by reductions in our GP&T costs, to increase utilization of existing transportation, gathering and processing capacity. We also expect meaningful reduction in interest expense, both in absolute terms and per mcfe as we increase cash flow and reduce debt.","At the same time, G&A per mcfe improve as we become more efficient and leverage our existing personnel. Combined, we see these cost reductions equating to enhanced margins over the five-year outlook starting later this year as we fill the last of our natural gas firm transportation agreements. We believe these anticipated improvements in margin, coupled with Range's low decline rate and maintenance capital requirements positions us to generate sustainable free cash flow and, given our vast inventory of high quality Marcellus locations, we believe we're in a unique position to not only deliver on a plan of free cash flow and growth, but to continue this beyond the five-year outlook into a market that will see others exhausting existing core inventories.","Now, while we think this outlook for free cash flow, improving returns and organic delevering with the high quality inventory is a compelling story, leverage does not come down as fast as we'd like. That's why we're actively pursuing asset sales that will enable us to fast-forward leverage improvements. We're targeting potential asset sales in Northeast Pennsylvania and Southwest Pennsylvania that will support our near-term goal of getting leverage below 3 times, as we ultimately move towards an investment grade leverage profile. We believe that prudently lowering leverage is a key step in addressing the disconnect we see between our current equity value and what we believe is a true intrinsic value of our business, and these potential asset sales should fast-forward to time in which we do that.","So we are making good progress on the operational and strategic goals we set for ourselves and we're excited about the progress we're seeing. To further support these efforts, we announced a couple of initiatives earlier this month that will result in Range further strengthening its management team and board. Range plans to add an Executive Vice President to the senior management team, who'll provide added experience and perspective to the team. We also announced that in cooperation with our largest shareholder, SailingStone, we'll be adding two independent board members to provide additional insight and perspectives.","Board refreshment is a topic we have discussed with many of our shareholders. We obviously agree that routinely adding new perspectives and ideas to the board is good corporate governance and makes for a well-rounded board. Similarly, we have split the roles of Chairman and CEO. Put simply, we're committed to being good stewards for the shareholders, which includes engaging with our shareholders in active, open discussions, and making changes that improve the company. Based on the ongoing active dialogue we've had and will continue to have with our shareholders, we believe these changes have been well received. We've seen a lot of change over the last six months, each of these has been a purposeful change that I believe will make Range a better, stronger company. The Range team from the board to senior management to the field remains focused on translating our incredible inventory into increased shareholder value. Like I said on the last call, I truly believe that we'll see Range valued as a top-tier E&P company again and we're working tirelessly to make that a reality.","I'll now turn it over to Dennis to discuss operations.","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. Looking back on the second quarter, our Appalachia and North Louisiana teams turned to sales 43 wells across our Marcellus and Terryville acreage positions. As we outlined on our last call, first sales was initiative up on a majority these wells during the second half of the quarter, generating a second quarter production of 2.2 Bcf equivalent per day. This puts us in line to deliver on our 2018 plan of 11% year-over-year growth, and we expect the third quarter to be at 2.22 Bcf equivalent per day.","Achieving our production goal in the second quarter was done despite two significant third-party infrastructure outages for both gas and NGLs. On June 7, there was a rupture of the TransCanada Leach Xpress pipeline that resulted in approximately 1.5 Bcf per day of natural gas to be diverted back into the Appalachian basin, including 300,000 MMBtu per day of Range's production. As Jeff indicated through our portfolio of transportation options and customer outlets, the marketing team was able to reroute our production as needed, selling more of our natural gas in Appalachia, minimizing the effects of this outage on our production. The line was put back into service on July 15 with our 300,000 per day of production returning to a normal state of operation and flowing to the Gulf Coast.","The second infrastructure issue occurred when operation was suspended on Sonoco's Mariner East I natural gas liquids pipeline. As a result, we lost access to capacity on Mariner East I for 40,000 barrels per day of ethane and propane combined for almost 2 months during the second quarter. As one of the largest NGL producers in the United States, Range has taken a portfolio approach to the sale of its purity products. The marketing team identified alternative markets for Mariner East ethane volumes and sold some of the ethane as natural gas.","For propane, Range has access to another local pipeline and railcars that continue to provide access to international markets via the Marcus Hook terminal as well as various domestic markets. By using these alternative methods to reach customers during the downtime, we were able to realize propane prices that were on average above Mont Belvieu index, although with a slightly higher transportation expense.","On June 14, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission voted unanimously to allow the Sonoco Mariner East I pipeline to return to service, shifting our ethane and propane sales to normal operation. Just as the team is delivering on production expectations, our capital spend is also on track and in alignment with our 2018 plan. At the midway point for the year, we're a little over 50% of our planned D&C spend, as drilling efficiencies drove higher first half of the year activity. I'll spend a little more time in a minute discussing these efficiencies and the good work from our operations team.","Our capital budget for the year remains unchanged at $941 million with 85% directed towards the Marcellus. Looking back on the second quarter, our operational highlights are similar to prior quarters. Our Appalachia drilling team continues to build upon their prior successes. In the second quarter, the team drilled their best horizontal footage day at 6,349 feet in 24 hours. This record falls into a long list of other 5,000 to 6,000 foot days and further demonstrates the consistency of our Marcellus operation. In addition to setting a 24-hour record for lateral feet drilled, the team also successfully drilled 12,084 feet as the average lateral length in the month of June. This was the best average lateral length for a given month in the program and shows the direction we're headed in the coming years. This all translates into a reduced dollar per foot drilling cost, as the team drills the longest, fastest, and lowest normalized cost wells in our history.","On the completion side, the team was hard at work as well, placing 1,738 frac stages at just under seven fracs per day. This is a 35% increase in total stages and a 10% increase in efficiency compared to the same time just one year ago. For production, the team turned to sales 39 wells in the second quarter from eight pad sites covering our dry, wet, and super-rich Marcellus acreage.","In the dry gas area, 28 wells were turned to sales from five pad sites. The average IP for these 28 wells was 20.5 million cubic feet per day from an average lateral length of 7,800 feet. Similar to prior well results we've discussed, four of these five pads were drilled on sites with existing production. As we've shared on the past calls, this approach saves upfront capital cost for roads, pads, and facilities, while saving on gathering cost through fully utilizing the existing infrastructure. As we look back on the first half of the year, along with our forecast for the remainder of 2018, we estimate a capital cost reduction of $7 million based on the use of the existing infrastructure for new wells. This is one of the many efficiency and cost reduction initiatives we expect to see in the years ahead as we develop our Appalachia-Marcellus and stack-pay opportunities.","In the wet area, an additional two pads were turned to sales. The first pad consists of five wells with an average IP of 43.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day from an average lateral length of nearly 12,000 feet. The second wet area pad turned to sales in Q2 came online in the last week of the quarter with production established from only three of the six wells. The three wells reached an average IP of 33.6 million cubic feet equivalent per day from an average lateral length of over 11,000 feet. We look forward to sharing the results of the remaining three wells at our next call, as they establish production early in the third quarter.","Lastly, in the super-rich area, production was initiated on three remaining wells from a five well pad we discussed in the last call. The three wells came online with an average IP of 33.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day from an average lateral length of 13,700 feet. These wells were instrumental in our increase in condensate production for the quarter with over 60% of their production as liquids. These wells are flowing under constrained conditions and cleaning up as planned. I believe all of these results are good examples of the types of lateral lengths and well performance we expect for our 2018 program.","Before we leave Appalachia operations, I wanted to look back on the continued performance from three key pads turned to sales a year ago. The first is located near the future Harmon Creek processing plant in northern Washington County. That should be operational later this year. On this pad we turned to sales four wells with an average lateral length of 9,200 feet. One year later, this pad continues to be a strong producer, with the wells currently producing above the normalized type curve by 14%. We expect to see more wells like this as we further develop the acreage around the new processing plant.","The second pad is located in the heart of Washington County and consists of four wells producing from an average lateral length of 9,500 feet. This pad was drilled around prior developed pads and one year later continues to exceed the normalized type curve by 35%, further supporting the team's ability to improve on prior well results.","The third pad is located in western Washington County where we turned to sales seven wells with an average lateral length of 10,700 feet. These are our longest laterals in the super-rich area at the time and one year later these wells continue to outperform the normalized type curve by 13% with the pad still producing over 1,000 barrels of condensate per day. With condensate selling for WTI less $6, the current economics of these wells are obviously excellent.","We're excited to see production like this from our program that highlights the quality of our acreage position. In North Louisiana, in the division completed and turned in line four wells in the second quarter, with two wells scheduled to turn in line in the third quarter. As we look back on the year-to-date Terryville performance, our average well results are producing in line with our normalized type curve published earlier this year. We have one drilling rig active in Terryville with a frac crew utilized as needed, which will continue to be our approach for the remainder of the year. Even though our activity in North Louisiana is limited this year, the team is laser focused on improving results.","A few recent examples of their dedication during the quarter are the drilling team increasing drill footage per day by 13.5% versus the 2017 average and by beating the direct operating cost target by 10% year-to-date. These operational accomplishments for both divisions would not be possible if not for the dedication of our Range team in the field, our technical support in the office, and the help of our service partners.","In closing, as we reach the midway point in 2018, we are on track with both production and capital spend, as we continue to drill and produce our most cost-effective and operationally efficient wells. I'll now turn the call over to Mark to discuss the financials.","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, Dennis. Financial results for the second quarter were consistent with our seasonal expectations and showed progress on a number of strategic fronts. These results were driven by operating activity on pace with our announced 2018 plan, and we believe keeps us on track to drive growth from a capital program set within cash flow. Investment decisions are guided by core principles of discipline to capital allocation, which directs dollars to projects with competitive risk-adjusted rates of return.","Efficient operations and diligent efforts in marketing production drove increased revenues, controlled costs, and improved cash margins for the second quarter. Analyst cash flow was $237 million for the second quarter and represents an increase of 22% over second quarter 2017 for both absolute cash flow and cash flow per share. EBITDAX was $291 million, an increase of approximately $51 million over second quarter 2017. Increased cash flow was driven in part by higher realized commodity prices, higher volumes, combined with ongoing cost controls. Average realized price per mcfe pre-hedge net of transportation costs improved $0.17 compared to the same quarter prior year.","Looking at unit costs for the quarter, total cash costs were $1.82 excluding the impact of changes in accounting treatment of certain processing contracts. LOE, production taxes, and interest expense were essentially flat compared to the same quarter prior year. Cash, general, and administrative expenses improved by about a $0.01, including stock-based compensation, G&A improved by $0.06 in mcfe.","As you will recall from the first quarter, new accounting guidance has changed the presentation of certain gathering, processing, and transportation expense starting in 2018. The net impact of this change is neutral to margins, with offsetting increases to revenue and to GP&T expense of $.21 in mcfe during the second quarter. Adjusting for this change and comparability, GP&T expense increased $0.06 in the second quarter, as compared to the same quarter last year.","This is mostly attributable to new transportation capacity coming online in 2018, which is offset by higher prices received as a result of this capacity, enabling sales into better markets. Non-cash impairment charges associated with unproved acreage exceeded second quarter guidance. Approximately $50 million of the expense relates to expiring acreage in certain North Louisiana extension areas that do not merit additional capital to extend leases at this time.","These charges represent the book value of acreage expiring through the end of 2018 and the higher than guidance second quarter is a function of timing as we made the decision to allow these leases to expire causing the recognition of the full 2018 expiration expense. For the third quarter, anticipated corporate unproved expiration expense returns to a more normalized $8 million to $10 million. At the end of the year, estimated acreage in North Louisiana remains consistent with current disclosures at approximately 150,000 acres.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect to achieve consistent or better unit costs. The most significant unit cost, GP&T will be influenced by the timing of our final contracted firm transportation capacity coming online. Cost control combined with expected better pricing should result in continued margin expansion.","Turning to the balance sheet, leverage as measured by debt-to-EBITDAX was 3.5 times at the end of the quarter, a sustained improvement from 3.7 times at year end and flat to the first quarter. Given seasonality and the cadence of drilling activity, we did outspend quarterly cash flow. However, expected annual capital expenditures remain in line with budget at $941 million and less than estimated annual cash flow. We anticipate debt reductions from free cash flow during the second half of this year. In addition, asset sale efforts discussed on recent calls are progressing and we continue to believe we will have one meaningful asset sale to announce in coming months.","In summary, our focus remains on converting consistent drilling success into tangible shareholder returns. From a financial point of view, the cost-effective resilient capital structure is a foundation to those efforts. Drilling success achieved with Range's existing inventory, when coupled with safe, efficient operations and rigorous capital management, we believe will yield predictable and growing cash flow. Range's deployment of future cash flow whether into drilling, debt repayments or returning cash to shareholders will vary over time, but it will be underpinned by a disciplined, thoughtful, allocation process.","Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Operator, with that, we'd be happy to answer questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Ventura, the question-and-answer session will now begin. We will take as many questions as time permits until the end of the call at 10 AM Eastern time. Your first question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Jeff, thanks for all the color on how you're thinking about asset monetizations. But I wonder if I could just dig a little deeper on the just \u2013 to the extent you can, how you see the current market in the wake of the Chesapeake deal in particular? And I guess, specifically, again to the extent you can, how you feel about \u2013 whether you expect your likely disposals that you can see line of sight for currently, to be acreage predominantly or acreage with production. In which case, how should we think about cash flow? And I've got a related follow-up, please.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, let me, as you might expect, I'm going to do it at a higher level. I think the quality of the assets' really critical, and I think if you look at the quality of our assets versus the Chesapeake deal, there's really no comparison. I mean, you can look at it, recoveries per thousand foot, cost per thousand foot, cost structure. So I think quality is really important, so I think that's not analogous at all.","The other thing I'll say, and this is at a very high level. So I'm not sure if this will affect your follow-up question, but feel free to ask it, but in my call notes, I said our near-term goal is to get leverage below three times. And I will say that we expect that by year-end we'll be able to accomplish that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. It's very high level.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","I know you, Doug, I know you're going to follow-up and ask like five times.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well, I...","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Let me answer it. Go ahead with the second question.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'll try not to be too predictable. I mean, the one asset obviously that you didn't mention specifically was Terryville. And obviously you've got a decline rate there that you've signaled I think pretty well to the market. Limited activity, you're obviously managing a decline rate. How should we think about the role of Louisiana in the go-forward portfolio? Again, I'll decide a fairly high level.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I'll leave it there.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Great question. Again, very early this year, given the results we saw in Terryville that were below expectations. We slowed way down in Terryville, and allocated even more of our capital to the Marcellus, so the clear focus being the Marcellus. But we did keep one rig there, and the other thing that we did that we talked about is we \u2013 several changes to the team, Dennis Degner now leading operations, Scott Chesebro leading the office in Houston and there's been several others. And I think those guys are making good progress. So we're going slower, there's a number of things we're trying at a high level. By year-end we'll have a good feel for what that is. And then we'll look at the competitiveness of the Louisiana properties against our portfolio.","But I think Dennis and Scott are doing a great job, and also going back to the original question, we want to reduce leverage, we want to get below three times in the near term, and we expect we'll be able to do that. And as I think I said in my notes, we have processes we're actively pursuing various things in Northeast Pennsylvania and Southwest Pennsylvania to do that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jeff, we appreciate everything you're trying to do here, obviously, but I don't want to press you too much on this, so just to be clear. Is Terryville off the table? Or is it a candidate for sale at some point?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Well, right now in the short run what we're saying is in the short run our focus is on Northeast Pennsylvania and Southwest Pennsylvania. Terryville, we'll look at how those returns are either later this year or early next year, and make that decision. If you look at our history, and there's plenty of history to look at, basically $4 billion in asset sales really over roughly the last decade. When projects aren't competitive, then we tend to sell them. So it comes down to can the projects that we have compete on an economic basis with things we have in our portfolio?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I'm going to ask one more if I may just real quick, and it's just really I want to finish on a positive note, because obviously you guys, I don't know how the heck you did it, but you managed to navigate these pipeline issues fairly well it seems relative to our expectations for sure, so congratulations on that. I just wanted to get your perspective looking forward. Do you see any other pipeline issues or challenges ahead of you? Or do you think that we're pretty much past the worst at this point? I'll leave it there, thanks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. Well, thank you, Doug, and I was teasing, very much respect your work and how you do a great job and we appreciate that. And again, thank you for the positive comments. It was a very tough quarter. And I give a lot of credit, our marketing team really did a great job and operational team of overcoming two really big issues, you'll remember, 40,000 barrels per day on Mariner East I is lot (30:13), and that's a big advantage we have of being able to move those, our products to international as well as 300 million per day on the gas pipeline, and then being able to move that and really almost not miss a beat, keep production up and then beat price across the board for all products. So, great accomplishment by the operations and the marketing teams, so appreciate your comment.","If you look at us, I think we're in a great position, there's really only one more major pipeline to come on and that's Rover, and Rover should be on sometime in the third quarter. So when you look at infrastructure concerns for Range, they should be behind us. And in fact, if you look into 2019, we should be in a significantly enhanced and better positioned than we have been in that we won't be waiting on pipeline projects or expecting pipeline projects, our acreage will be predominantly held, so we'll have really that much more flexibility as we get into 2019, and it's great having all those infrastructure projects behind us. We're now looking at realizations, we've been able to increase our expectation for what our NGL barrel will be to the top end of the Range, our gas differentials are coming in, its almost NYMEX pricing, we're getting condensate for near NYMEX pricing, so it's great to be in that position where a lot of those infrastructure constraints are behind us and then we get a high quality inventory with the optionality of being able to drill the liquids rich part as NGL prices are, like I said, levels we haven't seen since 2014 coupled with a really high quality gas acreage.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jeff, thanks for the very true answers. Guys, congrats again. Thank you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Hello, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I wanted to start with regards to the lateral length here. When you talk about the upside to lateral length relative to your five-year guidance, A, can you give us a sense of the, where you're thinking about lateral length on average in 2019 and 2020? And B, more philosophically, if you decide to deploy longer laterals, it seems like that's the direction you're heading, would you look to exceed your five-year growth forecast based on drilling the same number of wells or meet that forecast drilling fewer wells and potentially spending less capital?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, let me answer the second question first, and flip it back to Dennis for more detailed insight into lateral lengths. But I think what it says is, we have a lot of upside. So in terms of going forward into the five-year plan, we'll have a lot of optionality. To the extent we drill longer laterals and my full expectation is that we will, our growth should be more capital efficient. And again, our goal, our number one goal is to delever and get leverage down and drive that, so more capital efficient growth will enable us to do that. So our plans are to spend within cash flow obviously if we have better capital efficiency we can get good growth for less dollars or help us delever faster. But let me turn it over to Dennis for some granular comments.","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, good morning, Brian. We're really excited about the advancement that the operating team has made on our lateral lengths and we continue to see that advance, if you think about it just 12 months ago, we were announcing that we had drilled our first successful 15,000 foot laterals, had those completed and turned in-line. And in the last quarter, we made the announcement that we had drilled our next two longest, one at 17,800 feet and the other one at 18,100 feet. Both of those wells are in the process right now of being completed, and we hope to have the results of those to announce at our next call. So should be exciting for the organization. But as we look forward, our five-year outlook is really been a conservative approach to more 10,000 foot lateral type vision, but we know that as we continue to see us drill longer laterals, we're going to continue to advance that ball further and basically drill long laterals, because it makes a lot of sense from a dollars-per-foot basis as we develop the mineral and extract it here. So you'll see movement along the way, we're going to try and put longer laterals in as much as we can, it's just an efficient, more efficient operation for us.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And my follow-up goes back to the deleveraging points from earlier here. Can you provide any details on corporate structures that you may be or the structures of the asset sales that you may be considering beyond a straight sale? And then post asset sale, if the balance sheet and the leverage gets down to 3 times, how would you expect future deleveraging to be accomplished? How much of that would you depend on EBITDA growth versus how much would you depend on operating free cash flow?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, Brian. This is Mark. I'll try to answer those questions. I guess, first of all, in terms of the structures we would consider, we're not going into a great deal of detail on that just yet. I think what's most important perhaps is to say what we won't do, and that is do anything that would impair the efficiencies and the blocked up cost-efficient nature of our Southwest Pennsylvania position. So we certainly believe that 0.5 million acre footprint presents a very long-term drilling inventory, presents value opportunities that we can pull forward, and other ways to perhaps monetize a piece of it and accelerate that deleveraging profile. As it relates to your second quarter on what is the pace, effectively what's the pace of our deleveraging, how does that look? For the five-year outlook, as we've talked about before is a scenario, a plan at strip pricing. We can achieve our leverage targets through free cash flow. Ultimately our decisions will be driven by what the best returns are for invested capital, what we believe will maximize shareholder returns. So as we achieve our near-term objective of getting below three times, growth will be driven by cash flow. And our deleveraging becomes over that five-year outlook, of course, is a function of price, pace of drilling and so forth. So we will, really beginning in 2019, have tremendous flexibility on what the pace of drilling looks like, given that we have no further firm transportation or infrastructure commitment. So that's a good line of sight to achieving our long-term objective of below two times leverage.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And when you say the growth will be driven by cash flow, is that based on a free cash flow objective or spending within cash flow?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Yes. Generating free cash flow.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. It's a question I think you highlighted, Dennis, having about $7 million of savings by over the rest of the year by drilling off existing pads. Can you talk about any, in addition to the cost efficiencies you referenced, any thoughts about potential uplift from productivity as you go back into pre-existing pads and moving to a full development stage on those?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. Good question, Ron. I think as we look back over just the results that we looked back for the past 12 months, those are great examples. Now clearly, not all of those have been moved back or scenarios where we moved back onto pads with existing production. But one of them was definitely right in the heart of prior development, and one was adjacent to a prior pad site. And we're above the normalized type curve by 35% in one of those scenarios, and I think it was 13% to 14% on the other two. So the team has really demonstrated a strong ability to continue to, whether it's big data tools or just ongoing technical evaluation, to build upon the well results that we see year-over-year. You harvest that along with the $7 million in savings just by being able to move back in, and that's just the capital savings. That doesn't include savings associated with keeping the system full and our gathering and transportation going down. It really translates into significant value back to all of us.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","And do you, just to follow-up on that, the productivity uplift kind of that 15% to 35% that \u2013 on the pads that you mentioned on the call, what do you think is driving that? Is that just more effective development as you complete more wells on a pad at one time? Or is it improved lateral targeting versus when you drilled those \u2013 the initial laterals or something different?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, I think a lot of it goes back to the work of the folks there in Southpoint, on their ability to do the technical work in the background. So, yes, on the landing target. Even though we're at 1,000 producing wells today in the Marcellus, we're continuing to refine the approach on an ongoing basis. We continue to harvest data. We continue to look at ways that we can improve well results. Landing targets is just one of those. And the other is completion design. So we continue to tweak that approach as we move back into areas and we have greater learnings. Again, I'm going to reiterate this, when you have 1,000 wells, you have the benefit of a lot of data and the ability to improve upon your results year-over-year.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great. And then one last one maybe for Mark on the divestitures. Have you sold anything yet this year to at least start that deleveraging process?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, Ron. So just after the quarter we did close on the MidCon asset sale. Proceeds at around $23 million, it was about 11 million mcfe a day equivalent production. So a modest asset sale, but that's the first step. We have active processes underway on more meaningful, larger, potential divestitures, and as we've said we have good confidence that we'll be able to get good announcements, a good deal completed by the end of this year.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","An announcement versus closing, it doesn't really matter from your standpoint? Or does it, in terms of achieving that by December 31, or if it was a selling process?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Well, the announcement would just be made when there is a contractual arrangement, an obligation to disclose and high confidence in closing a deal. And as I said, these discussions are ongoing and progressing. So we will announce it, and we are eager to announce it as soon as we're able.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. So are we. Thank you.","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I had a question on the lateral length. If I think of the cost of a horizontal well, there's the fixed component of that surface location, and the vertical to get you down to target. And then there's that variable component as you go further and further out. Can you give a rough split on, say, a 10,000 foot well of those two buckets? And that way we could back into the capital gains as you go longer and longer?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Well, I think that's a \u2013 maybe rather than try and break it down in that granularity, we just continue to see that if you look at the cost of \u2013 well, there's a lot that goes into it, I'll just say it this way. It can be varied on number of wells on the pad site, it can vary by where in the field we're going to drill that specific well sequence, whether its dry, wet, or super rich, and also the efficiencies we see by area, clearly not all Marcellus drills the same. So that's probably less easy to breakdown into percentage basis. But again, as we look over the, let's just even say the six months of this year, we've seen our efficiencies continue to improve on the vertical section that you're pointing to, in addition to the horizontal section. So clearly the top whole section is the cheaper of the equation, but yeah, we just continue to see on our cost per foot basis we're decreasing on both sections of the whole.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","If I try to get at in a different way, if I contrast the cost per 1,000 foot of one of your dry wells against the super-rich, that number is sort of 650,000 versus 800,000. Should I take that incremental and say that's mostly completion intensity? Or is that jewelry to handle the multiphase flow?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Well, from an equipment and hardware standpoint, really from the surface down, there really isn't a lot of variability as we move across the field. You'll see no doubt some differences in the surface facility configuration, whether it's dehydration equipment or maybe something in the wet gas area where, now you're dealing with more processable gas. But yeah, as you look at \u2013 as you move across the field, the drilling portion is about a third of the cost, compared to the completion side which is more around two-thirds of cost.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Appreciate the insights.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Holly Stewart with Scotia Howard Weil.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe the first for either Jeff or Dennis, as you reiterated your 2018 production target of 11%. Can you remind us if you've talked about an exit rate for 2018? And then, maybe some thoughts around how that would position your production expectations for 2019?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Well, at this point, Holly, we haven't talked about an exit rate for the year. We continue to remain focused on the 11% target. We've got a real clear line of sight on that as we look at both Q3 and Q4. Q4 is going to be an exciting quarter for us as we look at some new infrastructure that's going to come into service, we referenced it earlier in the call with the Harmon Creek processing plant, there's some compression that also comes into play that supports that. So we're excited about some long laterals that are going to feed that ability to produce from the field there and fill our fourth quarter volumes and our growth profile 11%.","2019, I think it's early in the game plan for us to talk about 2019, but what we do know is that we're entering the phase of evaluating what kind of growth profile, and as Mark referenced, what that looks like within cash flow and then also factoring in North Louisiana results as well.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe, Dennis for you, just another one for you on \u2013 it looks like in your deck you've kind of list the well cost pretty consistent. Is there anything you're seeing right now on the service side?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, good question. We continue to see what I would call is some very one-off small moves in price, but because of initiatives like we reference on moving back to pads with existing production, we've really not only been able to stave any increases off, but the efficiencies along with it have been able to help us keep our cost flat and in some cases we're still seeing cost reductions across the board when you look at our D&C cost. But we have seen some small changes, they tend to be more like maybe a small increase in fuel or something very one-off in niche and nature versus the across-the-board service pressures that we may have seen in the past.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And maybe just my last one for Mark, you're pretty heavily hedged on both the nat gas and crude side. Is there any kind of magnitude of free cash flow generation I guess ex-asset sales that you can throw out there for 2018?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","No, I think for 2018, as I said, we are targeting a capital program within cash flow, we are well hedged to your point, and we'll continue to follow that on a go-forward basis. You will see good reduction in borrowings under revolver based on our expectations at current prices, so I think following the trend of our targets of getting below 3 times in the near-term is the objective and accelerating that with asset sales to get closer to the long-term target of 2 times. We haven't provided an annual cash flow number, so I'm hesitant to throw out a specific free cash flow number. But just on a trend basis, where our pricing is, I think you can extrapolate some guidance there on what the leverage looks like in achieving our near-term targets.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Understood. Thanks, guys.","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sameer Panjwani with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey guys. Good morning.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","On Terryville, you highlighted in the prepared remarks, you guys were seeing some faster cycle times and some lower operating costs, are you guys changing anything down-hole as you try to increase the competitiveness of that asset?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Well, yeah. Good question. I would think the majority of the team's efforts has really just been a refinement over what we've learned over the past really 12 to 24 months, through drilling across the core of Terryville. So there's not a one initiative that we would point to other than just continual improvement whether it's bit design or basically well plan (48:11) and targeting. We've talked about in prior calls, well placement being critical not only to well results but also its translating into our operational efficiencies as well. So, the team there in Houston continues to do a good job and also in Arcadia.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then I know this may be tough to quantify, but how should we think about the upside, or I guess downside to maintenance CapEx? Based on the capital efficiencies that you're capturing via longer laterals and other opportunities? It sounded like the numbers in your plan were fairly conservative.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, I mean, don't know that like you cited, we haven't quantified it yet to put it out to the market. But clearly, that five-year outlook \u2013 we tried to put together something we could meet or beat so we made what we think are reasonable to conservative assumptions really across the board. And lateral lengths, we put in at 10,000 feet, not that that's our expectation, but that \u2013 clearly we've been able to achieve that and do that. What you've seen for the last several years is lateral lengths continue to migrate longer. Dennis said, we've actually stepped out with some really long laterals. So our expectation is that \u2013 lateral lengths will increase with time, therefore capital efficiency will get better with time, which should affect maintenance capital in a positive way.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, last one for me. In one of your responses to an earlier question, you highlighted having flexibility in 2019 and beyond in terms of using free cash flow to either get faster EBITDA growth or to accelerate debt pay-down both in terms of trying to rightsize the leverage on your balance sheet. So how should we think about the factors that kind of go into that decision of either growing faster or paying debt down faster?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","So I think the driving factors nearer term are to achieving the leverage targets, as measured by debt-to-EBITDAX, so getting below three times and then longer term achieving something closer to two times. As we make the decision on appropriate reinvestment rates and what the resulting growth rates are over that five-year outlook, really, it's going to be driving factors behind shareholder returns. So we will look at rates of returns on wells, what then current prices are. We'll look at what optimization of the existing gathering system and long haul transport are. And we'll look at, quite frankly, what forms of returning capital to shareholders may make the most sense at that point in time. What are share prices? What are dividends at that point? What is free cash flow? And what growth rates are being driven. So as you put all of those variables together, that will drive the overall size of the capital program and production. So it will be kind of a continuous balancing equation, if you will, of those various factors over time.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","So you'd be willing to go slower than what your five-year plan would imply, depending on if you had better uses for that free cash flow then to invest it in terms of potentially putting it on the balance sheet earlier?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Yes. For example, if you can drive better cash flow per share by slowing down and deploying that cash flow in some other form or fashion, we would certainly consider that.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks. Thanks for squeezing me in here. In last night's release you spoke about a tailwind for capital efficiencies. How lasting are those gains in capital efficiency? What is the number for capital efficiency today based on your internal calc? And how is that expected to improve over time?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. I'll answer that, Dan. I think when you look at year-over-year through the history of the program, we continue to see some advancement on a capital efficiency basis. And I think we even sometimes surprise ourselves with the level that we've been able to achieve that with the \u2013 at the operating team and divisional level. What does that number look like as we project forward? Again, when you look at the five-year outlook, we've really taken a very conservative approach to what our capital efficiencies would look like. But there's every reason to believe we'll continue to see the advancements that we've \u2013 as an example, been able to harvest in 2018. When you look at the 17,000 foot, 18,000 foot laterals, as an example, we have every reason to believe that we can drill longer than that. And we also know that to be successful we've got to be repeatable. And all of that translates into, again, a $1 per foot drill and complete cost that's more efficient.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","I think a couple other things to think about when considering Range that's not top of mind is, really, we have a really low decline rate. So when you look at our corporate decline rate into 2019, we're projecting that to be below 20%, 19% or so corporate decline \u2013 which even for an Appalachian gas producer I think is really a strong number \u2013 let alone for an oil producer. And then when you look at all-in on a recycle ratio, I think we have one of the best recycle ratios in the business, regardless of basin or regardless of being an oil or gas producer.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. I appreciate it. As a follow-up to a previous question on the asset sales and appreciating that you can only say so much, but I'll give it a shot just the same. Who is in the market today to buy gas assets? That is, who are the likely buyers for the Northeast PA package? Or anything that's peeled off from Southwest PA? Just asking in an effort to better handicap the likelihood you can do what you say and need to do, and that's (54:00) sell assets where proceeds go to balance sheet.","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Hi Subash, this is Mark. There's different pools with capital...","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Dan.","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Sorry, Dan. There are different pools of capital that are out there looking at different assets. You've got international buyers. You have your adjacent producers, strategics. You also have quite a few PE-backed companies, both existing and new teams with commitments looking to deploy and acquire their initial start-up assets. So the dialogs that we are having and have had in various divestiture processes over the last 18 months have been quite thorough with those different pools of capital on the various assets. So you're not dependent on one particular market. You have options and discussions with varied parties.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","And I think the quality of the asset is a key thing. And then I'll just circle back to the high-level thing. And I think different people have hinted at for the reasons you all understand, that's all we can say at this point. But like Mark said, we look forward to sharing more when we're able to do so.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Appreciate that. And then just lastly here, just quickly. Has the Cotton Valley asset been fully scrubbed at this point? That is, what's the risk of the 150,000 net acres that remains going lower, being written down even further, asset changes and prices?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","We've looked at that pretty hard. So I think we're confident that at year-end the number will be plus or minus the 150,000 acres that Mark said.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great, appreciate the questions, or rather the answers, and have a great day a day.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, Dan.","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Subash Chandra with Guggenheim for our final question.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. First question is, is there a will or an ability to change your product mix at all, with any magnitude in 2019 by shifting rigs to the condensate window or the more liquids rich window?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, good question. We always provide a, well, say a level of optionality at the planning level for us to be able to move really across the three areas that we have in Southwest Pennsylvania. At this point you're going to see a pretty balanced mix, clearly, but we always do provide some optionality, and clearly moving back into pad size allows us to react quickly, maybe a little bit more so than when you have the start with grassroots well sequence. But again, as we start to look at the 2019 plan, our vision going forward back to Mark's comments around looking at how our plan would be tied to cash flow, we absolutely can have some flexibility, just like we demonstrated in prior years to increase with some degree of reasonableness our ability to drill in the liquids rich area.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","And I'd just like to pile in a little bit on the answering and go back to some of my initial comments in my prepared remarks that I think a lot of people just think Appalachia is a gas play, the Marcellus is a gas play. But it's important when you consider the liquids, the differentiated position Appalachia has in basin fractionation, control of purity products, access to international markets, that doesn't exist in any other U.S. liquid plays. And then to take it a step further, that Range has a dominant position in the NGL part of the Marcellus. We have the optionality of wet or dry, therefore that's an advantage and again, we're one of the largest top three NGL producers in the country.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Right, got it. The next question is this \u2013 the revised guidance for gas diffs, NGL diffs and GP&T costs. Does that fully reflect normal operations, Rover normal operations, Mariner East, and Leach, et cetera or is this sort of an intermediate step and then as things fall into place later in 3Q should we expect another revision?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Hi, this is Mark. I would say this is probably transitional. You will see hopefully Rover come online perhaps late in the next quarter, but first full quarter would be Q4 based on that expected timing. So I think once you have our entire portfolio of long-haul firm transport on you might expect potential further improvement.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","But I guess improvement on the commodity realization and some offset on the GP&T side once Rover comes on?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Yes, exactly. So as we've talked about a little bit before, on the GP&T side, it will peak in the quarter, the first full quarter after Rover comes online. So you'll see it tick up a little bit, our guidance for the third quarter is $1.38 to $1.42 or so. It might peak call it mid $1.40 range in the quarter after Rover comes online, keeping in mind that it's offset by better realizations, and also keep in mind that some of that trend is impacted by processing fees and some percent of proceeds expenses associated with the NGLs which likewise are receiving better prices, so that's offsetting that increased expense.","Over the longer haul, like we've laid out in the five-year outlook, fully utilizing the existing system and further growth anticipated to be sold in basin incurring no additional transport, we believe that, call it at least $0.25 improvement in gathering, processing, and transport is achievable.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Right, got it. Okay. And final one for me, do you think maintenance cap will change very much pro forma for asset sales?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, I mean, we haven't given any, we can't. And we haven't given any specific guidance to asset sales. But again, I think when you look at our low decline rate, strong recycle ratio, all that type of thing, I think maintenance capital is going to be amongst the best-in-class out there","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Top of the hour. Thanks, guys.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Laith Sando, Vice President, Investor Relations at Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.","Well, thank you, operator, good morning everyone and thank you for joining Range's third quarter earnings call. The speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Degner, SVP of Operations; and Mark Scucchi, Chief Financial Officer.","Hopefully, you've had a chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we've posted on our website. We also filed our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the Investors tab where you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. Please note that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. For additional information, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of EBITDAX, cash margins and other non-GAAP measures.","Lastly, as a bit of housekeeping, I'd like to point out that starting in 2019, Range plans to release hedging gains and losses ahead of each earnings report a filed 8-K. We believe this will help reduce variability in estimates and assist in the calculation of realized prices each quarter.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks, Laith, and thanks everyone for joining us on this morning's call. Range made steady progress in the third quarter on the strategic goals and five-year outlook we provided at the start of 2018. We hit our production targets within budget, we generated free cash and we accelerated our balance sheet improvement with the recently-announced sale of a 1% override in Washington County for $300 million.","Looking at the third quarter results, the team continued to build on the operational and financial success we saw in the first half of the year. Our cash flow increased 27% over the prior year. This was driven by improved pricing and consistent operational execution.","As one of the largest NGL producers in the U.S., with direct exposure to international markets, Range was well positioned to capitalize on improved NGL pricing fundamentals. You might recall that last quarter we increased our full year guide for NGL realizations. With our unique advantage as an NGL producer with direct access to multiple markets, we again increased our pricing guidance and expect fourth quarter realizations to be approximately 40% of WTI.","In the third quarter, 47% of Range's pre-hedge revenue came from liquids, the majority of which was from our Appalachian NGL production. Appalachia is in a differentiated position in the U.S. as it relates to NGLs with in-basin fractionization (sic) [fractionation] (03:14), control of purity products and producer access to international markets. This type of market does not exist in any other major U.S. liquids play as other basins typically send a Y-grade, or unfractionated, barrel to the Gulf Coast with no control over where it's marketed.","Last quarter, we mentioned that we thought the benefits of the Appalachian NGL model would become evident over the next year or so. We think that Range's third quarter pricing strength and our pricing guidance for the fourth quarter highlights that differentiation. Range's natural gas differentials also improved versus expectations during the third quarter as Rover capacity came on in September, transporting Range's gas to the Gulf Coast and Midwest markets. Range has also seen significant, improved in-basin pricing compared to last year as the Appalachian gas market is benefiting from new pipeline capacity additions in both northeast and southwest Pennsylvania.","As a result, Range expects our natural gas differential to improve to $0.12 per mcf less than NYMEX in the fourth quarter. This improves our full year guidance to NYMEX less $0.08. Over the next couple of years, we expect basis to remain strong in southwest Pennsylvania as additional pipelines are placed into service that will keep that portion of the basin free-flowing in the other markets. Pricing in northeast PA will depend on growth profiles of the various producers. However, near-term basis has recently improved in that area to levels not seen since 2013.","Operationally, the team continues to push for efficiencies, setting records on drilling longer laterals and turning in line high-quality Marcellus wells. In fact, southwest Pennsylvania's third quarter production was approximately 29% higher when compared to this time last year. I believe the significant growth out of southwest Marcellus while living within cash flow demonstrates what our core assets are capable of which provides us great confidence in our long-range plans.","Turning to the five-year outlook, I think it's important to reiterate that one of our key strategic objectives was improving our leverage profile. We believe that prudently lowering leverage is a key step in what we think is a compelling five-year plan that delivers a competitive free cash flow yield with an expected $1 billion in free cash over the next four years.","We're pleased that with the announced overriding royalty sales and corresponding debt reduction, combined with improved liquids pricing, and consistent operational execution, is expected to bring Range's leverage below three times by year-end 2018, approximately two years ahead of schedule. This places Range in a great position to execute on our long-term plans of consistent growth in cash flow per share. Range is actively pursuing additional asset sales as a way to accelerate our path towards further balance sheet improvement and the return of capital to shareholders.","Looking at the base case five-year outlook, we anticipate expanding margins through our lower cost structure as Range leverages its high-quality inventory and existing infrastructure. These unit costs improvements are led by reductions to our GP&T costs to increase utilization of existing transportation, gathering and processing capacity. We also expect a meaningful reduction to interest expense per mcfe as we increase cash flow and reduce debt bolstered by asset sales like we recently announced.","At the same time, G&A per mcfe should improve as we become more efficient and leverage our existing personnel. Combined, we see these cost reductions equating to enhanced margins over the five-year outlook. Third quarter cash unit costs improvements for G&A and LOE were evidence of this trend. As we fill our Rover capacity. The last of the natural gas firm transportation agreements will begin to see improvements in margins on our Marcellus natural gas sales as well.","We believe this anticipated improvement in margins coupled with Range's low decline rate and correspondingly low maintenance capital positions us to generate sustainable free cash flow. And given our vast inventory of high-quality Marcellus locations, we believe we're in a unique position to not only deliver on a plan of free cash flow and growth, but to continue this beyond the five-year outlook into a market that will see others exhausting core inventories.","In fact, I believe that Range has the best natural gas assets in North America when you consider five important factors and that's quality, quantity, infrastructure, liquids optionality and stacked pay. As I said on the last call, the entire Range team from the field to management to the board is focused on translating our incredible inventory into shareholder value.","I'll now turn the call over to Dennis to discuss operations.","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. The third quarter was successful operationally with capital spending on track and production coming in better than expected. Third quarter capital spending of $205 million and year-to-date capital of $725 million, puts us comfortably on track versus the 2018 budget of $941 million. Production for the third quarter came in at 2.27 Bcf equivalent per day, or about 50 million Bcf equivalent per day better than planned as a result of exceptional well performance and increased ethane recovery.","Looking first at ethane, our marketing team is always looking to maximize Range's cash flow by selling ethane barrels for more than we would otherwise receive by selling ethane in the gas stream. In the third quarter, we clearly saw improved NGL pricing across all products, and in particular, we saw ethane prices improve substantially in September. The marketing team did a great job selling additional ethane barrels above our contracted capacity during that quarter. This allowed Range to increase quarterly cash flow and recover approximately 15% more ethane than we did in the first half of 2018.","Looking forward with ethane prices now at levels that incentivize most producers to extract additional barrels, there are limited opportunities to increase ethane production above firm capacity and existing sales arrangements. However, the Range team will be persistent and looking for those opportunities on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. And with a history of consistently moving over 60,000 barrels per day with direct access to three ethane outlets in Appalachia, along with having an in-house marketing team with relationships in the U.S. and abroad, we see Range being positioned very well to benefit from improved NGL pricing in the U.S. and the international markets.","Next on the list, we also continue to see positive well performance from recent wells, which drove incremental production for the quarter. One example is in the Appalachia dry gas area where we turned to sales six new wells on an existing pad with an average lateral length of over 12,300 feet. The average IP of these wells was 29.6 million cubic feet per day resulting in yet another 100 million cubic feet per day pad. On top of that, we also observed continued strong performance from our 28 dry gas wells turned to sales in the previous quarter, which we touched on during our prior earnings call.","I also want to point out we are seeing very early and exciting production results from the eight super-rich wells turned to sales during the quarter. For example, on one of our existing pads, we recently added five new wells with an average lateral length of approximately 12,800 feet. The average IP for these wells came in at 37.9 million cubic feet per day equivalent, which included an average condensate production of over 1,000 barrels a day per well.","In fact, at one point, the total combined condensate production from the pad peaked at 3,000 barrels per day, plus two of these wells alone with an average completed lateral length of a little over 18,000 feet were flowing at a combined volume of more than 2,450 barrels of condensate per day. These were the two longest laterals drilled and completed by our Appalachia team that we discussed earlier this year with production results coming together in Q3.","As we enter the fourth quarter, we are scheduled to initiate sales on 22 wells taking our turn in line total for 2018 to 92 wells. This is slightly lower than the 100 wells expected earlier this year. However, when looking at the completed lateral footage we plan to turn to sales in 2018, we will be within 2% of the original plan, all due to extending lateral lengths.","Fourth quarter wells will be focused in our wet acreage near the upcoming Harmon Creek processing plant, which is on schedule to be commissioned this quarter. This will help us fill our firm capacity into the Rover pipeline which was put into service on September 1. As discussed on prior calls, Range has capacity on Rover of 400,000 a day and we're currently on track to fill this by year-end.","Turning our attention to North Louisiana, we had one rig operating in the third quarter with sales initiated on two wells. We will continue drilling with this one rig for the fourth quarter as we evaluate well performance from the 2018 program. With the overall plan clearly outlined, we will set production guidance for the fourth quarter at 2.255 Bcf equivalent per day to 2.265 Bcf equivalent per day putting us on track for approximately 11% year-over-year growth. And as I mentioned earlier, our capital budget of $941 million remains on track.","Now, let's shift to a topic that gets a lot of attention these days and that's lateral length. We are really proud of the team's work in this area and we think it's important to understand that the story here is about more than drilling longer laterals. It's also about overall program economics. When you break down the value of drilling long laterals, there are three areas to consider: development efficiency; well performance; and capital efficiency. These are three key boxes we're checking for both improved well and program economics.","First, let's look at development efficiency and sustainability considerations. Simply put, this is our ability to maximize access to the reservoir with a single wellbore, allowing us to develop more acreage and resource from a much smaller footprint. This is important for Range and for the communities where we operate for what I think are obvious but often underappreciated reasons.","Horizontal wells and now longer laterals allow for more efficient development of acreage that otherwise may have been challenging due to several possible factors, including existing or planned surface activities, difficult terrain or environmentally sensitive or special use areas. With all that in mind, the takeaway is simple as it relates to developing our full acreage position. Longer laterals allow for more efficient development with a much smaller footprint. And again, this is an important strategy for both Range and the communities where we operate.","Second, there's well performance. It's still early in the game when it comes to evaluating low productivity for long laterals. But when comparing their performance to our more than 1,000 wells in the Marcellus, the production from our longer lateral lengths is consistent with our expected type curves for each area. And at this point, after careful routine performance analysis by our technical team and comparisons to the corresponding type curve, we have not seen an impact to normalize production associated with lateral length. That's after more than doubling our average lateral length over the past four years. So as we continue to evaluate our program well results, none of our reviews have indicated any adverse impact of lateral length to well performance.","Lastly, let's look at capital efficiency. Longer laterals can significantly reduce and even eliminate a number of costs in areas such as well pad and road construction, top-hole drilling, drilling and completion mobilizations, surface facilities and reduce cycle times. For example, based on our current numbers, one pad with four 18,000-foot laterals can be drilled and completed with up to a 20% reduction in total capital expenditure compared to two pads with four 9,000-foot laterals covering the same acreage position.","Our industry is constantly evolving. Innovation and advances in horizontal drilling efficiencies over the past several years have driven an increase in the footage that we can drill in a single day. We are now at the point where the time to drill an additional 5,000 to 10,000 feet of lateral length may only be a couple of days requiring minimal incremental capital to being spent. And the wells we are drilling with laterals longer than 15,000 feet have shown as much as a 30% reduction in a lateral drilling cost per foot.","Our ultimate measure of success is economic performance. And our analysis consistently indicates that wells with longer laterals provide better returns. These higher returns directly translate into greater value for our shareholders. Given Range's asset quality and technical team, we believe drilling long laterals gives Range a competitive advantage as we move forward.","I'll share a few more notes before we head over to Mark. While our plans for 2019 are far from being finalized, we are in the process of identifying growth opportunities, milestones and projects that keep us in line with the objectives described in our five-year outlook. As we look toward the coming year, we expect to continue our practice of drilling longer laterals to generate improved returns and value. Similar to 2018 and prior years, we plan to drill wells on pads with existing production when possible, as that allows us to take advantage of reduced cycle times and existing infrastructure.","Also with the Harmon Creek plant on schedule for service before the end of this year, we are anticipating a full year of incremental processing capacity for 2019. This will be further supported by additional compression that will be added to our southwest PA program through the second half of 2019.","The additional processing and compression capacity complements our plans for shifting towards more liquids-focused drilling in 2019, which takes advantage of improved NGL fundamentals and Range's differentiated access to NGL markets. We expect that next year's well mix of wet and super-rich wells could increase to as much as 75% of our Marcellus well count, up from 60% in 2018 and the highest percentage in recent years.","And I'll close out with this. As we enter the last quarter of the year, we are on track to deliver on our cash flow, leverage capital and production targets as we drill and produce our most cost-effective and operationally efficient wells.","Now, I'll turn it over to Mark, so he can discuss the financials. Mark?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, Dennis. Business was well executed during the third quarter, accomplishing planned objectives while taking advantage of market opportunities. Third quarter activity continues to demonstrate Range's efficient operations and quality inventory, the combination yielding competitive and improving financial results. We've also made progress on strategic objectives, completing an asset monetization at an attractive price, realizing the value of a modest portion of inventory and strengthening our financial position. As Dennis described, our operating activity remains in line with the 2018 plan and importantly is delivering on budget.","Range generated free cash flow during the third quarter, fully funding the capital program while reducing borrowings. Analyst cash flow for the quarter improved 27% to $260 million. Cash flow improvement was driven by production growth of 14% and higher margins per unit of production, up 13%. Cash margins continued to benefit from improving realized prices for natural gas and NGLs as well as efficiency on the costs side. Average realized price per mcfe, pre-hedge, net of transportation costs, improved 20% or $0.34 per mcfe year-over-year.","Direct operating and corporate cash costs improved, declining a total of 16% or $0.10 per mcfe. As we've mentioned historically, gathering, processing and transportation as a standalone line item will vary over time as new infrastructure comes online, such as Rover late in Q3, and will also vary with NGL prices given a portion of processing costs are paid as a percent of proceeds. In other words, higher prices received result in higher processing cost, but better margins. However over time, the unit costs will trend down with full utilization of infrastructure and for balancing future opportunities for in-basin versus out-of-basin sales.","As you will recall from prior quarters, new accounting guidance changed the presentation of certain gathering, processing and transportation expense starting in 2018. The net impact of this change is neutral to margins with offsetting increases to revenue and to GP&T expense of $0.23 per mcfe during the third quarter. Adjusting this item for comparability, third quarter GP&T was $1.23 per mcfe. Year-over-year change is attributable to new capacity and higher NGL volumes and prices.","Turning to the balance sheet, leverage as measured by debt-to-EBITDAX is down quarter-over-quarter and reduced nearly half a turn from year end 2017. With planned capital expenditures in line with the annual budget of $941 million, we expect to continue generating free cash flow for the remainder of the year, which will further reduce borrowings.","Just after quarter end, we announced the sale of a royalty interest for gross proceeds of $300 million, which further reduced bank borrowings and improved leverage, putting us on an expected path to leverage below three times at year-end 2018. As discussed previously, there were multiple asset packages being marketed and certain discussions are ongoing. We remain focused on enhancing Range's financial position and driving leverage below two times.","While we can't comment on timing to accelerate deleveraging beyond the impact of organic free cash flow, we continue to evaluate divestiture options based on asset valuation and what we believe will drive the greatest long-term shareholder value. We will continue to employ a rigorous and thoughtful capital allocation process with spending defined by cash flow generation. Once Range achieves leverage below 2.5 times, we will be in a position to evaluate the relative investment returns from drilling, repurchasing shares and\/or increasing the dividend. This will all be considered in the context of driving consistent competitive shareholder value from a solid financial foundation.","Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Operator, with that, we'd be happy to answer questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Ventura. The first question is from Bob Morris of Citi.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Dennis, I just \u2013 on the processing capacity, as you bring on Harmon Creek and other capacity you said be at full capacity for processing next year, I know right now the fractionation capacity in the region is tight and right now I think you have the capability if you had the outlet to extract another 800 barrels per day or 1,000 barrels per day of ethane. But as you look to 2019, what is the ability or the infrastructure there to continue to extract more ethane as you move up to 75% of your wells being in liquids areas?","Or are you going to be constrained in any incremental or additional ethane extraction in 2019? I know in the meantime you can go ahead and rail the butanes and propane to market but as far as ethane, will you have the ability to extract incremental ethane next year?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. Great question, Bob. We've got our VP of NGLs Marketing here with us, Alan Engberg and I'm going to pass the torch to him and let him tackle multiple topics there.","Alan Engberg - Range Resources Corporation","Hey, good morning, Bob.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","This is Alan. Yeah, couple of different questions in there. I'll try to get them, if I miss one, just let me know. But with Harmon Creek, we will actually be bringing up a 20-a-day de-eth at that facility.","So, as far as I think one of your questions relating to the ability to extract ethane with the new gas plant. There won't be any issues there. Relative to overall fractionation capacity in the basin, as far as Range is concerned we're actually in a very strong position that way.","And in fact our friends at MarkWest are bringing up a new 60-a-day frac at Hopedale. I think it's planned for the month of November. So we'll be in a good position through 2019.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, that's helpful. Dennis, the second question is just on the well outperformance, apart from extracting more ethane you mentioned in the dry gas areas you're continuing to see a better performance on a per lateral foot basis. What is driving that, because I don't recall that you've changed your completion design as far as number of frac stages or proppant loading, so what is sort of driving that continued outperformance or improvement in performance on the wells in the dry gas area?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Well, we've seen a couple of changes across the board and I would say the playbook is real similar that we deploy whether it's wet, dry or super rich. And it's a great technical work by our geology team looking at how we can improve our landing in the respective areas of analysis and by our reservoir group who also look at what's driving well performance and there has been fluctuations in sand loading. So, though we don't always comment on how we're tweaking, testing or changing the recipe for how we complete wells, there's always stuff going on in the background that we're looking at to try and improve the well results. So I would say it was a combination of those respective items.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you and nice quarter.","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Holly Stewart of Scotia Howard Weil.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe just a couple of questions on the NGL side, the realizations obviously looked very good for the quarter and it looks like you're anticipating another strong fourth quarter. Would be interested I guess in just hearing your thoughts on the market overall and maybe this is even directed at Alan but in general we've seen some product weakness in the last couple of weeks. So is that factored into your thoughts around 4Q? And then maybe what are some of the pricing drivers here going forward?","Alan Engberg - Range Resources Corporation","Thanks, Holly. Yeah, it's definitely some volatility that has returned to the market. No question about it. Actually prices as you saw during the third quarter went up very quickly. So with respect to ethane that pretty much trades on its own outside of crude oil, but it was on a tear and the rest of the NGL barrel with crude continued to do well. And then based on tightening fundamentals across the NGL barrel we actually saw some nice prices.","You could argue prices almost for ethane in particular during the third quarter almost went up too much too fast. We were due for a correction. We got that correction in spades. I would argue that's almost come down too much too fast. But nevertheless, the overall fundamentals haven't changed. And the fact of the matter is that we've got a lot of new demand coming on. In fact at the end of this year, we've got a brand-new steam cracker coming on that will be roughly 90,000 barrels-a-day of ethane demand.","And then if you look through the rest of let's say the first quarter, I think you've got roughly 280,000 barrels a day of ethane demand coming on stream. And we just don't have at this point the infrastructure to supply into that demand. So you've got pipeline tightness out of the Permian, out of the Mid-Con, that is one issue. And then the further issue of course is fractionation capacity in Mont Belvieu. And neither one of those actually debottlenecks in time to meet that demand.","So, I think the overall fundamentals will remain tight for ethane as well and it's not talked about that much, but I think also for the rest of the NGL barrel. So the stocks that we see reported by the EIA today are a combination of the product as a purity molecule, as well as the product in Y-grade. And I would say that the balance is shifting to more Y-grade going into storage than what purity products are going into storage. So that's a recipe for a stronger market that despite the volatility that we're seeing right now should translate into higher prices.","Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.","And then if I might, our guidance for the fourth quarter is simply going to be based off of strip pricing. So to the extent that we see strength like Alan is talking about that would be upside to the guidance that we provided in the fourth quarter.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","That's great. Thank you for that, Laith. And then maybe just one more, maybe this is for Mark or Laith, a little more granularity on just the cost related to the GP&T and C line item. Looks like you're forecasting an increase quarter-over-quarter sort of due to NGL pricing as well as your incremental transport. But could you just maybe talk in general terms about how this guidance is translated? So if that means some color around what percent of your processing contracts or POP versus fee? Or maybe even a breakdown of that $1.54 in cost? What part is transport? What part is gathering et cetera? That would be helpful?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning, Holly. This is Mark. Yeah, let me take a crack at that and let's take a step back and get a snapshot of where we are just as a reminder. So the reported number was $1.46 in this quarter adjusting for the accounting change we're $1.23. So for comparability the change thus far looking historically has been to additional capacity coming online and of course additional NGL volumes extracted as well as the higher NGL prices. So as we look at those factors as they apply to Q4, you're seeing a continuation to a degree of new capacity in the form of Rover being on for a full three months as opposed to just part of September, that's a good portion of it. You have continued strength on NGL prices and volumes that are being moved. So those are driving the increase quarter-over-quarter.","When you adjust for that accounting change we are peaking roughly where we said we would and it will peak on a per-unit basis to gathering, processing, transportation expense. In the first full quarter after Rover our last currently signed contract comes online. So the trend is as expected. As you look at that total number and try to break it down into its components, big picture roughly 20% of the cost on a per unit basis relates to processing and then the balance is split roughly between long-haul transport and gathering.","So as we look out further into the future, the trend line we laid out in the five-year outlook still applies. The numbers have changed obviously with accounting guidance implementation in presentation, but the $0.25 improvement we indicated in the five-year outlook still holds and is still part of our expectation. And keep in mind that those comparisons were averages, annual averages, so as you think about it from peak to trough from a quarter, perhaps next quarter, you should see at least a $0.25 per mcfe improvement if not better.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks, Holly.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ron Mills of Johnson Rice.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning. Jeff, maybe for you on the overriding royalty interest sale, how did you all arrive at a 1% override interest sale? What position do you need to be able to pull that lever? And then as it relates to that, how do you think this puts you in terms of a whether leverage or negotiating position on your additional assets sales that are planned given the liquidity you've already brought in?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Well, let me answer the second question first. That puts us in a strong position. Our short-term targets that we've talked about now for the last couple of quarters and in our incentives was to exit this year below three times. So we've been able to do that, we're on track to do that and obviously being in that position of not having to do something puts you in a better position with all other asset sales. So, puts us in a good position, organically the five-year outlook that we've laid out we pulled leverage forward two years.","The pricing in that outlook really, if you look forward, based on the comments where we are in the comments and Alan Engberg just laid out, puts us in a good position with the five-year outlook. That said, we're still actively looking at asset sales and to go back to the first part of your question, we looked at a variety of options and to look at where could we get best value and best valuation. And we think with that overriding royalty sale that we got a very strong valuation for it. We have a high net revenue interest and our wells have very strong economics. So we thought of the variety of things we're looking at to that point in time that was the right thing to do.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","And can you \u2013 especially as it relates to Northeast PA, which has been one of the assets being marketed, any color or maybe it's more on the marketing side on what the pricing has looked like since the start-up of Atlantic Sunrise, because it also seems from a timing standpoint that once that is fully up and running that the market availability of that could even improve further? Is that fair?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, I think that's a good point, Ron. With Atlantic Sunrise on, basis has come in significantly. I think recently it's literally been in the $0.33, $0.34 range and historically it's been much higher than that. So cash flow therefore is stronger as they are high-quality properties. I think when you're looking at asset sales and if you look at historically Range has sold a lot of assets. But we've said this numerous times, you really have to find the right buyer at the right time. So clearly that pipeline coming on helps.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Portillo of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff and team.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","On slide seven you highlight the potential to ramp volumes through 2022 and thereafter generate a material free cash yield that looks to be north of 30%. As you look at the forward curve for natural gas, the market concerns around supply exceeding demand over the next few years and the hyper focus on balance sheet improvement. Is there a case to be made to potentially pull forward that free cash flow inflection into 2019 and 2020 and move closer to maintenance CapEx until there's a more constructive view on the commodity on a go-forward perspective? And specifically around that just the potential to accelerate shareholder returns, buying in reserves at a relatively cheap valuation here on a go forward perspective?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","The short and simple answer to your question is yes. There is a case and a scenario where you have to evaluate that as a potential outcome. So just as a reminder to everyone and new folks to the story, the five-year outlook is just that, it's an outlook, it is directional and what the asset base is capable of under a particular scenario. It's not intended to convey our plan or our conviction on one particular path. So we continue to evaluate the economics of the drilling program to rightsize that program based on competitive and recurring, drilling opportunities.","So as we get a sense of how 2019 is going to shape up from a pricing perspective, what returns we can help secure and derisk for hedging, we also have the exposure on NGLs and how does that relate to the cash flow. So the gating item as it relates to buying back in reserves, as you put it, essentially repurchasing shares, really the gating item there is the balance sheet. So the multifactor equation, if you will, is balancing the best rates of return for investing cash flow, how much of that cash flow to reinvest that achieves balance sheet objectives while maximizing shareholder return. So longwinded answer to your question, but we're in the midst of the planning process and we look forward to delivering that plan early next year as is our typical timing.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Grigel of Macquarie.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, good morning. Just in a similar vein, as you guys move towards 2.5 times either from greater organic free cash flow or asset sales, what's the internal discussion on balancing further debt reduction versus either a repurchase of shares or increasing the dividend, how do you balance those items in terms of priority?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","So once you get to 2.5 and below, you're more in a comfortable zone provided it's sustainable with some pricing expectation hedging and so forth. So the size, timing and scale of any repurchasing or dividend increase is, it would be some combination that could start around that level. And of course your opportunity and sizing increases as you get closer to your longer-term leverage of 2 times and that's sustainable. So, no particular numbers for you there, but it's about balancing the returns. So, the other factor there, what is the stock price at that point in time? What is the incremental cash flow per share generated by repurchasing shares? What is the rate of return on purchasing shares versus drilling in other wells? So there's a quantitative analysis. There's math that has to be done when you get past those gating items.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And would it be fair, just as a follow-up on that one, would it be fair to assume that the leverage target that was in this year's incentive plan rolls over into next year, is that at a \u2013 obviously at a lower level, but would that be fair or is that too premature at this point in time to assume that?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","I think the metrics you've seen in the incentive programs, you've seen them evolve and continue to align shareholder interest with the objectives of the company. So you can expect those to continue to evolve and drive appropriate strategic objectives for the company in line with what's going to drive the greatest value for the shareholders. So you can expect to see those and see those appropriately adjusted.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And then just lastly, could you guys provide an update on the EVP search and the latest thoughts on timing on when we could see something there?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. We've engaged a search firm and the process is underway. Of course the important thing, whether it's the board additions or EVP, it's all about getting the right person, so. But the process is under way and I'll leave it at that.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kashy Harrison of Simmons (sic) [Piper Jaffray & Co.] (41:19).","Kashy Harrison - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my questions. Just one quick one for me. In the prepared remarks there was some commentary on the exhaustion of core inventory within Appalachia and I just wanted to dive a little bit deeper just into that comment and that thought process, specifically what are you looking at that makes you \u2013 that leaves you to the conclusion that the core is being exhausted? What are some of the drivers behind that? And when do you believe it becomes more apparent to the broader market that there is less core inventory in Appalachia? Is that within the next five years? Is that within years six through ten? Just some color on that line of thinking would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, I think if you go back to the discovery well for the play was in 2004, it was a Range well, began being drilled horizontally successfully correct by Range in 2007, lot of other companies have jumped in and a lot of wells have been drilled. It's now the largest gas field in North America; I believe the largest gas field in the world and consider the area. So the cores of those plays are really well known, where the better wells are and where the poorer wells are. I don't think there's any question when you look at the quality of the wells, whether you look at absolute recoveries or normalized recoveries or recoveries per thousand, however you want to look at it.","And if you look at where people have been drilling and where all the activity has been, a lot of it's been in the core. People talk about technology and technology will continue to evolve, I'm not questioning that, but you can take state-of-the-art technology and pump that in Centre County or you can pick the county of your choice and the wells still aren't very good. So in fact they aren't good at all. So it's important where you are drilling and where you are. So the acreage is leased. The cores have been snapped up by various operators. I think Range has, again, considering those five things, quality, quantity, liquids optionality, take away and stack-pay, I think we have the best position in the play.","So the cores are limited, the cores are known, people have drilled a lot of wells in them. And I think within, you said in the, is it in the first 5 or years 6 through 10, I think it's clearly within the first five you'll see that core exhaustion and you'll start seeing it with deteriorating capital efficiency.","Kashy Harrison - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Oh, very good, thanks for taking my question.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jane Trotsenko of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jane Trotsenko - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning. So we have seen several data points that the frac sand costs are falling.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Can we ask, you may be on speaker, it's hard for us to hear your questions.","Jane Trotsenko - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. We have seen several data points that frac sand costs are falling. And my question is, how are the components of the well costs trending? And if we should \u2013 and how should we think about well costs for the next year relative to 2018?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. Jane, this is Dennis. I think as we look over the course of 2018 from a service cost standpoint, we've really seen, what I would say is, some very small increases but they have tended to be very kind of line item and niche in nature.","So fuel might be an example where we've seen some movement and we've worked with our service partners to try and address some of those increases. As we talked about, usually call-in and call-out though, our efficiencies have really massed in someplace, carried our cost even lower on a per-foot and per-well basis because of the great work that our operating and technical teams are doing.","So at this point we really haven't seen a cost increase when you look at, let's just say, total cost involved to land, drill and produce our wells. For 2019, we're well in the throes of our bid process for our services for the upcoming year.","We're excited about some of the early results, we'll have more to share as we get to the next call, but at this point, I think we're seeing encouraging cost that will keep us in line with what we were expecting and seeing here in 2018.","Jane Trotsenko - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So would it be \u2013 probably I'll just say that you don't see like a major cost inflation happening in 2019, right?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Well, I think at this point again it's early, but it would be difficult I think for us to see a significant cost increase for 2019, again, based upon conversations with our service partners and early on results.","Jane Trotsenko - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Got it. My second question relates to the ethane recovery. I would like to understand a range of ethane prices that would make ethane recovery economic for Range Resources.","And if we should expect a similar amount of ethane recovery in the coming quarters and maybe we could see a pickup in ethane recovery for Range once Mariner East 2 comes online and Mariner East 1 is converted to all ethane pipeline. Any thoughts about that?","Alan Engberg - Range Resources Corporation","Yeah. This is Alan. As far as how we look at ethane recovery, typically it's pretty \u2013 in some ways it's somewhat binary. You're looking at the local gas price versus the realized price after you get the ethane to the market.","And again fortunately, Range took a long-term view a long time ago actually at what the basin had to offer and we made commitments to be able to move product domestically. So south down to Belvieu up into Canada as well as internationally. So we have basically a range of options for moving the product. We look at the overall netbacks at each of those locations as well as in-basin, and we make a decision based on that of what's going to get us the maximum returns relative to natural gas. So that's in a nutshell how we look at things.","As far as the Mariner system is concerned, as you know ME2 is poised to start up soon and it'll be carrying propane and butane as well as a C3+ Y-grade. There will eventually be more capacity on ME1 for ethane and overall I think net-net that's good for the basin and it's good for Range.","Jane Trotsenko - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And can you give us a range of ethane prices that would make ethane recovery economic for Range Resources?","Alan Engberg - Range Resources Corporation","It's all relative to where gas prices are. So I can't really...","Jane Trotsenko - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Alan Engberg - Range Resources Corporation","....give it to you on a flat price basis.","Jane Trotsenko - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I see. But generally speaking we should see a similar amount of ethane recovery in the coming quarters as we have seen in 3Q, right?","Alan Engberg - Range Resources Corporation","That's a decent assumption.","Jane Trotsenko - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Got it.","Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. The team had the ability in the quarter to move some additional ethane when we saw the spike in prices in September. So the ability to move \u2013 to do that again in October, November, December is going to be dependent on Alan and the team's ability to find additional outlets for that ethane. But as you could imagine everybody is fighting for those same outlets.","Jane Trotsenko - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Okay. I understand. Thank you so much.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rehan Rashid of B. Riley FBR.","Rehan A. Rashid - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. If I could go back to the royalty sale, how deep is this market? And a related question would be how should I think about the implied cost of capital in this sale? Your debt trades at 5%, your equity trades at 6 times EV multiple, and then I've got a follow-up question as well.","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning, Rehan. This is Mark. Let me take a stab at that question. So how deep is the market? There was a very active set of dialogs around the marketing of that royalty interest. So there's clearly an interest in royalties as an investment opportunity. You can look at the other structures, whether they're publicly traded or in private hands that investors do have interest in yield-oriented instruments, and particularly, in something like this is a high-quality asset that has cash flow generating ability, that has a growth component. So there is some depth to that market.","As Jeff has mentioned before in our divestiture processes, it's about finding the right and the best buyer for that asset which brings you to valuation. So in terms of getting a fair price and a good value for something like that, of course the universe is smaller for those that are going to pay what we believe it is fair and accretive price to us. But suffice it to say that there is a viable and healthy market there as it relates to royalty. And the second part of your question?","Rehan A. Rashid - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","What's the implied cost of capital for kind of what you just transacted?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","Sure. Well, I mean the most simplistic way to look at the estimated $25 million in cash flow, look at this as a yield, look at the $25 million in cash flow relative to the gross $300 million, and you're at a 7% yield. As that compares to Range's cost of capital that's an attractive rate at which we could divest such an asset. And to think about it relative to cost of capital, I would think about it relative to the NAV of the asset.","The trade here was an asset sale and the monetization of an asset at a particular price assumption, at a particular development plan, productivity, basis and so forth. This was not a trade of some percentage yield for 5% debt. This was monetization. It was a straight asset sale.","It had the added benefit that further improved the yield, the effective yield and improvement in cash flow deleveraging to Range for the pay down. But it's certainly not a high double-digits type of cost of capital.","Rehan A. Rashid - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Yeah, okay. So, on that kind of depth to the market front over the next two years, do you get the same kind of call it multiples. Would you be able to do something like $1 billion worth of sales along the same lines, same valuation if you so choose to?","Mark S. Scucchi - Range Resources Corp.","I don't want to draw any boxes or bookends around that. I would just say that generally speaking, we would evaluate assets in the portfolio and see what the most effective way to monetize and create value for the shareholders.","So, whether that's holding and developing it or whether that's perhaps carving something off, whether it's acreage, whether it's reducing piece of the asset portfolio or whether it's royalty, we would consider most options at the right valuation.","Rehan A. Rashid - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Got it. I apologize for one more question. So let's just say winter shows up, storage is low, the exit low, gas prices next year strengthen, my favorite number is $3.50, call it, how do you think kind of \u2013 what does your capital allocation kind of shift looks like?","And maybe Jeff, if you can kind of give some color on how do you think the industry responds, maybe the Northeast, the Utica, the dry gas and the kind of Southwest wet area if you can break it down into those buckets? Thanks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, well. First of all let me say, I like your prognostication there, $3.50. So we could be thrilled with that higher gas price and which I think we've been clear about this, if prices are higher it will allow us to delever faster and get to the point of returning capital or continuing to delever faster.","You won't see a ramp in activity, you'll see us delever faster with the incremental extra cash flow which would be great. There's a strong message really I think in the industry from the buy-side, I think a clear message to the producers to, call it, Shale 2.0 or call it whatever you want to not ramp activity, but to live under cash flow really and then return capital back to investors and work on returns.","So I don't think you'll see a big spike in activity. It's interesting if you look at the rig count in Appalachia, it's really been fairly steady or steady to down if anything. And I think even with the spike and you're talking about a spike also, the question is, if sustainable prices long-term, could you hedge and lock it in?","Right now the curve is very backwardated. And I've read your research and I think there's \u2013 it's very well thought out research. And if what you're saying is true, the back end of that curve at some point should come up, maybe people would think about it differently. But in terms of a short-term spike, I just think if we have incremental cash flow, we delever quicker.","Rehan A. Rashid - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Thank you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Biju Perincheril of Susquehanna for our final question.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks. Good morning. My question was, with what success you are having with the long laterals, can you give us some color on how that trends up over the next few years, your average lateral length? And what impact does that have on your base declines and how we should think about maintenance capital?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","You bet. So our five-year outlook was based on an average 10,000-foot lateral. And at this point we're planning to still adhere to that on an average basis. What we know is and I kind of had mentioned this earlier, the results are early and they're exciting, both from a well productivity standpoint, the cost reduction that we're seeing and some of the efficiency gains. So we're walking our way into not just trying to drill record wells, but also have repeatable success which that's a real strong key in an unconventional resource development. So, as we look forward into 2019 and the years beyond, will we factor in more long laterals, the short answer is yes. It's going to be real key for us.","Anytime we start to look at drilling, let's say, we have drilling successes over the last couple of years to get to 15,000 feet, now to 18,000, we will take our division teams. We'll take a look at the appropriate adjustments that we would want to make to our long-range plan and then how that feeds into the five-year outlook. So as we look forward, we're excited about drilling longer laterals. We think it's going to be a much more efficient use of our footprint. And as I mentioned earlier, that's key for us and also for the communities where we operate in. But are we shifting to a much bigger number at this point? I think the short answer is, no, until we see longer-term results and until we can see how that plays into our long-range plan.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks. When you look at \u2013 if that number does move up is that going to have an impact on the PDP declines when you mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, normalizing for lateral length of productivity? And is that on the initial production rates or on what you think the EUR will be?","Dennis L. Degner - Range Resources Corp.","Well, I'll tack with from two pieces. The EUR piece \u2013 again we're not seeing any change in EUR per 1,000 foot basis as we look at the early on evaluation of these wells. Again, it's early. The first 18,000 footers are just coming online in Q3. The good news is as we have some 15,000s and a little bit longer that have been in production for now somewhere in the neighborhood of in excess of 12 months and the results there are really encouraging. So they're in line with what we've showcased as our area type curve. So two thumbs up on what we're seeing from a well performance standpoint.","Will we keep our base decline flatter? As you look at 2018, I think we've communicated we're anticipating our PDP decline to be corporately around 23% and then that flattening into 2019 close to 18%. So if longer laterals will allow us to keep our infrastructure utilized longer, some of the wells will be flowing at some constrained rate. So I think we would expect, yes, our PDP decline to look flatter in the years ahead with longer laterals.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great.

Please go ahead, sir.","Laith Sando","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range's second quarter earnings call. Speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Degner, Chief Operating Officer and Mark Scucchi, Chief Financial Officer.","Hopefully, you've had a chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we've posted on our website. We also filed our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the investors tab or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.","Please note that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. For additional information, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of EBITDAX, cash margins and other non-GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Ventura","Thanks, Laith, and thanks to everyone for joining us on this morning's call. In the first half of 2019 Range delivered on key strategic initiatives generating organic free cash flow, reducing absolute debt, improving our cost structure and efficiently executing our 2019 operational plan safely and within budget. I'm proud of the team's efforts day-in and day-out to make this happened.","The industry is clearly in the middle of challenging times with natural gas and NGL prices lower on seasonal weakness and energy equity struggle to find investor interest. Against this difficult backdrop we remained focused on the things that will drive long-term shareholder value and we remain committed to positioning Range for success through the commodity cycles.","In fact, I believe the company is in a better position today that at any time in our past in terms of our ability to not only withstand low prices, but to thrive when the commodity turns in our favor.","With Range start creating where it is that might seem counter intuitive. But let me walk you through why I believe that Range is so \u2013 positioned so well currently coupled with some of the things we're doing to further improve on our competitiveness which Mark and Dennis will elaborate on.","First, we've reduced absolute debt in the last nine months by approximately $1 billion following the recent sale of a 2% overwriting royalties on the Southwest Pennsylvania acreage.","This latest sale improves interest expense by $30 million per year has a minimal to well economics, significantly derisk the balance sheet and highlight the substantial value that we have on our assets that has not being reflected in today's equity market.","Second, Range has capture almost the half million acreage in the core of Marcellus. This acreage position is largely held by production and has been derisk by over thousand Range Marcellus wells and thousands of industry wells that surround our acreage.","This large derisk blocky position not only allows us flexibility in our capital plans, but it allows for increasingly efficient operation as we utilize existing pads, optimize infrastructure, drew longer laterals and effectively source and recycle water. These operational efficiencies are reflecting what we believe are the best drilling and completion cost in the industry.","Third, Range is class leading drawn complete cost and core inventory support a very competitive corporate based decline and low maintenance capital requirements. Range's base decline entering 2019 was below 20% driving a D&C maintenance capital of less than $600 million.","This slow sustaining maintenance capital is a differentiator for Range, making Range very durable through the low points of the commodity cycle and providing a solid base for delivering sustainable free cash flow long term.","Fourth, Range is fully utilized its transportation and processing capacity providing us flexibility and setting our operational plans from here forward. We're also able to move our products to a variety of markets throughout the U.S. and abroad with projects like the Shale Cracker and numerous in-basin power projects and Petscan [ph] facilities being contemplated near our core operating area. We're well-positioned to meet that demand when commodity prices want that investment.","Lastly, we're improving our cost structure by optimizing our transportation and gathering portfolio, rightsizing our G&A and operating efficiently. In fact, we have improved our cost structure approximately 5% since year-end 2018 and expect to improve an additional 5% by the end of 2019, putting us well on our way to achieving the improvements we were targeting in our five-year outlook in February.","Mark will discuss the improvements that we see across the various cost items in a few minutes. But to put these unit costs improvements in the perspective, every one cent improvement to our cost structure provides and uplift of $8 million to annualized cash flow.","In other words, the 10% improvement in unit cost we expect between the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019 equates to over $160 million an annual uplift to cash flow over 10% of our current market cap. These unit cost improvements demonstrates Range's commitment to efficient operations and our resiliency during the challenging commodity environment as these cost reductions provide uplift the cash flow that is agnostic to commodity prices.","For all these reasons I just mentioned, I believe Range is in good shape to not only weather the current commodity headwinds, but to generate sustainable free cash flow through the cycles.","We have captured a highly contiguous position in the core of the Marcellus. We have filled our infrastructure. We have the ability to reach multiple markets to sell our products. And our cost structure Shallow Base decline and peer-leading maintenance requirements provide a solid foundation from which we can make capital positions.","While Range is in good shape for a challenging commodity type, we see many reasons to be optimistic for the future of natural gas and NGLs. At a high level, we're producing cleaner more efficient fuels that are seeing increased demand globally, demand that's growing much faster than for oil.","As evidence of this, Range is in discussion with numerous second wave LNG projects that are looking to secure long-term supplies. Several of these projects made FID in the second quarter were secured key long-term sales agreements supporting our expectation that LNG demand reaches 18 Bcf per day in the next five years.","Looking at where the natural gas market sits today, we're currently seeing record power demand, record LNG exports, record Mexican exports in industrial projects along the Gulf Coast and even in Pennsylvania. This is happening at a time when natural gas producers are slowing activity and storage is at similar for last year when look at on days of supply basis. We think that sets up a very constructive story that's not been reflected in the forward curve.","At a fundamental level we can take a look at what price might be require to meet the increasing demand that expected over the next decade. Assuming the Permian continues to grow a couple of Bcf per day each year we still see a significant call in Appalachia to supply incremental growth.","Looking at Southwest Appalachia today, you'll find that our peers are not capable of generating free cash flow and growth at current prices. We do not expect that investors will fund massive outspends and therefore the pace of growth will slow perhaps significantly.","Before turning it over to Mark and Dennis, I'll just reiterate that I believe Range is well-positioned for the current commodity backdrop as we have a great deal of flexibility in setting our capital program giving our advantage base decline, slow maintenance capital, existing infrastructure and improving cost structure.","Range also has an unrivaled inventory of high quality Marcellus locations that provide a good base for not only generating free cash flow at relatively low prices, but to continue for decade into a market that will no doubt see other producers exhausting their core inventories.","We believe that as we continue to make progress on improving the balance sheet, Range's competitive advantage in peer-leading inventory will begin to be reflected in the market. We've made good progress. Having paid down $1 billion in debt over the last nine months and having generated organic free cash flow over the same time frame and the entire Range team and broad remained committed and focused on for other improving our financial position as quickly and prudently as possible.","I'll not turn it over to Dennis to discuss operations.","Dennis Degner","Thank you, Jeff. Consistent with our prior call, our operating teams have continued with their strong start to the year with production on track and capital spending in line with our 2019 plan.","The second quarter capital spending came in at approximately 25% of the total capital budget, but first half of the year spending totaling 55% of the 2019 capital plan, both as projected.","This is consistent with our plan outlined earlier in the year with activity frontloaded resulting in a lower capital spend in the second half of the year while generating a significant production increase in Q4.","Production for the second quarter came in at 2.287 Bcf equivalent per day, slightly above our production guide for the quarter. This was achieved despite some headwinds associated with unplanned weather and field upsets in the Southwest Pennsylvania liquids gathering and processing systems.","Exceptional well performance in both the dry gas and liquids-rich portions of the field for wells turned in line throughout the first and second quarters helped underpinned the production results captured in Q2. The second quarter resulted in us turning in line 18 wells across both divisions.","In Appalachia, we turned to sales 16 wells on four pads focusing on liquids-rich acreage, with the well evenly split between the wet and super rich areas of our acreage. In the dry gas portion of the field we continue to see exceptional performance from wells that were brought online in the first quarter.","As an example, one of the recent dry gas pads has produced over 100 million cubic feet per day for more than four months from seven wells from an average lateral length of 13,800 feet. We often talk about the strong gas rates in this area and this pad is no different.","Having produced over 50 Bcf of gross gas to-date under a constrained environment, keeping a portion of our dry gas gathering fully utilized. Shifting to the super-rich, in the second quarter we turned to sales four remaining wells on a seven well pad where sales was initiated at the end of the first quarter.","As an example of the productivity we see in our best super-rich locations this pad continues to produce more than 2000 barrels per day of condensate after three months of productions, and is consistent with an offset pad which is being producing from more two years and it still capable of producing over 1000 barrel of condensate per day.","Lastly, similar to the prior dry gas example, this pad is flowing under constrained conditions and its keeping a part of our liquids-rich gathering system fully utilized. As we look forward in to the second half of 2019 we are scheduled to turn to sales approximately 30 wells in the third quarter, which helps drive Q4 production.","The well count only provides one perspective. Looking at this another way we turned to sales just under 400,000 feet of completed lateral in the first half of 2019 with plans to turned in line over 600,000 feet of completed lateral throughout the third and fourth quarters.","After adjusting for recent asset sales, we expect third quarter production to come in at 2.25 to 2.26 Bcf equivalent per day. With our anticipated ramp in the fourth quarter this places our production on track and capital spending at or better than our 2019 plan.","As the story line regarding parent-child impacts continues to grow for other basins such as the Permian. We continue to see the reservoir quality of our assets coupled with our approach to inner well spacing and completion design resulting positive consistent results as continue develop our acreage and develop \u2013 deliver on our financial objectives.","As an example, [Indiscernible] production phase for these well, but Q1 [ph] production is right in line with expectations for this area and showing no indications of impacts due to existing offset production. This is similar to long dated results we have from going back to existing pads which has become common practice for our team.","Now, I'd like to go over some of our operational highlights for the quarter. Similar to prior quarters, our drilling team has been able to capture operational efficiency gains by drilling long laterals and returning to existing producing well pads.","In the second quarter the team drilled four of our top 20 longest well in our Marcellus program history. The average lateral length of these four wells averaged over 16,500 feet per well with the drilling cost per lateral foot that is 22% lower than year to-date average cost per lateral foot.","We continue to see the operational and capital efficiency of drilling long laterals by increasing the average lateral length by 7% over the first quarter, while reducing the average number of drilling days per lateral to eight days.","An important part of capturing these cost reductions and efficiency gains has been repeatable. And that is exactly what our drilling team has been able to accomplish. As of now we been able to drill over 20 consecutive horizontal well bores greater than 15,000 feet without an operational issue. A strong achievement due to the teamwork between our service partners, technical and operational teams.","A key part of our programs remains our ability to drill from existing pads while generating consistent normalized well performance as compared to their original wells. And the second quarter was no exception as we saw half of the wells drilled in Q2 from pads with prior production.","Drilling from existing pads is more capital efficient as many of the costs associated with pad construction, road upgrades, facilities, and gathering have been previously realized. Range's footprint and inventory of well producing pads also affords the flexibility to reduce site development time line associated with design, permitting and construction.","We have ability to return to existing well pads that we drilled with historically shorter laterals and apply current operations techniques, new technology and designs allowing us to produce additional reserves from the same location.","An example of this, I'd like to share was in the second quarter where our drilling team return to an existing pad with two wells drilled during 2012, with the total of 6500 feet of completed lateral length. On the return trip, the team drilled an additional 52,000 feet of lateral to the pad from the same location. These wells will be completed in the months ahead and we look forward to sharing their results on our future call.","Shifting over to completions, during the second quarter the completions team successfully complete Range's two longest horizontals to-date with completed lateral length of approximately 18,800 feet and 18,700 feet.","The team will be finishing completions operations on the remaining wells on his pad during the third quarter with first sales scheduled for early Q4. Long lateral well performance continues to impress as the well develop producing history.","As of today, we have 10 wells with lateral length greater than 15,000 feet with production varying from less than six months to approximately two years. As we monitor each well, we see their performance in line or above the published type curves, furthering our confidence for repeatability in a long lateral development.","Lastly, we have 25 additional laterals greater than 15,000 feet in either of the drilling or completion phases, which will provide some exciting results to discuss in the quarters ahead.","In addition to long lateral operations the team has continue to harvest operational and capital efficiencies by exchanging its water sharing program, utilizing other producer's water whereas we call it water sharing, in the second quarter totaled more than 750,000 barrels, which represents a 6% increase over the same time period last year and a $2 million reduction in completion cost for the quarter.","This translates into real savings for our operations, increased capital efficiency and overall it alliance with our corporate values for safe operations while being good stewards for the environment.","To continue with this theme, the range Appalachia operations team was an early adopter in reducing emissions and utilizing field gas to fuel both drilling rigs and frac cruise. Over the past several years this was achieved by having bi-fuel equipment when possible.","To continue this effort, the team has taken the next step by successfully completing a three well pad with an all electric frac fleet powered by natural gas turbine for our Southwest PA fuel gas.","In addition to our reduction in emissions by using clean burning natural gas as a fuel source, the estimated cost reduction associated with the diesel fuel displaced for over an 90 stage completion was approximately $250,000. We will be utilizing this fleet on a second pad this year and evaluating the results for future consideration.","To reiterate a point from earlier, it is Range's large contiguous acreage position and ability to move back to existing pads that allows us to take advantage of this type of technology and reduce emissions and capture additional savings in the years ahead.","Lastly, for completions, frac efficiencies for the first half of 2019 have increased over 10% versus the same time period a year ago. We're proud of the operating team's continued success and ability to generate a safe and efficient program with the Top Tier per foot cost structure.","On the gas marketing side, as Jeff mentioned we continue to ongoing discussions with new LNG buyers. Range plans to play a part in this long term natural gas story with current arrangement to supply 440 million cubic feet per day to five different LNG facilities.","On liquids, the Mariner East 1 pipeline was return to service in late April, allowing Range to resume exports of 20,000 barrels per day of ethane and 20,000 barrels per day of propane. Range also made use of the Mariner East 2 pipeline and rail for transporting additional propane and butane to Marcus Hook for subsequent waterborne exports.","The international arms for LPG expanded to the highest levels in five years on strong demand and curtailment to supply from various regions. This resulted in high capacity utilization at U.S. export terminals and strong premiums on exported barrels relative to the domestic market sales. We expect this dynamic to continue into the third and fourth quarters.","Closing out the operations section the team has delivered another successful quarter by executing safe operations, by generating repeatable, long lateral operational results and by capturing strong efficiencies resulting in our best program yet.","I'll now turn it over to Mark to discuss the financials.","Mark Scucchi","Thank you, Dennis. Despite the second quarter being challenging from a commodity price perspective, Range executed on its operating and financial strategy, efficiently managed the business, remained free cash flow positive year to-date and continued efforts to enhance margin to prudent cost management initiatives.","In summary, financial results, mid-year 2019 are in line with the key principles of our business. First, operate a self funding cash flow generating business. Second, enhanced margins and profitability through both price and the cost management, and third, but equally important, improves the balance sheet through monetization of assets.","With operations tracking plan results, Range has generated year to-date cash flow from operations of $446 million, compared to capital spending of $413 million, resulting in free cash flow of $33 million before dividends.","As discussed last year, we made the transition to free cash midyear 2018. We've continued that trend and expect to generate free cash flow for the full year 2019. Range's ability to generate free cash flow even in a low price environment is underpinned by its capital efficiency and cost structure.","Continuous efforts on optimizing cost have yielded and will continue to yield enhanced profitability and resiliency. For the second quarter we delivered our near term plans with unit cost better than guidance.","The quarter over quarter improvement of $0.05 per unit and $0.10 per unit compared to fourth quarter last year are the result of efficiency across the board led by improvement in the gathering, processing and transport line item.","To frame this significant improvement, recall that Range guided to a $0.30 improvement over the course of the five-year outlook, whereas in six months we've achieved one-third of that goal. I'll spend a minute walking through each expense line item and our expectation for each.","Gathering, processing and transport expense was a $1.45 Mcfe in the second quarter, compared to a $1.49 in the first quarter and $1.51 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Last year we guided to this line item peaking at the time our last contracted pipeline capacity came online which was in the fourth quarter.","As planned, full utilization of infrastructure is driving down this cost on a unit basis. As a reminder this cost consist of infield gathering, processing plant expenses, and long-haul transport for natural gas and natural gas liquids. Long-haul transport is largely a fixed costs with all of our contracted gas capacity online.","Infield gathering has both fixed and variable element, much of the gathering system is fully utilized and its cost recovery hurdles are meet, the fixed rate component will decline over time.","On the processing side, this is predominantly structured as a percent of proceeds from NGL sales and will vary with our prehedged NGL realizations. For context for Mcfe, gathering represents roughly $0.50; transport roughly $0.50 and processing around $0.45.","The unit cost decline over the past couple of quarters has been driven by modest production growth. Going forward however even in the reduced growth scenario their reductions in absolute spend that can continue the improving trend in the per unit GP&T cost near, medium and long-term.","Range's lease operating cost have decline in the absolute and on a per unit of production basis compared to second quarter last year. Range's operating costs are competitive with liquids producing peers and on a more granular level.","Our costs in the dry gas areas are also competitive with best-in-class dry gas only producers. This continued strong performance is driven by diligent operations in the field with specific savings related to water handling.","Cash, G&A expenses declined in the absolute and on a per unit basis. Proactive, thoughtful management of G&A has driven current reductions, but also drive expected future savings. G&A has often thought of its strictly corporate overhead that actually include critical investments supporting sound operations including safety, environment, regulatory, land administration, IT as well as more administrative functions.","In terms of headcount, when Range's operations included more basins headcount peaked at over 1000 employees. Today Range has approximately 750 extremely hard working employees.","Just over the last year there's been 12% reduction in G&A headcount as a result of asset sales and the reduction in force. Active surveillance of expenses our teams at Range that every element of G&A is expected to generate future cash savings of roughly 10% on absolute dollars on an annualized run rate basis.","On the matter of equity compensation expense, as a reminder it should be noted that even though potential stock grants specifically performance share, our expense that does not mean share were issued. In fact significant forfeitures have been experienced which is evident in the modest change in diluted shares outstanding.","During the quarter we closed on acreage sales of $34 million. And has recently announced we have signed and now closed on the sales of royalty interest for gross proceeds of $600 million.","Divestitures proceeds reduced borrowings and pro forma, the borrowings under the bank line of credit as of June 30 would be $295 million were less than 10% of the borrowing base. This results in pro forma liquidity under the borrowing base of nearly $2.5 billion.","The borrowing base approved in March already contemplated the royalty sales and certain other divestitures. Consequently, there was no change to the borrowing base. Range within full compliance with the financial covenants in the credit and with the asset sales completed we have further bolstered that position.","There are three financial maintenance covenants under the revolving credit agreement. One, a minimum current ratio, two, a minimum cash interest coverage ratio, and three, a minimum ratio, a present value of reserves that same pricing to total debt. Each of these has substantial cushion. Additional disclosure has been added to the company presentation further explaining these items.","Looking at Range's debt maturity profile, our first maturity is mid-2021. With ample liquidity under the revolving line of credit we effectively have a backstop to help manage maturities. We remain focused on reducing debt, reducing borrowing costs and maintaining the comfortable maturities.","On the topic of further balance sheet improvement, we are currently marketing several additional opportunities. These processes are in various stages and as we have consistently done in the past, we will announce results, but we will not negotiate against ourselves by establish dollar threshold or timeline.","Suffices to say, we have a deep inventory of project that we believe we can divest at reasonable values particularly in comparison to the value of our common equity. As we look at the progress made to-date in 2019 tangible achievements have been delivered against the plan has led out early this year.","As we look forward to the balance of 2019, we intent to successfully execute on our plan of generating positive free cash flow, while we accelerate value creation through inventory management.","In summary, we'll remain focused on converting consistently efficient operations on top tier acreage and the tangible shareholder returns in the form of free cash flow through the application of a disciplined capital allocation framework coupled with continuous cost management efforts.","Back to you, Jeff.","Jeffrey Ventura","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Ventura. The question and answer session will begin now. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kashy Harrison with Simmons Energy.","Kashy Harrison","Good morning everyone. Good morning everyone and thanks for taking my questions. So I know it's early to talk about 2020. But I was wondering if you could share some color on how we should think about capital allocation in a 250 environment?","Jeffrey Ventura","At a high level let me just say we have a lot of flexibility and very low maintenance capital. But Mark, let me talk a little bit more about our framework and thought process.","Mark Scucchi","Sure. I think the key principle that we've laid out in the strategy section upfront in the company presentation is the fact that our capital allocation process starts with free cash flow as a priority. So, given ranges pure leading decline rate, low maintenance CapEx number. And the fact that we have tremendous latitude nearly every option is on the table as we chart the path through at the end of 2020. We have no drilling obligations. Our infrastructure is fully utilized. So with that we can be responsive to prices, adjust the capital spending appropriately and as we gain a little bit greater visibility into 2020 as this year unfolds we can design the most suitable program, again being responsive to both gas and NGL prices.","Kashy Harrison","Got you. So, spending down year-over-year. Got it. And so -- and then the other question I had, there were some there was some commentary earlier in the call on just the \u2013 just a lot of discussion on reducing cash cost to drive sustainable improvements in free cash flow generation moving forward. I was wondering if you could just share some thoughts on consolidation as a whole in the -- your thoughts on consolidation as whole in the Appalachian Basin. And whether there could in fact be opportunities to expand free cash flow potential through mergers of equals and reductions in headcount and so forth? Thank you.","Jeffrey Ventura","Yes. We'll just \u2013 I'll start with range. And then try to actually answer your question at hand. But \u2013 yes, I think we're in a good position. We have -- when you look at range we have strong inventory, but then you got to look at the specifics of each company. So, we have I think one of the lowest corporate decline rates really even in the basin which puts us in a good position, very low maintenance capital. We're capable of generating free cash flow now versus our peers in the south. We can generate free cash flow and get a little bit of growth. Most of our peers or all of our peers in the southwest part of the basis aren't doing that.","With Midstream commitments that we have are full. When you look at our costs in drilling complete they're the lowest in the entire basin. In fact, lot of the peers are striving to hit a lot of costs. So -- and we think we can drive those down through technology and probably through a softening service costs environment or acreages HPP and so on. So, I think we've got a great path forward. Everybody talks about consolidation in the basin and theoretically some of those things could make sense. But I think we'll stay disciplined in terms of the path that we're on. But from a theoretical point of view you could argue some of that could make sense.","Kashy Harrison","Got it. That's it from me. Thank you.","Jeffrey Ventura","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Yes. Good morning. I wanted to get your thoughts on if Range decided to move into maintenance mode in 2020, call it from a 2.4 Bcf a day fourth quarter kind of exit rate. What type of capital rig activity tools would you need to keep, call it that fourth quarter run rate flat from an overall production basis?","Mark Scucchi","Sure, Arun. This is Mark. I'll start with that and then we can each come in from an operational perspective and so forth. So the D&C maintenance CapEx that we had guided for 2018 fourth quarter from 2017, the $525 add in let's call it $50 million or so in land. If you roll that forward to our exit rate, the number as you guided to and thing starting from a higher rate and holding that flat, you're probably in the low $600 million range for D&C maintenance CapEx from fourth quarter 2019 to fourth quarter 2020.","But keep in mind that since you're holding the high point from 2019 through calendar 2020 that's actually generating call it mid single digit type growth on an annual -- on an annualized basis.","Arun Jayaram","That's helpful. And any just thoughts on rig activity or tools to do that?","Dennis Degner","Yes. This is Dennis. We we've taken a strong look throughout the balance of the year at what it would take especially as we looked at early on the five-year outlook. And the program that we have in place now you know one of the focus is how do we maintain our leading operational efficiencies and keep driving down our cost structure. And we feel like we're able to do that with the current rig activity that we have in place in Southwest PA with a couple of rigs and also a frac crew or two.","It will be focused on making sure that we keep water handling those efficiencies and as we've talked about the water sharing value harvested. So we feel like we -- it's going to be more in line with what we actually have as we finish out the second half the year.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Appreciate that commentary. My next question; you guys have guided to a 5% decline in your unit cost structure between the second quarter and the fourth quarter. Assuming you do go to maintenance mode next year just as a case or scenario, Mark what your thoughts on your cash cost structure in 2020? I do believe some of your Terryville MVCs do roll off next year. But just directionally how do you think your per unit costs would trend into 2020?","Mark Scucchi","Yes. I think that's a good and a very important question. So, the cost trend both on a per unit basis and in certain contract [Indiscernible] do decline into next year. As you point out there is a processing capacity agreement where our MVC rolls off early in 2020 with a fairly substantial reduction in cost there. Again for utilization of the capacity that came online at the end of 2018 further optimization to the extent there is growth that being sold in basin. Again further drives down the unit costs on a GP&T. basis.","I would couple that with the trend line you've seen in absolute reductions on LOE, which has been extremely efficient in handling water and found opportunities there. Our G&A savings that we've achieved so far this year, many of the additional initiatives have not materialized because we're waiting for contracts that are not being renewed to roll off over the remaining months of this year. So the benefits of those will really materialize in 2020. So setting growth aside for a moment, we think that we can continue to achieve meaningful improvements in the unit cost structure.","I would also add to that that there's some additional savings on the gathering, processing specifically transport side as ME 2 comes online next year. Currently, some barrels are being wailed which is more expensive. So once ME 2 comes online we'll still be able to reach exports and reduce that absolute spend.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.","Ron Mills","Good morning. Question for you, Mark, on NGL pricing in the top that you have a couple of really good sides in terms of how the macro is improving in terms of days of storage and if you look at your realizations relative to a Mont Belvieu barrel, they've improved significantly over the past six to nine months. I wonder if you could just provide a little bit more color on your outlook for NGLs? And how do you how do you think that translates into in terms of timing and in relative pricing improvement?","Dennis Degner","Yes, Ron, this is Dennis. I'm going to pitch this over to Alan. I think he's going to have some good color on just how we view the downfield vision of NGL pricing and where things are headed.","Alan Engberg","Hey, Ron. This is Alan Engberg, head of our liquids business. I can give you a whole kind of dissertation on NGLs. I'll try to keep it brief. And just to say that, yes, the second quarter prices were challenging. But overall fundamentals are actually improving as we speak and we're kind of cautiously optimistic and encouraged by some of what we're seeing during the second quarter.","But if we look at let's say propane as a proxy for the NGL barrel, going into the second half of this year we see things, let's say, we ended the second quarter in particular in the Northeast with stocks that were lower year on year. In fact, there were roughly on a four-week moving average basis using the EIA pad 1 data. At the end of the second quarter we were 7% under last year, and as of the most recent EIA posting again on the four-week moving average basis roughly 8% under last year. So the Northeast is actually tightening.","If we take a broader look at the overall U.S. fundamentals, they're also improving. In fact, we started off from a high level at the end of the first quarter and start to build season probably 25% higher than where we were a year ago. But during the second quarter especially May and June we started to work that off. In fact, June in particular we saw inventories actually decreased by roughly 5 million barrels year-on-year. So for those reasons we're going into the third quarter now with fundamentals that are actually starting to improve.","In particular we're looking at an addition to export capacity, that's going to be coming up during the third quarter. That's enterprise's terminal where they're adding 175,000 barrels per day. And that's going to free up the US's ability to move more product. That we're seeing again from the tightening fundamental trend that we've been seeing of late. We're expecting that we're going to get into the start of winter with inventories on a day supply basis that are going to be lower than last year.","We have additionally new export capacity coming on during 2020. That is significant. It's like 750,000 barrels of new export capacity which is way in excess of what supply growth is going to be. So, overall for all those reasons we think the picture looks pretty good. Now some people might ask can the rest of the world absorb all the exports that the U.S. going to be sending out. And for that you said you'd looked at slide deck. If you look at slide number 39 if you don't mind I'd be happy to walk you through that.","But in slide 39 for global LPG S&D, we start with demand of around 9.5 million barrels at the end of 2018. Now the last five years we've had growth of roughly 5% globally for LPG. To be conservative we're going to say growth over the next five years will be 3%. And if we apply that to the base demand which is res\/com kind of home heating, industrial, auto gas, we get growth over the next five years around 850,000 barrels per day.","Then we take a look at the chemical sector and we want to plan 3% on that will actually be strict and we'll say, let's just look at projects that are under construction globally and projects that are close to FID, so they've got their financing in place. That adds another 700,000 barrels per day of demand. So it's 350 for PDHs and 350 a day for ethylene plants that will consume LPG. So, total demand growth is about 1.6 million barrels. Then if we look at the supply side the EIA is global outlook came up with supply growth outside of the U.S. over the next five years for LPG of 350,000 barrels per day. That's only 22% of that increase in demand. So that means that the rest of it is up to the U.S. to fill and that's a call on the U.S. of 1.2 million barrels per day.","Now at current strip pricing some of the consultants that we respect and if we look at their numbers and their forecast is growth of only 750,000 barrels per day. So to do the math on that we end up with a global short of around 450,000 barrels per day. Now that's just one scenario. But it's a decent scenario that says; number one, the world does want the rest of the U.S.'s exports. The U.S. needs more export capacity and you could argue it needs more supply if this scenario plays out. Does that answer your question?","Operator","He is out of queue now.","Alan Engberg","Okay.","Operator","We are nearing the end of today's conference call and we will go to David Deckelbaum of Cowen for our final question.","David Deckelbaum","Thanks for putting me in at the end, guys. Appreciate the time.","Dennis Degner","Thank you.","David Deckelbaum","I just had had two questions. One, congratulations on the recent overriding royalty interest sale. It took about a half to turn out your leverage. What other meaningful opportunities have you identified? And can we expect similar types of impacts with within the efforts going forward. And would you be willing or do you have the capacity to do similar transactions now?","Mark Scucchi","Yes. This is Mark. I'll start off. So given the sheer depth of inventory of projects the scale of our footprint, the time horizon we're talking about in terms of developing that, there are extremely high quality projects that we believe can find a good bid in the market today. We are focused on as I mentioned during my scripted portion accelerating the value of some of that through the divestiture processes.","We have a number of processes underway. I'm reluctant to get into specifics on any one, but suffice it to say we are actively working multiple meaningful projects and would eagerly look forward to announcing those. But we are keenly interested in monetizing some of that materially improving and altering the capital structure and capturing some of the value of it from the depth of this inventory.","David Deckelbaum","Would that include other potential overriding royalty interest packages?","Mark Scucchi","I would say we've got a very open mind. I mean you could see the value in the bid for those that we've achieved in three transactions raising $900 million. So there's clearly a bid for that type of asset. So we would keep that in mind.","David Deckelbaum","Okay. I guess I just recall the last time you guys were asked about this. I think you had said that you would be willing to do up to 2% this year. I guess, can you remind us why that was the upper limit. And you know what might exist beyond that?","Mark Scucchi","As we laid out the guidelines what we were starting with was roughly an 83% NRI. And as guideposts we said that we think that being around 80% would still be an advantageous position for range to be in relative to average enterprise of peers. And it's clearly not a material detriment to the returns of the wealth. So, that's not a hard and fast number. It was guidepost that we were indicating that even after divestiture of a few points we would still be in a very strong position. And I think that sitting at 80% today I think we find ourselves in still a very good position.","David Deckelbaum","Yes, I agree. My last question is just if you might. Could you give us any specific dollar color on the savings you'll experience next year in the following year from some of the MVCs rolling off, I guess just as a total dollar amount to the company?","Mark Scucchi","What I'll do is actually point you to the old disclosures on the North Louisiana assets. If you can look back at the MVC processing committed, it's not material to Range's overall costs, but in terms of the individual contracts. But I'll point you back to the last 10k the [Indiscernible] would've filed. They broke down the individual contracts, the capacity and the timeline and you can calculate what the roll off is.","David Deckelbaum","Okay. Appreciate the time guys.","Mark Scucchi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his closing remarks.","Jeffrey Ventura","I just want to thank everybody for participating on today's call and feel free to follow up with our IR team with additional questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect at this time."],"18018":["Range Resources Corp.

This call is being recorded. Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer period.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Laith Sando, Vice President, Investor Relations at Range Resources. Please go ahead.","Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining Range's first quarter earnings call. The speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Chief Financial Officer.","Hopefully you've had the chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we've posted on our website. We'll be referencing some of the those slides this morning. We also filed our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.","Before we begin, let me also point out that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. In addition, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of these non-GAAP measures. The supplemental tables also provide calculated natural gas differentials for the upcoming quarter and detailed hedging information for all products.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, Laith. Improving pricing differentials driving expanding margins is the theme of the first quarter and what we believe will be a continuing theme for Range in 2017 and 2018. Coupling the enhanced margins with the lowest PUD development cost for any of our oil or gas peers, we calculate our unhedged recycle ratio as approximately 3 times.","The story is ratified by independent work from well respected firms and analysts, with one such report included in our new presentation. It examines recycle ratios across the Delaware Basin, Midland Basin, the SCOOP\/STACK play, the Bakken, the Eagle Ford and the Marcellus. This work includes a number of very high quality oil and gas companies. Based on this analysis, Range has one of the top recycle ratios of any company whether oil or gas and in any basin. We believe this is a key indicator of long-term success driving above average profitability in a normalized price environment or strengthened stability in the down cycle.","Moving back to margin expansion, improving price differentials for natural gas, NGLs and condensate are expected for 2017. A full year of transportation on our Gulf Expansion Phase 1 pipeline project and a full year of contribution from our near to market North Louisiana assets are resulting in our natural gas differential for this year improving to approximately NYMEX less $0.30. Later this year, we're expecting Rayne\/Leach Xpress at their Southwest and Rover Phase 2 pipelines to commence operations. These transportation projects should result in further improvement in our 2018 differentials.","Per barrel NGL pricing for 2017 is projected to be 28% to 30% of WTI. A full year of Mariner East plus NGL sales from North Louisiana are the main contributors for the increase in realized price. Looking forward to 2018, fundamentals suggest that higher demand for ethane and propane from the petrochemical sector and exports can improve our pricing differentials further next year.","Our condensate pricing differential per barrel for 2017 is projected to be WTI less about $5.50. This is driven by a full year of our new marketing agreement for Marcellus condensate and a full year of North Louisiana condensate sales. Importantly, this pricing differential represent a 40% improvement over our 2016 condensate differential. This improvement in pricing across gas, NGLs and condensate coupled with one of the lowest cost structures in the industry, has resulted in the margin improvement we're seeing in the first quarter and are projecting for the full year. Capital efficiency in 2017 will continue to improve as we're targeting over 9,000 foot laterals in Pennsylvania and we're driving down the cost of drilling complete wells in North Louisiana. Ray will discuss our operational highlights next and provide more detail on our plans.","With the first quarter in the books, 2017 is shaping up to be a good year for Range. Importantly, we expect our class-leading recycle ratio in 2017 to continue into 2018 and beyond as Range is one of the few companies in the industry with a decade plus of high quality drilling locations. We have a resource potential of approximately 100 Tcfe as compared to our year-end proved reserves of 12.1 Tcfe. Our resource potential does not include the highly prospective Utica, which will drive our ratio of resource potential to proved reserves even higher.","As shown on slides 23 and 24, in the southwest portion of the Marcellus, Range has the highest estimated ultimate recovery per foot, lowest finding and development costs and lowest breakeven costs. We have a high quality asset position in North Louisiana and as shown on slide 13, we've made significant progress adding value since the acquisition was announced last May. Looking forward, Range remains well positioned to drive value for years to come.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. Production for the first quarter came in at 1.93 Bcf equivalent per day, and guidance for the second quarter is flat to the first quarter of 2017, or 1.93 Bcf equivalent per day, and we remain on track for annual growth of 33% to 35% as the company's production growth is weighted towards the back half of the year.","Before walking through operations, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our production growth for the rest of 2017 and how this sets us up for 2018. In Appalachia, we brought to sales in the first quarter less than 20% of our expected wells for the year, so growth in the back half of the year should look really good. In North Louisiana, we expect to bring to sales 29 additional wells in the second half of 2017, also providing solid growth in the second half of the year. We delivered on our expected production for the first quarter of 2017 in both Appalachia and North Louisiana.","And in Terryville, we expect wells going forward will generate better growth than the group of wells turned to sales in the first quarter. To illustrate, let's compare and contrast our first quarter activity with our expectations going forward. As discussed on the last couple earnings calls, 18 of the Terryville wells brought to sales in the first quarter were drilled prior to the acquisition, many of them over a year ago. As result of completing such a large swath of wells at one time, which was 27 during the first quarter, and because of the location of many of these wells, approximately 40 million cubic feet equivalent per day of offset production was shut in to minimize the frac hits.","The shut-in production does not come back all at once, but will come back throughout the year via flatter declines. Going forward, we're planning a more balanced approach both in terms of activity and planning the well locations to help minimize the impact on offset production. As discussed before, we've implemented a completely different flow-back in early production protocol. The wells will now be opened up under designed, constrained conditions, allowing the use of more cost effective facilities and the minimization of expensive flow-back rental equipment. We believe this will improve the overall project returns.","What it means is, that we won't see the initial 30-day rates that you would have seen in the past. And we've changed production operations in the field. In addition to a different approach to flow-backs, we're also implementing Range's safety, facility and production protocols. One example is eliminating production of the annulus. This practice, while common in some areas, is not the preferred practice with the equipment that is currently in place. These design and operational changes resulted in cutting back production by approximately 30 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the year. Of course, this simply curtails production, and we expect to get that production back via a flatter decline.","In the first quarter, we also tested some meaningful step-outs in Terryville that will help to further delineate and de-risk our well inventory. Some of these wells were in areas perceived as the edges of the field due to poor historical results. While the results from the new wells are early, they are very encouraging and are in part the result of improved targeting. With lower drilling and completion costs, the encouraging early well results and the ability in the future to incorporate better mapping and seismic, we believe these areas hold significant potential.","As part of that same process of better understanding the field's ultimate potential, the first quarter included wells that had been drilled pre-acquisition in some of the Pink horizons. Completing these wells will provide us a better understanding of the resource potential over the coming years.","Going forward, we'll continue to be focused on the Upper and Lower Red, while occasionally drilling other horizons and extension wells to optimize our full development plans. This is similar to our approach in Appalachia, that is, focusing on the Marcellus while unlocking the Utica and Upper Devonian opportunities over time.","So while the first quarter was a great quarter operationally and financially, we're really looking forward to the second half of this year, as we continue to build on our operational successes in both North Louisiana and Appalachia.","Hitting on some of the operational highlights for the quarter, we'll start with Appalachia, where we're directing approximately two thirds of our capital spend. We continue to make great strides in unit cost reductions, improving well performance and capital efficiency.","I'd like to take a few minutes now and walk through some updates on the drilling side in Appalachia. Our team has now drilled the longest Marcellus lateral in Pennsylvania and three of the top four longest laterals in the entire basin. In the first quarter, we drilled three laterals over 15,000 feet and seven laterals over 10,000 feet. We're achieving a 67% increase in daily lateral footage drilled versus a year ago.","Combining our drilling performance and planning efforts, our average lateral length drilled this year will be approximately 9,000 feet. These improvements can be attributed to four things. We've upgraded our rig fleet to higher horsepower and higher pressure rated equipment. We've adopted and greatly improved the efficiency of our rotary steerable tools. The team has redesigned our current mud systems, and a real focus on key performance indicators that trigger real and measurable success. And two final things on the drilling side, we've accomplished all of this while narrowing our lateral target to a 10-foot window, at the same time drilling faster while lowering cost from last year on a per foot basis by over 30%. And it's been almost two years since the team has had to sidetrack a wellbore. Needless to say, we're really proud of their accomplishments.","On the completions, facilities, water and production front, we're continuing to innovate and improve efficiencies and cost. We're fine tuning frac designs and zipper frac operations, and I expect we'll continue to do so for years ahead. Even with some forecasted pressure on service costs, our cost per stage and our cost per foot of completed lateral should continue to improve throughout 2017.","Facility costs should continue to improve and LOE continues to trend in the right direction. Any way you look at the data, Range has the lowest well cost, including facilities, of any operator in the southwest portion of the basin, and we expect those costs will continue to improve. One significant and unique advantage that we have is the extensive network of existing infrastructure in pads. We're planning for approximately a third of our 2017 wells on existing pads, with as much as half of our wells in 2018. This will drive down our costs significantly, by as much as $200,000 to $500,000 per well.","On the well performance side, we continue to improve completion designs and see impressive results. As an example, I want to highlight a couple of liquids-rich pads that we brought online during the first quarter. In the wet area, we brought online a three-well pad with average lateral length of 7,186 feet, completed with 37 stages per well that produced net-to-sales under designed constrained conditions at a max 24-hour rate of 35.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well.","In the super-rich area, we have a four-well pad with average lateral lengths of 10,772 feet completed with 54 stages per well, but have only been able to put two of the wells to sales so far. The reason why is that they're some of the best liquids rich wells in the basin. Those two wells have averaged over 31.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, each well, or over 62.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day combined with 69% liquids, again under designed constrained conditions net-to-sales for a max 24-hour rate.","As those two wells decline, we'll be adding the other two wells to sales as capacity frees up in the system. It's important to point out that this pad is near the planned Harmon Creek processing plant in a lightly drilled super-rich area. And we have plans to develop additional wells and pads in this area going forward.","Clearly, these two pads illustrate the quality of our low risk, long lateral inventory in Appalachia in the dry, wet and super-rich areas. These types of results, when combined with going back on to existing pads with existing gathering and compression infrastructure generate liquids-rich drilling economics that are among the best in the business. Like I've said in the past, we literally have thousands of these types of opportunities and I still don't believe we've drilled our best well yet.","As a quick update on the Utica, I believe it's worth pointing out the updated map in our presentation on page 44. Of particular note, we've highlighted the recent activity, including some direct offsets to our acreage currently being drilled that will clearly enhance our 400,000 net acre position further.","We'll continue to monitor those wells and other Utica activity in Pennsylvania as we go forward. Our best well remains as one of the top four Utica wells in the play. We believe it will hold flat for close to 400 days and the EUR looks to be around 3.25 Bcf per 1,000 foot. Again, essentially all our acreage is HBP'd and we believe the Utica play will play a complementary and important role in the future.","Shifting to North Louisiana, we're excited about the progress we've achieved in just a little over six months and believe we're on track to exceed our original acquisition expectations. We're in line with forecasted production and cash cost, and we're expecting solid growth in the second half of the year, while drilling and completion cost have improved further and faster than we expected. We've reduced our average all-in well cost for a 7,500 foot lateral by another $300,000 to $7.4 million while reducing drilling time, refining the target window and staying 100% in zone.","This is now $1.3 million or 15% below the $8.7 million cost last September, which obviously has a major impact on the economics. Like we've discussed, this lower cost will open up additional inventory from various horizons across our acreage positions. Our capital plan and the $7.4 million well cost in North Louisiana has baked in our forecast for service pricing increases for the year. For some services, those increases could range from 5% to 25%. However, as evidenced by our well cost, we fully expect that improvements in our operations and designs will more than offset the service price increases.","As mentioned earlier, our 2017 North Louisiana program includes drilling, delineating and de-risking our well inventory in Terryville. This plan consists of wells in the various Lower Cotton Valley intervals that will lead to an improved understanding and mapping of the reservoirs alongside the acquisition of additional science work directed at determining optimum targeting and completion design. We are acquiring additional seismic along the southwestern and southeastern portions of the field to help calibrate the reservoir mapping and well results.","During the quarter, we completed 27 wells made up of 19 Upper Reds, five Lower Reds and three Pinks. And we're producing these wells much differently than the historical practice, mainly under designed facility constraints, resulting in lower cost and flatter declines. We believe that this new approach of adopting more cost effective facilities, combined with better targeting and completions will drive the next step in development for the Terryville field.","To put some context around 2017 well activity, there are really three groups of wells. The first group is the wells that we simply call the pre-Range wells. In essence, we may have taken over operations in one phase or another, but essentially they were planned and designed using historical practices. This was 21 of the 27 wells in the first quarter, and 18 of them were drilled almost a year ago.","The second group of wells, which six of the 27 fall into this group, is those wells where Range may not have been able to pick the location or the formation, but we did have some influence in the targeting and drilling of the well. And then the last group are the Range wells, where we picked the location, formation, target and designed them from start to finish. The majority of the remaining 29 wells for the year, again which are weighted to the last half of the year, fall into this group and we've only recently begun completing the first of these wells. We're excited about what we see so far, and I look forward to updating those results throughout the year as we gather that performance data and build our reservoir models and development plans for the future.","As an update on the extension area activity, results continue to be encouraging from the two of the wells that we announced last quarter. Each of the two wells, each located in separate Terryville sized fault blocks, one to the east, and one to the west of the Vernon Field have cumulative production to-date of approximately 1 Bcf each. As a result, plans are underway to offset each well with another horizontal well.","Additionally, in the extension area, we have two pilot holes, one partially completed lateral that we're currently testing and we'll be starting a couple of new vertical wells designed to test multiple targets on an individual basis. This allows us to determine reservoir and rock properties while performing specific diagnostics to identify the best lateral targets. With over 400 Bcf per square mile and up to six target intervals, the potential is large. Again, we remain focused on Terryville while methodically testing and delineating the extension areas over time.","In the Marcellus, we're continuing to improve returns through lower cost and improved well performance and we continue to develop our extensive inventory of core locations with longer laterals. In North Louisiana, we're ahead of our acquisition case and believe we'll continue to make progress going forward. We're on track for our production growth guidance for 2017 and 2018 is shaping up very well.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials.","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, Ray. The first quarter of 2017 builds upon the excellent fourth quarter of 2016 with further improvements in top line growth, cost control, margins and bottom line net income and cash flow. Net income on a GAAP basis for the first quarter was $170 million, while earnings using common analyst methodology, which excludes non-cash derivative mark-to-market entries and non-recurring items was $61 million.","Cash flow for the first quarter was $258 million, 2.5 times the first quarter of last year's $99 million figure. Cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.05, 78% higher than last year's per share figure of $0.59. EBITDAX for the first quarter of 2017 was $303 million, compared to last year's $135 million amount. First quarter 2017 cash margin, at $1.47 per Mcfe, was almost double that of last year's cash margin at $0.77.","One notable achievement in the first quarter of 2017 was that for the first time since 2014, Range was solidly profitable without any contribution from our hedge book, with our unhedged recycle ratio approaching 3 times and continued margin and capital efficiency improvements projected, future quarters should be much more like the past two quarters than the preceding seven.","Moving to the expense performance for the first quarter, all of our expense results came in at or below guidance. Detailed expense guidance for the second quarter of this year may be found in the earnings release.","Turning to the balance sheet, like last year, we ended the first quarter with less debt than we entered as our spending outflows were less than our cash inflows. Our debt-to-EBITDAX leverage ratio, calculated using a first quarter annualized EBITDAX, was 3.1 times and our book debt-to-capitalization ratio is 40%.","Additional hedges were selectively added during the first quarter to be already well established 2017 and 2018 hedge positions and we initiated our first hedge on 2019 production. Presently, over 75% of our 2017 natural gas production is hedged with an average floor price of $3.22 an Mmbtu. Additional hedges were added to our oil and NGL book during the first quarter as well. Full disclosure of our hedge price and volume positions maybe found in the 10-Q, earnings release and Range website.","The first quarter of each year has historically been a strong one financially. The reason for this first quarter strength is usually the peak of winter weather and the resulting strong demand and higher prices for our products. In 2017, the story is very different. This winter we experienced the second warmest first quarter in 30 years, based on gas weighted heating degree days, and the second warmest first quarter in 123 years based on average temperature.","However, our first quarter cash flow of $258 million was roughly the same as our cash flow for the first quarter of 2014, a year when we had the coldest first quarter in 30 years. The reason that our first quarter financial performance in the second warmest winter in 30 years is on par with the coldest winter in 30 years is a result of capital-efficient growth and the improved transportation, marketing and cost control measures Range has been working on for the past 10 years. The margin improvements we are seeing from our relentless cost control, the capital efficiencies from technology and the quality of our rock, combined with the marketing uplift from our unique natural gas and NGL marketing projects, have made Range's financial performance much more durable regardless of the weather.","Now Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Ventura. Your first question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you folks. Good morning. Touching on differentials here, a big theme no doubt, and maybe picking up where Roger left off in his prepared remarks. How much of the improvement in differentials in your mind is unique to the company based on moves made in pricing molecules outside the Appalachian Basin say versus how much is based on developments general to the industry? Asking here in an effort to get a better sense of really what's sustainable.","Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah Dan, this is Laith. I think it really gets back to the approach that we've taken with marketing to move our molecules and have the flexibility of having production in-basin as well as moving gas to the Gulf Coast, the Midwest, and the Southeast. So in the first quarter, you'll notice that we came out with a positive $0.01 differential. So, despite having the warmest winter in the last 130 years like Roger mentioned, we still have some of the capacity that gets us to premium markets despite having no winter. And as we move towards the end of 2017, with some of the transport that we have coming online, you'll have 90% of our gas being sold to markets better than what we're typically seeing in Appalachia.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. Thank you. And just as a follow-up to that, just addressing the Terryville cost reduction, what's behind the cost reductions to-date? And what drives the reductions going forward here? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much the company's scale explains the improved capital efficiency in the field versus simply cutting fat that was in the prior operator's system, if you will.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, Dan. This is Ray. And that's a great question. And last quarter, we went through a whole litany of examples where they had increased drilling time, employed new downhole mud motors, more aggressive bit designs. We essentially changed out the drilling team. We brought in a gentleman that, Scott Chesebro, who is extremely talented and knows as much about high pressure, high temperature drilling as anybody, around and so he has really reshaped our whole program there. We've recently for example drilled a curve in one of these wells in 24 hours, and the average last year was 86 hours.","So it's just a continual litany of things like that that we've been able to do. We went from, in the series of wells that we fracked in the first quarter we had planned, because in the past they had averaged about eight stages a day or a little bit less, and so we planned for about eight and ended up averaging 12 to 15 stages a day.","So I think it's been a lot of that. It's been a lot of using Range's purchasing power, just simply because of the size and scale that we bring to the table. And then I think as we go forward with a more balanced approach and we kind of smooth out the activity levels and we plan where the wells are a little bit better, as we go forward we won't go through these very variable up and down cycles of activity levels going forward. And I think that will help improve cost as we go forward.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I appreciate the answers. Have a great day. Thank you.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Holly Stewart with Scotia Howard Weil.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning, gentlemen.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","First, maybe Ray, you gave a lot of detail on Terryville and the well results during the quarter, which I think explains the production that we saw in 1Q. But given these dynamics and the fact that you got 29 more wells which are all Range designs, can you maybe help us think through the volume for Terryville for the rest of the year and maybe how that sequential progression goes throughout the quarters?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Sure, Holly. And basically the high level answer is the next 29 wells are going to be a lot better than the first 27. And of course to understand that, you have to compare and contrast a lot of that. And I went through in my remarks and talked about how 21 of the 27 wells were actually wells that were pre-Range. 18 of those were actually more than a year old. So in a lot of ways, we had very little influence on how those wells were picked, where they were, what they were targeted in and so forth.","And then six of the remaining wells, which was the full group of 27, were wells that we took over in one phase or another. We didn't get to pick where they were, but we may have been able to refine the target or different phases \u2013 took over in different phases of operations. And some of those wells, we're testing other horizons and different things like that. So we're learning a lot. We've changed a lot of production facility. We've changed a lot of the early flow-back procedures. We're really focused on project returns instead of just 30-day IPs.","I don't think the previous operator did anything wrong. I think it was just different, and I think we've got a much different approach and as we implement that approach, I think what we've done in these first six or seven months that we've had it under our belt, which again is not very long, but I'm real proud of what the team's accomplished and I think you'll begin to see the results of that going forward. We've shot a lot of 3D seismic. We've done a lot more mapping. We're starting to build reservoir models and we'll be able to place a lot of wells in some of the areas where we've seen really good results. And I think, bottom line, the next group of wells will be a lot better, and that's part of how we get there for the production growth for the year.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Perfect. But any attempt to sort of break down Terryville versus Appalachia in that growth number?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Appalachia is \u2013 we only had about 20% of the wells to come online this year. I think I would attribute some of the changes in Appalachia to \u2013 a lot of it is timing, a lot of it is the team is making really great progress in drilling longer laterals. And you're going to start seeing some of the wells that we've talked about being on existing pads start to domino in the last half of the year. And as we've ramped up activity with the new budget and everything that started in January, a lot of that activity starts domino-ing six to nine to 12 months later, depending on if it's an existing pad or whatnot.","So, essentially we're getting really solid growth from both areas. In Appalachia, there's just a lot of timing that's going to come forward in the second half of the year. I'm really, really excited about some of the recent stuff we've done because since we've now HBP'd our acreage, one of the things that the team has really focused on is some of the very, very best areas. And the two examples I gave in my prepared remarks are certainly extremely impressive. I mean, those are some of the best economics out there, dry, wet, or super-rich.","But there were three more pads that I could have talked about that were 25 million, 26 million, 16 million a day equivalent type constrained rate conditions again. Which I think as you see us do more of that, focus in great areas, long laterals, existing pads, we're going to see really strong growth in the second half of the year out of Appalachia, just like we're going to see I think stronger growth out of North Louisiana. And we're really still solid on our production annual growth targets.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Yeah. Okay. Well, maybe switching gears to Appalachian for the follow up, you mentioned a lot of infrastructure constraints, adding the Harmon Creek plant, the downtime at Houston, and then the new gathering systems. Can you just maybe talk about the timing of these things and how it sort of impacts the near term volume?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","The MarkWest plant, it's something that \u2013 what they're doing there is the original cryogenic plant was about 30 million a day plant, and they are basically going to use that spot and put a new generation 200 million a day plant. So, again it's building a lot of infrastructure for our growth in the coming years. In order to do that, they have to take the whole plant down for day or two to reroute a bunch of power and do different things there. I won't get into too many details. Also part of that, the de-ethanizer will be down for about a week. And so while that will impact our second quarter some, it won't even be a blip in MarkWest's infrastructure. I mean they've gotten so huge now. So it's something we knew about, we forecasted. It's been built into our annual growth plans for some time. So, we're pretty pleased with that.","The new wells up around the Harmon Creek, the future site for the Harmon Creek processing facility, we need to get up there and start drilling wells in preparation for that. We have some basic backbone of the infrastructure up there, but just like our position in southwest Pennsylvania is really, really large. We're far from having all the infrastructure built out, and so as we move to the north, and so forth, you're going to see us add more and more of that infrastructure in compressor stations, the restructure and compressor stations, the processing plants and so forth. And I think the exciting thing is is that could be potentially some of the best rock in the whole core up there. So we're pretty excited about that.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Great. Thanks guys.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Gentlemen, say, question first just guys, I looked, noticed about the \u2013 this is more about sort of allocation of activity in northern that, noticed that northern Marcellus, kind of the drop we've seen year-over-year and sequentially. Could you just talk about kind of rig allocation or activity allocation? Should we expect kind of similar? And I know now you're kind of blending the whole Appalachian together, but as we look particular to northern Marcellus, how should we think about that for the next remainder of the year?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, it's a good question, Neal. We did combine all the operations in Pennsylvania into our southern Marcellus division, or what was previously called that, and it's now we just refer to it as Appalachia. You're right in that we have over the last several years put less and less capital up there as the differentials have been really tough. It's good rock, it's just hard to sell the gas when you've got those kinds of discounts in place up there.","So, we have put it all under one team. It will be much easier to allocate capital with that team up there. They'll put it in their whole mix of assets that they've got across Pennsylvania. I think that they're likely to find some new things. Any time to get a fresh set of eyes looking at project, they're likely to come up with new ideas and they'll put their grass roots plan together going forward and if it competes economically with the projects in southwest PA, then we'll fund it going forward. But at this point, they literally just took it over in the last month. So, I think it will be some time before we see anything happen up there. The good news is it's HBP'd, so we're not really rushed to do anything.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","No, great flexibility there. And then, Ray, just one follow-up, as far as looking at the level of the change that seems like, or encouraged I should say, about the changes in Terryville, when you look at kind of your new pressure management, how should we think about, you did mention, it's not a surprise that the IPs might be a little bit lower. But how should we think about sort of that cumulative production over, I don't know, either the first six, nine or 12 months as you sort of dial that in versus what the previous team had?","Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.","Well, I think what we have \u2013 this is Alan, Neal. I think what we have in the appendix portion of the book, we have some type curves associated for both the Upper Red and Lower Red. And I think what you see in those forecasts is a lower initial rate coming through. And so we would expect to probably with the wells, with the 29 wells going forward that Ray talked about, that we've had our design and everything in there, we would expect those well performance to kind of look somewhat similar to that. I don't have the exact page. I think if you look at -","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","46, 47","Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.","47 and page 47 in the book kind of gives you an idea of what it would look like. Probably what we would see, is you probably won't be starting at that peak rate. You'd probably have to slide that out about 15 days or some for wells to kind of, for wells as they come on, they kind of increase productivity for a little bit. So I would expect it's going to look something similar to that, so a little bit lower rate overall. Similar for the Lower Red that's also in the book as well.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","But overall, Alan, your returns, I guess the way you now are position that, it certainly appears to me like on an EUR return basis, they are a bit better despite that initial little bit lower rate, correct?","Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, I think that's fair to say.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","With the lower well costs.","Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.","With the lower well costs.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Great add. Thanks, guys. Good color.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Just one quick follow-up on Neal's question. Ray, is it safe to assume that part of the same or better economics despite the lower production rates is associated with the upfront costs? I think you mentioned facilities, gathering, flow-back equipment, how much is the cost savings associated with that flow-back to offset the lower initial production?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","That's a good question, Ron. We could get back to you with more exact numbers, but off the top of my head, when you're renting that expensive flow-back equipment for 30 to 60 days, it's several hundred thousand dollars, probably $0.5 million. It tops somewhere in that range. So you're saving a lot of money off the top up front.","Also like much like we've learned and done in the Marcellus over the years, you learn to optimally size your production equipment and make it more generic in nature, so you can kind of stack it, move it around, reallocate it to new wells, pull it off wells that have fallen below that and so forth. So it allows us a lot of overall project flexibility going forward. The team is doing a lot of things on the LOE side. They're doing lot of things on the salt water disposal side.","Again, we've only had it six or seven months, and gone through significant organizational changes. I think the teamwork is really coming to fruition, and you're already seeing, we've already lowered costs faster and further than we thought we would in our expectations. So, we're pretty excited about what we see. But again those well costs, we've cut a lot of the low hanging fruit, but I still think there is a lot of fine tuning that we're going do going forward over the next year. And again, we'll see I think begin to see a lot of that performance and economics really happen in the second half of this year.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay great, and then moving to my question, the super-rich pad that you brought on, you talked about that being in a more lightly drilled portion of Washington County. Why was that area more lightly drilled? Does that de-risk for, in years in industry minds that that portion of the acreage and has that flowed through to kind of the resource potential you thought that area may have?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. Well again, we have a really large position southwest Pennsylvania and we sort of started in the wet area around the Houston plant and you've sort of seen our development expand from that area over the years. We drilled years ago several wells up into the northwest portions of the field and got some early indications. We have full seismic coverage. We've got a lot of information on the field and these recent wells we've gone up there, they're 10,000 foot plus laterals. They're completed with 54 stages using all of the latest technology and we've made wells that are essentially 5,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The wells were making over 1,000 barrels a day of condensate apiece, each well.","So I mean the bottom line is yeah, all that area is completely de-risked. And I think now, we're beginning to become more excited about drilling a whole bunch more 10,000, 15,000 foot laterals up there as we go forward, and it gives us a whole lot of confidence that helps us in sizing the infrastructure and things that are going to be developing over the years ahead. This was something that's been in our plan for many, many years going forward. It's just now really exciting to see it come to fruition and how good those extra long laterals are going to be up there.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great. I appreciate the answers.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Subash Chandra with Guggenheim.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah, hi. I wanted to ask about your frac protect plan in Terryville. Do you expect these offset wells to return to their pre rates, to their prior rates? And could you give us a sense of was it a mile radius or so that you saw the frac interference and how many wells might have been impacted?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, that's a great question. We're still learning exactly how far these wells will impact offset wells, but generally speaking today, I think the thoughts are around 4,000 or 5,000 foot, so about a mile. I think that to answer first part of your question, yes, that production, those wells will eventually come back, some faster than others. And so, that's what I meant in my prepared remarks, while we shut in 40 million a day, while we had all that frac activity going on, some wells come on sooner than others and some come back to where they were sooner than others and there's just a huge variation in that. So I think as we go forward, when you take a much more balanced approach in the second half of the year, you will see wells where we planned that out better to try to mitigate and minimize the amount of impacts, so we don't have to shut in as much production and a lot of those things going forward.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Could you comment on how many wells were shut in?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","I don't know off the top of my head. I guess that's something we could, you could follow with Laith and the guys and we could get an answer, but I just don't know that answer.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Oh, sure, sure. And my follow-up is the Terryville well cost reductions, what was in the CapEx guide? Are you, it sounds like you're overachieving the CapEx guide for the year.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. I think we were probably a little higher than where we were today. Again, we achieved it faster and further than we thought. We're going to do what we always do. We're not going to change our stripes. We're going to use that capital to optimize the plan. There is still a lot of things we want to test. A lot of the southern edges of the field we want to test, the extension areas, it's going to allow us to do more science and diagnostics in that area, help us move that plan forward faster. So, I think that's a good thing in the long run for us.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Jeff, in your slide presentation, you highlight the three pipeline projects that are coming on in the second half of the year. Do you expect to, apart from an initial ramp-up period, fill your firm transportation capacity on those lines? And if so, is some of that moving gas from other existing lines to be more economic on these new lines, and still leaves you with some excess capacity in the system that you could fill if you continue to see better than expected well results?","And separately from that, for the industry, we're not at the 100 rigs you've always talked about that the industry needs to fill the pipe capacity, but as we get to year-end, do you see all this pipe, apart from which you're going to do, being filled by the industry?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. Let me kind of work backwards through that. In order to fill all that capacity, current rig count in Appalachia is somewhere around 64, plus or minus. I'll quote one of our competitors, Rice said they believe I think it's 125 rigs that are needed now in order to have all that filled. We've actually done our own internal work and our number is right around their number. So we think the basin basically needs to almost double the rig count in order to fill the pipes and that needs to happen almost immediately because some of those pipes are going to come on by the end of the year. So we actually believe the pipes all won't fill and there will be excess capacity in the southwest part of the play.","Of course, up in the north, far northeast part of the play, there is really no new pipe coming on this year and probably at the earliest, it's middle of 2018 or something for Atlantic Sunrise to come on up there. So one advantage of where we are in the southwest part of the play is better infrastructure, better takeaway, and it's a really important point. As those pipes come on, it will allow us to \u2013 to get to the first part of your question \u2013 to redirect some of our gas to better markets which should result in continuing to improve margins. A big part of the story this year that I think will extend into next year is margin improvement which translates into better cash flow, better cash flow per share, and coupled with that second half ramp, really helps us set up 2018.","So I think when you look at the infrastructure, the other thing \u2013 and then if you look really forward, the team's done a good job of setting up a diverse portfolio of transportation. We got a huge position where we continue to grow volumes, and as we grow volumes, then we'll have optionality whether to move some of that gas out of basin, to sell some in basin, which will ultimately really drive down, if you look forward, our transportation costs.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So I guess there, I guess part of my question, the corollary is that \u2013 your guidance really isn't dictated by the available pipe capacity, that it could move up given that there could be excess capacity from where you're diverting gas of existing lines.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","There will be that optionality. A big part of that will be cash flow. Our spending for next year will be a function of cash flow or \u2013 at or near cash flow. So, it depends on where you think gas prices are next year, but clearly we have the inventory and ability to grow and move gas. But we'll be somewhat disciplined. We'll be disciplined in order to be at or near cash flow.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then my follow-up for Ray, real quick is, Ray, you mentioned in the press release, you're drilling the two further extension wells to offset the two Terryville wells to the east and west of the Vernon Field. And your press release shows a third extension well. Is that going to be targeting the area to the north that before you had the Lower Red well that came on at about 5 million a day, which was less than the other two? But is there activity to the north of the Vernon Field part of the plan this year, also to go back to that area and see if you can get some better results up there?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","We don't have anything going on right now to the north side of the Vernon Field. That third well is in a different fault block from in the first three that we've talked about. The east and the west ones are pretty encouraging. They both cumed about 1 Bcf each and so we're going to offset those two wells to the east and west. The north one, we haven't done a whole lot with and there is another fault block where that third well is, and we're right now doing a lot of testing on it. So, it's turned into more of a science well than anything at this point.","And so we've kind of got that activity going, and then we've got another area where we're going to put a couple of vertical wells in and do some real serious core-ing and log analysis and micro-seismic imaging and a lot of different things in that area to try to optimize our reservoir models and figure out what the very best target is. I mean, the good news in several of those different fault blocks, and all of those fault blocks are Terryville size or larger, so the potential is really huge. But again, we're going to take our time methodically and strategically and test each one of those as we go forward. But all those fault blocks are different and they all have tons of gas in place, so that's the exciting part of it. We just want to make sure we've got really solid plans going forward.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","In that third fault block that you're going to test, that's east, west, or where is that?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","I don't know that we've disclosed that yet. But I'm sure we'll be talking a lot more about it in the next call.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Thank you. Good morning.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just following up with regards to the extension wells in Northern Louisiana, you've gotten the 1 Bcfe per well over I think it's about 160 days. Can you just add some more color there and parse it with your type curve? What do you think that suggests so far regarding economics and opportunity? Obviously, you've talked to your next steps there.","Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, Brian, this is Alan. We continue to plot those wells up against both the Upper and Lower Red, and they're producing kind of in line with what both those curves that are out there. That's kind of consistent with what we said on the last call when we disclosed the well results at that point in time. So, wells continue to produce similarly with what those type curves are. We're continuing to help understand where we are within the section, continue to gather a lot of data, and I think we're encouraged where we are to date to feel about going ahead and offsetting both those wells. We still like the fact that there is a tremendous amount of gas in place. There is multiple horizons out there, and of course, there is a lot of information we are continuing to glean from the production data as well as offset well performance from both vertical wells as well.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. And then shifting to Appalachia, Range is historically very early in signing low-cost takeaway contracts to get gas out of the region. And recognizing that the wave of new pipelines are coming on now from what you contracted a couple years ago, wanted to get your view on the strategy for growth in the next decade and whether you think it makes economic sense to be thinking about contracting now or whether your flexibility to shift capital geographically means Range down the road will depend more on local market prices and Louisiana prices?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Brian, let me start and others can chime in. I think one thing, if you look at the next decade out, something that's I think not real well understood actually was part of internal work we've done, and I've heard other people talk about it a little bit, but not much, is the concept of sweet spot exhaustion. I think if you really look at core areas in Appalachia, but I think it's true in the Permian, the only two plays I think with more than a decade worth of true sweet spot drilling left is probably Permian and Appalachia.","But when you look in Appalachia, there is only a couple of companies that have more than a decade worth of really high quality wells. Not that a lot of people won't claim that, but when you look at the data and you look at the EURs per thousand and cost per thousand.","So I think again, I think there is only two plays that have more than a decade worth of true sweet spot drilling. A lot of the other plays will be exhausted quicker than that. So if you look in Appalachia, even early on, our thoughts were when you look at all these plays, infrastructure tends to get overbuilt with time. I mean that's true historically.","We assumed that we would get what we thought was right-size transportation early on to allow us that flexibility to grow. So, I think given the position we're in, we're in great shape as we look forward. Again, we don't think the pipes fill early on, but particularly if you look out over the next decade, there will be that optionality probably to sell gas in-basin or we'll have the ability to probably move it out, whatever is more optimum. And with that, I think that will continue to drive down unit costs with time. Again the advantage we have is just a huge inventory of high quality prospects plus we have now the optionality of drilling in Northern Louisiana or in Appalachia. So I think we're well positioned for the future.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We're nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Blaise Angelico with IBERIA for our final question.","Blaise Matthew Angelico - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Yeah hey, good morning guys. Apologies if I missed this early on. But just was wondering if you could talk about what specifically you're going to be changing on the completion design on those Range controlled wells in North Louisiana versus what the prior operator was doing. And then in terms of that well that is completing, is that a second quarter or a third quarter call type of event where you release production rates?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. This is Ray. As far as completion designs, I don't want to get into too many details, but we're looking at stage spacing, the perforation cluster designs. As you can imagine, this is a sandstone. It's not a shale. There's a lot of differences involved here. We're still trying to optimize the targeting and figure out what makes sense to be. And we understand that being in the zone for 100% of the well is certainly, appears to me, making a good difference so far and we got some good examples of that.","So I think that we're doing well on that. It's going to be looking at different fluids, different proppant mixes, different perforation designs and we're far from understanding what we believe the optimum is going to be going forward. We're still working on that issue in the Marcellus, and so I think we'll have a lot of that going forward. And then, the last part of your question, I've already drawn a blank on.","Blaise Matthew Angelico - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Yeah, it was just in terms of that Range controlled well.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Oh yeah, yeah.","Blaise Matthew Angelico - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","That you're just completing, just kind of timing on the production rates on that.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah, we only just started completing it literally a week or two ago. There is going to be a little bit of a lull of time period until the next group of wells that we start completing. So, assuming it comes online in the next month, then we would probably want to see \u2013 I'm looking at Alan here \u2013 but probably three months plus.","Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.","Right.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Of production history. Because again, we've got a completely different flow-back protocol and early production protocol, and so the well we know is going to be constrained a lot longer. So, I would think it's going to be at least probably the call after next before we'll have anything that we can talk about definitively as far as EUR per 1,000 feet or anything like that. I think we'll continue to improve costs, but I think it's just going to take us some time before we can tell you much about that.","Blaise Matthew Angelico - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC","Got you.

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Rodney L. Waller","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported outstanding results for the second quarter of 2013, with record production and continuing decrease in unit cost. Both earnings and cash flow per share results were greater than first call consensus. The order of our speakers on the call of the day are: Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Also, Mr. Pinkerton, our Executive Chairman is on the call today. [Operator Instructions]","Range did file our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on the home page of our website or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we have posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call.","Now let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thank you, Rodney. With our existing portfolio of properties, we believe that we can grow our overall production at a rate of 20% to 25% per year for many years. As the largest acreage position in our company, Range has approximately 1 million net acres in Pennsylvania as the engine that will drive our growth. We have both the assets necessary to grow our production and a proven team in place to carry out our plan. In addition, we believe that we've lined up the critical processing and takeaway capacity for the next several years.","On the liquid side of our business in Pennsylvania, we have entered into 3 agreements to transport and sell ethane. The first project, Mariner West, commenced line fill on July 21. Since our sales point is FOB to MarkWest Houston plant, line fill to Range equals sales. The Mariner West project is significant in that the de-ethanizer at the MarkWest Houston plant in Washington County Pennsylvania is currently the only operating de-ethanizer in the Appalachian basin. This project is very important for Range in 2 regards: First, with the vast majority of our wet Marcellus gas being processed at the Houston plant, coupled with our dry Marcellus gas production elsewhere, 95% of our Marcellus production will meet pipeline specs, a key factor in ensuring that Range's gas will continue to flow. The remaining 5% of our Marcellus production flows to the MarkWest Majorsville plant in West Virginia, where de-ethanizers are expected to be in place and running in 6 to 9 months. If there are issues in the interim, Range has the ability to redirect the majority of the 5% of the gas that flows to Majorsville.","The second thing that Mariner West project does is allows us to continue to grow and build our overall production volumes. Mariner West, combined with ATEX, which is projected to come online next year and Mariner East, which is expected to come online with the ethane portion of the project in 2015, will enable Range to sell 55,000 barrels of ethane per day. Assuming minimum ethane extraction, this level of ethane sales will enable us to produce 1.8 Bcf per day of wet natural gas into the processing plants. When this wet gas volume is processed, and the gas is shrunk and the natural gas liquids and condensate are added to it, we are projecting that these 3 projects will enable Range to produce about 2.2 Bcfe per day net from just the wet and super-rich portions of our acreage.","Adding in the dry gas, we have the potential to exceed 3 Bcfe per day net. Bear with me for a couple of minutes and I'll quickly walk through the math. With these 3 projects, we have the capacity to produce 55,000 of ethane, barrels of ethane per day. Assuming minimum ethane recovery, this equates to 1.8 Bcf per day of wet gas into the processing plant. In addition to the 55,000 barrels of ethane, natural gas liquids and condensate could potentially total an additional 140,000 barrels per day. Total liquids production potentially could then be about 195,000 barrels per day. We're using a 6:1 conversion, 1.2 Bcfe per day net -- or Bcfe per day. After the liquids are removed from the 1.8 Bcf per day of gross inlet gas, the gas volume would shrink the 1.4 Bcf per day. Adding the 1.4 Bcf per day of natural gas to the 1.2 Bcfe per day of natural gas liquids and condensate equals 2.6 Bcfe per day gross, or about 2.2 Bcfe per day net. That's from the wet and super-rich portions of the Marcellus. If you add in the dry gas potential, we have the potential to exceed 3 Bcf per day from the Marcellus alone, with the 3 ethane projects we already have under contract. This is a key element which gives us the confidence a project 20% to 25% growth for many years.","On a compounded basis, growing at 20% to 25% per year equates to doubling production roughly every 3 to 4 years. In addition to having the projects in place to extract, transport and sell the liquids, we have secured enough firm transportation and firm sales to handle our projected gas sales for several years.","In 2014, we have firm capacity in term sales for over 80% of our production. Our team has been working on these projects for many years, and is putting the pieces in place so that we can continue to grow production profitably beyond our current arrangements.","On the operations side, we just updated our results and provided our expectations for the future drilling in Southwest Pennsylvania of our super-rich wet and dry wells on an EUR per thousand foot of lateral basis. In addition, we've updated all of our projected reserves and economics for these areas based on our updated well designs. Well designs range from 4,200 feet to 5,000-foot laterals, with over 20 frac stages per well. The average projected recovery for these wells ranges from 10.9 to 12.3 Bcfe per well.","As shown on Slide 23 of our investor presentation on our website, under current strip pricing, the rate of return for the dry, wet and super-rich projects are all about 100% pretax rate of return. Reinvestment risk in all 3 areas is low, and economics for all 3 areas are high. Therefore, our plans are to drill and develop all 3 areas.","We also just released the results of our 500-foot tighter spacing project in the Marcellus. Based on 3 years of history, the project is very encouraging, and we're projecting that our 500-foot space wells will recover about 80% of 1,000-foot space well. That both increases our resource potential and provides us additional confidence that we can grow at 20% to 25% for many years with high returns, low cost and low reinvestment risk.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations in more detail.","Ray N. Walker","Thanks, Jeff. My remarks today will primarily focus on the Marcellus in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Our technical teams continue to make great strides applying newer technologies and approaches such as RCS, enhanced completion designs, longer laterals and better targeting. We've updated and provided guidance for our development plans for all 3 areas, dry, wet and super-rich, as well as adding some new data. There's been a lot of discussion lately concerning well performance on a normalized lateral length basis, so we've included actual performance data on a per thousand foot of lateral length basis for all 3 areas in Southwest PA, as we believe we have some of the best performance data in the basin. Wellhead economics returns in Southwest PA of strip processing in all 3 areas are now approximately 100%. The bottom line, all 3 areas are high-quality assets, and like our philosophy has always been, it's really about economic returns at Range.","Our ability to achieve those high returns in dry gas drilling, wet gas drilling and drilling in the super-rich area allows us to confidently grow our production at 20% to 25% year-over-year for many years. Let's start with the super-rich area.","We've now added Slide #14 in our presentation showing the actual production data of the 17 wells that we've discussed in the last couple of calls, as compared to the average production curve of our pre-2013 results. It's early, but the actual production data shows that these 17 wells are producing to sales 50% better than the pre-2013 curve, with over 4 months of production history. Again, this is not based on just a forecast, it's actual production data to sales and we are very encouraged by what we see so far.","Also on the super-rich area, in early July, we brought online a new well that produced 3,670 BOE per day at 72% liquids, while choked back due to gathering system limitations. That rate included over 1,000 barrels per day of condensate. Just 2 weeks ago, it was the highest 24-hour maximum rate to date at any well in the Marcellus with more than 50% liquids. However, I'm happy to report that, that record did not last very long. Last week, we brought online another well approximately 10 miles away at 5,720 BOE per day with 63% liquids, which 24% of those liquids was condensate. This well is now the highest rate IP liquids well with more than 50% liquids, not only in the Marcellus, but in the entire basin, in the modern era that we're aware of. Again, these are only IPs, and it's still very early but we believe we are seeing some real upside potential as we implement these new well designs.","I'm going to pause for just a second here and offer my congratulations to the Southern Marcellus Shale division team for the great results. And just like the team in Pittsburgh, I don't believe we've drilled our best well yet.","On Slides 15 and 16, you can see our updated cost, EURs and economics for the super-rich area. You can also see our well performance on an EUR per thousand foot of lateral basis. We steadily increased lateral length and the number of stages while combining that with better targeting and completion science. We are now and into 2014 drilling 20% longer laterals and completing them with 50% more stages. All of this yielding better and better EURs, higher efficiencies, lower unit cost and the resulting economics that you see in our presentation. And we still believe there's substantial upside as we get more and more of these wells under our belt.","In the wet area, we also continue to see improving well performance for all the same reasons. Going forward, we plan to drill, on average, 4,200-foot laterals and complete with 21 stages. We project these wells to have an EUR of 12.3 Bcf equivalent, which is a 41% increase from our last projection. We've also included in this analysis for this area an EUR per thousand foot of lateral basis comparison. Again, we've seen improvement year-over-year, and we believe we have some of the best wells in the basin that are on an EUR per thousand foot basis, are nearly 3 Bcf equivalent per 1,000 feet of lateral length. We brought online 15 wells in the wet area this year, with an average IP of 13.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day with 38% liquids. Those wells were mostly drilled in 2012, and averaged 2,627-foot laterals with 14 stages. It used to be that a single well IP of 13.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day was a real game changer. But let me point out that today's game changers that this is a 15 well average from only 2,627-foot laterals that we drilled back in 2012. Although these are really impressive completions to date, especially if you look at them on a normalized per 1,000 feet of lateral length basis, we are now drilling longer laterals with RCS completions and expect bigger EURs and no returns.","In the dry area of Southwest PA, we brought online 16 wells so far this year, averaging 2,942-foot laterals with 15 stages. Again, those wells were either permitted or drilled back in 2012. But if you look at Slide #21 in our presentation, you can see that these wells, on a lateral length basis are almost 2.5 Bcf equivalent per thousand foot of lateral, and are already some of the best-performing wells in Southwest PA. Going forward, we're drilling wells in this area with an average lateral length of 5,000 feet, and completing them with 25 stages. We expect those wells to have an EUR of 12.2 Bcf, which is 2.44 Bcf per thousand foot of lateral, and we expect them to cost approximately $6 million.","At today's strip pricing, these wells would yield a return of 97% and an NPV 10 of $12.7 million. It's important to point out with these newer designs, these wells now compete favorably with our super-rich and wet area economics.","If you look at Slide #23 on the website, you'll see the real punchline. We've presented a side-by-side comparison of all 3 areas in Southwest PA. Economic returns in all 3 areas are approximately 100%, with EURs ranging from 10.9 up to 12.3 Bcf equivalent. Again, it's all about returns and cash flow at Range, and we believe this demonstrates the high-quality, low reinvestment risk and the diversity, along with the balance of our portfolio of projects.","Okay, shifting to Oklahoma. For the Horizontal Mississippian play, we've become more aggressive with the frac designs, primarily going back to the larger frac jobs which are yielding really good results. There's 3 recent wells listed in the press release with these larger volume fracs with IPs ranging from 957 to 1,306 BOE per day, and oil production rates from 230 up to 625 barrels of oil per day. All 3 of these wells are in line with or above our expectations. Going forward, on average, we still expect to be right in line with our expectations of EURs ranging from 485 to 600 MBOE per well.","I'll shift now to the other divisions across the company. In Nora, our last 4 horizontal Huron Shale wells have been the best-performing wells to date, so congratulations to Jerry and the team. They've implemented some new well designs and completions that appeared to be working really well. For Northeast PA and the other areas across the company, you can refer to our earnings release for updates on the activity in those areas, and we can certainly cover any of those areas during Q&A.","Production for the third quarter will be set at 945 million to 950 million cubic feet equivalent per day, with approximately 22% of that production being liquids. We've had great success during the first half of 2013, and we're on track for the year to approach the high end of our previously announced range of 20% to 25% year-over-year production growth.","In summary, our technical and operations teams all across the company are doing a great job, working safely, being a good stewards of the environment and good citizens of the communities where we live and work. We're really proud of our people and our high-performing culture at Range. We continue to work safely, protect the environment, meet our goals, make better wells and improve our cost structure quarter after quarter. All of this, combined with our high-quality, diverse and balanced portfolio, gives us confidence that we can deliver 20% to 25% production growth for many years into the future. Now over to Roger.","Roger S. Manny","Thanks, Ray. 2013's second quarter extends the positive trends evident in the first quarter, namely, significantly stronger cash flow derived from higher revenue and lower unit cost. Oil, gas and NGL sales for the quarter were $416 million, up 34% from the second quarter of last year. Cash margin likewise improved, with second quarter cash margin coming in at $2.71 per Mcfe, a 15% increase over last year. With top line growth outpacing expense growth, cash flow for the second quarter was $227 million, 46% over last year's second quarter. Cash flow per share for the second quarter was $1.40, 44% higher than last year.","EBITDAX for the second quarter was $269 million, 37% higher than last year. GAAP net income, which includes noncash hedging mark-to-market entries, asset sales gains and other non-recurring items, were $144 million for the second quarter. Earnings calculated using analyst methodology, which excludes these items, was $55 million, more than double last year's second quarter earnings of $18 million.","Please remember that all non-GAAP figures I just mentioned are fully reconciled to GAAP on the Range website. You may have noticed that last year, we began sighting our unit cost guidance in our quarterly earnings release. With this practice established, beginning with this call, in order to allow more time for operations updates and Q&A, I will no longer be providing detailed quarterly cost performance commentary and guidance. I'll confine my remarks to quarterly cost items, where our actual quarterly results differed from guidance.","Our first better-than-guidance cost item is third-party transportation gathering and compression at $0.80 per Mcfe, that's $0.02 below guidance due to the timing of expenditures, well hookups and a higher-than-projected production. We believe that $0.80 to $0.82 slot is a good estimate for the third quarter. Reduction in ad valorem taxes for the second quarter of $0.13 per Mcfe was $0.02 below guidance due to higher production from lower-cost areas. Our current estimate of third quarter production tax is between $0.14 and $0.15.","Exploration expense, excluding noncash compensation, was $12 million for the quarter, quite a bit below guidance due to the timing of seismic expenditures. Our seismic budget for the year hasn't changed, so next quarter should see this expense increase to between $19 million and $21 million. Unproved property impairment for the second quarter at $19 million was $2 million over guidance, reflecting the write-off of some nonstrategic unproved acreage in Texas. Third quarter should see this expense back in the $15 million to $17 million range.","G&A expense was $0.01 over guidance at $0.43 per Mcfe, due primarily to higher legal fees. We anticipate cash G&A unit cost for the third quarter to be between $0.40 and $0.42 per Mcfe. Lastly, interest expense on a unit cost basis is beginning to reflect the benefits of both higher production and the recent refinancing of several high-cost long-term bonds. Second quarter interest expense per Mcfe was well below our guidance at $0.54. Next quarter, we should see this expense fall another $0.02 to $0.03 in Mcfe.","Over on the Range balance sheet, the major changes since last quarter are the closing of the Permian asset sale, which garnered an $83 million pretax gain and the early redemption of the $250 million 7 1\/4 notes, which were pre-funded by the issuance of lower-cost 5% notes during the first quarter. And at the end of the second quarter, Range had approximately $1.4 billion in committed available liquidity under its credit facility, and approximately $1.6 billion in total available liquidity under our $2 billion credit facility borrowing base.","Earlier in the second quarter, Range added to its 2013, 2014 and 2015 hedge position with additional natural gas, oil and NGL hedges. Please reference to Range website and press release tables for detailed hedge volumes and prices.","In conclusion, the standout financial metric this quarter is the 46% increase in year-over-year quarterly cash flow. This increase illustrates the significance of steadily increasing production, combined with slightly higher prices and slightly lower cost. With production anticipated to increase 20% to 25% for many years to come, and our economies of scale still building, we look forward to many future quarters of cash flow growth.","Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Jeff and Ray, question on your lateral lengths in terms of driving the increase in returns in EURs. Ray, do you think you're about where you think you're going to be from a lateral length in terms of 4,500 feet? Or as you move further throughout the year or next few quarters that you may end up continuing to push those out, lateral lengths even further like others in industry have? And would you expect similar impacts on EURs?","Ray N. Walker","That's a good question, Ron. We currently have or are implementing the designs that we've just put in the presentation. So we're driving the wet area up to the 4,500-foot range, the dry area to 5,000-foot. And again, those, when we present them in the presentation, they're really an average of the whole program, so we're always drilling some that are longer than those, and some that are shorter. So our absolute goal is, yes, to drive these laterals longer and longer as they get in time. But right now, our best estimate of what we've got planned for next year are the numbers that we've got in the presentation, that we're presenting in the earnings release.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, good. And just on the 3 years worth of data you had on the down spacing, relative to expectations in terms of the 80% EUR of the 1,000-foot laterals, where does that -- where did that come out relative to your expectations and is that something that, as you move forward from a development standpoint, you'll plan on being closer to 50 or 60 acre spacing across your play? Or where do you think that will settle out?","Ray N. Walker","I think the -- our expectations going into -- we're probably in that 75% to 80% range. I think we see that in a lot of different fields across the country. It's a little bit hard to estimate and that's one reason that we wanted to see some real production history before we came out with numbers. We're dealing with a shale that's clearly better than anything we've ever seen before, and I want to look at that. I believe that we think that there's potentially some upside, they could perform a little better than that as we implement some of the RCS and some of the better targeting that wasn't actually done in these laterals. So I do think there's more upside in that, and I'm not sure what the second part of your question was, but I do think we see that there'll be down space or a tighter spacing, is a better way to say it, potential across all through the Marcellus.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And is the 12 to 15 Ts just related to the Marcellus in your wet and super-rich areas? Does that include any -- or any resource potential for Upper Devonian or anything else?","Ray N. Walker","No, the 12 to 15 TCF equivalent that we added is only Marcellus, and only in the wet and super-rich area.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, when we think about the Southwest Marcellus and the rates of return that you guys have outlined, and you compare that to rates return on the Northeast or Nora, well those are held by production property, it would seem like are primarily held by production. You wouldn't want to be pushing the drill bit there, really at all. You'd want to be redirecting drill bit and all capital toward Southwest Marcellus. Does those -- put those up as potential divestiture assets over time?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I think, one, when you look at the wells in the northern Marcellus, or the stuff up in the Northeast, you're going to see the same-type thing. We didn't update it this time. You're going to see some wells where you're going to have 5,000; 6,000; 7,000-foot laterals, and we'll be -- obviously, we share that technology throughout the company. In fact, throughout the industry and knowing what and what others are doing as well, so beware. I mean, I think you're going to see some impressive things in the future coming from that team, and we have a really strong team up there as well. We always look at redirecting our capital into the highest return areas that we have. We're focused on growing production per share, reserves per share, cash flow per share and bottom line, like we said, we think can basically at that 20% to 25% double and double again. That's being said, we look at all of our portfolio, and we look at the opportunities in there. Clearly, we're focused on per share growth. We have sold $2.3 billion worth of assets or something like that in the last few years, so we try to do the best things and keep focused. Now that being said, we think, the -- just like Ray mentioned, the stuff in the Southern Appalachian Basin, although at today's prices it doesn't compete, but one, we not only is it all HBP, we own the minerals on a lot of it, so we actually have the royalty, which is a real advantage. And the little bit of capital we've spent there, they're doing the same thing, they're drilling longer laterals with more stages and significantly improving the returns there, which we haven't shared with you and updated, but there's a lot of upside and potential. But that being said, we will continually look at doing what we think is most optimum things for our shareholders.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that. And then, maybe as a follow-up, dive in a little deeper in to the Southwest Marcellus, as you build out the ethane delivery capabilities and go from, call it 1,500 to 15,000 to 65,000 barrels of ethane extraction, can you relate that to what that means in terms of the amount of gas you can be producing, without violating pipeline limitations? In other words, the gas -- the true dry gas production growth that a company is that, or that's facilitated by that?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I'll try to walk through some of those numbers that I did earlier. I know that was a lot of numbers, and I went through them pretty quick. But with -- just with the 3 deals we have in hand, combined, those 3 deals are 55,000 barrels of ethane per day. So and that's just, obviously related to the wet and the super-rich, so that enables us to put 1.8 Bcf of wet natural gas into the processing plants with those 3 deals. And again, with the 55,000 barrels of ethane and the 1.8 Bs of gas, you get in an additional 140,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids and condensates. So it's 1.8 Bs of gas plus -- and when you add the 55,000 of ethane, and the 140,000 of natural gas liquids and condensates, 195,000 barrels of liquids, plus 1.8 Bcf per day into the plant. And in addition, so that's what -- just those 3 deals. Obviously, our team is looking ahead to grow and do everything else, and then on top of that, then you've got to add the dry gas areas, which you don't need the processing for. Indeed, we have great dry gas position in the Southwest PA and again, we went through there. We think in the Southwest, and when you look at those things on a per lateral foot basis, they're excellent and drilling 5,000-foot lateral with 25 stages, we think they're going to be over 12 Bcf wells. And plus, we've got some great dry gas acreage in the Northeast as well. So and that's really what I was trying to lay out. Our team's done a very good job. We have a long-range plan looking at how we're going to develop the asset, how we're going to grow at that 20% to 25% or wherever ends up being optimum and have laid in place to take away for the ethane, take away for these other natural gas liquids, and as well as layering in the dry gas pieces. And then on top of that, you have to fold in the rest of the company and what we do with that as well. That's why we have the confidence to say we can consistently drill at 20% to 25% per year with -- at low cost, with high returns. Again, going back to Page 23 in the rates of return that Ray mentioned. So that hopefully that answered your question. So it's 1.8 Bs just in that area, plus all those 195,000 barrels of liquids plus your dry gas.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","That does, if I could just do one more follow-up. When you start outlining that kind of gas production and we think of peers who are out there, both in dry gas, wet gas window, people who are in the dry gas window of the Utica, ultimately, what does that do for you guys, in terms of thinking about the macro gas picture? Is gas ultimately, then going to be, surpassing the demand of the Eastern markets and flowing back to Gulf Coast markets and what might that mean to pricing?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, I think, you always look at the pricing, where the markets are, and we've got 80% of our 2014 needed transport and marketing arrangements already in place. That other 20% really allows us to hit the spot and other attractive markets that are developing because of the displacement that the markets -- that the Marcellus is doing. There will be some pricing pressures in certain areas of the Marcellus where more gas is coming online than producers have a market for. Luckily, in the Southwest area, we're fortunate to have 6 of the largest pipelines in Appalachia running through the core of our Southwest area. We estimate that, that would equate to 15 to 20 Bcf a day of transportation capacity and opportunity to reach markets that are a forward haul or backhaul, as you alluded to, to hit those markets as to where you need to be. Fast markets, generally in the U.S., the premium markets are going to turn over about every 3 to 4 years, so therefore, you need the flexibility to hit those markets and keep those market arrangements fresh. So that's our portfolio and that's what we're focused on. Therefore, we think the capacity that's already in place, then as they have additional expansions come on in the basin, that will actually relieve the pressure on those existing capacities, which should give us more opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just kind of sticking with the Marcellus here. Obviously, you guys dramatically increased your type curves in Southwest PA. One thing, just noticing on some of those numbers is that it looks like really the NGL and the gas components were up significantly in the EURs, while the condensate component really wasn't as much. Could maybe you guys address that?","Ray N. Walker","What we've done is, like we've done continuously over the last 6 or 7 years is, as we get more and more data, we're just trying to refine that and make better and better estimates. I mean, that helps us forecast what we need as far as capacity and condensate sales and storage and facilities and all the things that go with that, so that's been a gradual process. So what we're putting forward is, what we believe we're going to expect to see going forward. And I think the condensate issue, we believe there's some upside there, there's no question about that. We clearly got some IPs that are huge, that are really fun to talk about. But I think we're going to be reluctant to forecast those wells until we see a lot more of them. Those -- we don't want to take something that's a highlight real type item, and then build all our forecast off of that. So we're still looking at a lot of normal distribution of results and we still try to use that going forward. So everything we've put in here is our best estimate going forward, and we did put some new type curves in the back of the book, Page 36, 37 or -- and 38, to update all of those and their byproducts. So you'll see all of the actual things. And that's all based on wells, actual wells, that we have planned for '14. I mean, we've got well names, we got most of the permits in place, everything's already set, so I think that's a very good approximation of what we've got planned to go forward.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. So you guys aren't seeing, maybe declining condensate yield on the wells in the wet and the super-rich, at this point?","Ray N. Walker","No. I think it's more a factor of just where you drill. I mean, as we go from the East side to the West side, your BTU changes, your maturities, so you've got more condensate on the West side, more heavier portions of the NGL barrel. You also have more ethane on that side. You just flat got more liquids. We've got some wells that are 80% plus liquids, all the way down into the low teens on the eastern edge of the wet areas. So I think it's just more timing and when those wells hit on the schedule and all of that. And again, what we're doing is taking all of that and making a forecast at an average type curve, and putting that in the book, so it's probably just more of an impact of that than anything else.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and I guess on your dry wells in Southwest Pennsylvania, if you guys have these bar charts in terms of [indiscernible] in '11 and '12, and then sort of forecast for 13 and '14, that one kind of stand out a little bit to me, because it looks like your EURs per 1,000 lateral foot on the dry in Southwest PA were actually going down a little bit where the wet and the super-rich were going up pretty substantially. Just wanted to get some color on why you think that is there?","Ray N. Walker","Sure. The wells that are coming online in '13 are actually wells that we planned, permitted and probably mostly drilled in 2012. A lot of those weren't -- were not using the best targeting methods that we know today. They weren't using RCS completions and different things like that. So you're going to see that impact things going forward. But what we've also done -- what we've typically done is, as we drill these much longer laterals, we're not assigning a 1-for-1 add, as you add stages going forward. We're taking a real conservative approach and putting the risk factor on those additional stages that might be further and further out in that longer lateral. In other words, 1 plus 1 is not always 2 in our mind when you're adding that. So that's -- it's just simply our best conservative estimate at this point of what those wells will be. Will they do better? I actually believe they will, but again, there's still a lot of upside in that area, and we're seeing some really impressive results there. And looking at -- it's not only us looking at offset operators in the area, there's some really nice wells that are being made out there. So we, again, believe, there's -- we're going to see a lot of upside in the EUR per thousand foot even when you look at it that way.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right, and I guess, am I correct in assuming that you've got a lot fewer wells and fewer production history in dry in Southwest Pennsylvania versus the wet areas, is that right?","Ray N. Walker","Oh, absolutely. Yes, that, a lot of that acreage is already HBP-ed for us. It was legacy assets that we had, and -- but we don't have the same number of wells there yet, that we have in the wet area.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right, so I guess that would explain the conservatism here overall for you guys then?","Ray N. Walker","Absolutely. Yes.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess just jumping over to the Mississippian real quick, I think you guys have previously talked about on prior calls, now roughly doubling the rig count in 2014, getting roughly double the activity. Obviously, I know you guys have added efficiencies, you don't have to add as many rigs, but given a bit of a slow start to the year in the program, I know you guys explain that in your press release. And also given the fact that the returns on the Marcellus look like they've improved quite a bit, we potentially expect lower levels of activity in the Miss, and maybe shifting more activity to the Marcellus next year? How we -- should we think about that?","Ray N. Walker","I think the best way to answer that is, that we've always said the Horizontal Mississippian play is really an emerging play. We've got 160,000 net acres there. It looks real impressive to us. We have experimented with different style fracs and designs and so forth. We feel like it's on track, things are looking pretty good. But at this point, like we said, even though we used to say in the past it was going to be 5, 10, 15 rigs forward, that was always with the caveat that we had to see the results going forward. And that's why it's only a small portion of our budget and so forth. But I think we'll reserve the right to make that decision until we lock in the budget towards the end of the year with the board. But I do think there's still a lot of upside there, but we're just going to have to wait and see what the results look like at the -- towards the end of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, I'm afraid I'm going to go back to the Marcellus as well. The pace of completions in the second half of the year clearly slows down quite dramatically. Is that a function of the higher cost of the longer lateral wells? And I just wonder if you could help us with a little bit of color as to how those sort of wells are much higher return, or at least a much higher return, with a higher CapEx. What does that mean in terms of activity levels, as it relates to rig count going into 2014?","Ray N. Walker","Doug, that's a great question. I think the -- it's more related to the fact that we've got a big capital budget. We're not going to raise it, we're going to stick to it. And what we saw early in the year is what we've seen for the last several years, is the Southern Marcellus shale division, just like a lot of divisions across the company, is making really great improvements in efficiency. I mean, the rigs are down to 4 or 5 days in some cases now. The frac crews are doing 9 stages in 24 hours, where a year ago, they are doing 3, 4 and 5 stages in 24 hours. So what happens is, you kind of by default end up frontloading the capital during the front portion of the year because we just get a lot more wells online. So we'll see a gradual slow down. We are also with the longer laterals. It's basically the drilling rate. The drilling rate times not a lot longer, but the completion time does add to it, when you go from 14 stages to 20-plus stages, it will take longer. And so I think when you combine those 2 things, you're going to see what we typically have always seen up there in the Marcellus, that the year tends to be frontloaded and then the rate of completions or the rate of wells coming online towards the end of the year will slow down.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That was very clear. So just to be -- I guess, just to be clear on that, so currently, your backlog is in the low 40s, as I recollect?","Ray N. Walker","I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The backlog of uncompleted wells is sitting in the low 40s, where would you expect that to get to by the end of the year?","Ray N. Walker","I think the total backlog is about 70, and I think it will come down slightly by the end of the year.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I guess, my follow-up is really going back to the question about the lateral end. I mean, you've talked about obviously, you've stepped these up pretty ratably over the last several years. But are you testing longer laterals beyond what you've disclosed in your latest guidance? In other words, where does the 4,000-foot lateral go to next, in terms of what you think might be optimal over the [indiscernible]?","Ray N. Walker","Yes, absolutely. And again, remember, these type curves and economics that we're quoting for you are the average of the program going forward through 2014 and into '15, actually. So, yes, we will drill quite a few longer laterals and quite a few shorter. I think our longest lateral today is about 6,000-foot. I suspect we'll probably go to 7,000 in some cases. The wells, the highlight well that I talked about being over 5,000 to 5,720 barrel a day well, that was a 5,000-foot lateral. So we're already doing it, and yes, and we will continue to basically experiment with longer and longer laterals and more and more stages, trying to find that optimum project return, which is what we're focused on, so.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, is there any limitation in terms of having the older sections bolted together that might limit you going to a more aggressive well design as we go forward?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","No. I think, the team's doing a great job of planning and looking at those opportunities and just consistently really, ever since we've been in the play, year after year, the wells get better. And given where we are, and given the fact that probably longer laterals with more stages, better targeting, more RCFs, will probably continue to drive up performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan McSpirit from BMO Capital Markets.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","In years, what do you model as the life for wells drilled in the Marcellus? And in what year is terminal decline achieved? And as a follow-up to that, does any of that change much with an increase in lateral length or change in completion design?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, we have with us Alan Farquharson, Senior Vice President of Reservoir Engineering, so he heads up all that for the entire company. I'll just turn it over to Alan then, of course.","Alan W. Farquharson","Thanks, Dan. First of all, the life that we model is about 45 years, out for the Marcellus is what you're seeing in there right now. I cannot specifically give you when we get to the terminal decline rate right off the top of my head, but I can tell you that we do use a multiple decline rate. We're using more than 2 in the projections that we have, so you're not looking at a single B factor going throughout the entire life of the well. I'd have to get back to you on the exact time of when we hit a terminal decline rate, but it's fairly far out in the future.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","You can coordinate with our IR team, and they can set a call up with Alan to get into some more of the specifics.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great, and just maybe a follow-up to that, is there any impact on the decline rates on wells drilled under the tighter spacing scenario, if at all?","Alan W. Farquharson","Well, I think your question is, is the shape of the curve going to look a lot different on tighter wells than what it is on the wider spaced wells?","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Right.","Roger S. Manny","Is that kind of the general question? Now as you can kind of see in the book on...","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Page 25.","Alan W. Farquharson","On Page 25, they actually do follow a relatively similar decline rate and obviously, a lot of those wells, with 3 years of history, we -- that was one of the reasons, as Ray mentioned earlier, we want to make sure we had enough information on these wells before we came out and talked about them. But overall, to date, they found very, very similar production profiles in terms of decline rates.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Great. And then lastly, just turning to the balance sheet, quickly. Can you repeat for me the leverage goals for year end, and maybe periods beyond?","Roger S. Manny","Yes, sure, Dan. I mean, we -- Range is an operating strategy driven company, not a financial strategy driven company, so we don't have hard leverage goals out there that we're going to manage to. We're going to manage the operations first, and then we're just going to keep that leverage and, for a lack of better term, our comfort zone. And as we've kind of talked about before, that comfort zone extends into the low 3 times debt-to-EBITDAX range, and then obviously as low as it needs to go to address the times that we're operating in. So right at about 2.8x, trailing 4 quarter debt to EBITDAX at the end of the second quarter, it's well down from fourth quarter of last year. And as we've said, based on current prices in our current hedge book, that ratio will grind down over time, not to any specific objective, but clearly at 2.8, we're very comfortable with that level of leverage, and are just fine anywhere in that zone.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","When you look at that long-term plan, about 20% to 25% growth for many years and basically doubling every 3 to 4 years, keeping our capital outspend to that $250 million to $350 million over cash flow in the early years, as we continue to grow, we strip pricing, we significantly de-lever over time, so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hsulin Peng with Robert W. Baird.","Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So my first question is, given that you're drilling longer lateral wells, can you discuss how this will affect your HBP schedule for acreage in Marcellus?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, I think we're in great shape there. We break it out by area, and like we've said many times, we've got a plan to basically hold all that acreage we want to hold. It'll happen with time. And I think an important thing to consider beyond that is, in addition to drilling to hold it which we'll ultimately do, all the leases that we'll be drilling also have extensions, on that number of tickers, so we have more than enough time to hold acreage, but we have a clear plan for that, and that will happen, and will.","Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, so a more high-level question. Given the updated resource potential and nearly 2 million acres with a stack pay in the Northeast, can you give us your current thoughts on how you are thinking about, in terms of potentially accelerating or optimizing the value of these assets, especially in the back end of the value? If you're happy with the status quo, with the organic growth, how -- I guess, what could be some trigger points where you or and the board could reevaluate your strategy?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, we do that, really in realtime, I won't say constantly, but frequently. It's something we're always looking at, is how do we maximize the value of our company. So again, I've said this before, at year end last year, where you're at net, at around 0.8 Bs per day, 20%, 25% growth in 3 years, we think we'll be about 1.6 Bcfe per day net. And go out another 3 years, that's 3.2 over 3 Bs. So we think, in that, from the end of the last year, in that roughly 6-year timeframe, we'll be over 3 Bs per day net, which is -- and I tried to lay that out pretty clearly in my notes upfront, near my call notes upfront, to say that we've got the liquids agreements, and a lot of the gas processing and everything in place to get there, which is phenomenal growth. The key is, it doesn't stop at 3 Bs per day, with the inventory we have, 3 can become 4, 5 or 6, which is, and then again, look at all the other E&P companies in the U.S. on a net basis, that's phenomenal growth for a company our size, with our market cap. Importantly, from very low-risk areas that, basically all that acreage in the Southwest and in the North East is de-risked. So it has very low reinvestment risk, there's a lot of drilling around it, the quality of the wells are excellent, yet they're getting better. Costs are coming down so we'll look at that all the time. We think we have a great plan that laid out, so we're not just looking at what do we want to do in 1 year or 2, it's in what do we want to do in your 1, 3, 5, 10 and beyond. However, we continually look at optimizing it. Like I said, we've sold $2.3 billion or so worth of assets in the last few years, so we're always looking at building and high grading as well, or where there more optimum ways to do it. But what we really think, if we -- if nothing else, if we just consistently execute on the plan we laid out, we think we will really drive up production per share, reserves per share and cash flow per share consistently with time in one of the highest rate of return plays out there. That being said, we'll always look and see if there's better ways to do our business.","Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then last question is more macro. So we have seen a bit of volatility with the Appalachian basis differential recently. And so I'm just wondering if you can give us more details on how you're -- where your pricing points are in -- within Appalachia, how you sell the contract for your gas sales, and how do you navigate through these volatile differential environment?","Roger S. Manny","We've got a great marketing team that's been doing this. So the contracts that we have today were put in place 2 to 3 years ago. That was a time to put them in place for these types of times, so that you've got contracts with pricing that goes through the soft periods as other producers bring on gas. Range does not bring any gas to market that doesn't already have a buyer on the other end, so we're not pushing any of that basis differential. Then we've moved our contacts to stay out as much as possible out of any Appalachian indexed type of price to minimize that. And then, of course, we've got our hedge position from that area. But basically, with the flexibility that we have, with the dynamic market that you have, with marketing arrangements and working with one of the largest producers in Appalachia, we have access to a lot of markets that give us this opportunity to lock in prices on a long-term basis. And that's going to be able to get us through these periods of time until other facilities, other producers get built, that allows us to continue to maximize our value.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Say, just a question on the Slide 10, where you guys break out by the wet and dry acreage and show different stack pays. I was wondering, kind of question about the Utica. Obviously, it looks like you do have a lot of potential for the Utica and, again, I'm just wondering as far as going after that or drilling other than that prior well that you had. Is that more dependent on waiting to see other results? Or given how successful you've been in the Marcellus and starting to be in Upper Devonian, why go to that now at this time? I'm just wondering what your thought processes is on that.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, you make a great point. On Slide 10, we're pointing out for those of you that haven't looked at it, we think, not only do we have 1 million net acres, really when you look at the stack pay potential, we lay it out on Slide 10, it's prospective for a number of horizons. Neal specifically asked about the Utica. And we have 180,000 net acres, wet acreage in the Northwest and 400,000 of dry in Southwest. The good news is all the stuff in the Northwest is HBP. When you look at the stuff in the Southwest, any well, to any horizon holds all horizons for us. So we have such prolific Marcellus wells, and it's so low risk at this point in time. Like I said, essentially all that acreage is de-risked. We'll just consistently drive up production and cash flow and reserves with the Southwest and hold those opportunities. The good news is, in both areas, there's a lot of drilling around us, some in of the Northwest and also, even in the dry, there's some wells that are coming right up against our acreage position. Of course, we're going to route those wells on. And then, we have the ability to stay focused on investing our dollars on low-risk things to generate returns, yet to the extent those other operators have success, we'll be able to capture that. To the extent they don't, we'll have saved some risk investment, but we think there's great potential. And particularly, it's interesting to look at the stuff in the Southwest, when you map high-quality rock, we have great Utica potential down there. It's high porosity, it's going to be high pressure, it's thick. And then, of course, it's stacked, so then you have all the advantages of infrastructure, roads, plants, pipelines, team and all that type of thing. So very excited about the potential but in the interim, in the short run, we're going to stay focused on the Marcellus and see how the rest of that plays out. And then we'll come back with, to the extent it's successful, what's the most optimum way to capture the value.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. Two more if I could, Jeff. Just looking at your maps, they're at very good detail. You certainly have the dominant position in Marcellus and\/or one of the dominant positions. But what's evident is there certainly somewhere you control, and there's a little bit, kind of little holes here and there. Is that going to enable you to add, maybe not but some might call material, but still add a fair amount of acreage for relatively low prices, because you can kind of walk some people out, if you will?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, I think there will be opportunities with time when you get a big blocky position like that, and there are small holes with time then. Your point's well taken, that we would be the logical person to pick the acreage up. We'll have infrastructure to take away the team, the pad and it'll be most efficient for us to develop it, so, yes, we'll clearly look at those opportunities and, therefore, you could see us capture some of those, with time.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just last, maybe a quick one for Ray. I know others we hear more about, maybe in the Eagle Ford and other areas, about people adding more sand per stage, and trying to obviously squeeze more out of that. Just wondering, Ray, maybe your thoughts as far as you guys obviously having fantastic results, besides maybe this multi-cluster. I mean, is there things to add more sand per stage, or what's your thoughts about that?","Ray N. Walker","Well, I think that all across the industry, people are focused on more stages in the lateral, more in better conductivity in the near wellbore region, and all of that. And, yes, we've been working on that since we started in 2006. We're continually looking at proppants, different mixes of proppants, different amounts of proppants, different concentrations and all of that. And I think that's just going to evolve over time. And one of the other things, the Marcellus is such -- it's in the largest hydrocarbon basin in North America, and I think sometimes we fall in the trap of thinking the Marcellus is the Marcellus everywhere, and it's not. It's not even the same from one side of the super-rich to the other side of the super-rich. And so, I think you're going to see all the operators talking about more conductivity, more frac jobs, more stages and working through that. The good news is, we're all exchanging data now. So we're doing lots of technical reviews on a quarterly basis and different things like that, that are helping everybody move up that learning curve faster. So yes, we are doing it, and I do expect there's going to be some upside in the well performance due to that, also.","Operator","We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Louis Baltimore of Macquarie for our final question.","Louis Baltimore - Macquarie Research","So your newly increased EUR estimates for the super-rich wells appear to be based off actual production from 17 wells drilled during the first quarter, that have average lateral lengths of 3,500 feet in 18 frac stages. Yet the new well design calls for 4,500 foot lateral lengths with 22 stages, and uses that same EUR estimate. So given the additional 1,000 feet of lateral, and 4 more stages, it would seem like these new EUR estimates are already too low?","Ray N. Walker","Well, I hope so. One of the things that we don't want to fall in the trap of just like, we have always been very data based in our projections. And those 17 wells, I totally agree with you, look like they could be in the range of what we're projecting for the wells going forward, with longer laterals. But again, we're not -- we want to see more data on those 17 wells, so we've only got 4 months of history so far, and we want to make sure that, that's consistent. We've been applying a lot more RCS, we've been changing our targets and optimizing that a lot more, and we're still going up the learning curve in the super-rich area. We don't have the history quite there yet, that we have in the wet area, so we are being conservative. And we don't want to take some really, some -- a group of wells that are really performing well in 1 specific area, and then base everything off of that, until we get more wells under our belts. So you're pointing out a great point, and it gives us confidence and that plus some of the EURs, like the wells I talked about in my remarks, and in the press release that are longer laterals and clearly going to be above those curves, all of that gives us a lot of confidence that there's a lot of upside, but we're not really wanting to model our forward projections on that yet.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to talk to in the call back to Mr. Ventura for closing remarks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Given Range's large, high-quality low-risk acreage position and drilling inventory, we continue to believe that in addition to growing production 20% to 25% this year, we have 20% to 25% line of sight growth for many years. With the high returns in our projects assuming current strip pricing, our cash flow is expected to outpace our production growth. We're also projecting that with current strip pricing, we'll be reducing the leverage of our company with time, as we drive up production and cash flow. Led by our approximately 1 million net acre position in Pennsylvania, we project that we will consistently drive up production and reserves on a per share basis, net adjusted for years to come. Plus we continue to be one of the lowest cost producers in the peer group and are still improving. We believe that this plan will translate into substantial shareholder value in the months and years ahead.

Please go ahead, sir.","Rodney L. Waller - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, operator and good morning and welcome. Range reported results for the fourth quarter and the full quarter for calendar year of 2015 with record production, a continuing decrease in unit costs, significant proved reserve additions, and possibly the lowest drill-bit finding cost for 2015 of $0.37 per Mcfe. The speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, our CEO; Roger Manny, Range's CFO; and Ray Walker, our Chief Operating Officer.","Range did file our 10-K with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we have posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins, unit costs per Mcfe and the reconciliation of reported earnings to adjusted non-GAAP earnings that are discussed on the call today.","Now, let me turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Rodney. Given the challenging price environment, our capital spending budget for 2016 is projected to be $495 million. This will in essence result in two horizontal drilling rigs plus one air rig in Southwest Pennsylvania. And to put that in perspective, we entered 2015 with 15 rigs. So for 2016, we have significantly reduced our activity and are primarily focused in Southwest Pennsylvania. This year, we're projecting lower well costs, better marketing contracts and lower unit costs. This strategy generates good returns and preserves our efficiencies by keeping a minimal level of activity.","Concerning asset sales, we have a signed purchase and sale agreement for Bradford County assets for $112 million. Our assets there consist of approximately $20 million per day of net production and about 11,000 net acres which is all operated by Repsol. This is our only outside operated position in the Marcellus.","In addition, we're currently marketing our Central Oklahoma assets. It's also important to note and point out that we have approximately $1.3 billion of liquidity with no bond maturities due until 2021. For 2016, we have approximately 80% of our natural gas hedged at a floor of $3.24 Mcf. Unit costs are projected to continue to decrease into 2016 with the proceeds from our Virginia asset sales used to reduce debt by 24%, our interest expense per Mcfe should be lower in 2016 than 2015.","Our Virginia assets also had higher LOE per Mcfe as well as higher G&A and broker gas marketing expense. Given the sale of our Virginia assets last year, coupled with the closing of our Oklahoma City office, staff reductions in our field offices last year and a recent workforce reduction in our Pittsburgh area offices and Fort Worth office. Our head count today is 31% lower than it was this time last year. Bottom line, we're projecting that on an absolute basis, interest expense, LOE and G&A will decline year-over-year.","As you'll see from the release, transportation and gathering per Mcfe will increase, but given the better contracts and better price realizations, we're expecting improvement netback pricing.","The Mariner East pipeline is expected to result in better netbacks for both ethane and propane. Range is the only producer on Mariner East. We control a dominant portion of the capacity on the pipe and has considerable access for propane cavern storage. With our unique contracts, we expect to generate significant pricing differentiation for these products going forward, especially during the summer of 2016. Given a full year of Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City transportation and better basis for a gas which we have locked in a significant portion with hedging, we're expecting better natural gas netbacks to more than offset the increase.","As an example, this project contributed to our $0.41 per Mcf price differential improvement in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. Our IR team has given more color for 2016 in our release. The capital efficiencies our team is achieving are very significant. This is particularly impactful when efficiencies are combined with the quality of the rock that we have. We believe this is one of the key differentiating investment attributes of Range. We believe Range has the highest expected EUR recoveries on a per lateral foot in the Southwest portion of the Marcellus play combined with the lowest cost per lateral foot.","What's important is that we're drilling laterals that are up to 1,000 feet longer with significantly lower cost ranging from 14% to 20% less total well cost per lateral foot including facilities. The EURs of these wells average 2.4 Bcf per 1,000 foot up to 3 Bcf per 1,000 foot. The absolute EURs are 16 Bcfe to 21 Bcf per well. Remember, we do have wells that are significantly higher than the average is. What's important is that the EURs per 1,000 foot of lateral are holding constant and we're achieving that performance in less time and with less cost resulting in improved capital efficiency.","Lastly, I will summarize our reserve report for year-end 2015 that was released last night. Adjusting for asset sales last year, our reserves increased from year-end 2014. The drill-bit finding costs with provisions was $0.37 per Mcfe and our drill-bit replacement 436% or production including price and performance revision.","Proved developed reserves increased from 52% to 55% and Marcellus reserves compose 97% of the total. Although the SEC proved reserve net present value decreased due to the significant commodity price decrease year-over-year. The year-end 2015 PV10 value of the proved reserves using future strip prices and current sales contracts is $6.8 billion which is very comparable to the year-end 2014 value of $6.9 billion.","The continuing strong PV10 value is a result of continued capital efficiencies, reduced operating cost and improvement in netback pricing with the commencement of our most recent sales contracts and scheduled future contracts.","For further comments on unit cost reductions as well as the balance sheet, I'll now turn the call over to Roger.","Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you Jeff. The fourth quarter capped a year of solid operating progress. Range achieved consistent production growth with improved capital efficiency paired with significantly lower unit costs. Perhaps most importantly, for the second year in the row, we ended the year with lower debt than we started. Over the past two years, production has increased 48% while debt has been reduced by approximately $0.5 billion or 14%. Starting with the fourth quarter income statement, higher production and lower costs were no match for significantly lower year-over-year commodity prices.","There were some bright spots, however. Cash margin during the fourth quarter was $1.52 an Mcfe, approximately 20% higher than the previous two quarters of this year. And both EBITDAX and cash flow were higher in the fourth quarter than the two preceding quarters of this year.","Fourth quarter reported net loss was $322 million, driven by a $409 million pre-tax loss on sale of assets and an $88 million pre-tax impairment of legacy Midcontinent proved reserves. Fourth quarter earnings, calculated using analyst methodology which eliminates non-cash and non-recurring entries, was $42 million or $0.25 per fully diluted share.","Cash flow for the fourth quarter was $204 million and EBITDAX was $241 million, both slightly more than 20% below last year's fourth quarter figures due to 30% all-in lower realized prices. Fourth quarter cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.22. Cash flow and EBITDAX for the full-year 2015 was $740 million and $897 million respectively. Cash flow per fully diluted share for the full-year 2015 was $4.45.","There were a few unusual fourth quarter expense items that merit comment. And while most all expense categories came in at\/or below guidance, transportation gathering and compression expense was $0.05 over guidance at $0.85 due to some new capacity coming on earlier than expected. Direct operating expense came in at $0.22, $0.06 under guidance, mainly due to a non-recurring $0.03 credit.","Speaking of unusual and non-recurring items, just to give everyone a heads up, next week, we will be filing a registration statement to exchange our 4.875% senior notes issued last year under Rule 144A with lifetime registered notes. We're also registering some shares that are already issued and in the deferred compensation plan. This is an ordinary course of business administrative matter and it's being done immediately after the 10-K filing just to save accounting expense. There are no changes to the note terms.","Our fourth quarter earnings release contains detailed expense item guidance for the first quarter of 2016 and one item that you'll note in the guidance is the increase in projected gathering transportation and compression expense associated with commencement of the Mariner East project. As further discussed in the earnings release and as evidenced in our fourth quarter margin improvement from the Uniontown to Gas City pipeline, these new projects are expected to improve our margins by generating significantly higher revenue over the incremental cost.","Another item of note in the earnings release is our decision to conserve cash by reducing our cash common stock dividend by half from a quarterly $0.04 a share to $0.02 a share. A highlight of every year's fourth quarter release is the annual reset of our DD&A rate reflecting the results of the year-end audited proved reserve report.","With heightened focus on capital efficiency, this year's results are especially significant. Our fourth quarter DD&A rate dropped to $0.97 per Mcfe, moving closer to our finding and development cost. With our total company recurring direct operating expense of approximately $0.26, the combined cost to recover our asset depreciation and produce our oil and gas was $1.23 an Mcfe. Our dry gas Marcellus assets have an even lower DD&A rate and direct operating expense. But even using this $1.23 per Mcfe figure for the whole company, as recently as 2009, our combined total company DD&A rate and direct operating expense was $3.17, almost three times today's figure.","In the first quarter of last year, we closed our Oklahoma City office, which reduced our company-wide head count by approximately 8%. As Jeff mentioned, walking that event forward to today, asset sales and additional reductions in force have reduced our total head count by 31%.","While this has been extraordinarily difficult for an already lean organization, it demonstrates our commitment to do what it takes to not just survive in the current downturn but effectively position the company for the future, whatever lies ahead.","Because our realized price peaked in 2008, we are already over seven years into a period that many are just now calling lower-for-longer. We already know what that phrase means, and we know what that phrase means we have to do. Besides dramatically reducing head count and high-grading our assets, here's another illustration of the type of positioning for the future I'm referring to.","In our reserves release, you'll see that we have a $0.40 per Mcfe proved undeveloped conversion cost, a modest 0.4 well proved undeveloped\/proved developed producing booking ratio, meaning that for every PDP Marcellus well, we'd only have 0.4 PUD wells offset booked. And you'll note that our PUD reserves are limited, not by economic value but by the SEC five-year rule.","Now, not mentioned in the release is that we have 124 fully constructed and operational Marcellus drilling pads holding five or fewer wells with, in most cases, room to drill up to 18 wells or more on each pad. Now, this means that for every PUD well we convert to a PDP well, there is another one ready to book on an existing pad with already built-out infrastructure.","With 124 lightly drilled pads already constructed and tied in, we can economically grow reserves in production in this fashion for many years. Plus, we have another 59 pads with six to nine wells on them, and these pads have the same lower-for-longer economics. We've included in the supplemental tables posted to the website a slide which takes the economics behind this illustration full cycle.","Starting with our actual fourth quarter 2015 $1.66 per Mcfe total cash cost, then adding the $0.40 F&D cost, then adding our fourth quarter $0.35 an Mcfe basis differential, it totals to a basis adjusted all-in cost of $2.41 an Mcfe, which generates excellent margins against our $3.24 2006 hedged floor price. But more importantly, this current all-in cost figure is more than covered by current strip prices in 2017 and beyond.","If things get even more challenging, note that the $0.40 F&D cost number in the reserve report is an average across all the company's proved undeveloped locations. Actual F&D cost will vary by well type and location, and we have the option to select from 183 existing pad sites, allowing us to optimize the development activity to match market conditions. Now, Ray is going to unpack this illustration a bit more during his remarks in just a few moments.","Now, positioning Range for 2017 with a recycle ratio over one times, unhedged at current strip prices, gives us confidence that we can continue to grow within cash flow even in this challenging environment. We believe that an underappreciated key metric to balance sheet preservation lies not in the rearward looking balance sheet ratio debt-to-EBITDAX, but in a forward-looking income statement ratio like the unhedged recycle ratio. If your unhedged recycle ratio isn't above one times, reducing debt or stockpiling cash only buys you time, it doesn't buy you success. This doesn't mean that we're ignoring the balance sheet, however.","At year-end 2015, our bank credit facility balance outstanding was $95 million. That's down from $723 million at year-end 2014. We've got approximately $1.3 billion in current available liquidity. Our earliest bond maturities, as Jeff mentioned, is 2021. The weighted average interest rate on our bonds is 5.125% and our debt is 96% fixed.","We have class-leading asset coverage with total debt per Mcfe of proved reserves of $0.23. And though we do not have a debt-to-EBITDAX ratio covenant, our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio at year-end 2015 was a very respectable and manageable 3.0 times. Lastly, our bonds continue to trade well against our peer group before and after recent rating agency actions.","Range currently has approximately 80% of our estimated 2016 gas production hedged at a floor price of $3.24 an Mmbtu. The earnings release contains a summary of our hedge positions for all commodities of 2016 and 2017. Additional more detailed hedged volumes and prices can be found on our website.","In summary, though our realized commodity price has declined every year since 2008, 2015 was the first year where Range was unable to increase cash flow and cash flow per share through higher production and lower costs. And while some may say this signals the bottom and better times are ahead, we've aggressively responded to the 2015 cash flow decrease by reducing and optimizing growth, carefully deploying capital to our best return wells, shedding additional non-core assets, further lowering our cost structure, improving our capital efficiency, having our dividend, protecting our liquidity, and continuing to operate safely in an environmentally sound manner. Much has been accomplished in 2015 and there is much left to do, but we're confident in the future of Range and we're going to manage our finances accordingly.","Ray over to you.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Roger. In 2015, we spent $814 million on drilling and completion which was 40% lower than the previous year and it resulted in 20% year-over-year growth even though the Mariner East project was delayed significantly from the original plan. This was a real testament to our team coupled with our high-quality and diverse asset base, meaning dry or liquids rich, and what we believe our best-in-class capital efficiencies.","Focusing on Southwest Pennsylvania for a few highlights from 2015 as compared to 2014, we saw our drilling costs per foot of lateral decreased by 21% while drilling 24% longer laterals. Our completions team increased the number of frac stages per frac crew per day by 31%. We achieved a 15% reduction in water costs for our completions operations. And with operational efficiencies and service cost reductions, we recognized an average 33% decrease in total completion costs per well. And importantly, we expect these improvements to continue.","For this year, our total capital budget is $495 million. This plan represents a 45% reduction in total capital from 2015 and a 69% reduction from 2014. Of that capital, 96% is directed towards drilling and completion with only $20 million in land. Essentially, all of our capital is directed towards the Marcellus with the majority of that being spent in Southwest PA.","And you can find the details for all of that in our earnings release and in our updated presentation on the website. We're only spending about $18 million in Northeast PA this year which involves 14 wells coming online and a couple of wells drilled which will be completed later. Our fourth quarter production came in at 1.43 Bcf equivalent per day, slightly exceeding our guidance of 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day. And our annual growth was right at 20% as forecasted.","Production for the entire 2016 year is expected to average 1.39 Bcf equivalent per day to 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day with 30% to 35% liquids. This works out to 8% to 10% production growth for the year on a pro forma basis adjusted for asset sales. Production for the first quarter of 2016 is expected to be approximately 1.35 Bcf equivalent per day with 30% to 32% liquids. This guidance accounts for the sale of the Virginia properties of $107 million a day on a pro forma basis. And on the pro forma basis would represent a 2% increase over the fourth quarter of 2015.","Importantly, we expect to see a higher exit rate at the end of 2016 than we stated the year with after the asset sale. We'll also maintain an inventory of wells waiting on completion or tie-in that is consistent with our reduced activity levels and also consistent with past years. This should set us up well going into 2017.","Jeff touched on the longer laterals, lower cost and resulting capital efficiencies in his remarks, and you can find the details and the economics behind those in our updated presentation. And Roger talked about the fact that we have an inventory of pads all across the core of the core with a demonstrated ability to drill wells with substantially less cost per well, so let me take a minute and walk through our three areas in the Marcellus and Southwest Pennsylvania and work all of this in together.","First, we've updated our 500-foot spacing test and our infill test in our updated presentation on pages 40 and 41. Our tighter spacing projects now have almost six years of history and our infill project now has almost two years of data on the new infill wells. Both demonstrate success in our core acreage position in Southwest Pennsylvania, and we believe this is a distinct and unique advantage for Range.","In the super-rich area, the 2016 wells are planned to average 6,700 feet which will be 24% longer than last year yet with the improved efficiencies and cost savings the completed well cost will be about the same which is $5.9 million.","Now, I want to take a second here and remind everyone that all of the costs that we discussed here are total completed well costs and do include all the facilities. We're projecting the 2016 super-rich wells to cost $881 per foot of lateral which is a 20% improvement over 2015. We project the recoveries to be 2.4 Bcf equivalent per 1,000 foot of lateral.","Said another way, we project spending $5.9 million to recover 16 Bcf equivalent, which equates to an F&D cost of $0.44 per Mcfe. Following, Roger's earlier point, if these wells were drilled on existing pads utilizing already existing infrastructure including the pad, roads, facilities, water and so forth, the total well cost would be significantly less and the F&D cost could then be as low as $0.38 per Mcfe.","In the wet area, our 2016 wells are projected to have 7,000 foot laterals on average which is 17% longer than 2015. Given the increased efficiencies and lower costs, the wet area wells are expected to cost $5.8 million or $832 per foot of lateral which is a 16% improvement over 2015. These wells are projected to recover 3 Bcf equivalent per 1,000 foot.","Again to summarize, we project spending $5.8 million to recover 21 Bcf equivalent which equals an F&D cost of $0.34 per Mcfe. Again if these wells were drilled on existing pad, the F&D costs could be as low as $0.29 per Mcfe. The Southwest dry area wells in 2016 are expected to average slightly longer at 7,000 feet versus 6,800 feet last year.","Significantly, the cost is projected to decrease from $6 million to $5.2 million. That's $743 per foot of lateral which is a 14% improvement over 2015. Again, our projected recovery of 17.6 Bcf for $5.2 million in the dry area equals an F&D cost of just $0.36 per Mcfe. If drilled on existing pads, the F&D cost could be as low as $0.27 per Mcfe.","In summary, by drilling on existing pads, our F&D cost in Southwest Pennsylvania could be in the range of $0.26 to $0.34 per Mcfe, which we believe would be the lowest in the play. As capital efficiency continues to improve throughout this year and beyond, we believe these F&D costs could go even lower, maybe as much as 10% lower, resulting in higher margins and even better recycle ratio for the company.","Our inventory of existing pads on core acreage coupled with our continued improvement in capital efficiency and our low-cost structure give us a significant advantage in this low-price environment. It positions us well for 2017, and we don't believe this is the case for everyone.","Capital efficiency is our focus and we're recognizing it in many ways. For example, in looking at our current plan for 2016, we're putting on line almost the same number of frac stages or if you say it another way, approximately the same amount of lateral feet for 43% less capital than we did last year while maintaining some of the highest EURs per 1,000 foot recoveries in the basin.","We can do this because of the high-quality resource and plays that Range has captured over the past 11 years of development in its core position. We believe these achievements are not likely outside the core, and we believe they are unique to Range.","Along with improving efficiencies from 15% longer laterals, we're continuing to achieve decreases in service costs this year as compared to last year. Our operating efficiency is among the best in the basin, and we have no long-term commitments for services. As an example, on the completions front, we're averaging over seven frac stages per day, per crew resulting in some very attractive service pricing for Range while still generating acceptable margins for the service companies. We believe this provides another unique advantage for Range.","On the marketing side, Range has added some capacity over the last four months that we're really excited about and that we've been discussing for quite some time. Of course, with this capacity comes cost. The biggest driver of the increase in transport expense for 2016 is related to Mariner East coming online in the first quarter as well as additional ATEX capacity for ethane.","Mariner East is expected to bring us better netbacks on our 20,000 barrels per day of ethane and 20,000 barrels per day of propane. The project started the commissioning process for ethane in late 2015, commissioned the refrigeration system in January then Range introduced ethane into the pipeline for the first time in February and we expect to be loading the first ethane ship in a few days.","We'll begin shipping ethane to INEOS and we'll also be able to utilize VLGCs which are the largest ships available to ship propane while providing lower cost transportation and better netbacks. As a result, NGL realizations are expected to improve from approximately 18% in 2015 to 24% in 2016. And NGL volumes increase substantially, approximately 30% over 2015. The resulting increased revenue far exceeds the additional NGL transport expense, thus improving cash flow.","On the gas front, we had a full quarter of the pipeline project Uniontown to Gas City by Spectra Energy. We'll have a full year of this for 2016 and this capacity is part of the reason for the improvement in our natural gas differentials when looking at the fourth quarter versus the third quarter or when looking at 2016 versus 2015. This project allows us access to markets in the Midwest and achieves pricing that is better than NYMEX.","Fourth quarter 2015 natural gas differentials were $0.41 better than the third quarter, and full-year 2016 is expected to be $0.10 better than full-year 2015 differentials. These premium transport additions set us up well to improve our relative pricing for 2016 and beyond for both NGLs and natural gas.","Next, I would like to bring you up to speed on our Utica wells. We're currently completing our third well as we speak. It's a 5,800 foot lateral completed with 38 frac stages averaging 500,000 pounds of profit per stage which is 50\/50 100-mesh and premium 40\/70. The well will be flowed back, tested and put on production under a managed pressure program, and we will not be trying to achieve a headline rate. The well is currently forecast to come in around $17 million including the production facilities.","We're currently cleaning up the well for the initial flow back and then we'll be building production facilities, planning to turn the well to sales prior to the end of the second quarter. We believe that our next well's total cost, again including all the production facilities, would be in the range of $12 million for a 6,500 foot lateral. And we estimate a well with an 8,000 foot lateral would come in at approximately $14 million.","The EUR of our first well remains in the range of 15 Bcf gross, and the second well is still expected to better than that. We're encouraged by these early results, and we see potential for further enhancements both in cost and in performance. However, in looking at the cost per thousand foot of lateral even on the next wells, we're in the $1.8 million range as compared to $743,000 in our Southwest PA dry Marcellus acreage.","In simpler terms, the Utica costs almost 2.5 times more than our dry Marcellus while achieving about the same production. While the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential even with anticipated efficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells far exceed the Utica. Given limited production history thus far, on a risk-adjusted basis, it's clear that our high-quality Marcellus wells are the superior investment.","Over time, we expect that the Utica can be a complementary development opportunity. But for now, our plan for the rest of this year is to monitor these wells along with offset wells while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine a path forward from there. In the meantime, we will remain focused on our high-graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible, and we'll continue to work to lower cost and improve capital efficiency.","Now, back to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Ventura. Our first question comes from the line of Jon Wolff with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","A few here. You may have been asked this before, but you obviously got a great price for Nora, but can you talk about what that does to your natural decline rate?","Alan W. Farquharson - Senior VP-Reservoir Engineering & Economics","Yeah, Jon. This is Alan Farquharson. Our decline rate still stays relatively consistent with what it's been historically. The reason why the Marcellus has been such a dominant producer in terms of total production, if you think about it, last year we made about 1.4 Bcfe a day and Nora was 100 million, just using some round numbers.","So the decline rate first full year still is around 19% and then declines. Within five years, you're back under 10% again. So that's pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last year. I think that a lot of people haven't really recognized how shallow the decline is in the Marcellus overall.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","A little more granular on that. I mean, it's such a low number, given \u2013 without the tight gas sands of the past and without Nora. Would that be a testament to the sort of average age of wells because certainly first year declines are not anywhere near 20%?","Alan W. Farquharson - Senior VP-Reservoir Engineering & Economics","Yeah, I think it's a function a little bit of the average age of the wells, but I think it's also \u2013 the first year kind of declines fairly steeply in a lot of these shale plays. But then I think most people probably don't look at year two, three, four, and five and then you see how flat some of the declines are. If you look at a lot of the historical data that's out on the PA website, you can see that those wells get fairly flat, relatively flat relatively quickly.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think an important point to note is if you look at Range's reserves year-over-year for the last 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 years maybe, our reserve revisions have been positive almost every year and really that speaks to the quality of rock and the wells are continuing to outperform. Again, that's not something that I think happens everywhere, but the fact that we haven't had reserve cuts and in fact we've got positive revisions gives our management team great comfort as well as our banking group. So part of that is \u2013 and if the wells are outperforming by definition than the declines are shallower.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","And also I'll just add one more thing in, Jon. This is Ray. That I think if you look at our type curves that we updated in the presentation, you'll see that last year's production in a couple of those areas seems to be pretty flat and I think people don't realize, most of our wells come online under constrained conditions. So that first year decline that most people think is there is somewhat muted compared to a lot of other places. So I think that contributes to it also.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Just thinking about capital efficiency and the decade-long process of in-fill acreage drill, purchases and building pads which if you could remind me how much they cost? I think last year \u2013 one time you're in kind of single well pads and then more recently I think it was four to five or five to six per pad, wells per pad. Can you update us on that and also the cost of a well pad?","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Jon. The pad construction phase or building a pad and a road can average anywhere from $400,000 up to $1 million depending on the terrain and the locale and whether it's got wet land streams next to it and all those sort of things that we have to do from erosion and sedimentation protections in Pennsylvania. So on average, $600,000 or so to $700,000 maybe. We have always drilled probably no fewer than three or four wells per pad, and in most cases, we average around five, I would guess. This is the current average. We can do some more research on that and see. But I think it's about five. We have drill pads up to 9 and 10 and 12 wells, but on average, it's about five.","We have very few pads that are less than three or four anywhere from history. I mean, we had a few very far step-out pads early on that were one or two or three wells, but that's literally been maybe five, six, seven years ago.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me just add on to Ray a little bit. But like Ray and Roger were talking about, it really sets us up at this point for strong capital efficiency going forward and the optionality to go back to those pads and drill on those pads where you've got a lot of the costs already. And the team has done a great job. So going forward, there is a really built in capital efficiency, and I think it's a strong statement to say even in this environment. We have a recycle ratio greater than 1 by being able to...","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, unhedged.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. That was the context of the question. I just wanted to get some numbers around it. The other thing on limiting the number of wells per pad, if I recall in the past, talking to you, some of it had to do with the takeaway infrastructure that would be required if you went to seven or eight wells per pad. Obviously, you don't own your own midstream company and maybe that's some of the factor. But it feels like \u2013 is there right sizing that \u2013 in terms of the amount of takeaway capacity that colors your view of how many wells per pad at least on the initial phase, I know you plan to go back to well those pads later?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We'll kind of tag team the question. I think if you look at slide 18, that kind of tells the story. We have a huge acreage position and what we think is the core of the ploy. So early on, we're limiting the number of wells per pad to be able to drill more pads, to be able to hold that position. And by the end of this year, we're basically done with that. On slide 18, when you look at the \u2013 and at this point, it's really well delineated. We've got basically combined potential in those horizons of about 1.5 million net acres stacked, predominantly down in Southwest PA. So we spread \u2013 so, for limited capital, we spread those pads out to hold it, but now going forward, it really sets up a strong efficiency to go back and drill on those particular pads.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. And Jon, it's been literally a 10-year \u2013 9 or 10 year process of building infrastructure with MarkWest when you talk about the wet system for instance. And a lot of that is \u2013 the backbone of that system is finally in place. And I think another concept is when we go back to one of these pads, I don't think we'd be going back and drilling all 18 wells. We would go back and drill two, three, four wells to kind of fill in that room that's now available because of the natural decline of the system and so forth, plus the fact that, like Jeff said, we've been talking about for a couple of years now that we had targeted about 2017 when the HBP kind of factor would be almost gone, and we're literally on the precipice of that. So we can literally, starting in next year's plan, really focus on the highest returns and where there is room in the systems whether it's the dry systems in East Washington or the Allegheny County or in the wet system. We have that much flexibility and that diverse set of assets, like Jeff was referring to.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","Last one since my mailbox is being inundated with the question around transport and gathering costs going up, and I assume that has a lot to do with Mariner East 1. I guess, my question is \u2013 I guess number one is, I think that's the big reason, but maybe confirm that. And then second, is propane at least getting a better revenue value than natural gas, and is there sort of a positive uplift from processing propane, understanding that these costs are fixed than some costs?","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I'll start. I mean, yeah. I mean, you're right. The additional costs are mainly from Mariner East starting up. And so we have that cost that goes on that line and the transportation on it. But it results in netback pricing both propane and ethane, that's far better than anything we've got in the past, so it way more than offsets and then Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City is a good example. The transportation cost on that line also gets added, but then when you net-net it all out, we're selling gas for sometimes $1 better than what we're selling it in to, results in $0.40, $0.50, $0.60, sometimes up to $1 better netback price.","But I'll turn it over to Chad to talk a little bit more about propane.","Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development","Yeah, Jon. This is Chad. We have worked on \u2013 since we moved the in-service date of Mariner East, we worked with the (43:09). I think we announced that we had a long-term agreement with (43:13). They have a global presence, and they are helping us and advising us on selling propane into the international markets. So since we announced the arrangement with them, we've locked in arb between mainly Europe and what Mont Belvieu prices were. So with that arb locked in for all of 2016 and part of 2017, we've captured that value that's much better than Mont Belvieu. So it's much better than Mont Belvieu and it's better than gas that we could get on a gas price equivalent basis.","Of late, you've watched freight, the Baltic Index on freight costs come way down. This time last year they were about \u2013 equivalent of about $0.12 a gallon to $0.14 a gallon. You can currently get a freight rate Baltic Index quote of about $0.035 to $0.04 a gallon. So the freight rates have played into our hand as well. So we're at the end of the day going to be able to get \u2013 at Houston plant, we're going to be able to get a Mont Belvieu equivalent to maybe minus $1 or minus $2 which is much better than any of our peers. So we're excited about Mariner East coming fully in service where we can take advantage of loading VLGC ships, lots of volume which will lower our per unit cost of shipping.","Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC","That helps. Thanks, guys.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. Ray, from a timing standpoint and as you talked about capital efficiency, at what point do you think you'd go back and start to drill again on those pads and be able to leverage the prior expenditures on the pad construction?","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Ron, it's a good question. We, for the last couple of years, we always seem to have a small percentage of our wellbore going back in an area and doing that. I think this year, there's a pretty small percentage of the wells that are on existing pads. I think really going into next year, and of course, we're just announcing this year's plans, so we've got a lot of work to do to figure out exactly what we're going to do in 2017. But I do foresee us probably starting to make more of a move towards that in 2017.","Of course, a lot of it depends on pricing and what all happens this year and I think with the big capital cuts that everybody is going through and the rig counts falling and lots of people choosing not even to drill per se that we're going to see the gas production roll over and we're clearly seeing gas demand increasing. So it's just a matter of time before things start changing and I think we're going to have to get much later in this year before we see how that works out and exactly what our numbers are going to look like for 2017.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","And I think part of it to go on one of the things that Jon mentioned was, from a infrastructure standpoint part of it, you never want to build capacity for peak production. And so when you look at your estimates of those pads, is the timing also driven by the fact when you start to gain capacity on some of those pads or is there something else driving that investment decision?","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","No. You're absolutely right. I mean, one of the driving factors in that whole plan will be exactly where we can put these wells, where there's room in the compression for instance, and process and capacity and all the different things that go into that, the markets, it's all a very integrated multi-disciplinary process that we go through. And we'll literally be working all this year as we \u2013 and we constantly optimize what we're doing month by month even right now. So that's always a big impact. You're correct on that.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","And then lastly on just the NGL realizations, particularly related to Mariner East, is that something that begins to start up here at the very end of the first quarter, is it better just to model it beginning in the second quarter? And then associated, I think in the past you had talked about cash flows from the ability to access international markets or even local markets in the case of propane can generate an incremental $50 million or so of cash flow over a 12 month period. Do those numbers remain unchanged?","Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development","Yeah. This is Chad. We actually started taking our propane in kind in the fourth quarter of 2015. Mariner East was not fully in service. It was not fully refrigerated. So we still were loading on what's called handy ships, handy ships are smaller volumes, they can take about 150,000 barrels. So the per unit transportation cost is a little bit higher which our netbacks were not as good as with Mariner East fully in service, refrigeration is in service and we can load the VLGC ships.","But our main focus on marketing the propane once it's fully in service is either take advantage of the arbs between Europe, Asia and Mont Belvieu and\/or the local markets. We can sell into the local markets in, for instance, the winter months when propane prices spike if we get a polar vortex. So we have that optionality to be able to find the best price for the propane whatever time of year it is, if that makes sense","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","With the pricing throughout not flat, but it should have a smoothing impact on the prices through the year for NGLs, correct?","Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development","Yes.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay, perfect. That's all for me. Thank you.","Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development","And we're...","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Roger, I know we share the same love of the recycle ratio and appreciate you putting that slide on the website. I wanted to ask you kind of on the three variables that you could control in that equation. One on the F&D side of things, you threw a $0.40 number out right now. But you really highlighted that you move to infrastructure, you move to dry gas area, that could potentially come down lower. Curious on activity levels, you've got 37% activity geared to the dry gas areas right now. Can you increase that more going forward given this best economics?","And then the second part of it is just on the confluence of the differentials and the transport costs. You guys have shown out to 2017 more downward pressure on the gas differentials. Curious if you \u2013 on slide four, you throw your cost on the transport side out to 2016, curious what that could look like going out to 2017? Thanks.","Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay, Mike. Yeah, let me comment on the recycle ratio and then I'll turn it over to Chad on the differentials. And you're exactly right, I share your enthusiasm for this ratio. I mean, we went through a period where in the old days F&D costs really mattered. And then we went through this period where everybody had oil and gas coming out of their ears and margins were great and then nobody really cared about it. It was all about margins. And now, I think, it's coming back into vogue and as it should be because, in times like this, positive recycle ratio unhedged, as I mentioned, I think is the key to keeping things afloat.","The $0.40 number that we have in the slide that we posted, again, that's company average F&D just to convert the PUDs. My illustration was there that since you've taken about 1.2 Ts of PUDs that are economic off your books because of the five-year rule, to the extent you go back in there and pop a PUD and convert it on existing pad, you just move another well onto it to take its place.","But the $0.40 covers all the PUDs booked across the entire company. And as Ray mentioned, in some of the areas of Marcellus like the dry gas, that number is down in the low $0.20s. So while the strip price is going to move and fluctuate, to your point, we can work the throttle and work that F&D cost as well. So that's a key variable for us.","As for the 37% dry gas. I mean, we've got some infrastructure coming on on the dry gas gathering side that'll allow us to ramp that up going forward. But, again, those are kind of game-time decisions as we look across the portfolio. And Ray's team looks at having the optionality on 183 existing pads, do I want to drill a super-rich, do I want to drill a wet, do I want to drill dry. We have other contacts besides MarkWest in Southwest PA, so a lot of moving parts, a lot of variables, and it's just a matter of optimizing.","So I think the key is having discovered the play and having been there for 11 years, that first-mover advantage of having just a whole lot more optionality in how we move forward in a tough environment.","Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development","So part of your question was discussing also future basis differential, and when you look at currently and going into 2016, Dominion South and M2 are still pretty much under pressure. But with some of these new projects, takeaway projects coming on line, the indexes are improving if you look at the forward curves of indexes. (53:17) in Dominion South improved a little bit but not that much, maybe going from $1 to $0.60 or $0.70.","But specifically for Range, if you look at slide 15 in our presentation, it talks about our firm transportation takeaway in 2016 and 2017. And though it increases, it's part of the increase in our transportation and gathering when you look the cycle margins.","It increases the cost, but also our basis differential improves, both in 2016 midpoint of around $0.42 and then going out into 2017 when some of other projects come into service, it improves even more, midpoint of about $0.28 to $0.30. So that's just helping the margins.","Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","And then the final part of that, probably just a multifaceted question there, is the transport and gathering into 2017, $1.05 in 2016, what's kind of the trend there? Do you expect more upward pressure on that, or could it stay at that level?","Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it's going to be \u2013 it's going to move around a little bit, Mike, but it's \u2013 over time, again, I know we've said that, but as we continue to build out, that's going to plateau, and eventually it will move down as we start to fully maximize the capacity.","But again, the big bump is incremental projects that produce incremental margin, incremental revenue. So we're not too upset about the increase that we had in the fourth quarter and that we've announced for the first quarter.","Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Got it.","Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development","The real key on the transportation per unit cost is, as Ray and Roger have talked about, we're going to be putting more and more volumes on, but you're not going to be spending more dollars on gathering and compression. Therefore, your volumes are going to be able to lower that cost just with the volume changes.","Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Ray, switch gears, just a quick one on the Oklahoma assets you have for sale. Can you give us the teaser on this? And just I'm curious how much exposure you've got to the STACK and SCOOP? Thanks.","Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","We've got BoA marketing it. It's about 28,000 net acres spread across four counties, about 6.5 million a day of production. The acreage is 100% HBP by all legacy vertical wells, about 6.5 million a day of production, about 80% of that is gas. It's right in the heart of the activity where Devon bought Felix's acreage and where Continental is drilling and Newfield is focused. So we will be receiving the bids soon. And we'll be evaluating the valuations and making a decision here probably by the end of March.","Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you.

Please go ahead, sir.","Laith Sando","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range's third quarter earnings call. Speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Degner, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Scucchi, Chief Financial Officer. Hopefully you've had a chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we posted on our website. We also filed our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the Investors tab or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.","Please note that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. For additional information, we posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of EBITDAX, cash margins and other non-GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Ventura","Thanks, Laith, and thanks to everyone for joining us on this morning's call. In the third quarter, Range delivered on several key strategic initiatives: improving our cost structure, bolstering our balance sheet and delivering on our operational plans for less capital than originally planned. Since the middle of last year, Range has completed over $1 billion in asset sales with the most recent sale being another 0.5% royalty that closed in September. Range has aligned its capital spending with cash flow from operations, so these assets sale proceeds have allowed us to reduce absolute debt by over $1 billion in the last 15 months. We believe these sales have highlighted the substantial store value we have in our assets. However, it's quite clear that this has not been reflected in the equity market as Range has continued to trade as a fraction of our underlying value. Given this disconnect and given the substantial progress Range has made in reinforcing our financial strength, Range's Board recently approved a $100 million share buyback program. This modest buyback program represents less than 10% of the asset sale proceeds received in the last 12 months, but it represents greater than 10% of Range's market cap. We believe repurchasing shares at such a substantial discount to our net asset value is a very compelling opportunity to create long-term shareholder value. We are actively pursuing additional asset sales as a means to further strengthen our financial position and are focusing on positioning the company for success through the commodity cycles.","Along those same lines, Range recently increased the commitments on its credit facility from $2 billion to $2.4 billion bolstering our liquidity, derisking future activity. Mark will provide some additional comments in a minute, but I think it's worth noting that the max conforming borrowing base remains greater than $4 billion using a price deck that is 10% lower than the current strip. I believe this reflects the resiliency of Range's assets and business in a challenged commodity cycle. It also provides a glimpse of the durable underlying value of our proved reserves, and our SEC reserves only represent a fraction of Range's total resource potential. So I'll go back to my comment earlier regarding the unique opening we see to create long-term value for shareholders through an opportunistic share repurchase program. Range's proved reserves under current bank pricing are more than double our current enterprise value, and that doesn't count any value for the thousands of core Marcellus and Utica locations that are not part of the reserves definition.","Looking at unit cost, Range has made great progress so far in 2019. Since the end of last year, we've reduced our cash unit cost by $0.16 per Mcfe or a 7% improvement across the board in interest expense, G&A, transportation and gathering, LOE and production taxes. By the end of this year, we expect to have total cash unit cost under $2 per Mcfe. For some contracts, every $0.01 improvement to our cost structure equates to over $8 million in annual cash flow. So the improvement in unit cost that we expect between the fourth quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2019 equates to over $160 million in annual uplift cash flow.","Importantly, these are lasting improvements to margins and cash flow that don't require a change in the commodity price. And it's important to understand that we're not relying on increased production to see these positive changes as Range has the ability to improve unit cost going forward even in a scenario that has no growth.","Operationally, the team continues to find ways to be more efficient in capital spending for the first nine months of the year has come in better-than-expected. Dennis will discuss in more detail, but we now expect to deliver our 2019 operational plans for $20 million less than originally budgeted. Range has been a leader in well cost on a per-foot basis, and our year-to-date performance is proof that we're continuing to find ways to become even more efficient. Range's class-leading drilling complete cost per foot, shallow base decline and substantial core inventory help support low and sustainable maintenance capital requirements. Range's base decline heading into 2020 should be approximately 20%, allowing for all-in maintenance capital of approximately $650 million.","Importantly, the maintenance capital figures Range has been talking about for the last several years are sustainable. Our maintenance capital reflects the capital needed to keep us on a similar glide path into future years. We believe this definition of maintenance capital differentiates us from some companies who may rely on significant DUC drawdown to generate a low to temporary maintenance capital number or that require significant outspend in 2018 and '19 to provide a short-lived tailwind into 2020. As we have shown over the last few years, our $650 million maintenance capital is sustainable. And it is a positive differentiator for Range, again, making Range very durable through the low points of the commodity cycle and providing a solid base for delivering free cash flow. As we begin looking towards 2020 and beyond, we have flexibility in where we set the capital program given our advantaged base decline, low maintenance capital, existing infrastructure that's fully utilized in an improving cost structure that's not dependent on growth. Should commodity prices remain challenged, we'll be looking to align capital spending with cash flow just as we've worked towards in 2019. Importantly, we'll not spend over that budget, and I believe our performance over the last two years is a testament to that as Range was one of the very few E&P companies in 2018 to come in under our original budget, and we'll do the same again this year.","Before turning it over to Mark and Dennis, I'll just say that I think Range has made great progress over the last year: we've paid down over $1 billion in debt, we've lowered our unit cost substantially and we've delivered on our operational plans for $20 million less than originally budgeted. The entire Range team and the Board remain committed and focused on keeping this momentum going into 2020 as we position the company for success through the cycles. Dennis?","Dennis Degner","Thank you, Jeff. Capital spending for the third quarter came in at approximately $160 million with our capital spend for the first three quarters totaling $576 million. Based on our current activity forecast, fourth quarter capital spending is projected to be at a similar level of $160 million resulting in a total capital spend of $736 million for the year. This is a $20 million below our capital budget spend set at the beginning of the year and is a direct result of the operational and technical teams' efforts to find and implement innovative operational efficiencies and ability to capture service cost reductions in the current environment.","Similar to last year, the initiatives driving our capital underspend are primarily attributed to the continued success of our water-sharing program, improved drilling and completion efficiencies associated with long lateral development and service cost reductions. Utilizing other producers' water in the third quarter or, as we call it, water sharing, totaled 750,000 barrels and represents an over 80% increase compared to the same time period a year ago. And similar to our update for the second quarter, this translated into an approximate $2 million reduction in completion cost for the quarter.","Production for the third quarter closed out above 2.24 Bcf equivalent per day, exceeding our revised guidance for the quarter. The Sunoco maintenance that reduced the amount of ethane we produced in the third quarter has returned to normal operations in early October and will result in more efficient transportation to Marcus Hook going forward. Better-than-expected field run time in our production operations and continued strong well performance from both new and existing wells across Southwest PA helped to offset a portion of the maintenance-related impact to ethane production in September.","Fourth quarter production guidance is being set at 2.33 to 2.35 Bcf equivalent per day as we expect to finish out the year with 28 wells being turned to sales or 29% of our annual 2019 turn-in-line number. Please note that our fourth quarter production guidance accounts for the recently announced royalty sales.","Looking back on some of the third quarter operational highlights. In Appalachia, the team turned to sales 22 wells on six pads during the quarter from an average lateral length of over 10,800 feet. The new wells were spread across all three areas of the field covering our dry, wet and super-rich acreage and generated some of our top-producing wells for the year.","I'd like to take a minute and cover some of the exceptional pads from each of these areas. In the wet gas area, we turned to sales a strong pad that generated the top three producing wells for the year thus far. This pad is in the heart of the field with a per well average initial production of more than 40 million cubic feet equivalent per day. This average initial rate also includes over 3,800 barrels per day of combined NGL and condensate production on a per-well basis.","In the super-rich portion of the field, we continue to see results consistent with wells turned to sales in the first half of 2019. In the third quarter, eight wells across three different pads were turned to sales. One pad produced over 2,500 barrels of condensate per day from just three wells and after two months continues to produce more than 1,500 barrels a day.","And lastly, in the dry gas area, we brought online our second highest producing pad of 2019 where our six well pad generated an average initial production of more than 35 million cubic feet per well. This dry gas pad continues to be a strong performer, producing over 100 million cubic feet per day after three months under constrained conditions. Each of these examples add to our growing list of strong performing, repeatable producing pads, as mentioned on previous calls.","As we look into the fourth quarter, we are scheduled to turn in line approximately 28 wells to finish out the year. These wells represent approximately 1\/3 of the wells and nearly 40% of the total lateral footage to go into production this year, putting us on solid footing as we enter 2020. In conjunction with our annual plan, the drilling team saw a reduction in activity during the third quarter as we moved to two rigs in Appalachia. Even in the environment of a reduction in activity, the Appalachia drilling team was able to achieve gains in operational efficiencies while our daily lateral footage drilled increasing approximately 35% in the third quarter compared to the first half of 2019. This substantial increase in daily footage drill can be directly attributed to utilizing new, directional drilling technologies for both curve and lateral applications. With initiatives like these, the team has been able to reduce the drilling cost per lateral foot by 5% in 2019 versus last year.","In addition to drilling wells quicker, lateral lengths to continue to increase year-over-year. Comparing to last year, the 2019 year-to-date average drilled lateral length is approximately 11,700 feet, which is a 13% increase over the average drilled lateral length in 2018. And the increased drilled footage supports our early plans for 2020 to turn to sales wells with an average horizontal length of over 11,000 feet.","Similar to our drilling operations, our completions team has continued to build upon their prior success by executing more frac stages in the third quarter with fewer frac fleets needed. The efficiencies mentioned above, coupled with our innovative water handling, are keeping Range at the leading edge of well cost per foot and F&D cost per Mcfe.","As part of that effort to stay a step ahead, I'd like to provide an update on two areas showcasing the creativity of our teams. The first initiative is related to the electric fracturing fleet test that was mentioned on our second quarter call. The team has since completed our second pad with this fleet, which was located in our dry gas acreage in Southwestern PA. Over 400 frac stages were completed on this pad while averaging almost nine stages per day, all while the team continued to refine procedures and processes during the operation. Efficiencies of over 10 frac stages per day were achieved multiple times with the peak level observed to 14 stages per day. During the three month test run, the team captured fuel savings of over $1.2 million while also reducing emissions and noise levels.","Looking at the early results, coupled with our unique, contiguous acreage position and regular ability to move back to pads with existing production, we see exciting potential with this technology. We are currently preparing to utilize this electric fleet into year-end and are evaluating its potential versus conventional fleets for our 2020 program. The second initiative involves our production and facilities teams taking the next step in reducing emissions during flowback operations. During the past few months, our teams have been able to update the equipment and processes used during flowback, which is resulting in further reduced emissions in our wet and super-rich operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. The enhanced flowback process has been tested across seven pad sites, generating an estimated emissions reduction of over 80% during the flowback phase with essentially no impact to cost. The team is encouraged by the early results and plans to follow up with a test in our dry gas acreage early next year. Given our team's dedication, hard work and creativity, we're optimistic the team will advance this initiative as we strive to reach our ultimate goal of zero net emissions.","Similar to our commitment to the environment, our team strives to operate in a manner that protects the safety of our employees, contractors and the public. Our focus on safety performance improvements this year has paid off by generating a 30% reduction in employee and contractor workforce OSHA recordables compared to the same time period last year. In addition to our worksite focus, we have built upon the success of our vehicle safety program this year by expanding the use of vehicle monitoring system, and it's showing encouraging results by further reducing our preventable vehicle incidents. We realize that we must continue improving our day-to-day safety and environmental performance to consider ourselves successful on all fronts of our operation.","Now turning briefly to NGL marketing. As we mentioned earlier, the Mariner East 1 pipeline was returned to service during the second week of October, allowing Range to resume transportation and exports of 20,000 barrels per day of ethane via the Marcus Hook terminal. Propane and butane export arbs extended second quarter gains on continued strong demand and curtailments in supply from various regions. In particular, September Saudi oil disruption resulted in a sharp appreciation of export values for LPG. With this occurrence, Range maximized the LPG exports during the third quarter using both pipeline and rail access to export terminals. Propane export values at the dock remain elevated and are currently estimated at $0.10 per gallon versus Mont Belvieu index. The combination of ethane rejection during the quarter and access to international markets for propane and butane led to the best differential to Mont Belvieu that Range has realized in recent history.","Looking forward into 2020, Range plans to maintain a strong NGL differential as additional pipeline capacity becomes available next summer, enhancing margins through improved logistics and additional international exposure.","As I get ready to hand it over to Mark to discuss the financials, I'd like to close out by expressing our thanks to our teams for delivering on another strong quarter through creative initiatives, allowing us to deliver on our operational, safety and environmental goals, all below our planned capital budget resulting in our best operational program yet.","I'll now turn it over to Mark.","Mark Scucchi","Thanks, Dennis. As we continue to execute on our strategy to navigate this commodity price cycle, third quarter activity focused on enhancing financial strength, increasing liquidity, reducing debt, reducing costs and maximizing cash flow generated by judicious capital investment. Pricing during the third quarter continued to be challenging. Nevertheless, Range successfully closed several material transactions that bolster the company's financial foundation and continue to extend the visible runway and flexibility available to support our long-term strategy while mitigating near-term risks.","With operations tracking planned results, Range generated year-to-date cash flow from operations of approximately $550 million. Year-to-date capital investment is trending below the annual budget of $756 million. And as Dennis mentioned, we intend to finish the year with capital spending below budget. In addition to capital conservation while executing operationally, Range has focused on operating and overhead costs with the benefit of this year's efforts evident in third quarter unit costs.","During the third quarter, we delivered on plans discussed previously with cash unit costs better than guidance. The quarter-over-quarter improvement of $0.06 per unit and $0.16 per unit compared to the fourth quarter of last year are the results of efficiency across the board led by improvements in gathering, processing and transport. As a reminder, recall that Range guided to a $0.30 improvement over the course of the five year outlook, whereas year-to-date, we've already achieved over 50% of that goal. In total, this puts current cash unit costs at $2.02 with expected further improvement to cash unit costs to below $2 and aggregate unit cost reductions in excess of the $0.30 improvement over time.","On recent calls, we described gathering, processing, transport expense in some detail given its importance as the largest individual line item. For the third quarter, GP&T was reduced to $1.43 per Mcfe compared to $1.51 in the fourth quarter last year. Consistent with our guidance, this line item peaked at the end of 2018 as our last contracted gas transport capacity came online. As planned, full utilization of infrastructure is driving down this cost on a unit basis. Going forward, even in a maintenance capital scenario, there are reductions in absolute spend that can extend this improving trend in per unit GP&T costs near, medium and long term.","Range's lease operating costs, excluding workovers, have declined in absolute and on a per unit of production basis compared to the third quarter last year and compared to the preceding quarter this year with third quarter costs declining to $0.13 per Mcfe. Incremental workover costs of $0.02 per Mcfe during the third quarter related to specific projects designed to optimize existing production. These were low-cost quick payback investments to make the most of existing infrastructure and production. Continued strong performance is driven by diligent operations in the field with specific savings related to water handling.","Cash G&A expense is an important figure during the third quarter as it is the first quarter reflective of a wide range of cost management initiatives. Last quarter, I mentioned the target of achieving a 10% reduction in absolute spend on an annualized basis with third quarter cash G&A expense of approximately $33 million. This represents approximately a 15% decline from the preceding quarter and annualized, a similar decline from prior year. While quarterly expenses do fluctuate, we expect the majority of this decrease to be sustainable and indicative of ongoing cost management.","During the quarter, we closed on the sale of royalty interest for gross proceeds of $750 million. This brings divestiture proceeds over the past year to approximately $1.1 billion, which has directly gone to reduce debt. On the topic of further balance sheet improvement, we are currently marketing several additional opportunities. These processes are in various stages. And as we've consistently done in the past, we will announce results, but we'll not establish a public dollar threshold or definitive time line.","Suffice it to say, we have a deep inventory projects that we believe we can divest at reasonable values, particularly in comparison to the value of our common equity. Divestiture proceeds were used to reduce borrowings with the bank line of credit declining to $328 million at the end of the third quarter. The balance of the revolving line of credit also reflects the results of open-market repurchases of approximately $94 million in face value of bonds with maturities in 2021 and 2022.","During the quarter, we began opportunistically repurchasing this near-term maturities at a modest discount. It is our intention to continue strengthening the balance sheet through debt reduction and through proactively addressing near-term maturities. Repurchasing these bonds and any future bond repurchases serve to facilitate refinancing in a cost-effective manner. Liquidity was improved with divestiture proceeds, but as recently announced, we also increased liquidity to the expansion of lender commitments under the revolver by 20%, an incremental $400 million to a total of $2.4 billion. This brings available liquidity after borrowings and letters of credit to $1.8 billion.","It should also be noted that Range's borrowing base remains at $3 billion with asset coverage potential above that figure providing additional cushion. While there is time before the first bond maturity in June 2021, this incremental liquidity serves as a potential backstop to help manage maturities. We remain focused on reducing debt, reducing borrowing costs and maintaining a thoughtful maturity ladder.","Another component of our recent announcement was the initiation of a share repurchase program sized at $100 million. The size, timing and framework for deploying capital through this repurchase program was carefully considered. It is Range's first priority to maintain and strengthen its financial foundation. With $1.1 billion in divestiture proceeds and an incremental $400 million in availability under the revolver, substantial progress has been made. Meanwhile, Range's stock price has suffered given commodity prices and leverage concerns. However, when viewed from a variety of valuation perspectives, be it net asset value per share, cash flow per share, production per share or reserves per share, we believe the value acquired via shares at these price levels is compelling. Consequently, a share repurchase program equating to greater than 10% of current market cap has been approved. While debt reduction remains our priority in light of the substantial reduction in debt and enhanced liquidity achieved, combined with our ongoing efforts, the potential allocation of less than 10% of recent divestiture proceeds for future opportunistic repurchases is a carefully balanced strategy.","As we look at the progress made in 2019 in terms of operating efficiently, safely, managing costs and the balance sheet, tangible achievements have been delivered against our strategic objectives. As we work through plans for 2020, it remains our priority to fund the business organically from cash flow to further strengthen the financial position and continue to protect and grow margins through ongoing cost management.","In summary, we remain focused on continuous improvement to position Range to effectively navigate commodity price cycles and to create long-term value while prudently managing risk. Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey Ventura","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Jeff, my first question regards the sustaining CapEx number. You cited $650 million for 2020. I was wondering if you could maybe give us a sense of what kind of rig count activity, TIL activity do you need to keep production flat from 2019 levels. We haven't seen a little bit of a reduction in the rig count looking at some of the publicly available data, so I just want you to give a sense of what the 2020 program could look like on a maintenance or sustaining basis.","Jeffrey Ventura","Okay. Yes. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Dennis for a little more detail. But I think when you look at the capital spend that we had this year and you look at the rig cadence and going up and down a little bit, rigs are important. I think lateral footage drilled is really a critical way to look at it. When you look at our wells carried in from '18 into '19 and '19 into '20 and what we're projecting from '20 to '21, that -- the lateral footage is pretty consistent. So again, we have an advantage in that we have a relatively low decline rate relative to our peers in high-quality wells and peer-leading PNC. But Dennis, do you want to put a little more color on that?","Dennis Degner","You betcha. Yes. Good morning. It looks like as we look forward -- I mean first of all, our planning group puts a lot of diligence in not only looking at what the upcoming year will present, but also the next couple of years that follow. So inventory management is something that we keep on the forefront in line with our activity. What we've learned clearly over the last several years is that rig activity and rig count isn't always the best proxy for what kind of inventory that's going to be generated. So back to Jeff's point, it really comes down to lateral foot that we're going to generate. In the call, we touched on it. But our drilling team has really done a phenomenal job just not only over the last 24 months, but just even also in the last quarter by drilling 35% faster in the lateral section compared to what we did on average in the first half of the year. So as we've been able to reduce down in rig count, a, it's been in line with our plan for the year. We were -- we're always playing to be front-end loaded. But we also see that we're generating more lateral footage for the same number of rigs based upon the efficiencies our service providers and our operating and technical teams on the drilling side have been able to generate.","So we feel really comfortable with the inventory that's being generated here as we end off 2019 and get ready to go into 2020 and also see that being sustainable for a -- I mean this capital perspective for the years that follow. To put some other framework around it, it's probably a couple of rigs as you look at the current efficiencies, and that's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of a couple of frac crews, 1 to 2 as well.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Mark, a follow-up for you. You talked about -- in the prepared remarks about proactively addressing some of the near-term maturities. I believe you have a $500 million maturity or so in 2021 and just under $1 billion in 2022. Could you talk about kind of your strategy for dealing with those maturities? You do have, I think you mentioned, $1.8 billion of liquidity, but give us kind of your action plan to addressing those maturities.","Mark Scucchi","Sure, Arun. I think a very fair question. And what I would point to is the proactive steps, the preventative nature of our activities historically of addressing maturities well in advance in this particular environment, whether it's through asset sales and just the absolute debt reduction. So far, obviously, as we discussed, over $1 billion of absolute debt reduction. The expansion of the bank credit facility provides again a backstop. So there is one alternative. But clearly, we will monitor the market and the conditions of the market for potential refinancing and move as soon as reasonably practical to push those maturities out. We're, of course, cost-sensitive. But on a risk-adjusted basis, we just want to make sure, as I mentioned during my prepared remarks, that we have a nice, thoughtful, safe maturity ladder with no imminent maturities. So I know that's a generic answer. But again, it's our approach to have multiple options, multiple ways of dealing with our financial and operational matters and decisions that need to be made. And I think we've kind of laid the groundwork for that on a financial front as well in terms of refinancing and having a backstop alternative.","Operator","The next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets.","Bradley Heffern","On 2020, I was wondering if we saw the flat price for gas stay similar to where it is now, around $2.30 or so. Is there a chance that you could let production decline in order to keep from outspending cash flow? Or is maintenance CapEx sort of the floor on what a capital program could be?","Mark Scucchi","Brad, this is Mark. I'll start with that, and we may each chime in. So I think the framework we've outlined, the first priority is operating the business with organically generated cash flow. So that will be the premise that we base our 2020 plans on. We are seeing significant cost savings. We're seeing improved operations, as Dennis just described a moment ago. So there is tremendous flexibility in our business model that overlays the asset base as well given the fact that all of our infrastructure is fully utilized. There are no drilling obligations that would require us to spend. There's no competing force that necessitates kind of abnormal growth in this commodity price environment. So we have the flexibility of doing a maintenance capital. And to -- more directly to your question, there is a scenario where you could allow modest production declines, and we maintain our unit cost or unit cost levels. So it is possible to allow production go into a modest decline.","Bradley Heffern","Okay. And then I guess if you could give a little more color on the repurchase and just the priorities of that versus debt. Obviously, you guys like the share -- well, you don't like the share price where it is right now, but you'd like to acquire the shares where they are right now. So if the stock stays at the current level, is it a program that could go relatively quickly? Or is it going to be balanced more delicately between repurchasing debt?","Mark Scucchi","Yes. I think first and foremost, you can see our priorities in terms of how we've deployed asset sale proceeds thus far. $1.1 billion in gross proceeds, and we've just now earmarked $100 million for share repurchase program. So looking at those two figures, you can see where we're placing the priorities. That being said, we do see tremendous value potential in the shares and the resource potential, the production and the cash flow that can be acquired via a share repurchase program. So we are not going to provide a specific framework, a quantitative framework by which we're going to deploy that $100 million. We're just going to be opportunistic and judicious with, again, protecting the balance sheet as a priority, but also deploying that $100 million program to create long-term value for our long-term shareholders.","Operator","The next question is from Karl Blunden of Goldman Sachs.","Karl Blunden","I appreciate the sensitivity around the explicit guidance on potential asset sale and royalty sales size. To some extent, it's important though when thinking about the size of the maturity wall to think about how much you could potentially do and then still have the result in NRI be acceptable for yourselves and relative to industry standards. Is there any way to quantify it in that way?","Mark Scucchi","Well, I think just looking at the last 12 months is a good indicator. We've sold 3.5% overwriting royalty interest and some modest noncore acreage for gross proceeds of over $1.1 billion. If we look at other basis with NRIs averaging around 75%, we are still substantially above that. There's obviously a host of options we have in our portfolio that we could seek to divest and generate proceeds; royalties are certainly among those. So if we're trying to draw a larger box around it, I think, for lack of a better example, I would just look at what we've accomplished over the last 12 months and say that there's really a possibility of replicating something like that.","Karl Blunden","Got you. That makes sense. And I have noted of course that the valuations you received have been pretty much constant over the last 12 months. That speaks to some debts in the market. Just with regard to some comments around potentially considering revolver drawings to pay down bonds, I understand that decision is to be made at a later point in time, we've seen some periods in oilier basins, I mean covenants to allow for in excess of, for example, 700 million of drawings to do that. Is that -- how should we think about the size and how much liquidity you'd use on your revolver to do that versus sitting down and making a tough decision as to is this the time to extend maturities using secured debt, for example?","Dennis Degner","So we are not in a position any time in the near future to have to really begin seriously exploring layering the existing senior notes. The revolving credit agreement allows us to repurchase debt, which we've already begun that program, as I mentioned, and the details are disclosed in the 10-Q, but we've repurchased face value of $94 million between the '21 and '22 notes already at a modest discount. So there's an opportunity here that we can continue opportunistically repurchasing those near-term maturities, '21s and '22s. So it just helps facilitate a refinancing when that becomes appropriate in time line.","So there is a modest limitation in the credit agreement. But as long as we have 15% availability under the commitments, we can repurchase up to that amount under the revolver. Clearly not our intention to just pull all of that in and use bank debt to do it. But just as frame of reference, that's the level and extent of the liquidity we have available to us.","Operator","The next question is from David Deckelbaum of Cowen.","David Deckelbaum","I just have maybe just one broad question, just about the buyback. Just curious on the timing that you're introducing it now. You guys have highlighted the discounted PDP for some time. Was this sort of the discount one you over -- just the prolonged duration of that, was this an external demand? Is it something that internally you all had devised? Just curious around the timing had come up now, particularly in light of the endeavors to delever the balance sheet.","Jeffrey Ventura","It's a culmination of the efforts that had been under the way this year, first and foremost, being debt reduction is the short answer. Valuation certainly plays a part in that. But first and foremost, it was repositioning the balance sheet with $1 billion in debt reduction.","David Deckelbaum","Okay. And then just to ask on the maintenance capital going into next year. I think you all have delineated the $650 million or so all-in and then around $550 million or so just on D&C side. One, I guess, is that sort of the broad level to think about beyond '20 in that five year plan, that sort of $100 million of other capital? Does that inflect lower at all? And then I guess, two, I suppose it doesn't -- that wouldn't necessarily benefit from any tailwinds of -- you're not necessarily including savings on the water side in those numbers because I'd like to get a better sense of what we see drilling activity being lower in Appalachia over time if there's just a greater upside then on water savings from water sharing.","Dennis Degner","David, this is Dennis. Yes. I think in the last call, one of the things is we started to touch on the capital required for maintenance capital. I think we may have said at one point in time, the numbers you're framing of $550 million to a $600 million kind of assessment, that was also earlier in the year, end of 2018 kind of view. But once the program for 2019 then took shape, front-end loaded activity had a stronger ramp in production for Q4, it's what started to fluctuate, if you will, to maybe be more closer to that $650-million-type number. I don't think we're viewing $100 million in non-D&C capital as a part of that right now. It should be something significantly less. And I think a lot of it has to do with when you look at our responsible land capital spending, as an example, a lot of our acreage is held by production.","So land spending has reduced year-over-year not only as we've seen the land get held through our activity, but also through just those strategic leases that need to be picked up then start to get smaller and smaller. So we would estimate that delta between the non-D&C capital and D&C to be much lower than what you've reflected here.","David Deckelbaum","Okay. All right. Understood. And then just to -- if you could, any color on just the water savings you're experiencing. Is this just a function of just lower activity in the basin and less demand for water?","Dennis Degner","A few years ago, I'm going to say this was probably the 2014-2015 time frame. We've -- we had been on at that point about a three to four year run of recycling 100% of our produced water in Southwest PA. So good initiative there, very creative by our local team there in Pennsylvania. What they then saw was an opportunity to expand that through water sharing with other operators. Clearly, as their program started to slow in activity, we had the ability to utilize more of their water. Though we're at 100% recycling in those years, it still makes up about 40% to 45% of our total water use. So there's an opportunity to take other people's water. So we view it as a win-win. We view it in line with our ESG reporting that we announced earlier this year, which we're excited about. And we see this as savings not only that we're capturing this year, but we also captured it similarly last year.","Will we be able to continue this? We're optimistic that we can. And a lot of it has to do with those partnerships and the relationships we develop with those other operators. With our contiguous acreage position, it really lends itself to the ability to capitalize on those savings year-over-year depending upon the program.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will go to Kevin Cunane with Citi for our final question.","Kevin Cunane","I just had a quick question on your unit cost assumptions under your maintenance CapEx scenario. You mentioned transportation coming down despite moving to maintenance. So is that just your Louisiana contract pulling off? Or is there something else there as well?","Jeffrey Ventura","There are variety of pieces to it. Just continuing to optimize the existing transport, there's a processing contract rolling off. There's some other more modest local gas transport contracts that we can rearrange and\/or allow to expire. So it comes in a variety of forms, including perhaps moving NGL transport off of rail on to pipeline. So there's a number of forms that help drive a reduction in spend even in maintenance CapEx-type scenarios.","Kevin Cunane","Got it. Understood. And then I guess just on your DUC count. Do you guys have an active drill down fleet that you've owned through the end of year and into next?","Jeffrey Ventura","Yes. I would say -- yes. Kevin, we have a very consistent -- I would say, a lot of it's really fairly just in time based upon the activity level that we have. So rarely have we carried a strong DUC inventory. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that once we're moving in to do that activity, we have a pipeline in the ground in most cases and we're ready to produce those wells. So we're carrying a very consistent DUC inventory from 2019 into 2020 that you would see within a small bandwidth from prior years as well.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.","Jeffrey Ventura","I just want to thank everyone for participating on this morning's call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.","Statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","At this time, I would like to turn over the call to Mr. Laith Sando, Vice President, Investor Relations at Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range's Year-End Earnings Call. The speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Chief Financial Officer.","Hopefully, you've had a chance to review the press release and updated Investor Presentation that we posted on our website. We also filed our 10-K with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.","Before we begin, let me also point out that we will be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. In addition, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of these non-GAAP measures. The supplemental tables also provide calculated natural gas differentials for the upcoming quarter and detailed hedging information for all products.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks, Laith, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on this morning's earnings call. As we begin 2018 and we look at what the next several years hold for Range, we're excited about what we see as we begin to harvest the top tier inventory that we've captured since discovering the Marcellus in 2004. We see this translating into improved returns and free cash flow laid out in our five-year outlook.","Before we discuss the great opportunity we see going forward, I'd like to acknowledge that our performance in 2017 was not up to Range's standards. While we had outstanding results in the Marcellus, we did not hit our targets in North Louisiana and we all agree yearly results have been disappointing.","The productivity of the wells has been below our expectations, and this is reflected in the updated type curves that we provided last month. Put simply, the asset has been more geologically complex than anticipated and portions of the core area have been less productive than expected. And while we have a very talented hard-working team overseeing the assets, we are slowing our North Louisiana activity significantly in 2018 and allocating approximately 85% of our capital to the Marcellus.","By slowing down in North Louisiana, it will allow the team additional time to incorporate our latest technical and production data. By allowing more time running just one rig for the remainder of 2018, we expect the team under new leadership will make improvements. Throughout 2018 and going forward, we will continually assess our capital allocation and make adjustments as needed.","From where we sit today, running one rig in North Louisiana and focusing the vast majority of our capital towards the Marcellus is the right move for Range. By focusing our capital in the Marcellus, we expect to generate Southwest Pennsylvania growth of 25% in 2018, allowing Range to fully utilize its transportation capacity. The ability to fill our firm transportation commitment so efficiently is a testament to the collaborative efforts of our marketing, planning and operational teams.","The Marcellus has continued to surprise us to the high side in terms of productivity and efficiency gains, as evidenced by the consistent reserve growth and production results over the last decade with improved type curves over time, most recently in the super-rich area that has continued to outperform our expectations.","Couple all of this with improving local differentials and a class-leading inventory of 3, 800 wells is why we're allocating approximately 85% of our capital to the Marcellus and why it is the driver behind the five-year outlook we recently provided the market.","Looking at this five-year outlook and beyond, I believe Range is very well-positioned to drive long-term value for shareholders with the focus on delevering and returning capital to shareholders. As we discussed on the last earnings call, Range has spent the last 10-plus years taking the Marcellus from an idea in a Range conference room to what is now the largest gas field in the country. This commissioning phase for Range is largely complete in 2018 as the last of our natural gas infrastructure projects comes into service, allowing us to deliver natural gas to customers from Appalachia to the Gulf Coast and abroad.","Over the course of the five-year outlook, we see continued improvements to margins through a combination of improved access to markets and an improved cost structure, driven primarily through better utilization of existing transportation and gathering capacity. Range's five-year outlook delivers an annual production CAGR of approximately 13% on a per share debt-adjusted basis.","Importantly, the outlook also provides approximately $1 billion in free cash flow and leverage below 2 times by 2022, all at year-end strip pricing and without the benefit of potential asset sales. This not only shows our commitment to spending within cash flow, but also the deliverability of our assets led by the Marcellus where the team has a great track record of delivering consistent results.","Switching gears and looking at the balance sheet, know that we're committed to prudently improving debt-to-EBITDAX below 3 times as quickly as possible. Like I mentioned, the five-year outlook has us improving leverage organically to under 2 times by 2022 without the benefit of potential asset sales, but our plan is to use asset sales to accelerate the deleveraging process and that's something we are actively pursuing.","Any additional cash flow from increased commodity prices or additional capital efficiencies will go towards our near-term delevering goals. In 2017, we sold $70 million worth of assets as part of our continual high grading, and we currently have processes underway for additional asset sales.","In addition to potential asset sales in the Midcontinent and northeast Pennsylvania, we're also looking at ways to pull forward the value on inventory that's not in our near-term plans. Before turning it over to Ray, I'll say what I think distinguishes Range is a very high quality and very large inventory. Evidence of this can be found in our five-year outlook and our recent reserves release.","At the end of the five-year outlook, Range would still have 3,200 wells remaining in the Marcellus alone. I believe the quality of our inventory is demonstrated in our year-end reserves report where proved reserves were up 26% over the prior year for Range.","The PV-10 of these reserves was $8.1 billion based on SEC pricing or $9.5 billion using year-end strip pricing. For context, our total enterprise value is trending at a roughly 30% discount to this PV-10, which doesn't include several thousand unbooked Marcellus wells or any of the potential we have in the Utica, Upper Devonian or Lower Cotton Valley. In effect, I see very little, if any, value being ascribed to Range's vast unbooked resource potential. It is on us, the Range team, to prudently and consistently execute and translate this resource potential into shareholder value.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. Starting with production, the fourth quarter came in at 2.17 Bcf equivalent per day, which resulted in 30% year-over-year growth. And the first quarter is off to a great start and we expect it to come in at 2.18 Bcf equivalent per day, which is inclusive of some planned MarkWest downtime that happened during January at the Houston complex, involving residue compression maintenance and upgrades for the new Houston 1A plant that's being commissioned soon. This had an impact of about 30 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the quarter for Range. This was built into our 2018 forecast, and I'll add that the MarkWest team did a great job in getting all this work done as planned.","For the year, annual production guidance is set at 11% and our capital budget for 2018 is reduced from 2017 and is currently planned at $941 million, allocated approximately 85% to our Marcellus assets in southwest Pennsylvania. Around 91% of the total corporate budget this year is directed towards drilling, completion, facilities and pipeline infrastructure.","Like Jeff mentioned, in our recent reserves release, we reported a 26% increase in proved reserves to 15.3 Tcf equivalent, resulting in a year-end PV-10 reserve value of $9.5 billion using strip pricing from year-end and current sales contracts. Our drill-bit finding costs were $0.31 per Mcfe with 55% of our SEC reserves being proved developed, and our proved developed reserve life of 19 years remains exceptionally strong compared to our peers.","The average lateral length for existing proved undeveloped wells in the Marcellus increased by 26% to approximately 9,000 feet, with newly added proved undeveloped wells averaging over 9,500 feet. Over the past several years, the lateral lengths of our proved undeveloped locations have continued to progress longer, and I would expect that these lateral lengths, when drilled, will on average be longer than they're currently booked.","We also had positive performance revisions for 2017, as improvements in well performance in the Marcellus more than offset the underperformance in North Louisiana that we previously discussed. Over the last five years, our reserves have essentially doubled or increased approximately 7 Tcf equivalent, adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures. Page 6 of our presentation on the website provides additional detail on the depth and quality of our Marcellus inventory.","As we've discussed on previous calls, over the last several years, Range has drilled some excellent wells on the north, southeast and west portions of our southwest Pennsylvania acreage position that further confirm the high quality of our core Marcellus acreage. The consistent success and continued improvement both in short-term rates and longer-term recoveries has all of us here at Range excited about the quality and scope of our future development potential.","So let me run through some highlights to represent some of the great things going on in Southwest Pennsylvania. During the fourth quarter, we turned in line 42 Marcellus wells averaging over 10,000-foot laterals from 10 different pads. When you look at the 30-day average rate to sales, again, remembering all these wells were under facility constrained conditions, these 42 wells on an average basis produced 23 million cubic feet equivalent per day to sales per each well. And, again, these are 30-day constrained rates and not just peak rates or IPs.","During the fourth quarter, we had four pads flowing at over 100 million cubic feet equivalent per day each pad to sales. These four pads were over that 100 million a day mark for each pad for periods ranging from 12 days up to 60 days and counting. One of those pads that's in our dry gas area produced to sales at over 170 million a day under constrained conditions for 14 days from five wells averaging 14,384-foot laterals.","Our corporate base PDP decline for 2018 quarter-four to quarter-four is expected to be approximately 23%. As we progress into 2019, our corporate base PDP decline will be decreasing to approximately 18%, allowing us to hold production flat with much less capital. Our Marcellus PDP decline rate is approximately 20% for 2018 and 17% for 2019.","As our production becomes more and more dominated by the Marcellus in Southeast Pennsylvania, our corporate decline rate will continue to flatten even more. At the end of our five-year outlook, we expect to be producing in the range of 3.5 Bcf equivalent per day, and we'll have the ability to hold production flat if we choose to with only about $600 million per year of maintenance capital, yielding $1.3 billion in annual free cash flow, as illustrated on slide 14 in the presentation on the website. And importantly, at the end of 2022, we will still have 3,200 high-quality Marcellus wells left to drill. We believe this sets Range apart from our peers.","On the drilling side, in Southwest Pennsylvania, we drilled 1.1 million lateral feet in 2017, which represents a new record and is a 30% increase in the footage drilled per rig over the prior year. The team drilled our top 15 longest Marcellus lateral lengths in 2017, with several laterals planned for 17,000 to over 18,000 feet in 2018.","In fact, just this past weekend, the team set pipe on a 17,875-foot Marcellus lateral, and the rig is currently drilling a planned 18,100-foot lateral on the same pad. Our internal industry research shows that we've now drilled the longest Marcellus lateral on record. While the average lateral length drilled in 2017 increased by 34%, importantly, the drilling cost per foot decreased by 16%. These drilling efficiencies have served to offset some of the increased service costs we've seen. This is reflected in our well economics that show improvement on a normalized cost basis in 2018.","On the completions and operations side of Southwest Pennsylvania, we completed a record 5,302 frac stages in 2017. The average lateral length of wells turned in line increased to 9,102 feet, which is a 42% increase over 2016. The average lateral length of wells turned in line in 2018 is expected to be 10,110 feet or an 11% increase over 2017. For 2018, we expect to drill approximately half of our wells on existing pads, which is up from a third last year.","The teams' efforts on water recycling have also benefited the company significantly as we are not only servicing our own wells efficiently with some of the lowest well cost in the area, we're also saving money by taking water from other operators in the area, reducing our cost further. On average, we have about $1.4 million in water costs per well, much less than some of our peers. And in Southwest Pennsylvania, our LOE decreased by 9% to $0.10 per Mcfe for 2017.","Concurrent with our recent reserves, 2018 capital and five-year outlook releases, we updated our type curves and economics in the presentation on the website, representing the average of the wells we expect to turn in line during 2018, as I just mentioned. And again, while we've priced in modest service cost increases of 5% to 10% in 2018, which mostly are on the completions side, we expect the net impact of those increases to be minimal in Southwest Pennsylvania.","Our technical team is also expanding its work with data analytics and predictive analysis, and we expect to see continued optimization from that work. Longer laterals, going back to existing pads and utilization of existing infrastructure, resulting in lower unit cost will also contribute to better economics and efficiencies in the coming years.","And finally, while not a lot of companies talk about it, I'm really proud of our teams all across the company when it comes to safety and environmental compliance. We had a great year in safety for 2017 with no days away-from-work and only one recordable incident for Range employees, taking us closer and closer to our goal of zero incidents and sending all of our employees and contractors home safely to their families each and every day.","On the environmental front, we focus each day on operating in an environmentally safe manner. For example, we've focused on minimizing methane emissions over the last several years. From facilities designed to testing protocols, we've made it a priority and have shared our efforts in the field with state and federal regulators. I am pleased to report that Range was recently recognized as a top performer in the area of emissions by As You Sow in its annual report, which can be found on our website.","Shifting now to North Louisiana, like Jeff said, the results we've seen thus far were not up to our standards. Our current plan is to run one rig for the remainder of 2018 with one frac crew on and off during the year as timing dictates. We'll continue to monitor capital and results and make adjustments as necessary. We'll continue to take what we learned throughout 2017 and integrate key drivers, such as landing target, job intensity, proppant placement, and stage spacing in the various layers in the Lower Cotton Valley.","We're incorporating seismic attribute data from the new shoots that we received near year-end and have developed more stringent reservoir and earth modeling. Bottom line, we're going slower and we have a dedicated technical team focused on improving the results we've seen to-date.","Shifting to marketing, during both the fourth quarter of 2017 and in early 2018, incremental firm pipeline takeaway capacity out of Southwest PA has commenced operations, which should improve our corporate differential significantly going forward. These projects include Enbridge's Tetco Adair Southwest Project, which went into service late in the fourth quarter, and TransCanada's Leach and Rayne XPress projects, which went into full service January 1 this year. And by the end of the second quarter when Rover is expected to be online, over 90% of Range's production will be directed towards price-advantaged markets.","Importantly, these additions to Range's transportation portfolio reduce basis volatility, especially during the seasonally weak months of July to October and should increase the predictability of Range's corporate natural gas differential going forward.","Looking at near-term Appalachia supply and demand, our internal work shows that when you look at the natural gas takeaway projects that have come into service since the third quarter of 2017, only about half of that volume is new gas, with the other half simply being local gas that was being displaced. More broadly, storage levels are likely to end the winter season between 1.4 and 1.5 Tcf, which will require a significant injection season to bring storage levels closer in line with the five-year average by the end of October.","At current forward pricing levels, coal-to-gas switching is incentivized, providing additional demand upside. Longer term, from the third quarter of 2017 through the end of 2019, we expect Southwest Appalachia takeaway to grow by approximately 12 Bcf a day with an additional 1.5 Bcf a day of demand growth from Cove Point and new gas power plant (21:32) over the same time period.","Consensus production estimates for Southwest Appalachian producers points to growth of 6.2 Bcf per day over the same time period at prices ranging from $3.07 to $3.09 per Mcf with WTI at $60 per barrel. And, of course, the current strip is not that high and might not support that level of growth. All of this supports the potential for improving local prices.","We're also seeing strong global LNG demand and we believe the U.S. is well-positioned to supply that increased demand. And specifically for Range, we believe our high-quality inventory and transportation portfolio positions us well to access this future demand growth.","Shifting to liquids, Range produced record volumes of NGLs in the fourth quarter of 2017 with total net NGL production of 106,038 barrels per day, up 24% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter, making Range one of the largest independent NGL producers in the U.S.","In fact, almost one-third of Range's expected revenue in 2018 comes from natural gas liquids, providing us leverage to improving liquids pricing, as evidenced in our five-year outlook sensitivities. As shown in the company presentation, if WTI were to average $60 over the five-year period versus strip pricing, which is closer to $54, Range would add an additional $700 million in cash flow over the next five years.","A significant portion of Range's ethane and propane volumes are being delivered to premium market segments via Range's advantaged access to international destinations. Fourth quarter Appalachian ethane gross prices were up about $0.25 per gallon, representing a 119% premium to local natural gas markets before hedging, and C3 plus NGL gross prices were $42 a barrel or 76% of WTI before hedging.","Propane, in particular, benefited from improving domestic and international fundamentals, with Range's realized prices up 59% over the same period in the prior year. Our top-tier inventory of liquids-rich assets have us well-positioned to supply both domestic and international projects coming on stream throughout this decade and the next.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials.","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you, Ray. Reviewing the Form 10-K one final time last week, I could not help but notice the SEC required disclosure table on page 45. This table, as presented in all 10-Ks, sets forth the past five years of financial performance. Page 45 of the Range 10-K illustrates that since 2013, production has essentially doubled, proved reserves have essentially doubled, total unit costs per Mcfe have roughly been cut in half, profitability has been restored, cash flow from hedges has largely been replaced by cash flow from operations. Yet at year-end 2013, our market cap was 175% of our SEC PV-10 and currently our market cap is 41% of our SEC PV-10. This disclosure was a stark reminder that there are times when financial and operating performance have little bearing on stock price performance, and this is one of those times.","Now looking at the fourth quarter, revenues, net income and cash flow were above the third quarter and higher than the fourth quarter of last year. Despite late pipes and challenging operating conditions, production guidance was met and consensus estimates were exceeded. Fourth quarter cash flow was $260 million, slightly higher than last year. Full year 2017 cash flow totaled $916 million, a 61% increase from 2016.","Fourth quarter EBITDAX was $309 million and full year 2017 EBITDAX totaled $1.1 billion, 53% higher than last year. Fully diluted cash flow per share for the fourth quarter was $1.06, while full year 2017 cash flow per fully diluted share was $3.73, 24% higher than full year 2016.","As Laith mentioned, please reference the earnings release and supplemental tables on the Range website for full reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP.","Cash margin for the fourth quarter at $1.29 per Mcfe was higher than the third quarter and full-year cash margin at $1.24 per Mcfe was 26% better than the full year 2016 figure. We look forward to our remaining pipeline capacity coming online during the first half of 2018, which will help stabilize our margins as basis volatility has reduced.","GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $220 million and GAAP net income for the full year was $331 million. Adjusting fourth quarter GAAP net income using common analyst methodology, which removes non-cash and non-recurring items, was $55 million or $0.22 per fully diluted share. Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the full year was $143 million or $0.58 per share.","Reviewing significant unit cost structure variances for the fourth quarter, transportation, gathering and processing came in $0.05 per Mcfe favorable to guidance due to in-service (27:56) dates on several new pipelines. The offset to this cost improvement was a $0.07 wider forecast to gas price differential as pipeline takeaway capacity access to better price markets was delayed.","Reflecting the reallocation of capital from North Louisiana to Appalachia, we increased our estimate of expiring North Louisiana acreage, resulting in a $218 million non-cash impairment of unproved properties. Other unit costs were below or in line with guidance.","While not a specific guidance item, I wish to mention that Range, like most all other publicly traded companies, will be adopting the new GAAP accounting standard for revenue recognition in the first quarter of 2018. Under this new accounting standard, costs associated with certain gathering and processing arrangements that are currently netted against revenue will be re-classed to expense.","There is no increase in actual cost with this new accounting standard, only a reclassification between revenue and expense. The result will be an increase in revenue and an identical increase in gathering, transportation and processing expense. I will update guidance to reflect this change and provide a reconciliation between the old and new accounting standards in April.","Over on the balance sheet, as Jeff stated, we have a plan in place to orderly reduce our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio over time, and we intend to bring down leverage ratio faster than our five-year outlook forecast with asset sales. In the meantime, Range continues to have ample liquidity with over $500 million in committed availability under its bank credit facility.","Consistent with our past practice, Range has continued to add to its hedge position during the fourth quarter with over 70% of our anticipated 2018 natural gas production hedged at a forward price of $3.09 per Mcf and over 70% of our projected oil production hedged with a forward price of $53.30 a barrel. Details of our current hedge positions across all of our products may be found in the earnings release, Range website and 10-K.","In summary, the fourth quarter showed steady progress with higher production, cash flow and net income. The full year financial performance for 2017 was markedly better than 2016, with EBITDAX back up over $1 billion and unit cost held in check.","Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Ventura. First question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I'll start with a philosophical question, I guess. So, as you guys mentioned, you are trading well below PV-10. Why do you think that that is? And what do you think that you can do to address it? I know it's kind of a tough question, but if you could take a shot.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. Well, let me take a shot at it. It's a good question. I think, one, it \u2013 we'll talk about the macro and Range specific. But, one, I think people are typically bearish natural gas right now and if they're into the commodity, probably more on the oil side. Later on, all right, we can do it as a follow-up question if you want, I can address the macro and maybe paint a little bit better picture. But I think the macro is part of that.","I think the other part of it, quite frankly, like we said, are two things. Our leverage is high relative to peers and the results in Terryville have been disappointing, like we said. To address those two things specifically, I think when you look at our leverage, we have a five-year outlook that we put out that I think is a good solid plan led by the Marcellus and I think we really have outstanding high quality rocking team work in the Marcellus to drive that plan.","So to address the leverage specifically, and it's on page 12 of presentation if you look at it, assuming no asset sales and we are actively pursuing asset sales, by 2020, assuming strip pricing, we get debt-to-EBITDAX below 3 times. I think that's important. Importantly, on that same page, we ran a couple of sensitivities. If you assume the strip is correct for gas, but just assume WTI is $60, so currently it's trading over $60 and the strip long-term is a little under that, but if WTI is $60, debt-to-EBITDAX accelerates getting below 3 times from 2020 to 2019. Not that far out. And then, again, to the extent we're successful with our assets sales, we have the opportunity to pull that into 2018. I think that will be a key event for us there in terms of getting valuation back.","And, again, you can, same thing, debt-to-EBITDAX below 2 times on a five-year outlook, 2020, it's 2022. WTI is $60, pulls it to 2021, asset sales would pull that below 2 times to 2020. I think that's important. On that same page, too, with that I talked about debt-to-EBITDAX, but it also increases our free cash flow by 70% or $700 million, as Ray said and, of course, that gives us a great free cash flow yield of greater than 40%, given where we trade.","So I think those are important things. In terms of North Louisiana, we talked about. Partly we're addressing the results there. We're slowing down. We're going down to one rig. We think that's the right thing and we're really redirecting the bulk of our cash flow up into the Marcellus, which we also think is the right thing. So it gives us time to slow down, see where we are in Louisiana. At the same time, we're having phenomenal results in Pennsylvania. Ray talked about some of them. We expect that that will continue.","So it recognizes the great results we have in PA. Also with all that new transportation that's coming on in PA, we expect the prices to come in a little bit, give us better net back in pricing, and through redirecting existing volumes coupled with the focus, the capital there allows us to fulfill our transportation commitments. So we think those are the reasons I think we're trading below \u2013 to answer question specifically, those are the things that we're doing specifically to address them.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. Appreciate the detailed answer. And then in the prepared comments, you talked about pulling forward value outside of the asset sales that you've talked about in the Mid-Con and in Northeast PA. Is that just more asset sales or are you thinking about other structures like JVs or something along those lines to do that?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Well, it's great question, too. So there's multiple things we're looking at and multiple options in order to help us delever and pull forward value. If you look at the position we have in Southwest PA, we have a big position, we have a big footprint. Importantly, we hold all horizons with any well. So, it's not just the Marcellus, but it's the Utica, the Upper Devonian and within that big footprint. To the extent there's value in some of those horizons or value in inventory that's far out there that we could pull forward that we think is a fair price, we certainly would consider that and do that.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Next question from Holly Stewart from Scotia Howard. Your line is open.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning, gentlemen.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Maybe the first one, either for Jeff or Ray. I'm just curious what specifically are you looking for? I mean, I think you completed roughly 20 wells in North Louisiana in the fourth quarter. So, I guess, what are you looking for as you watch those wells? And then how are you thinking about the changes to the completion design in 2018?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Let me start at a high-level then I'll flip it over to Ray. Again, what we're doing is recognizing the below performance that we've experienced. So, if you go back to 2017, we talked about what the results were for the first-half wells. And although the second-half 2017 wells were significantly better, they're still below what we were targeting.","So last year, we ran four rigs and at times more than four rigs \u2013 six or seven rigs, in a spot period, we've cut back. Today, we're at two rigs. In a week, we'll be at one and we'll stay at one rig for the rest of the year. So I think going slower is important.","We've changed leadership. We're incorporating all the knowledge that we have to do that. And at the same time, we're redirecting our capital up to the Marcellus where we've had great results, consistent results. And if anything, it just keeps surprising us to the high side. So we think that's the right way to allocate capital and it's the right pace to go at in Louisiana. But, Ray, you want to hone in on some of the specifics on what we're going to do on the one-rig program?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Sure, sure. It's a great question, Holly. I think what's important to point out and all the things Jeff said, I totally agree with and is exactly why we've moved most of our capital to Appalachia because they've had great success up there and things have improved in longer laterals and capital efficiencies and just all the things we are seeing happen there.","When you look at the last batch of wells that we did, like Jeff said, they're way better than the wells we did in the first half of the year, but they still didn't reach what our expectation was going in. But there were a few wells that did and there were a few isolated cases. I think some wells we announced back \u2013 last September that were at the tight curve have continued to perform well. We drilled the best Lower Deep Pink well in the field today and so there's a few things there that we want to do some more testing.","We experimented with some different job sizes, stage spacing, cluster designs, proppant intensity, different things like that that we experimented with over that last batch of wells. And so we literally need to slow down, let the team focus on some technical analysis of all that data, decide what worked, why it worked and what didn't work and why it didn't work, build some models and look at the different areas that we're going to be looking at. But, again, we're going a whole lot slower. It's a lot less capital and, again, pulling in new leadership and a different focus on it going forward.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, great. Maybe could you just expound on the new leadership comment?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Sure. John Applegath, who is leading that division, have retired earlier this year. John did a lot of great things for the company and he was approaching his 70th birthday and was ready to go. And we have promoted Dennis Degner to Senior Vice President. Dennis is going to be overseeing both divisions day to day. Dennis has a lot of great experience as a background and a lot of the efficiencies and the successes we're seeing in the Marcellus are a direct result of Dennis' work up there. So we're going to be still focusing on Appalachia. And like you say, 85% or more of his time is still Appalachia and that's where the lion's share and the engine and our whole five-year plan is based on. But, clearly, we're going to pull in, slow down and put a lot more technical analysis in the North Louisiana assets going forward.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","And I'd add to that a little bit. Dennis has done a great job for us running operations for a long time there, now be in-charge of both divisions. Again, still focused on making sure we're doing a great job up in Appalachia as well as trying to pick up what we're doing in Louisiana.","Curt Tipton is going to run our division up in South Point. Curt's been with us a long time, does a fantastic job. I have great confidence in Curt and his ability and the team up there, great depth there. And then Scott Chesebro will replace John Applegath to run the North Louisiana division. Scott has a great track record. He spent a lot of time with Anadarko, actually worked that area and did a lot of the drilling in and around Vernon when Anadarko was running a lot of rigs, and then later on, did a lot of things worldwide for Anadarko. So Scott has a great track record, great resume, and we think under that team, working under Dennis will do great things.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","That's great. And maybe just for my last question. Can you just remind us of the total firm pipeline commitments and then kind of when during 2018 you expect to have those filled?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Well, we had three pipeline projects coming on. And when you look at the three pipeline projects, one of them came on in the fourth quarter, one of them literally like January 1. The last of the three is Rover. Rover should be on \u2013 we'll defer to Energy Transfer and the comments that they made on when Rover is going to come on. So, it'd be early second quarter, maybe, I think is what they're saying.","When you look at our ability to, again, move existing volumes into the pipeline as well as the new drilling, we think that we'll do a good job of filling that transportation this year and have really over 90% of our natural gas going to good markets. And that's part of \u2013 when you look at the Range story, I was talking a lot early on, I quoted a lot of the numbers out of the five-year plan.","The other thing that's I think important to look at on the presentation, and I'm seeing if I can flip through it and find it real quick, I think it may be in the appendix. But we have with our \u2013 differentials are for natural gas, for NGLs and for condensate. And again, you see continued improvement in 2018 in all three areas, and a lot of that is a result of the transportation and efficiently using the transportation. The IR team, I'm sure, can give you guidance to what they are, plus it's in the presentation.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","That's great. Thanks, guys.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question from Adam Meyers from Cowen. Your line is open.","Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC","I guess, maybe just starting with the five-year growth outlook here. I'm curious if you could give us any kind of background as to how Range arrived at kind of 11% as the optimal long-term growth rate to hit your leverage targets. I'm talking to some investors, it sounds like some could be wondering why it's not a lower growth rate, potentially throw off some more cash. So, any thoughts you have on that would be interesting.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. I mean, that's a great question. And when you look at the plan, there were several things we're looking at. Again, it's driven by the Marcellus. It's driven by wells we have high confidence in, in terms of being able to hit the results and targets. I think that the team did a job in terms of when you look at 2018 and 2019, very reasonable assumptions. We really didn't build in efficiencies until you go out to year three, four and five. And the efficiencies we built in were pretty minor. There are things that we see today that are in hand. We assume lateral lengths no longer than 10,000 feet, even though in reality we'll probably do that. So, we think we have a good plan that's well-built and we tied it to strip pricing.","When you look at it, there's a variety of things that you need to look at in order to build the plan. We ran multiple sensitivities. Of course, Holly just asked on the previous question about the transportation we have and filling transportation. So this plan fills transportation, it meets transportation. And when you look at it, it delevers us over time and then throws off a significant amount of free cash flow over time with those rates.","So we're living at or below the cash flow estimates and different pricing estimates. We ran some different sensitivities to show you, again, on page 12, throws off $1.7 billion at $60 WTI and gas strip. That's a 40% free cash flow yield. Those are commitments. It does a lot of good things for us. And of course, we'll continue to look to optimize it with time and to see what the most optimum thing to do is. But it delevers us and then it gives us the optionality with time to either increase dividend or buy back shares.","Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC","Right. That makes sense. And then maybe sticking with the five-year plan, deleveraging obviously a key component. Any way that you can give us a sense as to the level of interest you're seeing for some of these non-core assets and maybe just how much an asset sale could accelerate the timeframe for deleveraging?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Like I said, when you do asset sales, it's really important you've got to find the right buyer. I think I'd give examples with various people in the past and good examples for us would be Nora or Bradford County assets. You have to be disciplined and you have to find the right buyer. Again, I'll keep referring to page 12, with no asset sales, debt-to-EBITDAX gets below 3x at 2020. WTI \u2013 gas stays at strip and you look at WTI at $60, it accelerates to 2019. If we're successful this year with asset sales, we could pull it into 2018.","Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC","Well, okay. Very interesting. Great quarter. Thank you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question from Mike Kelly of Seaport Global. Your line is open.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","You just kind of touched on it, Jeff, but really I want to look at slide 8 that shows kind of your organic deleverage and wanted to get your sense on what you'd like this chart to look like with asset sales, specifically kind of 2020 metrics, where you'd like that to be?","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. When you look at slide 8, again, it shows debt-to-EBITDAX below 3 times in 2020 and below 2 times in 2022. I'd like it to be sub-3 times near term. And a little bit of price improvement, successful asset sales this year, we could get there. So we'll try as hard as we can and focus on that and basically it's pulling the blue bars forward on slide 8 a year, preferably two years.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And switching gears. Ray, you hit on the supply\/demand dynamics in the Northeast gas market. What kind of stood out to me was that you expect pipeline capacity growth kind of 2x what you see as production growth out of the Basin through the end of \u2013 I think it was the end of 2019. I was curious if you could give us a little bit more color on your projections on that supply growth front. You gave like a 6 Bcf a day number and just want to hear a little bit more detail on this \u2013 on that analysis that encompasses everybody that's up there, anything you give on that front would be helpful. Thanks.","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. What we did is, of course, it's all internal work. And we looked at third quarter \u2013 took the timeframe from the third quarter of 2017 through the end of 2019, which isn't that far away. I mean, it sounds long ways out there, but it's the end of next year. And when you look at that, we've got pretty good line of sight on the pipes (48:30) that are going to happen and I think there's pretty much a lot of confidence in that. Certainly with the current administration and FERC commission, all that looks positive.","So there's about 12 Bs a day when you sum all that up. We simply took basically the consensus estimates and public data of the Southwest Basin producers, both Utica and Marcellus in the areas that would be connected to those pipes. And, again, we're completely holding Northeast PA out. I think that's a totally different animal up there. But if we look at the producers that are connected to those pipes and what they've publicly said and what consensus estimates are built around, it's about a little over 6 to maybe 6.5 Bs a day of growth that everybody is projecting from the third quarter of 2017 through the end of 2019, so with the same time period.","So this is following I think what we've seen historically in this industry over the last almost 40 years I've been doing this is that infrastructure always gets overbuilt. Now the question becomes what happens, and I would also say that 6.2 Bs of gas is at a pretty healthy consensus price of basically over $3. I think it's $3.07 to $3.09 on a consensus basis that people were predicting that kind of growth. With the strip at $2.85, $2.75 or where it's today, it's not there. And clearly that could put that growth level at risk.","So we think, like we said for a long time, that there's going to be ample pipeline takeaway gas capacity in the Basin. It's going to be overbuilt. We think demand pull will start occurring. We already have a lot of that taking place. Even on the liquid side, it's beginning to take place where markets are actually coming to us to buy the gas at the tailgate of the Houston plant, so to speak. So we see a lot of that shift beginning to take place, just like we predicted it would for years. And I think that's kind of how we put all that together internally.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","I'd just add to that a little bit. When you look out further into that 2020 or 2020 plus, we really believe based on our internal work that you're going to see sweet spot exhaustion in the Marcellus, Utica as well as in a lot of other plays really all over the county, which is really important when you look at people projecting forward. And then it comes back to who has an inventory that can last. And, again, we think with the quality, the acreage we have and the large number of locations that are in the sweet spot that will put us in a great position. But that's something that I think is not in the market, but it's a real technical factor.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Got it. And just if you had a ballpark number for the amount of volumes that could come from private operators in the region, is that \u2013 it might not even be meaningful, but do you a sense of that, too?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","I don't think we really have a sense of that.","Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.","That's in the data, and it's factored into the analysis.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","It's in that number. These are our internal numbers. Within the number, that's included. So it's the public and private people that are collectively incorporated into that.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Appreciate it, guys. Great details.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from David Deckelbaum of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff and everyone. Thanks for taking my questions here.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Good morning.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just wanted to ask just on the portfolio management process. You all have put together a compelling five-year growth plan, returning capital to shareholders. You've talked about some asset sales. One, I'm wondering, just how now Terryville fits into everything. I understand the process you're going through this year, you'd analyze what you could improve upon. But, I guess, when I think back to when you all made the acquisition in 2016 versus now, it certainly doesn't seem that you need the Terryville in your portfolio relative to the opportunity that you have in the Marcellus.","So, one, I'm trying to get a sense of how long the evaluation process might take and how long you'd like to stick with it before potentially looking to monetize Terryville and kind of attempt to pull some of that value forward. And then, I guess, at the same time, I imagine that this year I wanted to get a sense of how much free cash Terryville is generating in the 2018 plan. And if you would more rather appreciate sort of an underinvested free cash generation coming out of Terryville to sort of supplement a little bit more of the total enterprise over the next couple of years.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Yeah. I mean, in essence, that's what we're doing. We're dialing back Terryville to one rig, so we're basically taking all of our cash flow and some cash flow from there and reinvesting it up into the Marcellus for the reasons that you're saying.","So I think the key is, the results \u2013 again, first half results were disappointing in 2017. Second half better, but still not where we want them to be. We've slowed down significantly. We're allocating some of that cash flow up to Pennsylvania to help us achieve great results and fill pipes and do all the things that we're doing there. And then I think the key is what do the results look like as we go through the year. And there's different things to look at and there's different analogies that you could use.","One analogy is Northeast Pennsylvania. Northeast Pennsylvania has good returns and is a strong asset, but, again, where we allocate more capital. Right now, we're allocating to Southwest Pennsylvania. And other good example might be people \u2013 if you go back just a couple of years, which isn't that long, and you look at Southwest Pennsylvania specifically, we have the dry, the wet and the super-rich. And I remember we put out economics of those three areas, and the economics at that point in time were the super-rich and the wet were about half the economics of the dry and we got a lot of pressure from people, why in the world would you put any money into the super-rich or the wet, look at the economics in the dry.","And fortunately, we kept putting some money into it and we understood it better. And you look at where we are today and the type curves are significantly better and the team's done a good job. But we'll clearly look at it and we'll look at like we have historically where are our returns, how important are the different pieces to the portfolio and, therefore, what should we do? Do we keep it? Do we allocate capital to it? Do we sell it? I think that's just typically what we've done as we've managed the portfolio over time. We look at real-time data and make what we think is the right decision for capital allocation.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And, I guess, the only follow-up to that, I guess, is when you look at the split of assets that contribute to free cash generation, you talked about $1 billion or so cumulative in five years. At what point does the Marcellus generate more free cash than Terryville does?","Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.","Well, I'll take a stab at it. By virtue of \u2013 at the end of that time period, Terryville is declining this year, like we talked about in the outlook and then we're holding it flat 2019 going forward and virtually all the growth is coming out of the Marcellus. So the Marcellus dominates basically starting this year all of those factors. So I think it just becomes smaller and smaller each year as it goes forward and the big lion's share of it's going to be the economics in Southwest Pennsylvania.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Appreciate the responses, everyone.","Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Ventura for concluding remarks.","Jeffrey L.

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Statements contained in this conference call that a not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] .","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Rodney L. Waller","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported outstanding results for the third quarter with record production and a continuing decrease in unit costs. Both earnings and cash flow per share results were greater than first call consensus.","But first, the order of our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After the speakers, we will conduct a question-and-answer period. Also Mr. Pinkerton, our Executive Chairman, is on the call today.","Range did file our 10-Q with the SEC this morning that's now available on the homepage of our website or you can access it using SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we've posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today.  We've also added tables, which will guide you in the modeling of our future realized prices for natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. Detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter is also included on the website.","Now, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thank you, Rodney. The third quarter was another great quarter for Range. Production for the third quarter of 2012 was 790 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which was 47% higher than the third quarter of 2011 and 10% higher than the second quarter of 2012. We're on track to achieve 35% year-over-year growth for 2012 versus 2011 within our capital budget of $1.6 billion.","On the cost side, absolute LOE dollars for the third quarter were below the prior year quarter, resulting in LOE per mcfe dropping from $0.58 per mcfe to $0.40 per mcfe. This is directly related to the quality of the wells that we're drilling and the quality of the teams operating the properties. All line unit costs continue to drop and are continuing the trend that we have in the first 2 quarters for 2012. Roger will discuss the cost management and results in more detail in a few minutes.","We also achieved an important marketing milestone in the third quarter. Rain announced that we have become the anchor ship around the Mariner East NGL pipelines project. As the anchor shipper, we have firm transportation to ship 40,000 barrels per day of processed liquids from MarkWest Houston Pennsylvania plant to Sunoco's Markus Hook terminal facility near Philadelphia. The 40,000 barrels per day will consist of 20,000 barrels of ethane per day and 20,000 barrels of propane per day.","Under the agreements, we also have access to a very significant portion of the 1 million barrels of propane storage at the facility. The propane can be delivered into the East Coast and Northeast U.S. markets and\/or exported internationally, which opens up significant new markets for us.","In addition to this agreement, we also announced the 15-year ethane sales agreement with Eneos. Eneos is a global manufacturer of specialty chemical and oil products and currently plans to utilize its own ship fleet to take delivery of our ethane at the Sunoco's Marcus Hook dock facilities.  Contracted volumes are planned to start in the first half of 2015 and increase over time to 20,000 barrels per day.","The Mariner East project is the third ethane project in which we have announced our participation. The first ethane project was Mariner West. Mariner West is expected to start in midyear 2013 and ramp up to 15,000 barrels of ethane per day. The ethane will be purchased by Novo Chemical and transported to Sarnia, Canada. The second project that we announced was our participation in the ATEX project, which will move ethane to the Gulf Coast Petrochemical Complex. This project is planned to start in 2014 and ramp-up to 20,000 barrels per day. All 3 ethane projects originate at the MarkWest Houston plant in Washington County, Pennsylvania.","In essence, these 3 projects ensure that will be able to meet gas pipeline specifications in a timely manner, they give us operational flexibility and they enable us to build and grow our wet Marcellus production volumes. These 3 projects, assuming minimum ethane extraction, allow us to potentially grow Marcellus volumes in the wet portion of the play up to 1.8 Bcf per day. In addition these 3 projects will add about $0.40 per mcf to our effective gas price.","On Slide 10 of our current IR presentation on our website, it shows that we have about 335,000 net acres in the wet portion of the Marcellus, which is in the Southwest portion of the play. In addition, we have about 235,000 net acres of dry gas in the same area. Summing both areas, we have 570,000 net acres here. Since we discovered the play in October of 2004, approximately 1,500 wells have been drilled in this area. Based on those roughly 1,500 wells or so, our many long-distance step out and delineation wells, and considering that our discovery well came online in 2005 and that we now have up to 7 years our production history, we believe that all of this acreage is highly perspective for Marcellus Shale.  Combined, between the wet and dry portions of the play, we believe that we can possibly grow the Marcellus production alone to 2 to 3 Bcfe per day.","In addition, we believe a lot of this acreage has perspective for both the Upper Devonian and Utica Shales and would allow us to leverage existing Marcellus infrastructure. With success in these other horizons, we have the possibility of growing beyond 3 Bcfe per day.","It's important to note that it's not just growth. The growth in gas filled with the best large scale repeatable economics in the U.S., particularly given Range's dominant position in the wet portion of the play. The economics are very good given the capital required to drill and complete the wells versus the projected recoveries per well. The other key is the effective uplift in price due to the liquids production. If natural gas is priced at roughly $3, given all the uplifts from a natural gas liquids and condensates, the effective price we receive on the wet gas portion of the Marcellus is about $6 or about double gas price alone. That assumes the ethane stays in the gas. Once we begin to recover ethane, and once all 3 ethane and propane agreements are in effect based on current strip prices, it adds about $0.40 per mcf to the $6 price, which further enhances our economics.","For 2012, we entered the year with a goal of growing between 30% to 35% with a $1.6 billion capital budget. I stated on a couple of previous calls this year that if we choose to live within projected cash flow for 2013, we could grow at 15% to 20%. This year, we drilled in the dry gas portions of the Marcellus Shale in the Northeast, which, for us, centers in and around Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. We did this in order to drill the hole that we believe are some of the most perspective acreage in this region. We ran 4 and, at times, up to 5 rigs in this area.","By January 2013, we plan to be down to one drilling rig here. The reason is, at this point, we can run one rig and still hold the key acreage we want to keep in that area given the continuous drilling plazas that we have, coupled with larger tracks in general than in the Southwest part of the play.","Therefore, given the relatively low price of dry gas as compared to wet gas and oil, for 2013, we're planning to focus on the wet and oil areas of our portfolio. Also, come January 2013, the 2 areas that we plan to focus on drilling to convert acreage that held by production are the wet portion of the Marcellus in the horizontal Mississippian oil play in Northern Oklahoma and Southern Kansas, which has a large liquid and oil component. The good news is that our 2 most economic plays happened to be where we need and want to drill to hold acreage.","Given that we can reduce drilling in the northeast portion of the Marcellus from 4 to 5 rigs to 1 in 2013, we will most likely be reducing capital spending in 2013. I want to stress that we don't set our budget into our December board meeting, our budget is subject to board approval. In past years, after board approval, we typically announce our 2013 capital program at the end of January or early February.","Given those caveats and realizing that it's still early, looking at strip pricing today, preliminarily, it looks like even with the reduction to a single rig in the Northeast dry Marcellus, we can still grow volumes for 2013 at a rate of 20% to 25% over 2012 focusing on the liquids-rich and oil areas. To do so, we currently estimate that we would overspend cash flow by approximately $250 million, plus or minus, assuming current strip pricing. Over the next month and a half, we'll prepare a recommended 2013 budget for our board and present it in our December board meeting.","Looking at 2014 and beyond, we control and operate almost all of our assets, except for Nora field in Virginia. If strip prices hold for 2014 and beyond, we will look at ramping up our growth -- in ramping our growth back up. In essence, we'll move the growth lever up with higher prices, while being mindful of holding key Marcellus in Mississippian acreage and fulfilling our longer-term ethane and propane commitments.","In the Mississippian play, given continued drilling success in our 150,000 net acre position we're planning on ramping up drilling. If we begin 2013 with 5 drilling rigs and move to 10 rigs in 2014 and 15 rigs in 2015, we believe we can hold all of our acreage within the primary term and significantly grow our oil, NGL and gas volumes in the play.","As most of you probably recall, in the timeframe from 2004 to 2011, we sold about $1.8 billion of properties. These asset sales did several important things for us. They allowed us to keep focusing on growing our most economic projects, which had the highest growth rates with the lowest cost, while divesting of our low-growth high-cost projects. This focus not only our capital on our best projects, but it also enabled us to focus our technical talent on our best projects.","In our release this week, we announced another $170 million of sales, most of which consist of our Ardmore Basin assets and some scattered Marcellus acreage. Completing this transaction, as we expect, will bring us a total of about $190 million in sales this year. We'll continue to identify assets that we think make sense to divest.","In summary, we believe that we have the ability to create substantial shareholder value in the current commodity price environment and have the quality of assets and flexibility to do so for many years to come.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.","Ray N. Walker","Thanks, Jeff. We exceeded our production guidance coming in higher on gas and NGLs and right in the strike zone on oil. In fact, 47% organic production growth, when comparing to the prior year quarter, is the highest production growth in the company's history. Again, this is a great testament to our operating and technical teams.  They've reached record production levels while, at the same time, substantially reducing expenses and improving efficiencies.","To illustrate that point, let's talk about operating cost. In addition to our record production, we continue to see an impressive decrease in field level expenses. As I've pointed out in the past, we've seen really great improvements and efficiencies all across the board. And we still see those happening, and we believe that they will continue to happen as we're going forward. But when you combine the increased efficiencies with what our operating teams have achieved in lowering the finding and operating cost, it's truly impressive.","For example, when comparing the third quarter of this year with the same quarter last year, we've seen a 47% increase in production, with a 31% decrease in LOE per mcfes. In fact, our absolute field level expenses have decreased, year-to-date, this year as compared to the same timeframe last year by 12%. Accomplishments like this really help us to achieve great economics, long-term, in what we believe to be some of the best and largest repeatable plays out there. Not only are we seeing great growth at low cost, we are also seeing improving well results.","Now, let me highlight some of those results that we're seeing across the company. Please refer to our press release for specific well results. I'm not going to repeat all of those results in my remarks here, but they are certainly noteworthy, and we can discuss them during the Q&A. However, I do want to call your attention to the table in the Southern Marcellus section of the press release. It shows 64 wells coming online during the third quarter in the super-rich and wet Marcellus areas.","If you compare those rates to the type curves in our current IR presentation, you'll notice that the average RPs of those 64 wells is above the type curves and, in particular, the liquids rates are well above the type curves. In the super-rich area, we had a significant step-out well that tested at 1,044 barrels of liquids per day and 10.3 million gas, excluding ethane. If you figure in ethane, the well was 2,053 barrels of liquids per day with 8.7 million gas. The lateral length is approximately  3,800 feet, and it was completed using a 20-stage RCS completion. As you can imagine, the economics on a well like this would be phenomenal.","What I want to stress here is that this well is one more example of how our wet and super-rich acreage is not only being derisked as we step out across the acreage, but it also illustrates the exceptional resource base that we put together over the last several years. As we're working on designs and stepping out across this position, we're continuing to see improving results as this position is derisked. We expect that our 335,000 net acres in the wet and super-rich Marcellus will provide for a highly profitable drilling program for many years to come.","In addition, in our Northern Marcellus division, we continue to see outstanding results with good economics. But as Jeff said, we'll be ramping down our activity to enter 2013 with one rig as we continue to focus the majority of our capital towards liquids-rich and oil projects. Next year, we expect of able to meet our lease commitments on our key acreage in Northeast PA with generally one rig as now most of that acreage is HPP'd or in a continuous drilling mode.","Also of importance, I want to give a quick update on the Upper Devonian shale. Our second super-rich Upper Devonian well continued to clean up following our early August announcement. It ultimately had a peak 24-hour rate of 552 barrels of liquids per day, of which 31% was condensate and 4.7 million a day of gas. With ethane extraction the well would be 998 barrels of liquids per day and 4 million gas. We don't plan any further Upper Devonian tests this year, and we're currently developing our plans for 2013.","Shifting to the Utica, our first wet Utica well in Northwest PA was drilled and completed successfully. The log data and core data that we collected, along with the pressure testing we performed, show us to be right in the strike zone for liquids-rich production. The well is currently set in for a 60- to 90-day period post frac and we'll be keeping any results proprietary for a while longer. With the data we've gathered, we now believe the Utica, in this area, could potentially benefit from the so-called aging or seasoning process that you may have heard others talk about. And that's why we have the wells set in. Of course, we'll have our own conclusions as to the technical and economic viability of this technique after we finish some of this testing. We are encouraged by what we see, and we still plan to spud the second wet Utica horizontal well late in the quarter. As it's still real early in this play, we expect to know a lot more about the potential of the wet Utica on our 190,000 net acres in Northwest PA by our next conference call.","Now, let me shift to Oklahoma. The horizontal Mississippian oil play is progressing well. We're up to 156,000 net acres and now have our second well that exceeded 1,000 boe per day. We had a peak 24-hour rate of 1,227 boe per day. The lateral link that's approximately 4,000 feet, and it was completed with a 20-stage frac. We own a 74.9% working interest in that well. I think it's also important to point out that our first 1,000-plus boe per day well that we previously announced was turned to sales in the second quarter and has held up very well. The well has now achieved a 90-day average of 1,049 boe per day. Let me also point out that when we look at the IPs of the wells turned on in the last 2 quarters, the average IP is 552 boe per day, which is well above our 600 Mboe type curve. The team is continuing to optimize midstream and power infrastructure and is steadily improving our completion designs.  While it's early in the play, we believe our team can continue to produce these wells at very attractive operating costs that will continue to enhance our economics.","In West Texas, at our Conger field properties, we've drilled our third Wolfberry vertical well. That well had an initial 24-hour production rate of 505 boe per day. This is substantially better than our first 2 Wolfberry wells. Those first 2 wells were projected to recover 216 Mboe each, and we expect this well will do better. It's also significant to point out that it was completed at 11% lower cost than the first 2 wells, and when you combine that with the better expected recovery, the economics will improve substantially.  Plans are to drill and complete 3 additional vertical Wolfberry wells at Conger in the fourth quarter.","Shifting to the horizontal Cline oil play, there's still a lot of offset activity in the area, and we are monitoring that closely. We successfully drilled and completed our third horizontal Cline oil well and is currently being tested. It's still early in the cleanup process, and we expect to have test results to discuss at our next conference call.","I also want to give a big attaboy to our marketing department. As the Marcellus and the Utica have grown, our team has taken many important and strategic steps in the Northeast markets. These steps ensure that our production flows steadily on a year-round basis for many years to come. Certainly, the ethane and propane deals are great examples of just a few of those strategic moves. Our team is always evaluating future opportunities and is consistently adjusting our portfolio, working with both pipelines and customers. Again, our marketing folks have done a great job staying right out in front in of the ever evolving Northeast markets.","Our already strong safety record continues to improve as we remain well below our peer group averages. Our incident rate is 53% below our peer group's rate and 39% below our own incident rate in 2011. And our lost time rate is 54% below our peer group's rate and 64% below our 2011 rate. Safety and environmental protections remain a core value at Range. And from the bottom up, our operating teams believe it, live it and own it.","As for guidance, like Jeff said, while our drilling and completion activity level will slow down a bit during the fourth quarter, which is primarily in Northeast PA and in spite of the Ardmore Woodford Shale, we still expect to come in right at a 35% year-over-year production growth target, with our fourth quarter liquids growth in the range of 33% to 36% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.","As you can tell, we are really proud of our operating and technical teams. They make it really easy to talk about our results each quarter. In summary, cost and well performance are steadily improving, while working safely and protecting the environment. And we have some great way to return projects that are continuing to get better and better.","Now, over to Roger.","Roger S. Manny","Thanks, Ray. The third quarter extended our favorable growth and cost trends evidenced in the first 2 quarters of 2012. Fueled by strong production growth at low-cost, cash flow and EBITDAX both registered quarter-to-quarter increases.","Turning first to the income statement, third quarter cash direct operating cost, including workovers, was $0.40 per mcfe, $0.18 below last year and equal to the second quarter. Year-to-date cash direct operating expense on an absolute dollar basis was $11.4 million lower than last year on 36% higher production volume. It would be impossible for every increase in production, while at the same time reducing cost, so we expect cash direct operating unit costs to be in the $0.43 to $0.45 range in the fourth quarter as we further increase our oil and liquids-rich production, which carry higher margins but also higher unit operating cost.","Cash G&A expense for the third quarter was $0.46 per Mcfe, $0.07 below the third quarter of last year and $0.01 lower than the second quarter of this year. Salaries and benefits make up the largest component of our G&A expense, and we've seen these costs decline on a unit cost basis for the past 6 consecutive quarters. This is a key indicator of the quality and maturation of our play expansions as we are now increasing production consistently faster than our overhead.  Fourth quarter G&A unit cost is expected to be $0.44 to $0.46 per Mcfe.","Third-party transportation, gathering and compression expense in the third quarter came in at $0.71 per Mcfe, $0.03 higher than last year. The timing of additional firm transportation capacity and the capital spent to hook up incremental production, do not always coincide with the timing of production commencement, which makes this expense somewhat variable. We anticipate this expense to be $0.75 to $0.79 per Mcfe in the fourth quarter.","The third quarter DD&A rate was $1.69 per Mcfe, $0.20 per Mcfe lower than last year. Fourth quarter DD&A rate should be in the $1.65 to $1.68 per Mcfe range. And we believe that the DD&A rate will continue to decline as our capital efficiency further improves. The fourth quarter DD&A rate should reflect this as it will incorporate our year-end reserve report results.","Recalling that most state production taxes are assessed on wellhead prices rather than effective prices after hedging, third quarter production taxes were $0.05 per Mcfe plus the Pennsylvania impact fee of $5.4 million. That brings the total production tax burden for the quarter to $0.12 per Mcfe. Prices have improved a bit recently, making our best estimate for fourth quarter production taxes $0.08 per Mcfe on total company production, plus $5 million for the Pennsylvania impact fee, making the total $0.15 per Mcfe.","Interest expense for the third quarter were $0.61 per Mcfe, $0.08 below last year's figure. Higher production volume and incremental debt funded under the lower floating-rate bank revolver is what helped bring the unit interest cost down. The fourth quarter should see this trend continue, with interest expense of $0.59 to $0.60 per Mcfe.","Exploration expense in the third quarter, excluding noncash compensation was $14 million, that's $3 million below last year due to lower dry hole and lower seismic expenditures. Seismic expenditures in the third quarter were only 1\/3 of the budgeted amount due to project timing. So we expect to catch up in the fourth quarter, with total exploration expense of approximately $19 million.","Our ordinary unproved property impairment for the third quarter was $20 million, and we also recognized an unusual impairment on an unproved property of $20 million, bringing the total unproved property impairment for the quarter to $40 million. The unusual item consisted of our last undeveloped Barnett Shale lease, which was held out on the 2011 sale. The fourth quarter estimate for unproved impairment is $19 million to $21 million.","Third quarter cash flow was $189 million, essentially the same as the third quarter of last year, while EBITDAX for the quarter was $230 million, 4% higher than the third quarter of last year.  On a per fully diluted share basis, cash flow was $1.18 per share, $0.03 above analyst consensus estimates. Cash margin for the third quarter was $2.56 per Mcfe and earnings calculated using analyst methodology were $32 million or $0.20 per share, also $0.03 above analyst consensus estimate.","As Rodney mentioned, please see our website for detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP figures to GAAP, along with hedging schedules and other helpful information for investors.","Over on the balance sheet, things are pretty much business as usual in the third quarter. We funded our capital program with cash flow and draws under our $1.75 billion bank credit facility. The bank credit facility has a $2 billion borrowing base, which was unanimously reaffirmed by the 28-member Range bank group earlier this month and it's currently approximately 25% drawn. Though our rate of spending slowed considerably in the third quarter this year compared to the second quarter, our leverage, as measured by current total debt to trailing 4 quarter EBITDAX, increased slightly to 3.3x. We remain comfortable with our leverage around the 3x EBITDAX level, thanks to our high rate of return plays, low cost structure, long reserve life, operating control of our growth assets, substantial liquidity and our hedge position. EBITDAX is beginning to grow again, thanks to higher production and slightly higher prices, which should give us a bit of a tailwind on the leverage ratio going forward into 2013. Our increase in EBITDAX in 2013 will enable us to outspend cash flow by approximately $250 million, while also reducing the leverage ratio to below 3x.","As has been our practice, as Jeff mentioned, we continually evaluate our assets for potential sale and will likely entertain additional sales periodically to sharpen our operating focus, which will also help keep leverage in check. As Jeff also mentioned, we have signed a purchase and sale agreement to sell our Ardmore Basin Woodford shale properties at a gain, which when closed, along with several small miscellaneous assets, will garner approximately $170 million in proceeds to shave the peak off of our leverage and help keep leverage from going any higher in the fourth quarter.","We're pleased to have increased our hedge position during the third quarter. We added new hedges in 2012, 2013 and 2014. For the fourth quarter this year, we've got approximately 85% of our projected gas production hedged at a floor price of $4.17 MMBtu. We've got approximately 60% of our NGLs hedged at above market prices and approximately 80% of our projected oil production hedged at $90.82 a barrel.","Our 2013 and 2014 natural gas and liquids hedge positions were increased during the third quarter such that we will again be entering the new year with approximately 3\/4 of our 2013 production hedged and over half of our 2014 production hedged. Please reference the updated hedging schedules on the Range website for these new and existing hedge volumes and prices.","To summarize, the third quarter showed continued cost reductions, which, when combined with record increases in production volume, increased our quarterly earnings and cash flow, positioning us very well for the fourth quarter.","Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly with your comments about outspending for next year and tying that to discretionary cash flow, obviously, that discretionary cash flow is going to move with commodity prices, but you must have some sort of range in mind currently. Any chance you can share that with us?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes. Well, let me start and then I'm sure Roger can pile on. But what we're talking about for next year and it's preliminary and subject to board approval, but what it looks like right now is we would get year-over-year growth of 20% to 25% outspending cash flow, looking at current strip prices by approximately $250 million, plus or minus. And then the other important part is looking at the strip in 2014 and beyond. In essence, we would look at ramping growth back up. And let me talk about it philosophically before I turn it over to Roger. Our strategy, and we've talked about it before, is on the low end. Within cash flow, we can grow at 15% to 20%. Of course, on the high end, it depends where you focus, whether you're focusing oil, liquids-rich or gas. But this year, obviously, we're growing at 35%. And now we have a huge inventory and a lot of flexibility, both in oil, wet and dry. And then we operate and control almost all of it. So as prices move up or as the strip looks better, we'll look at ramping up and as prices are worked, then growth rate will be a little lower. Then there's several key things in there. When we look at growth, for instance, for 2013 we're not focused on absolute growth. We're focused on best economics and best returns. So our drilling, therefore, next year, like I said, is we're going to cut down in the dry gas areas in Northeast Pennsylvania and focus our drilling on the liquids-rich and oil areas. Liquids-rich down in the Southwest part of the Marcellus and oil in the horizontal Mississippian. And so we're looking at cash flow per share rate of return, that type of stuff. If we are looking at just best absolute growth, obviously, what we'll do is drill 100% dry gas and for $250 million of our cash flow, we'll probably drill it at 35% to 40% or more. So and the other thing I think is important, we think in a dry gas area, it's just looking out. We ran some economics earlier this summer. If we delay drilling in, say, Lycoming County for a year or 2, in essence it doubles the rates of return if you move on a per well basis, if you move the capital out to the point in time when the strip's better. For 2014 and beyond, again, I just wanted to give you a little context before Roger comments more on the financial part. But in the Mississippian, we talked about ramping beginning of this year, 5 rigs, and then we'll success to 10 and 15. So, it sort of gives you a feel for the shape of the curve there and the growth in the Mississippian. In the wet Marcellus, you can look at those ethane agreements as a proxy for what our gas rate's going to be in the wet areas. When you add the 3 together, we have committed a 55,000 barrels of ethane per day. So currently we're 0 selling ethane. So by mid-to-late 2016, we need to be at 55,000 barrels of ethane per day to fulfill those agreements. Under minimum extraction, that's 1.8 Bcf per day. Under most likely extraction that's 800 million. To put that in context, currently in the wet area, we're about 370 million per day. So on the minimum, on the low end, we're going to more than double production in the wet Marcellus to fill those agreements by mid-to-late 2016. So when I sort of put it all in context and I think probably the most important thing to do that is what our portfolio and we talk about 44 to 60 Tcf. But I want to stress a lot of that's in the Marcellus and down in the Southwest. Highly derisked because there's 1,500 wells and it's not just 1,500 wells, but when you go on our IR presentation, you can look at the quality of the wells in the wet, the super-rich and in the dry. There's a big data set with up to 7 years worth of history, and that's where our acreage is. So not only can we grow at 20% to 25% and then ramp up in subsequent years to potentially something higher, we can do that for many years to come, for probably a decade or more to come. So I think that -- I'm not saying we're unique, but because we discovered and have a big position and what we think it's one of the best, the largest gas field now in the U.S. and particularly in the wet area where the best economics are, we're very well-positioned to do that for a long time to come. So let me flip it back to Roger to talk more about the funding and leverage.","Roger S. Manny","Yes, just commenting on the overspend, Dave, we're obviously in a capital-intensive, highly-cyclical business and we mind our balance sheet very closely and our balance sheet is in great shape and we want to keep it that way. We've got a lot of financial flexibility and liquidity built into the balance sheet. So the question is how comfortable are we leaning on the debt throttle in times like 2012 and in times like 2013. And the reason we're comfortable at this point talking about overspending cash flow, $250 million, plus or minus, as Jeff says, is that with the trailing -- current debt to trailing 4 quarter EBITDAX measure, which we feel is the best measure of leverage, given a tailwind from higher EBITDAX from higher prices and higher production, let's just go into 2013 to where you can overspend cash flow by about a quarter billion and still actually drive that leverage ratio down a few ticks. So that's really the plan behind that. We have, as I mentioned, plenty of liquidity. The question is how we use that liquidity and we intend to be prudent about how we go about doing that.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Appreciate that, and maybe just to clarify a little bit, you must have kind of a range around that discretionary cash flow, and I'm imagining that, that organic discretionary cash flow, not necessarily cash inflows, i.e. asset sales, and just roughly looking at kind of our model that would put you in a range of maybe call it $850 million to $950 million for next year. Am I way off the mark, I'm just trying to triangulate to what that CapEx, aggregate CapEx number would be.","Roger S. Manny","We've never given cash flow guidance. And I certainly don't want to start now. What I can comment -- and I'm also not going to second-guess the board on the CapEx budget for next year. So I really can't comment on your range. But I can assure you that we've run the numbers, and we feel confident in the 20%, 25% range and the 250 approximate overspend.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Carver with Capital One Southcoast.","Marshall H. Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","On the 2013 growth, thanks for the color there, with the emphasis on liquids in both the Mississippian and Southwest PA, is it safe to assume that the liquids growth would probably be a little bit higher than 20% to 25% and the gas growth would be lower?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","We're not going to come out with the specifics again until we present to the board and get it approved. But in generally speaking, yes, the liquids grow disproportionately to the gas and to the overall. But we'll come out with all those specific numbers once we get formal approval from our board, December. Typically, we get approval and so roughly around the first week of December, and it's been like end of January and early February when we do it. Maybe we'll accelerate that, we can bat that around, maybe we'll do it in mid-December or something or January. But, yes, the overall answer to your question is, yes. They will grow disproportionately.","Marshall H. Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","And just sort of follow-on to that, then I'll hop out of queue, are there any bottlenecks or the liquids end in next year? Or how should we think about that?","Ray N. Walker","Well, I think what we're seeing in the fourth quarter is due to some of the timing issues that we talked about a couple of quarters back. A lot of these wells are getting compressed into the third and fourth quarter. So we're seeing a lot of wells come online, and that's just kind of exaggerating the bottlenecks that are there. And I think that we're seeing that unwind, and we really expect that to unwind even further into 2013. We turned on 84 wells in the third quarter, which is a bunch of wells. And as we see that backlog unwind, which we're beginning to see the effects of that, I really believe in 2013, most of that will have worked its way out as, especially as we get into the second quarter or so of next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Lively with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the 2013 preliminary numbers, specifically on the outspend, it sounds like you guys are comfortable with just using the leverage to grow. Or are you guys going to plan to plug that $250 million gap via additional asset sales? And if so, what's kind of next step on the list in terms of what you would consider selling?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, let me talk about it in general terms. If you look at the period from 2004 through 2011, we sold $1.8 billion worth of properties. And through that time, we significantly drove up production and drove up our share price. This year, so far, because we sold a little bit in the beginning of the year, to date, we've sold $190 million worth of properties. So Roger and his team and working together with the board will come up with a way we can optimally finance that as we look forward. Clearly, we have the ability, if we choose to do so, to carve off a little more assets like we have historically. But Roger will be making that recommendation as we go forward. Our strategy has been, we think periodically selling things makes a lot of sense for a number of reasons. One, it really keeps us focused operationally. It keeps us directing our capital into our highest return, best growth, large scale repeatable projects, and by the same time selling them, it prevents us from investing like when we had the offshore, I guarantee you, whenever you're in an area you get AFE'd by a partner, you have to react to something. The only way that you get out and spending money in areas that you prefer not to spend a lot of times, it is just to sell it. Plus, it enables you to redirect your people. So, I think we have a very focused company, and we've shown the ability this year, even with the sales that we have, we're still hitting our growth targets even when we sold the Barnett, literally, selling 120 million a day within 6 months we have such robust, large-scale projects now. We more than made it up within a short period of time, with much higher rates of return. So that's what we've done historically and as we finalize our budget and look into next year, we'll come out with what that plan is.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and in that vein, for the Permian, how much more do you guys need to see from a delineation standpoint to sort of bucket that area in terms of being one of those core assets versus being something that you would consider monetizing?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I think the key part with the Permian, it's sort of like our Utica play as well. All of that Permian acreage is held by production, which really gives you great flexibility. It gives us time to watch our wells, to watch our competitors' wells. Same with Utica there, we have another 190,000 net acres that's all held by production. And again going back to a higher level theme of Range, we like to get into areas where there's high quality, large-scale repeatable stack pays, rich hydrocarbon charge and then put a really strong technical team on there and continuing to work and work and work and coming up with those new opportunities. And that's really paid a lot of dividends for the company. So we don't have a time frame per se, but we continually look at the results of our wells and others, and that will determine what's optimum for the company. Like I said, as evidenced, we're not -- we're all about -- we're aligning with the shareholders. It's all about share price performance, growing production per share, reserves per share, debt adjusted. So whatever makes the most sense to do, we'll do. We sold $1.8 billion worth of properties. So if that's the right thing to do, we'll do it. We're really focused on the best returns and the best opportunities as we go forward. And as we learn more about those areas, then they need to go higher into the list or lower, based on performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Did you guys -- I'm not sure who alluded this, but could you just talk about all the infrastructure coming online in the Marcellus and how much more capacity that frees up for you, when, and as you think about the timeframe over the next few quarters that, that comes on, when do you anticipate most of that additional infrastructure to be in place and what's the timeframe look like for the next couple of quarters?","Ray N. Walker","Yes, David, this is Ray. The infrastructure bottlenecks, per se, that we experienced this year were really midstream, had to do with low-pressure gathering and compression and so forth. And like we've said earlier, MarkWest is kind of a [indiscernible] job by catching up and actually getting ahead of us now and now we're beginning to get those wells put online. And so we kind of -- as far as the infrastructure needs, going into 2013, the amount of pipe, for instance, that they have to put in place in 2013 is a whole lot less than it was this year. So we're kind of, for lack of being cheesy about it, we kind of have reached an inflection point in the infrastructure. And the fact that the biggest part of it's been built, and now we're going to go -- basically, now, we're just kind of tying in wells to already major infrastructure that's there. So in Southwest PA, we really don't see any big issues. Of course, we're still going to be ordering plants going into the future in different things like that. But that's all way out in front of where we're at, and we feel really, really good about that. Like Jeff talked about in his remarks, we've got a definite plan to be getting to the point where we can deliver on all these commitments that we've got and do it in an economic and reasonable manner to get there. So we feel pretty good about infrastructure going forward, and we don't foresee any huge bottlenecks, especially in Southwest PA or really in Northeast PA where PVRs just put phase 3 online up there. So we're really good shape for the next couple of years on infrastructure.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And I'd just add, back to the ethane agreements and as we continue to ramp up in ethane, in essence we're taking the ethane out of the gas and selling it as a liquid, which frees up about 100 million a day in the gas pipeline. So there's another benefit that comes out of those projects.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, let me ask an unrelated follow-up. Equitable's, if you're talking about selling assets and here on presumably on the potential board for being sold, would you guys sell that generally with Equitable? How would that process work?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, I'm not -- you have to ask Equitable what they\u2019re doing, which I'm sure you've done. But EQT, to make it modern-day, yes, we are partners with them. They have the Huron in Kentucky; and then on the Virginia side, we're partners with them in Nora; and then separately, we have other assets, friends [ph] since we own Haysi 100% and Big Rock 100% and that type of thing, Widen 100%. But we like those assets in Virginia. We always want to be -- do whatever the right thing is for the shareholders, but we really like the assets we have in the Virginia. It has that same characteristic that we like to see at Range. Their stack pays. Everything from literally from a lot of thousand feet down, you have the CBM, you have the CBM, then you have the traditional zones in the Berea and Big Lime, then you have the Huron Shale. All of it is either held by production or we own the minerals. Actually, our economics are superior to what EQT has, because we own the royalty. We actually get paid the royalty on those pieces. Our team, even though we've cut the capital way back there, because we can, and we have that in idle, they're still growing production this year, even with a $13 million budget, which is just a minor fraction. So we have really high-quality asset with a high-quality team. But we do have other scattered assets throughout the company, if we want to sell things, that we control and we operate, and we -- like I said, as evidenced by the past 7, 8 years now, periodically, we're always looking at it, and we've ranked those assets out and there's things that fall to the bottom and we would consider selling those if it's the right time in the right place in the right area. Don't get lost a little bit in our flipbook and if you look at the IR presentation. We're focusing on the things we're spending money on, but we have a lot of production in other areas, we just don't list it all. And for those of you who have been with us for a while, we used to have the pyramid that Rodney loved. So, the pyramid and all those other things that would be possible considerations for asset sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions here. First on that great result you had on that step out on that super-rich area, I was wondering are you planning, I guess, to drill a number around that? Is that why kind of the delay to bring that online and by the result you're seeing there, have you already essentially delineated and sort of connected the dots in that area if you know where I'm going with that?","Ray N. Walker","We are -- it was a significant step out. And by definition, we didn't have infrastructure out there where that well is. So it's going to be a while before it comes online. And to answer your question, yes, I mean now that we have derisked that step out area, we'll begin marching towards it with infrastructure and with wells as we go forward. That way, you kind of know there's a great target out there and, again, that's been real surprising to me, especially since I was there essentially from the beginning that as we stepped out and continue to step out, we're just seeing better and better and better results. So the size and scale of this play is really truly amazing. It just keeps getting better.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, it's really exciting like what Ray said in that area as we stepped out in the super-rich, we have 125,000 acres out there, really big blocky position. So it's a great opportunity and even though we've been drilling out there for years now, I would argue -- and Bill Zagorski, our geologist, has said, we probably haven't drilled our best wells yet. So the future is really bright.","Ray N. Walker","And there's significantly higher rate of returns. I mean if you look at our updated PowerPoint slides on the website, you can see that in that area, just because prices have come up a little lightly and we're making better wells too, but I mean those wells are over 90% rate of return now.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's very noticeable. Good -- great point, guys. And just a follow-up, on the Utica, I noticed you need to have in that first one, shut-in, and talking about drilling as second. Here in the fourth quarter, again, I know you haven't said too much yet on that, Jeff, either for you or for Ray. Just wondering the expectations on liquids expectations and then thoughts on once you'll see these 2, will this dictate, I know you've kind of talked about your budget next year with this depending how good or how liquid these wells are, would this could dictate some of your spending next year in that area?","Ray N. Walker","Yes, I'll start. I'm sure Jeff will jump in afterwards. The Utica well, we've done -- being the first well for us, we did not have to bear a lot of the cost of the learning curve that we did in the Marcellus. So we kind of setback on purposes, an HBP position. It's been there for years. And so we've kind of tried to learn from everybody else. But we began gathering data and then on this well what we've done is the actual data from this well, and I mean logs, cores, pressure data, everything that we've done to date puts us right on strike with some of the good stuff that's happening down in Carolyn and Harrison County that we're reading about. And we've been working a lot with offset operators and talking about that and exchanging data. So we've learned a whole lot. Everything we've seen today, we were very encouraged with, and so currently we've got the wells shut-in, doing the aging or seasoning or shake and bake or whatever you want to call it. And we do believe that there's some technical reasons that, that could help the well and could work on it. So we're just trying to gather all this information, get our test results, everything we see tells us we still should go ahead and drill the second well. As far as next year, it's way too early to tell. I mean I'm going to make the case until we get the results from these first 2 wells in some of the offset activity, we probably won't plan anything. Again, it's an HBP position, so we don't have to do anything next year. And I'd rather put our money in some known projects down in the super-rich, for instance, and make 100% rate of return wells if I could do that.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Ray, are you talking Utica or the Point Pleasant?","Ray N. Walker","It's the point Pleasant. In most cases, it's the Point Pleasant that's what's producing this, not really the Utica. Although, we all call it that.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And I'd just add a little bit, like Ray said, we're confident that we're in the liquids part of it, got all the right ingredients, we'll see when we test it. And Ray's point is really a key one. It's all held by production, just like all that stuff out in the Permian, where we're testing different things too. In the Marcellus, when we started, since it was a Range idea, when we were the first company out there, we had to carry 100% of the cost of the R&D. We don't have to do that for the Utica or for the Cline some of these other plays because they're HBP positions. I've noticed recently Floyd Wilson's company, Halc\u00f3n, spotted a lot of wells just in and around it. So up there, they have a big position. You have [indiscernible] company has that and others. And we're right on strike with the good stuff and a lot of other people are -- you are going to start to see a lot of wells popping up in and around it. So, we'll do -- we'll carry some of the R&D and let others carry some of that as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just kind of a follow-up on 2013. You talked about ramping down the pure gas activity in Northeast Pennsylvania Marcellus and ramping up Mississippian by a fair bit. You said you will start the year with 5 rigs, just -- and then go to 10 in '14. Would you expect to kind of ramp up the rig count in '13 in the Mississippian kind of literally over the next couple of years to get to 10 rigs in '14 and then to 15 rigs in 2015? And would also expect any potential reductions in the wet Marcellus in 2013 as part of your plan to lower CapEx?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","We'll reverse it, I'll start this time and Ray can go add on. When you look at the Mississippian, what we're thinking about right now, it's a little more stair stepped. We'll probably have 5 rigs starting the year probably in January of '13 going to 10 rigs in January of '14 and 15 rigs in the following year. And then obviously, as we learn to become more efficient, we'll tweak in all that, but that's trajectory. We really significantly drive up oil volumes, liquids volumes and gas volumes up there by doing that and hold all the acreage within the primary terms. So we think that we've got a really strong team up there, really good plan. In the wet and super-rich part of the Marcellus, as I said, we're looking at -- an easy way to think about it, and we'll get more clarity with time, but if you just look at that 3 ethane deals we committed to, we have to be by 55,000 barrels per day by mid- to late 2016, which dictates, if you back calculate it the other way, under most likely ethane extraction, it's 800 million a day. Under a minimum, it's 1.8 Bcf per day. We're currently at 3.70 Bcf. So it sort of gives you a feel, high and low, what the trajectory is just in the wet and super-rich part. Obviously, Ray is working with the teams there and the guys that we have on the ground. They're going to do that as efficiently as they can with the fewest number of rigs and lease capital to get the highest returns. So there's my -- I'm tossing the baton back to Ray.","Ray N. Walker","Thanks, Jeff. It's really -- there's no -- it's really hard to think about slowing down in the southern Marcellus because we're really not slowing down in 2013. We're really continuing to grow pretty substantially.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","We're slowing down the dry part in the Northeast, and we're keeping the southern Appalachia down in Nora idled. But, I think, as the gas prices pick up, those areas will kick in and really supercharge the growth. And at that time, we'll have better returns. So, I've seen a rupture from that. [indiscernible] I've never done that before.","Ray N. Walker","And the drilling rigs, again, this is sort of one of my pet peeves. It's hard to think about rig count anymore as describing activity because these rigs are getting so fast, and so efficient that, I mean, we're literally doing twice the work with the drilling rig today than we did a year ago. So it's really more about in these kind of plays is what all of the industry is learning. It's more about infrastructure and pads and timing and bringing those pads online and all that sort of things. So what we're seeing next year is longer laterals, more frac stages. We're getting better and more efficient designs. We're having to build less infrastructure. So, we really are, activity-level wise, probably still going. We may be growing slower than we were, but we are still growing next year. We're not slowing down by any means.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And growing at a significant level.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, very significant.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful there on the clarity. Question on the cost side, I've just been noticing that your transport cost has kind of been going up on $1 per Mcfe basis, really, ever since you guys kind of established that metric, I think it was in the fourth quarter of '11. You guys are expected to go up again this quarter. Do you just have any kind of longer-term color on when that may start to flatten out? Should we see that flat in '13 at $0.75 to $0.79 per mcf? Is that going to keep climbing? Just any thoughts you have around that would be helpful.","Roger S. Manny","This is Roger. As I mentioned on the note, it's truly a variable cost. There's a lot going on under the hood with that metric. You've got money being spent, you've got production volumes varying in different areas of the company. So you got a lot of moving parts that come up with that. The uptick in fourth quarter, we've got some capacity on the team project that's coming on the fourth quarter. So the bills are going to start coming in for that capacity. So creates a little lump there. And the production will start to catch up and maybe you're putting out a plant somewhere. So it's just kind of a constant tug of war between volume and capital spend. So we'll continue try to guide you guys as best we can, but as I mentioned in the notes, the timing doesn't always kind of work out the way your spreadsheet says it's going to. But you'll probably see that continue to trend upwards for a piece and then eventually the volume will build, and it'll trend back down.","Ray N. Walker","Especially, on the gathering side, Leo, and then on your transportation side, as we can transport this gas to newer markets that have a higher positive basis in the market to sell the gas at, that sales price is going to go up in gas sales. It's not going to come reducing to your transportation cost. So you're going to have to be cognizant of the expansion of the market and our margin versus just the absolute cost. So there'll be different arrangements that come that direction, but Roger is exactly right, is the gathering charges, you got to build it before you put the gas in it. There is our charging for you as soon as that comes on, but then as the volumes come on, it's going to ramp that per Mcfe down on the gathering. And we've discussed, internally, as to whether or not we actually break that line out into 2 components when it gets to some significant size. So as you can see, the gathering, ebbing and flowing, as you turn on things and then your transportation charge basically will translate back to your commitments footnote as to what you've got for firm takeaway capacity to be able to always deliver your gas to the markets and keep the gas to flow.","Operator","We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Joe Magner of the Macquarie group for our final question.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Just curious where the Permian fits in your plans for 2013 looks like you having good success down there I know a lot of it is HBP, but just curious how you're thinking about that.","Ray N. Walker","Yes. I mean, right now we're not what I would call super active out there. It's a big HBP position, and we're drilling a few Wolfberry vertical wells. Those are, as we talked about earlier, they're improving dramatically just in the first 3 wells, and so we've got to see more wells we will do this quarter. We're still putting plans together to see what we do next year. Again, the important thing about that position is it's HBP. We don't have to do anything next year. So I'm guessing, at this point that we will have some minimal amount of activity there next year to kind of help prove up some things or more or less confirm some things that we learn from activity in the area. But no real big plans at all at this point.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay, and then touched on a little bit, here, a second ago, just on improving rig efficiencies. Is there a way to quantify or perhaps provide us with an update on how many wells you think you can drill per rig per year in both the Southwest Marcellus as well as the horizontal Miss?","Ray N. Walker","Well that's a great question, Joe, and unfortunately, there's not a real good black and white answer to it, because we're still finalizing plans on lateral length and completion styles and number of wells per pad and all of those different things. We're also looking at some better designed rigs as we've gotten smarter and gotten more wells under our belt and different things that we're considering. So it's hard to give you an answer, but you can go back and look at the -- I think it was in the last quarter where I spent a lot of time talking about the efficiencies that we saw year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And we're still seeing those kind of results. I can't quote you numbers today, but I'm sure we could get the IR guys to follow up with you on some numbers. But it's too early to talk about 2014 just because it's -- I mean, 2013 or '14, because we're still putting those plans together and finalizing kind of tweaking what the actual numbers will be.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Still need to present it to the board, still need to get approval, all those kinds of things.","Ray N. Walker","Right.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","And just one last one, Jeff, you touched on gas prices, as gas prices pick up, perhaps ramping up some activity. What price level would you need to see on a sustainable basis for you to start thinking about dry gas activity again?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well I think what's really key is if you look on our website for the dry gas areas, we have economics out there, and you can see them for both Southwest PA and in the Northeast. And -- I'll see if I can flip through it. I'll make my point and make sure I get it off the right numbers. If you look at, for instance, if you look at Slide 18, at PA, and it's on Slide 18 and you look at pricing, at $3 flat gas, it's a 21% rate of return; at a $4 flat price, it's 56%; at $5, it's over 100%. So, it's really price sensitive and really steep and the same thing is true in the Northeast with that going through it. When you look at -- and if you look at the strip out in 2014 and beyond, you're starting to see prices where you start to generate some really attractive returns in the dry areas. And the good news is we've got a really, again, we've got a really big bucket of dry gas opportunities, wet and super-rich opportunities and oil opportunities, and we have the operational flexibility to sort of throttle back and forth between those various buckets. And we're looking at maximizing the returns for the dollars we spent, most efficiently drive enough cash flow per share, production per share, reserves per share.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for closing remarks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thanks to our hard-working teams in each division Range is on target to meet our 2012 production goals within our capital budget. We're driving down our unit cost in the process. Because we have very large acreage positions in some of the best plays in the country, we should be able to achieve double-digit growth in production and reserves on a per-share basis, debt adjusted for many years. Plus we continue to be one of the lowest cost producers in our peer group and are still improving. Therefore, we believe that this will translate into significant shareholder value in months and years ahead.","I want to say, before I thank everybody for participating on the call, let me just add to that. We're out of time and, in fact, we've over run time by 5 or 10 minutes and there's still some people queued up in Q&A. So please feel free, sorry, we didn't get to everybody, but follow-up with Rodney and the IR team and we'll make sure that we do our best to answer all your questions. Thanks for participating on the call.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Rodney L. Waller","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported outstanding results for the first quarter, with record production and continuing decrease in unit costs over the prior year. The order of our speakers on the call today are: Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Chad Stephens, our Senior Vice President in Charge of Marketing, will be available to answer questions after our prepared remarks. Range did file our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on the homepage of our website, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we've posted on our website supplemental tables which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of reported earnings to our adjusted non-GAAP earnings that are discussed on the call.","Now let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thank you, Rodney. Range is continuing to successfully execute its plan and we're currently on track to grow our production volumes at 20% to 25% for this year and beyond. For the first quarter, production grew 21% over the prior year quarter. Cash flow reached $262 million, which is an increase of 20%. Unit costs decreased 6% compared to the prior year quarter, and net income was $33 million.","On the operations side, it's fun to announce that we drilled our best Marcellus well ever, in what we believe is the best Marcellus well ever drilled by the industry in the southwest portion of the play. The well tested at a 24-hour rate of 6,357 Boes per day, or 38.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day from a 7,065 foot lateral with 36 stages in the Marcellus. Our team continues to demonstrate its ability to consistently improve and raise the bar. This speaks both to the quality of our acreage and also to the quality of our team.","The Midcontinent team also set a new record by drilling our highest oil-rate Mississippian Chat well to date. This well came online at a rate of 1,263 BOEs per day. Of this total, the oil-only rate was 1,062 barrels per day. As I discussed in detail on our last call, I believe that there are 3 key items this year that will distinguish performance between companies in our industry: one -- the first one is owning a sizable acreage position in the core area of the key -- of a key play such as the Marcellus; the second is the ability to consistently execute well; and the third is having a strong forward-thinking marketing team. In regards to item one, we have a huge position in the quarter to Marcellus, which is the best gas play in North America, maybe the world, given the economics of the Marcellus and the risks elsewhere. In terms of being able to consistently execute well, Range has a 10-year track record of consistently meeting or exceeding its targets, a 10-year period with a 20% production CAGR. Over the last 5 years, our Marcellus CAGR is 96%. Given our strong portfolio of natural gas and liquids contracts from customers, I believe we have a strong forward-thinking marketing team with a demonstrated track record.","One comment that I hear is that the Range story is well-understood and that people have confidence in our ability to grow production by 20% to 25% for many years. The question that I get following that comment is, what does the market not understand about Range? I think there are several things, particularly for those that model the value of Range. Since we discovered the Marcellus in 2004, the quality of oil wells has improved in terms of production rates and reserves each and every year. We've shown our historical improvements in terms of 0 time plots year after year. In addition, you can see this improvement, and that every year since then, we've had positive proved reserve revisions reviewed by our independent reserve auditors, which further confirms the strong performance. For those of you who model Range's future in the Marcellus, I believe that we can continue to see these kinds of performance improvements over time. In our view, the capital efficiency improvements are not over and should be considered in any evaluation of Range.","We've also seen efficiency improvements year after year on the cost side. LOEs per mcfe has significantly decreased since the discovery. G&A per mcfe has also crested over and has been declining. We believe there's still room for both to continuing to decrease on a per mcfe basis as production goes up. Interest expense has been declining on a per mcfe basis as well, and absent significant changes in the macroeconomic environment, I believe that this, too, will continue. Therefore, we believe these future cost efficiencies should be considered in evaluation calculations as well.","If you have a high-quality technical team and a huge footprint in the core of a high-quality play with thousands of wells to drill, that's the type of performance that should occur, and that's what we're witnessing. In addition, as we continue to develop the resource and get better and better with time, the recovery factor of the hydrocarbon in place should increase. In my opinion, in the core of a high-quality natural gas play, the recovery should approach and may likely exceed 50% of the in-place volumes.","As we continue to develop this resource and acquire more data and more history, the probability of success of this project should continue to increase, thereby increasing the value of our company. In addition, as we go forward, I believe that gas markets will improve given the move to increase gas usage and power generation and in the petrochemical sectors, along with the rise of manufacturing. LNG exports will also be a driver, and slowly but surely, transportation fueled by natural gas is increasing. Each successive year, we projected the value of Range should increase. Given our expectation that will drive up production 20% to 25% per year, each successive year the starting point for our production in the model will be higher, the capital and cost efficiency should get better, and ultimately we believe that the gas price will move higher. We believe we have the potential to significantly drive up shareholder value.","Another significant upside that we have, that perhaps is not well understood by the market, is the Utica potential beneath our Washington County acreage. Based on our mapping and seismic, we believe that make we may have the dry core of the Utica play in that area. That's based on well control and seismic control, not only in Ohio and West Virginia, but in Washington County, Pennsylvania. Typically, in any play, the dry core is the area with the most prolific wells. While we've not yet included the Utica in our published resource potential figures, we have spudded our test well and we expect to have some results to talk about before year end.","Our portfolio at Range essentially consists of 3 areas: about 1 million net acres in Pennsylvania; about 325,000 net acres in the Southern Appalachia basin; and about 360,000 net acres in the Midcontinent. These areas all have the same attributes that we really like at Range: great stacked pay potential; a rich hydrocarbon charge; good infrastructure; and great technical, marketing and operating teams focused on creating shareholder value with the assets.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.","Ray N. Walker","Thanks, Jeff. I'll focus my remarks this morning on operational results, production guidance and marketing, and as always, there's specific detail in our earnings release and in our updated presentation and we can certainly cover any of that in the Q&A.","I'll start with our southern Marcellus division in Southwest Pennsylvania with an example of improving capital efficiency, combined with improving well performance. We recently drilled 2 new wells on an existing Marcellus pad in our wet area. That pad had 5 existing wells that had been producing for a little over 2 years. One is the new well with a 700 foot spaced well and the other one was a 900 foot spaced well. That new wells averaged 3,776 foot laterals and 19 stages as compared against 2,500 feet and 9 stages on the 5 existing wells. And the new wells utilized our newer targeting technology, reduced cluster spacing, or what we call RCS completions, and our newer frac-ing science. These new wells point out some very important and significant value adds going forward. First, these 2 new wells, on average, cost approximately $850,000 less per well than like-kind wells drilled on a newly constructed pad today. In other words, an apples-to-apples comparison with today's cost and processes. The reason for the significant savings is the already existing infrastructure, in essence, the pad, road, water and some of the production facilities were already paid for, along with the gathering infrastructure.","Secondly, the average initial production rate, or IP, of these 2 wells was $18.9 million a day each, as compared to $4.9 million a day each for the existing wells completed over 2 years ago. That's nearly 4x better. This is a tangible example of improving completion designs and technologies combined with reservoir modeling, and this example confirms our belief that there's opportunity to recover additional reserves at better metrics as we add wells on existing pads throughout the field.","Third, even though the new wells were 50% longer laterals with more than twice as many stages, the new wells still cost 6% less than the original wells on an absolute basis. And we're almost 4x better performers based on the IPs.","And lastly, but equally impactful, these wells came online approximately 9 to 12 months earlier than normal due to much of the permitting procedure being satisfied by the existing pad and related infrastructure.","We believe we're still in the early innings of the ballgame in driving real step changes in value and capital efficiency going forward as illustrated by this example. 10% of the wells we're drilling in 2014 will be wells that we've gone back onto existing producing pads like this example, and we expect that percentage should increase in the years ahead. The second example from Southwest PA involves a new 5-well pad in the super-rich area. The 5 new wells were all completed with our latest RCS designs, having an average lateral length of 6,635 feet and 34 stages. Again, these laterals are significantly longer than our historical average. The 5 wells had an average IP of 28.6 million cubic feet equivalent per day each, or 4,773 Boe per day, of which 65% is liquids and is now our highest per well average IP from any pad yet in Southwest Pennsylvania. One of these wells IP-ed at 38.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 6,357 Boe per day with a 7,065 foot lateral and 36 stages, and is now the highest liquids-rich well IP, again, with greater than 60% liquids in the basin. In fact, we believe it's the highest IP rate reported in the southwest portion of the basin or any Marcellus well, either dry or wet.","When you consider this fixed offset pad to this new super-rich pad, which hold 28 wells, having an average IP of 9.9 million a day with 3,650 foot laterals and 18 stages, these 5 new wells, on an absolute basis, have a 189% higher IP, and on a normalized lateral length basis, have a 60% better IP, again, illustrating that our team is getting better and better at understanding the reservoir and recovering more of the hydrocarbon in place.","We get a lot of questions concerning how to compare well results with variable lateral lengths against the standard type curve. Considering the variability of lateral lengths actually being completed, we've now updated the presentation with a slide that normalizes our 2013 actual well data on a lateral length basis for our super-rich area. What you'll see is that with a year's worth of data, the 2013 wells on a normalized basis continue to produce about 50% above the 2013 normalized type curve. This clearly supports the upgrade of our type curves at the last earnings release.","Going a step further, albeit very early, the 4 super-rich wells that we've turned to sales thus far in 2014, which averaged 5,933 feet with 30 stages are slightly outperforming the 2014 type curve. While recognizing they have less than 30 days of production history, we're cautiously optimistic this performance will hold up. And once we get more wells and more production history on the 2014 wells, we'll update and normalize the 2014 type curves accordingly.","A third example of improving well performance is a new pad we just brought online in our dry gas area of Southwest Pennsylvania. This pad had 3 wells averaging 4,768 foot laterals with 25 stage completions. This is a brand-new pad and we're still cleaning these wells up, but all of these wells appear capable of well over 20 million a day and are exhibiting really strong wellhead pressures. In fact, one of the wells was flowing at over 30 million a day over the weekend. Takeaway of the pad is limited to approximately 50 million, and again, this is another example of applying our new completion designs in the dry area with some longer laterals and delivering outstanding results.","Combining what we've seen from the first example of going back onto an existing pad with much improved capital efficiency and achieving much better well performance, coupled with the much improved and record-setting performance of the super-rich area and the dry gas area examples, our high-quality inventory becomes even more valuable. Being in a core position like we are, we believe the high-quality rock can continue to yield better and better results. And again, as I've said many times in the past and we just proved once again, we haven't drilled our best well yet. We expect our EURs to continue to improve on an absolute and normalized basis, while at the same time becoming more capital efficient. This is very impactful as we have a large footprint in the core of the Marcellus in Southwest PA and have only drilled a small portion of our inventory to date. And we have almost a 10-year track record in the Marcellus to support that we are getting better and better.","Shifting to the Utica test. We've spud the well, and albeit very early in the project, we're on track to have test results by the fourth quarter. We're planning for a 6,500 foot lateral targeted in the Point Pleasant interval to be completed with approximately 32 stages, utilizing our latest RCS designs. There've been a lot of questions concerning what our expectations might be. While I'm not going to predict the test rate, what I can say is we're a little deeper, we believe we have a thicker formation with comparable permeability and porosity, and we believe we have comparable and potentially higher pressures than the key offsets to our West and South. Again, we could have the core of the highest gas in place in the Utica right underneath our core Marcellus and Upper Devonian position in Washington County, PA, and this well should tell us a lot about the potential value of that resource.","In northeast Pennsylvania, we're continuing with our program, averaging one rig throughout the year while fulfilling our lease commitments and holding our production volumes approximately flat. As a follow-up to our last call, where I announced the 18 Bcf well in Lycoming County, that particular well, for the first 150 days, averaged 16.9 million a day. Again, it was a 6,353 foot lateral with 32 stages. The average of the 4 wells on that pad was 11.8 million a day each for the first 150 days, and the 4 wells had an average lateral length of 5,406 feet with 22 stages. The great news is that we have the ability and capacity to add as many as 25 more wells that will exceed 5,000 feet of lateral length in that immediate area in Lycoming County to significantly ramp up volumes when the time is right.","In the Midcontinent Division, we remain focused on delineating and testing our Mississippian Chat acreage on the Nemaha Ridge, along with developing our St. Louis production in the Texas Panhandle. For the chat play, we're continuing with our larger stimulation designs, and we just completed a new well that IP-ed at 1,263 Boe per day with 92% liquids, including 1,062 barrels of oil per day. This well has just yielded our highest oil rate to date in the play. As our team is applying the new stimulations, while it's still early, the results are encouraging. I want to reemphasize that our expectation for EURs remains in the range of 485 to 600 Mboe as we stated in the past.","As you know, during the first quarter, we had a much colder winter in Appalachia than average, and it certainly exceeded what we had forecasted as normal winter downtime in our volumes. While we were successful in supplying all our customers during the extreme conditions, we did experience significant shut-ins affecting our production for the quarter. Despite those challenges, we exceeded our first quarter production guidance. And my congratulations to the operating teams across the company for all their great planning and execution during the extreme weather condition. Production for the first quarter was 1.056 Bcf equivalent per day with 35% liquids.","Moving to the second quarter. In Southwest Pennsylvania, MarkWest just completed a planned turnaround of its Houston and Majorsville plant complexes that will significantly affect our second quarter volumes. This is a very positive event for Range, and despite the downtime, we are still on track for quarter-to-quarter growth and to grow our 2014 volumes 20% to 25% over 2013. It's important to point out that this turnaround completely took down all of our wet and super-rich production in Southwest Pennsylvania for 7 days. This turnaround was the first since the Houston site began operations in the fall of 2008 and involved major upgrades to various systems at both processing complexes. These upgrades set us up for an increase in process and capacity for Range by 200 million and should significantly enhance plant operations and provide better reliability and efficiencies, allowing for Range's wet gas and liquids growth over the coming years. We applaud MarkWest for their exceptional planning and execution of these upgrades, and we see this as a very positive event for Range.","Inclusive of the turnaround, our second quarter guidance will be in the range of 1.06 to 1.075 Bcf equivalent per day with 30% to 35% liquids. The turnaround was significant and results in an impact of approximately 50 million cubic feet equivalent per day in our second quarter volumes. However, the turnaround also now gives us greater confidence in our remaining plans for 2014. Quarter 3 guidance will be approximately 1.16 to 1.210 Bcf equivalent per day, and quarter 4 should be approximately 1.28 to 1.34 Bcf equivalent per day, both with a range of 30% to 35% liquids.","As we continue to emphasize, and as pointed out in the press release, Range's marketing strategy is to continually diversify and expand the company's markets with customer base in those markets and the indexes to which we sell. We continue to do this through the acquisition of firm transportation capacity that dovetails with our growing production volume. As part of this strategy, we've focused on projects that involve the expansion of existing infrastructure, thereby resulting in relatively lower transportation rates. And we continue to focus on projects with in-service dates that fit the company's projected volume growth. We're able to do this because our acreage is located in Southwest Pennsylvania where the existing infrastructure is already expansive and in close proximity to our operations.","Slide 21 of our presentation provides a detailed breakout of the regions of the country where we're sending our gas, the associated volumes and transport costs. You will note on the slide that our current firm transport cost is approximately $0.25 per mcf, and by 2016, is projected to be $0.21. Not reflected on this slide is a recent arrangement Range has entered into as anchor shipper on a pipeline expansion project. This firm transportation agreement provides Range with an additional 200 million per day of capacity from Southwest Pennsylvania to the Gulf Coast, with a projected in-service date of June 1, 2017. We also picked up 25 million per day of released capacity effective April 1, 2014, to East Coast markets with some of the strongest basis to NYMEX.","Also in our press release is a schedule that provides detail of our corporate differential to NYMEX over the last 5 quarters. This schedule also provides detail of our Marcellus-only basis to NYMEX. First quarter 2014 corporate basis before the effects of basis hedges was a plus $0.66, and after basis hedges was a minus $0.24 as it's very similar to the pricing we saw in the third and fourth quarter. The bottom line is that our marketing team is doing a great job accessing the best indexes to sell our gas. We like to stress that 85% to 95% of our gas is sold under more favorable indices, and by 2017, we'll be selling on approximately 20 different indexes, 15 of which are outside the Appalachian basin.","Turning to our NGL marketing. Our 2 new ethane pipeline projects are working well, with Nova taking its full contracted volume on Mariner West, and the ATEX pipeline to Mont Belvieu is receiving its full amount as well. Mariner East is expected to be in service in 2015. Again, when all 3 ethane projects are up and running, we'll receive a 25% uplift on our ethane revenue versus leaving the ethane in the gas stream net of all fees. We have been and are continuing to take advantage of Sunoco's market export terminal in Philadelphia to access international propane markets on a seasonal basis. We're also in discussions to sell our butane volumes to international markets, all of this being tangible examples of the good work our marketing team is doing in the basin.","In closing, Range has some great acreage positions across the company, and we have tangible and current examples unlocking improvements in both well performance and capital efficiency across all our divisions. And we have a great marketing team that continues to deliver, all of which continue to drive up shareholder value and gives us confidence in our expectations for meeting our goals going forward.","Now over to Roger.","Roger S. Manny","Thank you, Ray. Building upon the strength of our 2013 results, the first quarter of 2014 saw strong production-driven top line revenue growth, building significantly higher earnings and cash flow than last year.","First quarter revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales, including cash-settled derivatives, was $467 million, 17% higher than last year. Cash margin for the quarter was $2.73 per mcfe, roughly the same as last year's $2.75 figure, but higher sequentially than the $2.68 per mcfe figure from the fourth quarter. Cash flow for the first quarter was $262 million, which was 20% higher than cash flow from a year ago. Cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.62, 19% higher than last year. EBITDAX for the first quarter was $305 million, 18% higher than last year.","Net income for the first quarter came in at $33 million compared to a net loss last year of $76 million. Earnings derived from methods used by most analysts, which excludes asset sales, derivative mark-to-market entries and various nonrecurring items, was $74 million or $0.46 per fully diluted share. As Rodney mentioned, please remember that all our non-GAAP measures are fully reconciled to GAAP on the various supplemental tables found on the Range website.","Moving down the income statement to the expense categories and keeping with our current practice of only commenting on expense items that were significantly different from guidance, most of the unit costs came in as expected or better. Cash direct operating expense for the first quarter at $0.41 per mcfe was $0.02 over guidance due to nonrecurring workover expense and higher field-level overhead expense, mainly due to costs associated with managing production to a record cold Marcellus winter and higher water disposal costs. We expect second quarter cash operating expense to return to trend at $0.36 to $0.38 per mcfe.","Cash transportation, gathering and compression expense per mcfe was $0.78 for the quarter, also $0.02 over guidance, primarily due to maintenance and capacity expansion ahead of our volume growth. We added additional firm takeaway capacity at the start of the second quarter, which will not be fully utilized until future periods. And these capacity additions, while prudent to support expected production growth, are expected to cause an increase in transportation, gathering and compression expense in the second quarter this year to between $0.86 and $0.88. As we get past the impact of the processing turnaround and production builds in the second half of this year, we should see this rate come back down into the high $0.70 range. Exploration expense and unproved property impairment expense were both below the low end of guidance by a combined $5 million due to the timing of seismic expenditures and fewer lease explorations. Please reference our first quarter 2014 press -- earnings press release for additional detailed expense item guidance for the second quarter.","Aside from higher book equity from a solidly profitable first quarter and cash flow continuing to grow faster than debt, things were pretty quiet on the balance sheet. The trailing 4-quarter debt-to-EBITDAX ratio rounds up to 2.8x, down from the 3x figure at the end of last year's first quarter. And in April, our bank group unanimously reaffirmed our $2 billion borrowing base, and we ended the first quarter with just over $1 billion committed liquidity. Range continued to orderly layer in additional 2014, 2015 and 2016 hedges during the first quarter. And the best place to obtain detailed hedge volumes and prices by product is the Investor Relations section of the Range website. Investors may also find summary hedge information in the press release tables.","To close the finance remarks, Range is off to an excellent start in 2014, with production up 21% and cash flow up 20% from the first quarter of last year. Our cost structure and capital efficiency continue to improve while production increases and cash flow builds, trends that we anticipate will continue into the rest of 2014.","Jeff, back over to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","I appreciate the breakout of the corporate differentials historically, and it looks like, obviously, in this quarter, due to favorable pricing up in the Northeast and kind of unfettered access to those markets is what drove that 88% -- or excuse me, $0.88 premium in the Marcellus. Can you guys talk about, I know you've got hedges in place, but what your expectations are for kind of expected run rate, both short term and long term, on those basis differentials at this juncture?","Chad L. Stephens","Yes, Dave, this is Chad. Thanks for the question. First off, if you look in our earnings press release on Page 5, there's a table that talks about the corporate basis differentials and the breakout of our Marcellus, which was the specific Marcellus was $0.88 positive. But we also -- there's a little paragraph there that talks about going forward with our existing basis hedges, the impact of them are and they're relatively immaterial going forward. But to give you a little bit more color, let's briefly review some of the main points that we talked about in our last earnings call and then I'll talk a little bit more specific about new information that we have released since then. First, one of the most important factors regarding our differentials is determining what pipelines a producer has access to, and we talked about in Southwest PA, the multiple pipelines we have access to. When we began accumulating our Marcellus acreage position in 2006, not only did we want the best location based on gas in place and we have some gas in place maps in our presentations, as evidenced by the maps, we also wanted the best location based on accessible infrastructure. The bulk of our Marcellus acreage is located in Southwest PA near several large existing pipelines that give us access to multiple markets and pricing points. This diversity reduces the risk associated with all the recent basis volatility in the Appalachia indices that we've seen over the past 4 or 5 months. One of Range's unique qualities is our disciplined approach of finding multiple options. So you can see this in our selection of stacked pay acreage positions, the multiple NGL marketing ranges we have with our ethane, extensive customer base that we talked about and we're expanding on that, and specific to your question, really, is the pricing indices. The more good options we have, obviously, the better decisions we're able to make. Last month, we provided that we have 9 different pricing indices on which our Marcellus gas is currently priced and also showed our expectations to add a few more by 2016, and we continue to do that. I did not know of another producer in Appalachia that has the same level of pricing diversity. Our corporate differential during the first quarter, as we've shown, was minus $0.24, which is similar to what we've been reporting in the prior quarters. Although we don't guide for any type of specific pricing going forward, we do expect natural gas realizations to continue reflecting the general price movements of the multiple indices on which we sell our gas, and we talk about 85% to 95% of our gas is sold on premium or better indices. Only about 10% to 15% of our gas is exposed to either M2 or Leidy, which are the -- 2 of the more negative indices in the Appalachia basin. In the summary, this generally will result in slightly weaker basis relative than our mix, while in the winter, we'll have some more exposure to premium prices like we showed in the first quarter of 2014 during this winter vortex. I hope that gives you a little color about our perspective on pricing.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","It does, but I'm just trying to get a little bit more specific. When I look at kind of Q1 and Q4, as you highlight, it's sort of a corporate level of about a minus $0.24 -- $0.23, $0.24. Is that something we should run going forward in our economic models? Or do you think that, over time, you're going to be able to generate even higher returns, kind of similar to what we saw Q1, Q2 in 2013?","Chad L. Stephens","Again, it was -- the first quarter was this unforeseen winter vortex and prices, all of the indices really spiked. And that was really what drove the loss in the basis hedges. We used all of our tools available to us. We accessed multiple indices through the multiple firm transportation pipe projects that we have, but we also use other tools such as basis hedging. As we entered this particular winter back in late summer and early fall, we were anticipating these basis blowouts, which were occurring as we entered the winter, and we were hedging to protect against continued blowouts. And unfortunately, this winter vortex hit, the basis narrowed. And we caught -- we got caught with these basis hedges. But we're going to always continue to use all of the tools at our disposal to protect against this basis risk going forward. So I hope that gave you some perspective of how we approach. I think going forward, relative to fourth quarter 2013 and first quarter 2014, when you look at where the indices were and where our corporate differential resulted, I think you can pretty much project similar differentials going forward, absent a winter vortex.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that color. And then just one other question. As you guys highlighted, you'll be moving from 6 horizontal rigs down to 3 horizontal rigs in Southwest PA through the balance of this year. Obviously, it highlights tremendous drilling efficiency and completion efficiency gains, but it didn't look like there's any change to forward CapEx. So with that in mind, does that mean that more capital is going to the individual wells, specifically through more stage completions, the tighter frac clusters, et cetera? Or is there potential that your full year CapEx actually could come in below expectation?","Ray N. Walker","Well, that's a great question, Dave. Our CapEx budget is still going to remain at the $1.52 billion and we're not going to change that. We are -- you hit on a couple of points. We are definitely becoming more and more efficient. We're also drilling longer laterals. We have an extra rig in there for the, of course, the Utica test. It's really just a matter of timing and everything else that is the reason, the fluctuation of rig count, but it's really what we're seeing is capital efficiency, more RCS completions, longer laterals and it's just all a matter of fact of the timing. But our CapEx budget will remain at the $1.52 billion.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. Last question, at 3 horizontal rigs at year end, is that where you plan to be running in 2015? Or do you need to ramp that back up to kind of maintain similar wells drilled as you did in '14? Just trying to get a handle on how that's swinging up and down.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, it will swing up and down throughout the year, but definitely there will probably be on average more rigs running in '15 than there is in '14 just simply because we're going to keep our production growth guidance in the 20% to 25% range. So of course, 20% to 25% of '14's volume is a lot bigger than 20% to 25% of '13's volumes were.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I've got -- I've sort of several kind of quick answer-type questions. The first one is the Utica test that you're currently drilling, is that being drilled on an existing production pad? Or is that a stand-alone well?","Ray N. Walker","Yes, that is being drilled on an existing producing Marcellus pad. And we're actually offsetting one of the Trenton-Black River tests that was done years ago, have a high-quality 3D seismic that we shot across the position for the Marcellus, which also enables us to image the Point Pleasant interval in the Utica. And then we've got the ability to actually put this well into sales fairly quickly towards the end of the year. So we're pretty excited about the test.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. I noticed that the NGL production had a pretty significant uptick quarter-over-quarter. Is there any special color to that?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, let me address that one. What you saw, as we have, as we mentioned in the press release, both of our ethane projects, Mariner West and ATEX, up and running. Next year, we'll add the third one that we have, Mariner East. And as we mentioned in the release and Ray did as well, once all 3 are up, it's actually a 25% uplift of taking the ethane out, that's net of all fees versus leaving it in the gas. To put a little more color, on an annual basis, that will be about a $45 million to $50 million increase in cash flow.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great. And the last question that I'll ask today is, when do you plan to start to -- now that you've got the Utica going, when do you plan to start undertaking some liquids-rich exploration or development, whatever you want to call it, for the Pennsylvania Upper Devonian?","Ray N. Walker","Well, we've, in the past, have drilled, I think, 4 or 5 Upper Devonian tests, and every time we drill a Marcellus well, we get a good look at the Upper Devonian. So we've mapped it out. There's now enough industry tests that have been done around our position in Southwest PA, as well as all across the play, actually. And we've got a few slides in our presentation that refer to that. I think Slide #24. So -- and when you look at all that data, that, to us, is something that's been unlocked. We had a really, really great well, the last well we tested. So we're basically holding that right now, focusing on the Marcellus. As we drill the Marcellus, we hold rights to all of the formations from surface to the center of the earth. So it's really a matter of focus for us today. And we have, as I talked about, really good examples of going back on the existing producing pads and wells that are a whole lot cheaper and a whole lot better performers. And we believe there's lots of potential to figure out the Marcellus. And I think you'll see the Upper Devonian layer into that plan as the years come forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice & Company.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Ray, on the super-rich wells that you -- the 5 well pads you talked about in the longer laterals, those are 20-plus percent longer than what you expect for the average this year. Are you still sticking to the 5,300 foot lateral average for the year? What drove the longer laterals? And was there anything special or different about where you drilled that pad to result in that kind of deliverability?","Ray N. Walker","Well, that is a great question, Ron. We -- the pad was actually not a special pick geographically per se as much as it was fitting into an area that we needed to HBP some acreage and also fill in the infrastructure. So it was probably more governed by that and was probably a location that was planned 2 or 3 years ago when we picked that location. So I think what you're seeing is a couple of things. We are producing or completing wells significantly differently than we did 2 or 3 years ago. We're using better frac designs, RCS completions, different profit mixes and all sorts of things that the completion team, the technical team up there are doing. They're also working a lot on targeting the laterals and figuring out exactly how to place these things in the Marcellus and it's making a huge difference, as you can tell, by this monster pad -- monster well that's on the pad. So this has been a really impressive pad for us. As far as lateral lengths, we're always trying to drill the longest lateral that we potentially can on a site. When we put out the average lateral lengths planned for the year at the last call, those were basically based on our plans at that time. Our hope is that we will basically get to drill a little bit longer when we actually get the rig on that pad because we'll be able to add leases at the last minute and things like that, that go forward. So all of those things being said, I think our average lateral length will probably end up being a little bit longer. But again, it is, on average, over 100-and-some odd wells. Some of those will be pretty long. Some of them are over 7,000 feet, and some, of course, will be shorter. So hopefully, we'll always be able to push that lateral length a little bit further as time goes on.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Let me add a little color, Ron, before you add your second question. And top of what Ray said, if you look at Slide 19, we show in the Southwest, dry, wet and super-rich, and importantly, that second line is EURs per thousand foot of lateral. And with the exception of what Cabot has up in the northeast, I think our EURs per thousand foot of lateral were probably second highest of anyone there. Really, what it speaks to is the quality of the lot. Now what you're seeing is we're taking high-quality rock and we're drilling longer laterals. So we drill a 7,000 foot lateral and we got a well that's 38.1 million per day. It speaks to longer laterals and more stages and all those efficiency Ray said can do, that was in the super-rich. In the dry, we went back and drilled some wells with little bit longer laterals and the wells are constrained, and just opening one up and it's still constrained, it was 30 million per day. So it shows when you got high-quality rock in the core of the play, and as we continually optimize completions, it speaks to, as we continue to migrate longer, what those wells might look like.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And then, I guess, somewhat as a follow-up to Dave's question earlier. If you look at the success here in the super-rich and the 3 dry gas wells, you talked Marcellus, as well as you talked about in -- or earlier on the call, plus the Utica. When you think about capital allocation over 2015 and beyond, and also with the rig count that you talk about, how do you full strength your plays given the strong results in each of these plays, albeit with the Utica still drilling the first well?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, I think the key is on that same Slide 19. I just talked about EURs per thousand foot of lateral. If you look on the same slide, it looks at the rates of return. And you can see the rates of return, whether they're dry, wet or super-rich, are really strong in all 3 areas. So we intend to develop that entire position. And again, remembering that position is about 530,000 net acres on the slide before it. On 80 acre spacing just in the Marcellus, there's over 6,000 locations to drill. And as Ray mentioned, it looks like we can go tighter, we have hole pilots in some of these new wells that he referred to -- were really exciting because it shows going back in earlier, jumping back to last summer, so when you infill, we thought maybe those infill wells might be 80% of the offset. Now with some of these other tighter spaced wells going in with newer completions in older areas, it shows, hey, maybe we can do a lot better than that. So we've got the Marcellus to develop on top of it. The Upper Devonian looks derisked and a great opportunity and we'll find out. And hopefully, on our call in October, we'll be able to talk about the results in the Utica and we have high hopes for that. Again, we're offsetting old Trenton-Black River wells. So we've already seen the formation and seen what it can do and it correlates really well to the high-rate wells that are marching eastward towards us. In fact, one of them is within a mile of the edge of our acreage. So we plan to develop all of it. So really, what we think we're going to end up with is a cube of Upper Devonian, Marcellus and Point Pleasant below us with stacked pay potential and then you're going to have dry, wet and super-rich and really that whole thing looks good, which gives us the confidence to say that we think we can grow at 20% to 25% for many years with improving capital efficiencies as we go forward into a better gas pricing environment.","Ray N. Walker","Ron, I was just going to add a little color to that. I don't know if I told you about these 2 wet wells we drilled. One of them, just to illustrate Jeff's point with a tangible current example, is we went back on this pad that has 5 existing producing wells that we completed a little over 2 years ago. So they've been on sales for 2 years and one of these new wells was placed between laterals that were 1,400 feet apart, so it's a 700 foot infill well instead of maybe a 500 foot, but that's pretty close. And the other well was between 1,800 foot, 2 laterals that were existing 1,800 feet apart so we put one in that's 900 feet spaced, in other words. Those 2 wells IP-ed at almost 20 million a day as compared to 5 million a day from the original wells. And what's more important than all of that, they're $850,000 cheaper per well on an apples-to-apples comparison. When we look at those kind of economics, what we show you on Page 19 doesn't even get close to what potential we could see going forward.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Which gets to the last point in terms of capital efficiency. I mean, obviously, significantly higher EURs at even the lower cost. You've made a lot of changes as you can -- as that highlights just on the 2 years on that 1 pad. How close are we getting in terms of getting to -- not maximum, but where do you think you are in the continuum of increasing capital efficiency, given the amount of changes that you made just over the past 2 years? Because I don't think they're driving potential significant value growth in -- when you look at your future inventory.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, that's a great question, and I think we still got a long ways to go and it's an impact of several things or an effect of several things. One, we've got a really top-notch technical team that's doing tons of PVT analysis and reservoir modeling and analysis of targeting and all of these different things that they're doing. And we're in the core position in the play, which has better perm, better porosity, more hydrocarbon in place. And when you combine all of those things, I really think, as fast as things are changing, that we're still only in the third inning, maybe the top of the fourth of a baseball game trying to figure out what the potential could be going forward. We're only several hundred wells into what, like Jeff referred to earlier, could be 6,000-plus wells going -- when it's all said and done. So when you get a team that's that sharp, that's got the kind of track record that we've got and kind of improvements that we've seen just in the last few years, I think the potential is really, really big for what we're going to see in improvements going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, a couple of quick ones, please, if I could. On that Utica test well, are you drilling a vertical pilot hole? And has that already been TD-ed?","Ray N. Walker","We have not TD-ed the pilot hole yet. We will drill down and actually get some logs and so forth and then we'll kick it off and drill a horizontal in it. So I could -- you could say a pilot hole from the standpoint of just getting some logs and so forth, but we have an offset well fairly close but we will confirm that and actually match it up to our seismic and all of that going forward.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then the other, back to the Marcellus, on these new RCS wells you've been talking about, especially the infills, what do you think the effective frac half-widths of these things are?","Ray N. Walker","That is the age-old question. And if you ask 20 different engineers, you'll probably get 20 different responses. There's -- to me, as a guy that's done a lot of frac jobs over the years, it depends. When you talk about effective fracture length, if we're talking about where we effectively place the proppant in the fracture, that could be quite long, in some cases, maybe 500, 600, 700 feet half-lengths. But I think what we now understand in today's world is that these fractures are very, very complicated and very complex near the wellbore. And actually, what we're learning is we want more of that to take place near the wellbore. So I would tell you today that in an effective -- from an effective production standpoint, that you're probably 100 to 150 feet away from a wellbore at the best because all of the really good production that we're seeing is coming from pretty near wellbore. When you do history matching of pressures and different things over the years, you're going to see that, that -- that's what's happening. And you've seen that evidence in some of the fields that have a lot of history like the Barnett, where they've actually been able to put laterals as close as 125 feet in some cases. But clearly, they did it at 250 feet in a lot of areas in the sweet spot. Now will this go that far? It's way too early to tell that at this point. But we clearly, as the examples we've talked about this morning, clearly believe we can get to 500 foot spacing in the wet and super-rich area. I think there will be areas where you can go closer than that in some instances. I think the Upper Devonian may act the same way, but again, remember, the Marcellus is not the Marcellus everywhere. We're talking about a huge position in Southwest PA, 530,000 net acres, and the way we treat a well in the super-rich area is a completely different design of what we're doing in the dry area. Even though we may use the same techniques and processes and engineering principles that taught us what we know in the super-rich and we apply some of those things in the dry area, it's a different design that we're pumping in the dry area, and we're seeing that, that is actually working. When our reservoir -- we showed you super-rich, we showed you wet and we showed you dry in a presentation. When our engineers work on it, they're working on 20 to 30 different map areas just in the wet and super-rich area, for instance. So they're looking at a lot of different areas to try to design specifically for that instance.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And on those 150 sort of wells stimulated, what does that tell you about the recovery factor of those rocks that close to the wellbore? Is it 80%? Is it...","Ray N. Walker","Well, I think, when we look at all our numbers today, we think we're in the high 30s of recovery of gas in place. Now as time goes on, we'll probably be able to calculate that there's more gas in place than we thought there was, but we'll also get better at frac jobs. We'll also get better at initiation of fractures near the wellbore in making more complexity, and there may be stress shadowing and different things like that, that we can do to help create that complexity. But there's no doubt we will drive recovery of hydrocarbons in place up as time goes on. But today, I think we're still pretty solid in the 35%, 40%. Alan Farquharson can talk a little bit more about that.","Alan W. Farquharson","Yes, Bob, we're still in that range in terms of where we think we're going to be. And as Jeff said a little bit earlier, we think we're going to be able to drive it up to over 50%. As you look at each individual layer, I think it gets very complex to try to say in the first 100 feet, we're going to be x percent and then we're going to get y after that. So I think, really, of all the numbers we continue to provide you is on what the resource opportunity is looking at specifically, our acreage block [indiscernible] over the years. In those numbers, there is variability depending upon where the acreage is and the hydrocarbon in place in those numbers. So obviously, in the cores, maybe a little bit higher than that. But in the aggregate, we're thinking that we're in the 35% to 40% type recovery range and that we think we should be able to exceed up to 50%, depending upon what spacing is going to be at end of the day, commodity pricing, et cetera. That is what's going to continue to drive recovery factors higher.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, if I can just add on, if you go back to Slide 13, we have a gas in place now for the Marcellus Shale, and of course, behind that, the other horizons. And I really believe, and I think we believe as a team, where you're going to get the high recoveries, by high recoveries I mean maybe exceeding 50%, is in the core of the play. And there's clearly 2 cores, one in the Northeast, one in the Southwest. If you're in non-core, the recoveries are going to be lower, the stuff may never be drilled. So it's where your acreage is located. And again, going back to those original infills that we released last summer, we've shown that you can drill as tight as 500 foot between wells successfully. So how tight that ultimately gets, we'll see. But I think driving the recovery factors up will be a combination of tighter spacing, which may be the 500 foot, coupled with more efficient completions.","Operator","We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch for our final question.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can I ask a question about your -- you said that the limitations on how much further you can go with the lateral lengths on the wells that you drilled to date. I guess, what I'm really trying to get at is you're sticking with the 5,300 feet but -- and I think the expression you used in the press release is you continue to experiment. But are there any limitations as to why you couldn't move to the longer length as a more standard well design? And I've got a quick follow-up, please.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes. No, there's no limitations to our lease position or anything like that. I mean, so what -- I think what's really important, if you go to Slide 18, the fact that just -- we're just now -- we have roughly 1 million net acres in Pennsylvania, the biggest position, I think, in Pennsylvania than any company, and importantly, with big parts of that in the core, in the stacked pay areas where the infrastructure is and all that type of thing. But if you go to 18, even on 1,000 foot between wells, we've drilled 8% of our wells to date. And I think, ultimately, we'll be drilling on 500 foot in that core area. So you could argue we've drilled 4% of them. No, there's no limitation and what you've seen us do is progressively go longer. I mean, if you go back every single year, we're progressively -- we've gone longer, and you're seeing us now step out and try some 7,000 foot wells and all and, hey, with great results, 38.1 million a day, the best well ever by any company in the whole southwest part of the play in the Marcellus. In fact, if you look at liquids-rich, it's better than any of the Utica wells, if you want to look at it that way. So no, there's no limitation. So I think as good as the results have been, we can, like Ray said, we're probably bottom of the third, top of the fourth. We can continue to go longer. If we haven't optimized the first 4% to 8% of our wells, we'll get better on the remaining 90%, so we're working on it.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. My follow-up, Jeff, I guess, nobody has really asked about the mix on the call. I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on that. And what's behind my question is, if you look at the well results, the most recent well results, I guess, after you changed your well design last year, you changed back again to, I guess, the longer laterals you're doing again now. But it seems that the well results are coming in a little lighter in terms of volumes, the 30-day volumes, compared to what you were getting in the wells last year. So I'm just wondering, what was your updated level of enthusiasm, I guess, in the overall quality of the play and in terms of how you think about future capital commitment and so on? I'll leave it there.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, Doug, that's a good question. And I think in the last earnings release, we reported some 30-day rates on a group of these newer design completions, and that 30-day rate is a little bit higher than the 7-day rate we reported in this release. That's not unusual. These wells tend to start out and they don't, a lot of times, don't reach their maximum production rates for a week or 2, sometimes a little longer out. So I would expect that -- I wouldn't put too much weight in the 30 day versus 7. I mean, we certainly don't. I mean, we look a lot more at 30 days, we just don't happen to have 30 days on those wells yet. So we're still cautiously optimistic about it. We're very pleased of what the team's doing. They, as evidenced by, they just hit a record well. It's our biggest oil rate from any well to date. So I think we're doing much better at delineating the acreage and learning from our 3D seismic that we're getting in. We're -- the bigger stimulations, we're still tweaking some things in that. And I really think by the end of the year, we'll have a much better picture of how those wells are going to hold up. It's simply -- we simply need to see 6 to 9 months of production out of some of these wells and it's going to unfortunately take 6 to 9 months to see that. So we can't speed it up. So once we've got that data towards the end of this year, I think we'll be able to get a lot more color on how we see that play emerging from this point.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, I'd like to start by saying I think there's roughly 10 more people that were in the queue for questions, so please -- I apologize we don't have more time. Please follow up with the IR team, and we hope to answer all your questions. But the concluding comments, we're on track to grow production 20% to 25% in 2014. I think cash flow will grow in line with that or perhaps better, we'll see. But given our approximately 1 million net acre position in Pennsylvania, focused in the southwest portion of the state where there's good historical infrastructure and where there's great stacked pay potential and because we have a great portfolio of dry, wet and super-rich wells, coupled with our approximately 325,000 acre footprint in the southern Appalachia basin and our 360,000 acre net footprint in the Midcontinent, we believe we can grow 20% to 25% for many years. As always, we'll stay focused on safely executing our plan and being good stewards of the environment.","Thanks for participating on the call.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

The order of our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Chad Stephens, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development.","Range did file our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on our website under the Investor tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we have posted on our website supplemental tables which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and reconciliation of reported earnings to our adjusted non-GAAP earnings that are discussed on the call today.","Now let me turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thank you, Rodney. The past several months have been a very challenging time for E&P stocks as Appalachian natural gas prices and now oil prices have been under pressure. We appreciate our shareholders' continued support as the commodity market sort themselves out as they always do. At Range, we remain focused on the things that will make Range and its shareholders successful in the long run, which is executing our plan for low-cost growth day in and day out. As one of the lowest-cost producers with the largest position in the core of the Marcellus, we are excited about what we have in store. Hopefully, in the next hour, you'll have a renewed or newfound appreciation for all the things that are going right at Range and how we've differentiated ourselves.","This is the 10th year anniversary of the discovery well for the Marcellus, which was Range's rents #1 in October of 2004. This was the first commercial well in the Marcellus and the one that kicked off the play. It was a vertical well. Range followed with the first commercial horizontal well in August of 2007 and announced multiple successful horizontal offsets in December of 2007. Today, anchored by this discovery, we believe that Range has a simple story. One, Range has the largest acreage position in the core of the Marcellus, and being in the core makes a big difference in shale plays. Two, most of that acreage is in Southwest Pennsylvania area, where the Upper Devonian, Marcellus and Utica\/Point Pleasant are all stacked on top of each other, which gives us built-in future capital efficiencies. Three, Range has identified the wells to be drilled that will take us to 3 Bcfe per day and beyond. Four, Range has the gathering, compression and processing plants already planned and under contract. Five, Range has the takeaway capacity arranged and under contract to support this growth. Six, Range has the liquidity and balance sheet to deliver on this plan. And seven, importantly, we have the team in place.","The Marcellus discovery has brought to the region a tremendous supply of natural gas, creating a temporary oversupply in the region and the weakness in pricing that we've all seen. To support this supply growth, billions of dollars are being spent, both domestic and internationally, to utilize these resources for decades to come. With our cost structure and first mover advantages, Range is well suited for this short-term oversupply with outstanding growth plan for the coming years of growing U.S. natural gas demand.","One of the advantages of being a first mover in a large play is the ability to secure low-cost transportation. We have disclosed our natural gas transportation agreements in the play through 2018. Under these agreements, our transportation grows from 1.1 Bcf per day at a cost of $0.28 this year to 1.75 Bcf per day in 2016 at the same cost for $0.28. In 2018, it grows to 2.4 Bcf per day at a cost of $0.39. It's not just about low transportation costs. It's equally important as to which markets you sell your products in. Our transportation agreements take us to solid demand markets at the endpoints, with the flexibility to sell to additional good markets along the way. By 2018, we plan to be selling into 22 different indices, which -- with gas headed to the Gulf Coast, Southeast, Midwest, Northeast Appalachia and Canada. By 2018, we expect about 1 Bcf per day of Range's production to be moving to the Gulf Coast or Southeast, up from 360 million cubic feet per day today.","Every company's portfolio of transportation contracts and the destinations and markets that they go to is unique. Based on the data we have seen, Range, capturing the advantage of being the first mover in the play, has the lowest cost and most diversified portfolio to very good markets. Importantly, our transportation capacity follows our expected production growth.","I also believe the same is true on the liquid side. Range is the largest liquids producer in the basin, and few companies have significant proven liquids-rich acreage. But even these companies that have liquids production, every company is different with unique transportation contracts and unique purchasers associated with them. Being the first mover in the play, coupled with a strong in-house marketing team, Range is in an advantage position here, too. The Mariner East propane project is projected to start up in early 2015. This will result in a significant cost savings of about $0.20 per gallon associated with transporting our propane to the Marcus Hook terminal. It will ultimately result in better propane pricing associated with faster loading in larger ships when exporting the propane. The ethane portion of Mariner East is projected to start up in mid-2015. Once this happens, combining Mariner East, Mariner West and ATEX, we project that we'll receive more than a 25% uplift to our ethane price versus selling the ethane as BTUs in the gas stream, and this is net of all transportation and processing costs. That combined increase of our ethane and propane arrangements when all of our contracts our operational equates to more than $100 million per year uplift to our net cash flow that all begins in 2015. No other company has that ability or the contracts in place for the next 15 years.","Another advantage to being a first mover is our acreage position. We have the best potential for stacked pay versus any other operator in the basin. This is shown on Slide 10 of our investor presentation on our website. We put together an acreage position of approximately 1 million net acres in Pennsylvania. When considering all of the stacked pay potential, it's more like 1.9 million net acres, which is shown on Slide 11. We are on target for having our first Utica well in Washington County completed and tested in December this year. If successful, it will confirm the Utica\/Point Pleasant potential in our Southwest Pennsylvania acreage. Being the first mover and capturing the best stacked pay potential, we've also captured the heart of liquids-rich and super-rich Marcellus. The same is true for the Upper Devonian. Range not only has the most net acreage with the best stacked pay potential, but we also have the best quality of rock in the southwest portion of the Marcellus.","On Slide 19, when comparing our current completions on a recovery per stage or recovery per lateral foot, the Range wells are the tops in the southwest portion of the play.","In addition to the positive attributes that I've just mentioned, the southwest portion of Pennsylvania also has the best infrastructure of any area of the play, which allows for expansion into new markets. Having size, scale, quality acreage in an area of good infrastructure and a great team, we have grown our gross Marcellus production in the third quarter to 1.2 Bcfe per day. We are the largest liquids producer in the basin. Our net production for the third quarter consisted of about 700 million cubic feet per day of gas, about 50,000 barrels per day of NGLs and approximately 8,500 barrels per day of condensate. As we've driven up production, our total unit costs have consistently declined. In some cases, we have even reduced our absolute costs as we've hydrated our portfolio and reduced our financing costs. Over time, as we grow net production 20% to 25% each year and drive down unit costs, even if prices remained steady, we expect our annual cash flow to grow by a rate in excess of 20% to 25% per year. As we move more gas to better markets, our gas prices should increase, along with liquids prices through the previously mentioned contracts.","In addition, as the infrastructure in the basin builds out, our basis should improve with time, too. Importantly, our team has a track record of consistently meeting targets and doing what we say we'll do. Our reserve growth over the last decade has been impressive, and importantly, our performance reserve revisions have been positive for the last 6 years. Those are important aspects of our company.","We're off to a great start after assuming 100% of operations in Nora, which is our Southern Appalachian division. Ray will discuss some recent technical breakthroughs, which have significantly enhanced that project. It has size, scale, repeatability, very good economics and one of the best gas prices in the United States. We have also made significant progress in the Mississippian Chat play, which will enable us to drill more there in 2015. Ray will talk about that, too.","The third quarter for Range was a profitable one, in spite of a challenging pricing environment. Assuming stabilizing strip pricing and differentials, we still project that we can be cash flow positive in 2016, and then our planned growth beyond that can be within cash flow. Importantly, we project that we'll continue to grow 20% to 25% in 2016 and beyond, when gas demand is projected to grow significantly from LNG exports, petrochemical, power generation, manufacturing and transportation growth. With visible production growth for many years, price-advantaged end markets, balance sheet strength to exploit our deep inventory of low-cost assets and the capacity to increase our capital efficiency by leveraging our infrastructure as we continue to grow, we believe that we'll be well positioned as natural gas prices stabilize and strengthen over time.","I will now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.","Ray N. Walker","Thanks, Jeff. For the third quarter, we beat our production guidance and either beat or met all of our operating cost metrics. And we continue to see exceptional well results, lower costs and improving capital efficiencies across all our divisions. Production for the third quarter came in at 1.21 Bcf equivalent per day, and we're currently right on track for our fourth quarter guidance of 1.35 Bcf equivalent per day with 30% liquids. This, of course, will put us at the high end of our year-over-year production growth guidance of 20% to 25%.","For the third quarter, as compared to the same time frame last year, the company achieved 26% production growth. And our unit cost and cash flow improved, as Roger will discuss in his remarks. In the Southern Marcellus Shale division, our well results remain the best in the southwest portion of the Marcellus, and our finding costs are amongst the lowest in the entire play. Let me give you just a couple of examples illustrating recent well performance.","In our wet and super-rich area, during the third quarter, 4 of the pads, which total 18 wells that we've brought online, had an average 24-hour IP of 16.1 million per day per each well. Again, it's important that I point out that these are actual 24-hour production rates to sales under production facility limited conditions. These 18 wells averaged 4,400-foot laterals and were completed with 25 stages. As I point out, one of those pads was a 5-well super-rich pad where 2 of the wells averaged over 1,000 barrels of condensate per day each, and 2 of the other wells on the pad averaged over 900 barrels of condensate per day each, all for a full 24 hours. In our Southwest PA dry area, we brought online a 3-well pad that had an average 24-hour IP to sales of 26.4 million a day. The 30-day average to sales for the 3 wells was 17.4 million a day per well, and they averaged 5364-foot laterals with 28 stages. These 2 examples illustrate both the quality of our core acreage in Southwest Pennsylvania, along with the technical and operational expertise of our team. On both an absolute and on a normalized basis, our results were consistently the best in the region.","Operating efficiencies are also strong. For 2014, we will drill approximately 12% of our wells on existing pads. And just to remind you, all of our drilling has been pad drilling for many years, and as I've discussed on previous calls, this gives us the ability to go back and drill up to 20 more wells per pad in any horizon as capacity frees up in the gathering system, while at the same time, appreciating huge capital savings and improved well performance, as we've discussed before. This really allows us to optimize our investment in gathering and will provide us the lowest cost over time.","As an apples-to-apples comparison to some recently reported metrics in the region, year-to-date, as compared to the same time frame last year in Southwest Pennsylvania, we've seen a 17% decrease in unit cost per Mcfe on a lateral foot basis, which is a clear indication of improving capital efficiency. And again, we believe the best in the basin, and we continue to execute more and more efficiently. Year-to-date, we've pumped 15% more frac jobs as compared to 2013, and we expect to pump approximately 42% more stages in 2014 as compared to '13. As you might suspect, this translates to a pretty good production and revenue increase as we bring wells on in a better pricing environment this winter.","For 2014, our average lateral link for wells in Southwest PA, including super-rich wet and dry, is projected to be 5,402 feet. This is 55% longer than in '13. For 2015, we're estimating that our average lateral length in Southwest PA will be more than 6,200 feet, with 1\/3 of the wells over 7,000 feet, and our longest lateral will be almost 12,000 feet. We expect longer laterals to continue to lead to higher EURs and even better returns. And on the volume side, our production from the Southern Marcellus Shale division for the third quarter is almost 36% higher this quarter as compared to last year. And we just set pipe on our Utica test in Washington County, PA, and are currently beginning our planned 32-stage completion. The logs and other diagnostic information from the well are consistent with our expectations. And the current schedule has us starting the completion this -- or as I just said, just now, followed by a flow test in December.","Shifting to Northeast Pennsylvania. Production for the third quarter was 25% higher than last year, driven mostly by outstanding well results. We're still maintaining our activity level at 1 to 2 rigs, while the team is doing really well at lowering costs and developing bigger and bigger wells. At the last call, we announced the well in Lycoming County that flowed under constrained conditions at 25.1 million a day for 30 days, with a 6,550-foot lateral. The state data reports that well at 22.2 million a day for 53 days. To follow up, that well has now averaged 20.1 million a day for 90 days and is one of the top 10 wells in Pennsylvania, and I might add, the only well in the top 10 not operated by Cabot and not in Susquehanna County. We're planning in early 2015 to drill a full-well pad, offsetting this record well, with average lateral lengths of over 8,000 feet. For 2014, our lateral lengths in Northeast PA are 34% longer than last year, and the team is consistently bringing these wells in at less than $5 million. For 2015, we expect our lateral lengths will be approaching 6,000 feet, and we expect them to continue to get longer with larger EURs and improving economics.","For the Midcontinent division, the team is making progress in refining the geologic model for the Chat play. Please refer to the earnings release for the details on recent wells. So far this year, our 2014 wells have shown a 33% improvement in their 30-day IPs over our 2013 wells. And with 37% of our wells, during the second and third quarters, having max 24-hour IPs greater than 1,000 Boe per day, we're confident that we've identified key reservoir areas to target going forward. For 2 quarters now, we've set records in well performance. And with continued success in the fourth quarter, we expect to be able to modestly increase the activity level in the Chat play next year. We're still finalizing those plans and will announce the planned well counts when we announce the 2015 budget.","Moving to the Southern Appalachian division. We introduced our plans for the next 18 months at the last call, and I'm happy to report that operations are progressing with very encouraging results. Again, we have a lot of details in the earnings release. With Range now having a full quarter of operational control over the Nora assets in Virginia, the team has introduced new techniques and well designs, resulting in an improved performance and economics. In the short period of time, Range has already achieved some of the best CBM results in 15 years using a major well design change, incorporating higher-grade casing and higher-rate foam fracs. The additional costs are around $10,000 to $20,000 per well. With 6 CBM wells turned to sales using the new completion technique, average results are 100% better than the historical field average, with returns of 100% or better. On a particular note is a new CBM well that's produced at a 60-day average of 340 Mcf a day, which is 5x the average CBM rate. And we just turned in line a new completion that's at that same level. There's over 2,000 CBM locations identified at the current spacing with the potential of over 3,000 infill locations. Similar improvements have been achieved with the same well design and high-rate fracture technique on the vertical tight gas wells, with overall results more than 70% better than historical field average for approximately $10,000 to $15,000 in additional costs. With 7 tight gas wells turned to sales with these new designs, the 30-day production average of these wells is the highest in over 10 years. The estimated rate of return of these wells is over 74%, and there are over 1,500 locations that are de-risked for future tight gas development. The division is also drilling horizontal Huron Shale wells, and there are over 2,000 de-risked horizontal Huron Shale locations currently identified.","And lastly, I want to remind you of the exploration potential beneath the 475,000 net acres that Range now controls in the Southern Appalachian basin. With only 4 penetrations below the Devonian Shale, we believe there's significant potential for exploration in the 6,000-plus feet of additional sediment between the Devonian Shale and the basement. Remember the old saying, the best place to look for oil and gas is in an oil and gas field.","I want to reiterate a couple of important points about Southern Appalachian. Number one, we own the minerals, thereby, yielding better economics since we have 100% of the working interest and 100% of the net revenue interest for most of the property. And number two, like Jeff mentioned earlier, our Nora production sells into one of the best markets for natural gas on the East Coast. We expect the average NYMEX plus $0.20 year round, with some gas potentially achieving even better prices than the prime winter markets. The well-defined, large and de-risked inventory of projects, which totals over 5.2 TCF of de-risked resource potential in Virginia, coupled with the new well designs, improving well performance, large gathering system with capacity, expanding demand in the region and favorable pricing, gives us confidence that we have the potential to ramp up production in the coming years with economics that are very strong even relative to the Marcellus.","In closing, we have an experienced and innovative team, a great portfolio of projects, a proven track record of execution, innovative marketing solutions with takeaway capacity, and all the infrastructure and financing security to achieve our growth projections for many years. There's really one clear message that I want to get across today. We have everything in place, soup to nuts, with the track record to support, to achieve our goals for growth in production and cash flow within a low-cost structure, building shareholder value for many years.","Now over to Roger.","Roger S. Manny","Thanks, Ray. The third quarter brought steady improvement in our cost structure and balance sheet, with continued year-over-year growth and cash flow despite lower realized prices.","Starting with the balance sheet this time. Since our last quarterly call, Range has received an upgrade from S&P to BB+ and Moody's with our Ba1 credit outlook from neutral to positive. These upward moves by both rating agencies ratify our continued progress, both operationally and financially. As natural gas and natural gas liquids continue to become true global commodities in the years ahead, our improved credit standing and favorable export contracts will help us continue to compete for long-term customers and new and better priced markets, not just in the U.S. but all over the world.","Following the ratings upgrade. Even though Range has continued to add significant, long-term, firm transportation commitments and now has sufficient contracted capacity to see us through many years of double-digit production growth, the amount of standby letter of credit collateral posted behind these commitments has declined by 21% from its peak earlier this year. Posting collateral behind pipeline contracts or taking an equity interest in a pipeline to avoid posting collateral adds the hidden cost of transportation and reduces available liquidity.","Credit quality matters now, and we believe it'll matter even more later. Complementing our new credit ratings, Range restructured and renewed for another 5 years our bank credit facility. The facility size was increased to $4 billion. The borrowing base was increased to $3 billion, and we chose an additional commitment of $2 billion. Importantly, borrowings under the new credit facility are priced 1.25% below the old facility, and the new credit contains a fallaway collateral feature that will enhance our future transition to investment grade. Like the old credit facility, the new facility is comprised of a leading energy industry's savvy group of diversified domestic and international financial institutions, with no one bank holding more than 6% of the commitment. I wish to thank each of these 29 institutions for their continued support of Range, equipping us with a state-of-the-market credit facility.","Now moving to the income statement. Cash flow for the third quarter was $257 million, 5% higher than last year's third quarter. EBITDAX for the third quarter was $294 million, 2% higher than last year. Cash flow per fully diluted share was also higher than last year at $1.54 per share. Given that the third quarter of net realized Mcfe prices were down 17% from last year's third quarter, these year-over-year increases in cash flow and cash flow per share were the hard-fought result of disciplined growth at low cost. Reported net income for the third quarter of $146 million was almost 8x higher than last year due to a pretax $125 million mark-to-market derivative gain, as our hedges became more valuable with declining prices. Third quarter earnings, calculated using the methodology used by most analysts, which exclude asset sales, mark-to-market hedging entries and various nonrecurring items, was $62 million, 8% higher than last year at $0.37 fully diluted share. As Rodney mentioned earlier, please reference the various reconciliation tables found on the Range website and earnings release for full reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP.","Looking at our cost performance in the third quarter. Total unit costs were down by $0.36. In the case of interest expense, on an Mcfe basis, this expense was not only down year-over-year by 30% or $0.15 per Mcfe, it was also down by approximately $5 million on an absolute basis as well. Another noteworthy third quarter unit cost expense decline was in our DD&A rate, coming in at $1.28 an Mcfe, down 14% from $1.48 figure for Mcfe last year. The decline in DD&A rate continues to signal improved capital efficiency, which helps our cash flow grow faster with less capital. Please reference the third quarter earnings release for additional detailed expense item guidance for the fourth quarter.","The earnings release also contains summary details of our hedge positions on both commodities and basis in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Additionally, detailed hedge volume and price information may be found on our website.","In summary, the third quarter was a solid quarter, with the benefits of low-cost growth outweighing the negatives of significantly lower realized NGL gas and oil prices. Building off of the balance sheet improvements and restructured credit facility, based on current strip prices, we are positioned to finish strong in 2014, with a return to double-digit, quarterly, year-over-year cash flow growth to a company of double-digit production growth.","Chad, over to you.","Chad L. Stephens","Thanks, Roger. First, I'd like to provide a little macro perspective on Appalachian natural gas. Northeast natural gas supply has grown to a current rate of roughly 60.5 Bcf per day. Half of that coming from Southwest Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, and the other half from Northeast Pennsylvania. Most of the recent volume growth has come from the Southwest Pennsylvania region, with Northeast PA supply flattening due to pipeline constraints in that area. Base demand in the overall northeast is approximately 12 to 13 Bcf per day, including summer injection. This seasonal oversupply has had a negative impact on regional Appalachian index prices during the current shoulder period. Index prices in other parts of the country have remained relatively stable. As the current shoulder period ends and winter season demand picks up, northeast regional index prices are expected to improve. The good news is the Midstream industry is bringing relief to the oversupplied Appalachian region. Beginning in mid-2015 through 2018, new announced pipeline takeaway capacity from Appalachia totaling an estimated 31 -- excuse me, 34 Bcf per day and representing over $35 billion of capital investment will provide improved supply\/demand equilibrium, strengthening Appalachian basis differentials and improving net realized prices. Also, beginning in 2015 and growing through 2020, increasing demand, totaling an estimated 15 to 20 Bcf per day, is expected to come from DOE FERC-approved LNG exports, the majority of which is on the Gulf Coast, increasing exports to Mexico, power generation, especially in the Southeast and pet chem industry growth. As we have emphasized in our third quarter earnings release and in our IR presentations, Range's early entry into the Marcellus has allowed us to secure relatively low-cost, firm transportation, the in-service date of which follow our projected annual production growth of 20% to 25%. We want to assure we are not paying for capacity we won't be using. These firm transportation arrangements move our natural gas and natural gas liquids to markets, with strong year-round demand and stable index prices. As mentioned earlier, we're sending our gas to the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast. We believe that there are certain locations on the East Coast as well that have strong demand throughout the year, including the summer, and provide attractive index prices. We will continue to pursue those markets as well.","I will direct you to our earnings release, which provides detail on our corporate gas price basis differential to NYMEX for the third quarter of minus $0.49, which is an improvement over the second quarter. As you know, Range extracts ethane from our wet gas at the MarkWest processing plants. We do this because our ethane sales contracts generate more cash flow for Range then leaving the ethane in the gas stream. For Range, we prefer to optimize cash flow rather than a higher gas price and NGL price per unit.","Alternatively, some of our peers leave their ethane in the gas stream, creating richer gas, and reflect the impact of a richer gas as BTU uplift in their gas price realizations. Again, Range maximizes our cash flow by extracting the ethane from the gas and selling it separately into, by mid-2015, 3 different sales agreements. If you took our current ethane sales proceeds and added it to our total corporate gas production revenue, it would increase our corporate gas price realization by $0.32 for the third quarter. As a result of this, the third quarter corporate differential would be minus $0.17 rather than the minus $0.49 figure reported. We believe this to be the most accurate comparison of peer group gas price realizations.","While in the near term, the Northeast regional oversupply subsides as Midstream industry builds out their announced expansion projects, Range will continue to direct our efforts toward finding the strongest, most stable areas of domestic natural gas demand. We also are expanding our NGL sales efforts to a broader, more global scope, seeking any available arbitrage in international markets.","Back to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You've talked about the increase in your takeaway contracts in detail in your slides over the past couple of months in 2016 versus 2014, but can you talk a bit about 2015 and how those contracts look if we would take away the benefit of Mariner East out of the equation and assume no changes to recent pricing? What you see as the benefits to your margins from the contracts that would be coming on in the next year?","Chad L. Stephens","Yes, Brian, this is Chad. As we've alluded to in the notes, there are other areas of the country where the indexes have remained relatively stable. One of those is in the Midwest. We do have, in 2015, some significant volume coming on to take gas through the Chicago, Michcon area, which is -- that's really the main amount that's coming on in 2015. Again, 2016, we have quite a bit coming on that's going to the Gulf Coast. It's really competitive, and we do have some other deals we're working on with NiSource and TETCO that we really don't want to get into specifically. So I can just say that, that level [ph] in lateral Michcon, Chicago volume that's coming on in 2015 is what we want to talk about.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, and I would just add to it. What Chad had mentioned earlier, we're going to get into winter pricing, assuming we have any kind of normal winter, which some of the weather forecasters are saying we will. So we'll get into winter pricing, which is good in Appalachia and with our contracts. And we get into Mariner East propane in the first quarter of next year of 2015. We get into Mariner East ethane at the middle of the year, and all these things are uplifts. And now we get into the better gas price contracts that Chad mentioned, coupled with just the increased demand with the LNG exports, Cheniere starting up, hopefully, and projected to be on time about this time next year. Plus some of the increased Mexican exports and also -- we think that Range is uniquely positioned with ethane contracts and propane contracts and some things that some of our competitors don't have that will give us an uplift in a stable price environment or steady price environment. But we have some incremental contracts and things coming on as well.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And as a follow-up, switching to the Utica. Your Utica heat map [ph] now focuses more heavily on Southwest PA. If your thesis is correct, how would that change how you think about your capital priorities between Utica -- between drilling the Utica versus the Marcellus within Southwest PA? And how strategic would that change, how strategic your Northeast PA position as to the company?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, let me talk a little bit about -- one of the things we do that you just mentioned is our map before for gas in place or hydrocarbon in place was for Utica\/Point Pleasant. So we stripped it out and showed just the Point Pleasant since that's the real reservoir target, and that's where the more prolific wells are. And we think it's not just about gas in place, but we think there's other things that factor into it. Another key factor other than gas in place is we think the areas of the highest pore pressure and highest geo pressure really relate to where the high-quality gas wells are. And we've outlined that in green on Slide 14. So when you look at where those 2 things coincide, we have a really dominant position in there, of course, where -- there's old Trenton-Black River wells that gives us the ability to map that, and then we've just drilled, and pet logged, and cased our first well, and we're in the process of completing it. Importantly, when you look at our hydrocarbon in place numbers, there's no potential in there right now for Utica\/Point Pleasant. When you look at the acreage map back on Slide 11, in that Southwest -- we have south -- 537,000 acres in Southwest PA on Slide 11. 400,000 of those acres are prospective for Utica\/Point Pleasant. So you can kind of do the math yourself, take the gas in place numbers, times that, and come up with what the resource potential could be. Specifically getting into your question, our strategy is to have that well completed, tested, and if all goes well, announced towards the end of December. We'll put that well online and test it, and we have the capacity and ability to do that. And then we'll offset that well a couple of times with the wells spudding somewhere in the spring of next year, and we'll drill a couple of more wells. And then we'll watch their performance. Then the key is, really, the performance of those wells. Again, strategically, when you go into 2016, even with where prices are, where the strip is today, we still think that we'll be cash flow neutral to a little bit positive in '16, but we think in 2017, '18 and beyond, we throw off a lot of cash. So the Utica gives us optionality. One of the options with increased cash flow is to reinvest in the high rate of return projects and pull some of that value forward and potentially ramp growth in those years. Still living within cash flow but getting higher growth because of the incremental cash flow that we'll have. Another option that it gives us is to the extent the returns are strong, we can start rolling in Utica wells and get even more efficient capital growth. We think there's a lot of efficiencies coming. Another important part, I think, to our acreage position, stepping back away from your question a little bit, is the fact that we own all horizons. So we drill -- as we're drilling the Marcellus and driving up production and driving up cash flow, we're holding everything above and below. So there's no pressure on us to drill. It's a great option that I think will create a lot of value on our stock. Kind of a long-winded answer, but I wanted to -- hopefully, I answered your question and added a little bit to it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Doug, are you on? You may be muted, we can't hear you. Operator, we're not hearing anything on our end from Doug.","Operator","Okay, I'll go on to the next -- next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Say, Jeff, for you or Ray, the first question is, obviously, just -- I was looking at, I guess, the expected wells that come online in the fourth quarter. Certainly, a large number of the wet area in the Marcellus and then, obviously, in the Nora. So I guess, as you look out into 2015, is this an indication of getting kind of the -- indication of, I guess, the direction you're going to go there? Or how do we think about 2015 CapEx directionally?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Let me talk at a high level, and then, Ray, you may want to add to it. What we typically do every year is we -- of course, we have a long-range plan. We've revised that periodically. We present it to our board in December. Upon board approval -- and typically, what we've done is announce it towards the end of January. So our capital budget is not set yet. That being said, I think what you'll see -- and we've talked about it a lot through a number of things like longer laterals and more stages and better targeting and LOE coming down and unit costs coming down, ultimately, land costs coming down, you're going to see the capital efficiency roll through. Roger mentioned, we're already seeing it in the DD&A coming down strongly over time. So we haven't set that yet. Clearly, our budget next year will continue. The value driver will be the Marcellus. And -- but you may see a little bit of incremental capital go towards Nora and\/or a little bit in the Midcontinent. But you're still going to see 90-plus strong percentage of our capital being directed towards the Marcellus with the longer lateral wells. Ray, do you want to comment about some of the wells lateral lines in the fourth quarter and a little bit maybe what you're thinking about for the '15?","Ray N. Walker","Yes, sure. Neal, what -- I think we're -- there is no question, we're striving to drill longer and longer laterals. We see that as really improving our capital efficiency. Our team is learning a lot of technical things about targeting and RCF completions and frac designs. We're making a lot of really great progress from what we think is already a leading position as far as well performance because we do have that core area. I think another thing to point out is the mix of wells, I think, will change from time to time just simply because we have -- remember, we have 1 million net acres. We're developing over 500,000 of that in Southwest PA. We have dry, we have wet, and we have super-rich. When you look at our presentation that the economics of those 3 different areas, you'll see they're all relatively close, something over 100% even at today's -- all of today's prices, today's EBITDAX, transportation costs, everything rolled in as it is. They're all very competitive. So HBP is not really an issue anymore. We've got that taken care of. And what we see going forward is just really a focus on driving up our capital efficiency even to higher levels than we are today. And I think you'll just see that kind of ebb and flow between super-rich, wet and dry as we go and as we build out infrastructure and make all that happen.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Ray, just a follow-up to that. How do the -- sort of the near term differentials play into your thoughts about what to drill? I mean, I was just looking, obviously, where your guidance -- we certainly know that just in the near term, the Northeast PA has a little bit wider differentials until some of your FT and other things come online. How do the differentials sort of play into this in the near term until some of the FT and other arrangements come online?","Ray N. Walker","Well, we look at everything on a real-time basis. So we make real-time capital allocations throughout the year. And when you look at the economics in Northeast PA today, again, with all the basis differentials, with all -- everything that the Northeast PA market is challenged with right now, because our team is doing so well with those wells, our well costs are down below $5 million, and we're making wells that are -- have 90-day production of over 20 million a day. Well, some of the top 10 wells in the Northeast PA, those wells still, on a rate of return basis, compete very favorably, even with the wells in Southwest PA. And of course, in Northeast PA, we have -- everything is HBP-ed up there. We can maintain that area with the 1- to 2-rig program, but that's, again, like Jeff was talking about earlier, as we move into the out years, past 2016, when we go cash flow neutral or slightly positive, we're going to start throwing off lots of cash in the outer years. We see Northeast PA as another area that we can ramp up because we do believe, as Chad was speaking about earlier, the increased takeaway projects, the increased demand, that's -- there's billions of dollars being spent on, we believe all of this is going to allow us a great option to able to accelerate areas going forward. And one of those areas could potentially be Northeast PA.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And Jeff, one last one, if I could. You all mentioned just a large amount of mineral ownership that you all have. Would you think down the line, either '15 or '16, of some sort of monetization around this like one of your peers has done at Perm or? Have you all got any thought to that?","Roger S. Manny","Yes. Neal, this is Roger. I'll take a swing at that one. When you look back 8 years, Range has sold or exchanged over $3 billion worth of assets. So I think we've got a pretty clear history of when we have an asset that we feel is worth more to a different set of shareholders than ours, than we will part with that asset. And I don't -- we don't view this any different view. I think, though, in the case of the Nora royalty, when you look at the low decline underlying that field, I mean, this is an enormously high-quality royalty interest. And I think even as faulty is the valuation might look out there today, I think it's better than most of what's out there. So -- but looking back at our history, we're very reluctant to part with an asset until we know with a high degree of certainty what it's really worth. So for us, the issue isn't so much the front [ph] evaluations that might be out there today. But as Ray was mentioning, the extraordinary improvements that we're seeing in recovery, in production out there, what does that asset going to be worth a year or 2 out. We want to get our arms around that before we make those kind of decisions. I think that's very characteristic of how we've done things in the past and what you'll see us do going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two quick questions, if I may. First of all, on the Nora. I don't know if you touched on -- or at least not to the extent that we wanted to on the deeper opportunity in the Nora. Is this a dry gas play in the deeper -- down the basement that you talked about? Or is there a liquids opportunity? I'm just -- and I'm thinking really more about the premium gas market. How does this impact your capital allocation decisions, particularly as it relates to Northern Marcellus? And I've got a follow-up, please.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, let me take that one. Yes, Nora is really interesting, and Ray mentioned we're doing some fairly low-tech things that are really inexpensive to enhance value of the tight gas sands in CBMs and having great success right out of the box. I think we're 10 for 10 or 12 for 12. But it's interesting, there's potential, deeper potential. Some of that deeper potential is in the Devonian section, literally. I mean, by deep, I mean, we're talking 5,500 feet. But there are other horizons as you go below that. According to our exploration, and we'll see over time, some of the upside or optionality is, even though the southern part of the Appalachian basin is subnormally pressured, our explorationists think as you drill deeper, and remember, deeper may be, ultimately, basement. We're not sure where basement is, which is really exciting. It may be 11,000 12,000, 13,000 feet because nobody's ever drilled that deep. There's only -- the deepest -- most of the well stop at 4,000. Some at the 5,500. There's a couple of wells, one goes to 7,000 and one goes to 7,500. But they're old wells, old technology. No 3D seismic and just a couple of old 2D [ph] lines. Our explorationists feel as you go deeper, you actually break back in to normal pressure, and then potentially, geopressure, which is exciting. And they also think some of those horizons, as you go deeper, may contain liquids or wet gas. Well, we'll see with time. The nice part about it is we have 475,000 acres that are basically unexplored deep. Again, deep, being below 5,500 feet, which isn't really that deep in most parts of the U.S. So we have that potential. We own 475,000 acres, 100% working interest and most of 100% net revenue interest. And we totally control the timing. So what you'll see us do in the short run is experiment with some of these completion techniques, which really is just running a higher strength pipe so we can pump at a higher pressure, pump at higher rates, pump bigger fracs and better stimulate the wells. And there, it's fairly inexpensive, and we're seeing, on average, almost double the rates for an incremental cost of, call it, $15,000. So long-winded answer again, but I think there is the potential for higher pressure as we go deeper and there is the potential for liquids.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Jeff, just -- again, this is obviously arguably a better gas market than your Northern Marcellus. So I guess you're just running minimum activity there any way to hold acreage. But how does it stack up in terms of the overall portfolio, as almost like a diversification play if you like, now that you own the whole thing?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, and we have in the book and there's some slides in there, and Ray talked about it last time. We're just flipping through the slides. On Slide 19, you can see the returns in the -- under various gas prices in the southwest part of the Marcellus, depending on price you use and where you are. Anywhere between about 90% to 120% rate of return. You've got strong returns in the Northern Marcellus there in that -- really in that same range. And then when you flip to the Appalachian slides that we have in there, on Slides, really, 31 -- Slides 30 and 31, we're saying the returns of some of those projects are also up to 100%. So they're all strong returns. The one area that you'll see us focus on drilling again in the short run is the Southwest Marcellus in that that's the only area where, ultimately, we need to drill to hold all the production. To make it really clear, with the leases we have and the drilling plans we have, we'll hold all that acreage within the existing lease terms that we have. So there's no concern over losing it. But we need to drill it to hold it. So you'll see us focus our activity down there. It also happens to be where we have some of the highest returns, and it also happens to be where we have the flexibility of wet, dry and super-rich, plus we have all the stacked pay potential and information that we gather as we drill those wells. But in time, I think there's a great upside in the Nora. When you look at that area, we're making roughly 100 million per day. I think with what we've identified, I think we have the potential to drive it to greater than 500 million per day, with stuff that's already on the books, 500 million could become 700 million. You throw a little bit upside in, and I think there's great potential if we have some exploration success and stuff down in that part of the basin. And it's near good gas markets.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I don't want to labor the point, but can you put a time line on that? Because, actually, what I'm trying to get at is how quickly do you think you...","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes. I think, what I mean, -- we have it again. We'll present our budget to the board in December because of the fact that we didn't have a JOA with EQT down under. And most areas, you do have a JOA. We couldn't spend capital. So really, capital allocation in Nora has been close to 0. And with last year, I think we had allocated -- or this year $20 million roughly. So we haven't set our budget yet. I think for next year, $20 million may become $50 million, something like that, $40 million, $50 million, $60 million. We haven't set it yet. The year after that, it may become something like $100 million, again, all subject to board approval. And then $100 million may become $200 million. And you'll see that ramp kind of in that time frame. And as we do that, we'll unlock what we believe is great value or out-of-the-box, I think, we're off to a strong start in enhancing the value. And then we can decide that ultimate ramp and how to ultimately maximize the value even from a financial perspective.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Jeff, I don't want to take out too much time here, but I've got a very quick follow-up, if I may. Just real quick. You've been very good about optimizing capital. When I look at the stock that you mentioned there, I just kind of wonder, when you start talking about Utica, Devonian and Marcellus, all in the same kind of area, what can you do to reduce your surface footprint? I'm thinking about is there a multi-stock gradual opportunity somewhere down the line? Or is it still too early to think about that?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, I think one advantage, as Ray pointed out, is we can put a lot of wells on those pads in excess of 20 wells on the pad and to whatever horizon we want. So then you get the ability utilizing the same pads and roads and a lot of the other infrastructure. So there -- but I think you're right with time, having stacked pay like that, there's kind of a free auction of technology in the future of stacked laterals. And clearly, you can drill stacked laterals right now. And then, I'm sure, with time, ultimately, we may be able to drill stacked laterals and effectively stimulate them. So there's a nice upside to what technology can bring. And there's a big advantage to having all those horizons on top of one another, let alone scattered out across different parts of the country.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Regarding the new completion techniques and the completion designs, I heard what you said on Nora. I also heard what you said on longer laterals and better targeting. But what design changes do you think are having the most impact? And what are some of the new techniques that you're trying? And can you talk about the differentiation by area?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Ray, do you want to take that one?","Ray N. Walker","Sure. I'll start with Nora. And like Jeff alluded to, really, what it amounted to there is, in the past, a lot of those wells were -- completed limited entry where you put a limited amount of perforations in a lot of different layers and try to accomplish the stimulation with one frac job. Essentially, what we're doing today, by running, investing a little more money in constructing the well with higher strength casing, we can pump at higher rates and higher pressures and allow us to pump more fluid at higher fracture pressures down hole, so to speak. You create more near wellbore complexity and fractures, which, therefore, yields more production. And that's been highly successful at this point. Again, we're early, but like Jeff said, I think we're 10 for 10 or 12 for 12. And some of the best results we've seen in 10 or 15 years, both in the tight gas vertical and the CBM. I think there's a huge potential for us to study and model that further and look at different types of frac designs, different volumes and a lot of things there. Like Jeff said for a number of years, we've not really spent much money there, and we just have really done a lot other than just maintenance type work. So we're pretty excited about that. Shifting to the Marcellus, we're doing a lot of the things. We're just continuing to refine and do a lot of the things that we've been doing all along. And you've seen us, year after year, continue to update our EURs. Our type curves continue to look better. Our results on a normalized per foot of lateral basis have been very consistent. And we think there's still a lot of work to do as we continue to refine our targeting techniques, we continue to define the spacing between our RCS completions and perforation clusters and different types of profit designs or some of things that we're working on, the profit loading, liquid loading that we're pumping into these wells. So a lot of that stuff is continuing on with what we've been doing in the past, and you've seen us just continue to get better and better results. I'm really proud of our technical team there, and my hats off to them continually because they just continue to make better and better wells, I mean, some of the wells I've talked about in my remarks. When you've got 4 out of 5 wells making close to 1,000 barrels of condensate per day, I mean, that's a tremendous fracture conductivity down hole. And we're really excited about what that means going forward. And we've seen just in the last couple of quarters some of the best wells we've ever done. And we're pretty excited about that and how we use that information going forward. So again, we're just continuing to capture that data, model it, understand it and continue to refine that going forward. And I think we -- like we talked about a lot of times in the past, I still think we're in the third or maybe fourth inning of the baseball game. We've got large core area there with a lot of diversity being super-rich, wet and dry. And I think there's no one pat answer for any one specific area. And I think as our team has learned to identify those things, which makes the best wells, I think we're just going to -- you're going to continue to see our capital efficiency get better and better.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","The only thing I'd add to what Ray said is we're in that maybe third inning of the Marcellus or so. And the Point Pleasant in Washington County, we have first batter up. So we're excited about the first batter.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And Ray, do you think we're in the third or fourth inning in terms of the technological leaps? Or do you think we're in the third or fourth inning in terms of the application across your acreage?","Ray N. Walker","I think it's -- mostly both is the way I would characterize it. I think there's some technological breakthroughs that are being looked at in a lot of different areas, whether it's modeling, whether it's frac design or just pure operations. Even in the well construction side of things, like Jeff referred to, being able to drill stacked laterals or even opposing laterals out of a single vertical wellbore, I think there's some major technological breakthroughs that will happen in the next, I think 3 years or 7 years out, but some of it exists and some of it is just not commercially applicable in our situation yet. But I think those things will happen. And when they do, it'll be a major step change. And none of that is built into our long-range plan, and I think that those kind of things are just going to be more upside for us going forward.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","But I would -- I agree with Ray, but what I would add, though is, again, what's really important is to be in the core part of the play, whether it's in Marcellus or any play. So you want to be in the core and about -- on average, about 10% of the acreage is core. And then it's important when you compare cores of the various plays. And the advantage that the Marcellus had is its higher-quality rock versus some of the other plays in other parts of the country. The big technology increases will really impact people in those areas. What you want to have is acreage in the core with high-quality rock, a lot of hydrocarbon in place. And then using high-quality teams, tighter spacing, new technology and better completion and drilling techniques to just keep driving up recovery factors. And I think we're in that position.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then are you convinced that you're getting increased EURs versus just bringing production forward?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes.","Ray N. Walker","Yes.","Alan W. Farquharson","Yes.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And the third yes was Alan Farquharson, our Senior Reservoir Engineer. If you heard 3 yeses on the call, so...","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I did. And I could say I got that confirmation. And then just quickly, in your Northeast PA, could you just remind us of your takeaway situation there? And is that also -- are you in good shape there, keeping up with production growth? And also talk about any asset, the after-sale right now or in the near future.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, let me just say it at a high level, and then I think we'll probably take one more question. And then we're already running over a little bit. I don't want to run over it too long. The marketing team's done a really good job. We have a long-range plan, which is important part. We have really well-integrated team, everybody from all the engineering, geology, marketing, finance, midstream, all the different pieces. So the plans that we have, long range for that acreage, the marketing team's done a good job of varying the takeaway to good markets for that team as well. So I think in terms of takeaway out of there, I think we're in pretty good shape.","Operator","Nearing the end of today's conference, we will go to Dan McSpirit of BMO Capital Markets.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I have several questions, but will limit it to one and one that's maybe more philosophic. If you speak to an improving supply\/demand balance in today's press release or yesterday's press release, what are the chief risks to that outlook, whether on the supply or demand side of the equation? I asked to not only get your view of the world but determine whether producers in the basin that are less well positioned have really felt maximum pain?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, let me start at the high level and then turn it over to Chad, and then there may be others on our team that want to talk about it. But I think the good news when you look on the demand side is -- there's a number of analysts out there, and I won't quote them, but there's a lot of people that show incremental gas demand, plus or minus 20 Bcf per day. Some people are saying 2018, 2019, 2020. I think on the high side, the University of Texas had 25 Bcf of incremental demand. And it comes from a number of things. So I think on the LNG side, again, Cheniere, the first project, everything that I hear is on time. And the second and third trains, they'll start in '16. All of that is on time, and it should happen. So I think the LNG stuff in the U.S. is important. I think gas is a superior fuel to coal. So in terms of -- gas has been displacing coal from power generation with time. I think that'll continue as well. Billions are being spent on the petrochemical side to convert the feedstock from an oil-based feedstock to a gas-based feedstock. So I think that'll happen. And slowly but surely, you're seeing transportation occur. So I think the demand is coming, the demand is coming timely, plus there's exports to Mexico. So I think those things will happen. On the supply side, again, I think most of the plays -- the core parts of the plays are about 10%. Our teams have looked at all the plays around the country. They range from a low of 6% being core to a high of 17%, according to our team, with an average of 10%, which means 90% is non-core. If you look at a lot of the non-core stuff, it's not going to get drilled in the next 20 years or 30 years. I don't think. I think it's way out there. So I think, ultimately, as that shakes out, there's help there. And then the other piece is the infrastructure build-out, and we have a slide in there in our presentation that addresses infrastructure build-out, and it's on Slide 22. And we think, in the Appalachian Basin, that occurs at about 2016. So I think all that stuff works out. And once it does work out, then it's where's the low-cost gas. The other thing that low-cost gas has done, it's not only going to be exported, but it's displacing coal for power generation. It's displacing oil, the feedstock for petrochemical. Displacing a little bit of oil to feedstock for transportation. The other thing low-cost Marcellus gas is doing is displacing high-cost gas in plays like the Haynesville and Barnett and Woodford and other areas where you've seen the rig counts come down and the production from those fields come off significantly. So I think all of those things are happening. Back to your question about maximum pain, I think, again, our team has done a good job, the marketing team working with the operations team to make sure that we can move our gas between now and then. I think companies that haven't done that maybe haven't felt maximum pain. But I think it's another competitive advantage and another differentiation for Range. So anybody else on our team want to add to what I said? Or did I...","Chad L. Stephens","It's Chad. I couldn't have answered any better, but I will say that where commodity prices are right now, we know the demand is coming. It's just a matter of when will it come and at what levels. So with that being said, you got to look at the curve and see at what price are you able to drill and deliver the supply to meet that demand. So you'll see the curve play out as that demand -- as the market starts seeing that demand take traction between the LNG exports, power gen in the Southeast, Mexican exports, we're displacing gas from Canada. It's happening. It's just a matter of exactly when the markets will see it coming, at what price to be able to supply that demand.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes. And again, I think it's not that far out there, weather clearly plays an issue. I read something from AccuWeather that, hopefully, it's snowing in parts of the country on Halloween or at least raining and cold. So that's -- from our perspective, it's a good thing. I feel bad for some of the kids trick-or-treating, but that's helpful in the short run. And then it's back to differentiation for Range. We have that firm transportation and supply to bridge us through those harder periods, Dan, that you mentioned. And then in addition, we have contracts that none of our competitors have in terms of some of the liquids, which give us an uplift starting in the first quarter of '15, not that far out. Plus the weather, if we get any normal winter, though. It's not that far out. And then, again, it's an advantage for us so...","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Okay. I'll conclude on the same themes I discussed in my opening comments. Fundamentally, we believe that Range is a simple story. Range has the largest acreage position in the core to play, largely in the stacked pay area in Southwest Pennsylvania. We have the wells identified, the field infrastructure being built and the necessary takeaway capacity contracted to grow 20% to 25% each year to triple our current production to 3 Bcfe per day and beyond. The acreage position largely covers the most perspective liquids resources in the basin, with necessary transport and export facilities being built to handle our multiyear growth.","We want to thank our shareholders for their support. We believe that Range will be a leader in building shareholder value. Thanks for participating on the call.

Our exit rate for the Marcellus should be 600 million cubic feet equivalent per day or greater. Our liquids production growth target was delayed to permitting issues. However, we expect for the fourth quarter that liquids growth will be 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2011.","On the costs side, our teams are doing an excellent job and costs are coming in better than expectations. LOE per Mcfe continues to decline dramatically from $0.60 per Mcfe in 2011 to $0.48 in the first quarter of 2012 and $0.40 in the second quarter of 2012. Our total cash cost per Mcfe is also following the same downward trend from $2.61 in 2011 to $2.50 in the first quarter of 2012 and finally, to $2.38 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2012.","Our DD&A per Mcfe has also been reduced from $1.80 per Mcfe in 2011 to $1.67 in the first 6 months of 2012. These are both very impressive numbers and a very impressive trend. Our teams are also making important progress on the marketing side of our business. We continue to negotiate on the third ethane solution and we believe we are close to finalizing the deal. In addition, we're well-hedged for the remainder of 2012 and '13 for all 3 products, gas, oil and natural gas liquids. The details of our hedge position are listed on our website. This includes how we've hedged both the light and heavy end of the NGL barrel.","As we continue to focus on optimizing our portfolio we have engaged RBC Richardson and Barr to market our Ardmore Basin Woodford properties. We have about 9,300 net acres of liquids-rich Woodford properties that are currently producing about 12.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day, of which about 54% is liquids. Our Ardmore Basin Woodford properties are high quality properties. However, our current focus in the midcontinent is on our horizontal Mississipian play where we are achieving outstanding results. The position we have in the horizontal Mississippian consists of 152,000 net acres and therefore has much greater upside per share.","In addition, although the rate of return in the Ardmore Woodford is very good, the rate of return in our horizontal Mississippian play is even better. The decision to market the Ardmore Woodford properties, assuming we find a buyer that recognizes the value in these properties, both increases our focus and fast-forwards the value we would have received from these properties. The results we're achieving in the horizontal Mississippian play continue to improve and impress. The average result of our 2012 drilling program is significantly better than our first 8 wells. You can view the 2012 curve as compared to the first 8 wells on a slide included in our current IR presentation on our website.","Also during the second quarter, we drilled our first horizontal Mississippian well in excess of 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Its peak 24 hour rate was 1,363 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The liquids portion of this rate was 1,122 barrels per day comprised of 782 barrels of oil per day and 340 barrels of natural gas liquids per day.","We're also making good progress in the super-rich and wet areas in the Southwest portion of the Marcellus along with the dry gas portion of Northeast Pennsylvania. In particular, we just recently completed a new well in the super-rich area that flowed at a rate of 5.7 million cubic feet of gas per day and 1,000 barrels of liquids per day, of which 55% is condensate. Ray will discuss these areas in more detail and he'll also update you on our first 2 Upper Devonian wells in the superrich area in Southwest Pennsylvania.","In addition, we're currently drilling our first Utica well in Northwest Pennsylvania and started drilling our next series of Cline Shale and Wolfberry wells in West Texas.","There's one other area that I especially want to mention. To date we've given you production plots for the dry gas area in Northeast Pennsylvania and the wet and super-rich areas of Southwest Pennsylvania. In our IR presentation on our website, it states that we have 570,000 net acres in Southwest Pennsylvania. We believe approximately 335,000 net acres here are perspective for wet or super-rich Marcellus and 235,000 net acres are perspective for dry gas. We haven't talked much about this significant dry gas position, but recently, we drilled and brought online 2 pads that are just on either side of the wet dry line of 1,050 Btu gas. One is just on the dry side and has 1,040 Btu gas. This dry gas pad has 5 wells that average 14 million cubic feet per day per well for an average initial 24-hour rate to sell, and it appears the reserves for these wells will average 7 to 8 BCF each.","The other Pad is just over the wet dry line and has a Btu content of 1,065. This 10-well pad has an average IP of 13.7 million per day for its initial 24-hour rate to sale and also appears to have average reserves of 7 to 8 BCF per well. These 2 pads are about 35 miles apart. My point is that we've tested over a dozen wells on the edge of the dry side of our acreage in Southwest Pennsylvania and we believe the quality of these wells is excellent.","Our teams continue to deliver outstanding results in the field. Financially, Roger and his team are very disciplined and focused on maintaining our liquidity and strong financial position in order to run the business. Our hedges are a key component of our strong financial position, which allows us to execute our capital program as planned, keeping Range financially strong while we grow reserves and production per share will always be a key principle of our business plan.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.","Ray N. Walker","Thanks, Jeff. Today I'm going to talk about production, efficiency improvements and give some additional highlights on our activity.","Let me start with production. We exceeded our second quarter production guidance, coming in well above guidance on gas and oil but lower-than-expected NGL production. The lower NGL growth was primarily due to permitting delays for pipelines and string crossings in Pennsylvania. The good news is these permitting issues have been resolved by overcoming the residual impacts of the policies that were left over from the previous administration. We give a lot of credit to DEP leadership in Harrisburg for recognizing and then resolving these issues. We can now plan more effectively and we do not anticipate these permitting delays in the future. As a result, we fully expect to see substantial growth going forward as those delayed pads begin to come online. By the end of this year, we expect to reach 40% liquids growth when comparing the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011. Because of the delays, we will not hit our 40% full year over full year target, but we are back on track for impressive quarterly liquids growth.","Guidance for the third quarter production will be 773 to 778 million cubic feet equivalent per day comprised of NGLs at 18,300 to 18,600 barrels per day, oil at 7,600 to 7,800 barrels per day and gas at 618 million to 620 million cubic feet per day.","In addition to our record production, another key story I want to tell is how we're significantly improving efficiencies and costs while delivering better well results all across the company. Let me give you just a few of the many examples that we're seeing. In the Southern Marcellus, we've seen a 23% decrease in cost per foot drilled while drilling 22% longer laterals in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter. Also in the Southern Marcellus during the same timeframe, while pumping the same size jobs we've seen the completions teams perform 22% more frac stages while at the same time introducing initiatives that we expect will reduce completion capital for the remainder of this year by over $4 million. In the Northern Marcellus, drilling cost per foot has decreased by 21% from quarter 1 to quarter 2 and we've seen a 25% decrease in completion cost per stage by optimizing our completion designs.","In our Midcontinent, the division in the horizontal Mississippian, we've seen a 25% decrease in drilling days, allowing us to effectively double the length of our laterals and increase the number of frac stages with a very modest cost increase. I'll give you more of those details in a few minutes.","In our Permian division, we drilled 3 Wolfberry wells and have already seen a 24% reduction in total well cost. In Virginia, from 2011 to 2012, we've seen an 11% improvement in total well cost while drilling and completing 13% longer laterals in 26% less drilling days. We also continue to make great progress in our safety program. Our total recordable instant rate is 51% below our peer group and our lost time incidents are 35% below the peer group average. While we continue to strive for 0 incidents, we are really proud of our team and their focus on safety and environmental protection. That culture will play a paramount role in keeping us performing at a high-level while remaining a low cost and high rate of return producer.","Now let me highlight some of the results that we're seeing across the company. Please refer to our press release as we list the results of some really great wells. I'm not going to repeat those results in my remarks here, but they are certainly noteworthy and some great wells that we are really proud of. Also, please refer to the new presentation on the website as we have specific details in there for all of our projects.","In the super-rich Marcellus, we had a really nice well recently tested at 5.7 million gas and 1,000 barrels of liquids excluding ethane. We have now brought online 11 wells in the wet and super-rich area this year at over 500 barrels per day of liquids, not including ethane extraction. The super-rich and wet Marcellus continues to deliver excellent results. Jeff highlighted some very impressive dry gas well results, which give us a confirmation of the potential reserves for the 235,000 dry gas acres that we have in Southwest PA.","In the Northern Marcellus, we're continuing to see outstanding results with good economics, also confirming the significant resource in place there.","The Marcellus has proven to be a great asset across our entire position with class leading rates of return and tremendous resource potential. The horizontal Mississippian oil play likewise is progressing very well. Our team there is optimizing quickly. We're now drilling and completing approximately 4,000-foot laterals with more stages and making better wells, while seeing only a modest increase in total well cost to around 3.2 million, which is excluding the saltwater disposal. And we fully expect that those costs will come down even more as we get more wells under our belt.","As shown in our new corporate presentation, our 2012 wells are performing significantly better than our previous wells, and although early, we believe that could be as much as 600,000 BOE wells. That would mean a 25% improvement in well performance with a very modest 10% increase in costs. This is amazing progress in only 6 wells.","The team is continuing to optimize midstream and power infrastructure along with implementing improved saltwater disposal, production designs and operations. We believe our team can continue to produce these wells at very low operating costs compared to the more traditional designs, and we're already recognizing significant benefits in costs and efficiencies.","In the first super-rich Upper Devonian Shale well, we confirm the 300-foot section with a similar volume of hydrocarbons in place as compared to the super-rich Marcellus. Given the thickness of this interval, which is 3x thicker than the Marcellus, and understanding that the shale is in multiple layers, where to land a lateral in the section is complicated. The first well tested at a 24-hour rate of 1.9 million equivalent per day, which was composed of 1.3 million gas and 116 barrels of liquids from a 3,300-foot lateral with 16 stages.","Now let me put this in perspective. These results although less than we hoped to see, are significantly better than the first 4 horizontal wells that we drilled back in the Marcellus in 2006 and 2007. We learned early on in the Marcellus that targeting was important. And it took more than a few wells to figure that out and in fact, we are still optimizing our targeting in the Marcellus even today.","From an appraisal standpoint, we are pleased with the data we've gathered from the Upper Devonian and the super-rich area. Mug log data indicates excellent gas shales, some of which are the best we've seen in the Upper Devonian section today. Log data shows substantial porosity and permeability, analysis of core intervals has documented large pore development in each of the key shale members, therefore validating excellent porosity and permeability development.","Using what we've learned from the first well and analyzing all the data and diagnostics from both wells, we believe we have a better target interval in the second well. We've also optimized our lateral length and adjusted our completion design based on what we learned. We're now completing that second well and hope to be ready to discuss those results at our next conference call.","Our first wet Utica well in Northwest PA is underway, and we still plan to spud a second test well in about October. We continue to monitor industry activity in the area and believe by the end of this year, we'll know a lot more about the potential of the wet Utica in our 190,000 net acres.","In our Conger Field properties we've drilled 1 Wolfberry well which is being completed as we speak and we're drilling our third Cline Shale horizontal as we speak. Please take a look at the updated of Wolfberry economics in our presentation and as we've seen improved well performance as well as good cost reductions. Our Cline shale EUR average of the 2 producing wells is 340,000 BOE, and we've also updated those economics in our presentation. Plans are to drill 4 more Wolfberry wells and maybe one more Cline Shale well this year. We also see lots of offset activity in this area and are monitoring that activity as well.","As you can tell, I'm really proud of our operating and technical teams. They continue to execute, innovate and improve efficiencies. Cost and well performance are steadily improving while working safely in protecting the environment. We're able to do more with less while getting better at what we do and we have some great rate of return projects. All of that combined should enable us to meet our production goals and grow at very attractive returns for many years to come.","Now over to Roger.","Roger S. Manny","Thanks, Ray. Like last quarter there are significant positive developments to discuss on both the income statement and balance sheet. The big income statement story is our continued progress in reducing operating and overhead costs without sacrificing per share growth in production and reserves. This was a great quarter where most of the recurring cost items all came in at or below guidance, and in some cases, significantly below guidance.","Leading off with direct operating cost, the operating teams exceeded all expectations, with direct operating costs, including workovers, coming in at $0.40 per mcfe, that's $0.25 per mcfe below last year due to reduced water handling, equipment rental and well service expense. To help put this in perspective, on an absolute dollar basis, we spent $3.7 million less in direct operating expense during the second quarter this year compared to last year on 42% higher production volume. You're now seeing the benefits of focused growth from a continually high-graded asset base by employee shareholders who understand what is required of them in a low price environment.","As we had additional oil and liquids rich production the rest of the year, absolute operating costs are expected to increase slightly with production and unit costs will likely also increase slightly. Next quarter, we believe we will see operating expense in the range from $0.42 to $0.44 in Mcfe.","Third party transportation gathering and compression expense for the second quarter was $0.68 per mcfe, the same as the first quarter this year and $0.02 higher than the second quarter last year. We anticipate this expense to decline slightly on higher volume next quarter to between $0.63 and $0.65.","Second quarter DD&A rate was $1.66 per Mcfe, slightly below guidance and $0.03 lower than the second quarter of last year due to changes in production mix and the Barnett assets held as discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2011. The steadily declining DD&A rate is further evidence of improving capital efficiency. We project DD&A next quarter to hover in the $1.66 to $1.68 range, again depending on production mix.","Our listeners may recall that the way we're handling the new Pennsylvania impact fee guidance is to provide a specific absolute dollar quarterly estimate for the impact fee plus a quarterly production tax estimate for non-Pennsylvania production on a unit cost basis spread across total company production. The second quarter Pennsylvania impact fee was $7 million and production taxes on the non-Pennsylvania production reflecting lower on gas prices totaled $0.07 per Mcfe. For the third quarter, we expect the impact fee to be $6 million plus $0.10 per mcfe on total company production as we bring on more production in higher tax rate areas.","Second quarter G&A expense, adjusted for noncash stock comp and other nonrecurring items, was $0.47, $0.12 below last year and $0.03 below the first quarter of this year. The decrease in year-over-year unit cost G&A expense is due to lower legal fees and lower unit cost, salary and benefit expense. Third quarter G&A expense per Mcfe is projected to be $0.46 to $0.47.","Interest expense for the second quarter was $0.66 per Mcfe, $0.10 below last year's second quarter figure, with higher borrowing levels at slightly lower rates spread across higher production volumes. Exploration expense, excluding noncash comp in the second quarter, was $15 million, $4 million higher than the second quarter of last year due to higher seismic expenditures. We have additional seismic expense coming through in the last half of this year, making our best estimate for third quarter exploration expense approximately $20 million.","The second quarter impairment on unproved properties was $44 million. Of this amount, $21 million was the ordinary calculated quarterly impairment expense and $23 million was a special provision attributed to an acreage high-grading transaction. In this transaction, we exchange our drilling rights and obligations on some non-strategic Marcellus acreage for Marcellus acreage in a high-quality derisked area where we're actively drilling. The net result was in our view a smaller number of higher quality acres. Next quarter, we expect unproved property impairment to be back in the range of $20 million to $22 million.","Cash flow for the second quarter was $156 million. That's $12 million below the second quarter of last year. On a fully-diluted share basis, cash flow was $0.97, $0.02 above analyst consensus estimates. EBITDAX for the second quarter was $196 million, $5 million lower than the second quarter of last year. Cash margin for the quarter was $2.34 per Mcfe, and earnings, calculated using analyst methodology, were $18 million or $0.11 a share. That's $0.06 above the analyst consensus estimate, thanks to lower cost.","As Rodney mentioned, our website contains a full reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP in addition to updated hedging schedules and other useful investor information.","Turning briefly to the balance sheet, we began to draw upon our $1.75 billion credit facility in the second quarter to help fund the frontloaded 2012 capital program. At the end of the second quarter, we have 141 operated wells awaiting pipeline connection or completion. The capital spent on these wells approximates 1\/3 of our total annual capital budget. Spending 1\/3 of the frontloaded 2012 budget with no contribution to year-to-date production or cash flow, when combined with realized prices has taken our debt to EBITDAX ratio to 3x, a bit earlier in the year than you might have expected. And we remain comfortable with our leverage hovering around the 3x EBITDAX level, thanks to our high return plays, low cost structure, long reserve life, operating control of our growth assets and our favorable hedge position. However, as has been our practice, when our leverage exceeds the 3x level as it did before the Barnett sale in 2011, we will advise you as to how we intend to manage the leverage going forward. And as Jeff mentioned, we have commenced the marketing process for our Ardmore Basin Woodford shale properties, which when completed as we expect will help manage our leverage. Plus the same time fast forward net present value. EBITDAX should grow as completed already paid for wells are turned to sales and the combination of asset sales and higher EBITDAX should help bring the leverage ratio down toward the end of the year.","Looking at our hedges for a moment. Range has continued to build upon its hedge position during the quarter by adding new hedges in 2012, 2013 and 2014. For the remainder of this year we have more than 80% of our projected gas production hedged at a floor price of $4.18 in an MMBtu approximately 60% of our NGLs hedged at above market prices and approximately 80% of our projected oil production hedged at a floor price of $91.19 a barrel. Please reference the hedging schedules on the Range website for the new and existing hedge volumes and prices.","In summary, the second quarter demonstrates the commitment of all Range employee shareholders to meet the challenge of lower product prices by reducing an already low cost structure while still producing double-digit per share growth in reserves and production.","Jeff, I'll turn it back to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Dave Kistler of Simmons and Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly on the comments about leverage that Roger made. As you start to look towards '13, in the past you've highlighted you can live within cash flow and deliver maybe 15% to 20% production growth. However, it seems like there is a willingness to go outside of cash flow. Should we be looking at that leverage metric to determine how far you guys would go outside in '13 or could there be a decision to start living within cash flow by '13? Any kind of color you can give us there would be great.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","This is Jeff. Let me start and then Roger will add his comments on at the end. So let me put it in context. Back to this year, we're taken it to a really high level. Our strategy is to stay focused on growing reserves and production per share within some of the highest rate of return and lowest cost plays out there. This year, we're looking at 35% growth outspending cash flow, and what most people would recognize are 2 of the best plays if not the best plays in the industry, the Marcellus particularly the wet part and the horizontal Mississippian oil play. So next year, and we won't set our budgets until later this year, but we're obviously we're working ahead and we're planning ahead. And we said it earlier this year, we have the opportunity if we choose to do so to live within cash flow and still grow 15% to 20%. And we believe we can still do that. So it sort of brackets off a couple of different slots here for where we are this year. If we choose to do that next year, we have that ability. But let me put that in context. I want to talk about it in a number of ways. One, another advantage of Range is we control or operate almost every area we have with the single exception really of Nora. So outside of Nora, we operate typically with a higher working interest or 100%. So we really have the ability even if we choose to live within cash flow next year, something close to cash flow to really shape our growth to what prices ultimately do in order to capture NAV. We have the ability and we have great operating teams led by Ray that can ramp up quickly if we choose to do so and capture NAV. If we keep spending down for a year, a year or 2 or a year, we have the ability to ramp up significantly and you can see this year what the quality of the portfolio can do. I think another key thing to really look at to is when you look at and if you go up to the 100,000-foot level and you look at the various plays that are out there, if we were strictly focused on maximizing growth in all these plays, the highest growth areas are the dry gas parts versus the liquid rich parts. And they're typically the thickest, gassiest highest pressure parts whether it's the Barnett Shale, the Marcellus or Haynesville, you pick it. So those are where you get the best growth. And what's really impressive is if you look at the quality of some of our gas properties that we've talked about, literally if we were only focused on growth, and we aren't, we're focused on rate of return and we're focused on a lot of other things, but if we only focus on growth what we would do is direct 100% of our drilling into the dry gas areas; and rather than growing within cash flow at 15% to 20%, theoretically you could probably double that, probably be 30% to 40% or where we are today. But importantly, what Range is, is really focused on maximizing rate of return. And given today that oil prices are high and gas prices are low, in order to maximize rate of return, what we're doing is focusing on liquids. In fact you can see us we're dropping rigs in the dry gas areas and focusing predominantly in the wetter, super-rich part of the Marcellus or horizontal Mississippian play. But I think a really key part, again bringing it back to Range, is Range is in a great position. We have great potential in both oil and gas. Just in the Marcellus alone, we have -- we talked about what we have in the wet and super-rich part. But if you look at the dry gas part in the Southwest, there's 235,000 acres plus another 180,000 in the Northeast. So we have 415,000 acres of dry potential in the Marcellus alone. And then if you look at the super-rich and wet combined just in the Marcellus that's 335,000 acres. We've got tremendous running room with really strong rate of return both ways with the ability and flexibility to direct our capital off into the future including the rate of production growth, plus we have 152,000 net acres in the horizontal Mississippian. So I'm reaffirming that we have the ability to do that if we choose to do so. We'll continue to work it through the end of the year. We'll look at the results of our projects. We'll put together a plan that we think optimizes value for our shareholders based on our core values of growth in reserves per share, production per share, both at adjusted rate of return, holding acreage, all those considerations, and we'll present that to our board in December. And typically, we've come out with our 2013 plans early in -- early in the 2013, whether we accelerate that a little bit and do it right at the end of this year or early next year like in previous years, we'll decide later this year. But Range is in great shape. We've got high rate of return projects in multiple areas. And what we're trying to do is just frac it off a little bit with some of the flexibility that we have. But let me turn it over to Roger to discuss further.","Roger S. Manny","Yes, just to comment on the leverage. I mean clearly the leverage in 2013 is going to be a function of where we set the drilling throttle and where oil and gas and liquids prices are as that -- going into next year. And since we haven't set the drilling throttle yet and we don't know where prices are going to be, it's a little hard to predict where the leverage is going to be. But we have committed to keep the balance sheet strong and that's what we're going to do. And as I mentioned, when the leverage gets in that 3x range while we're fairly comfortable in that range because of all the factors that I'd mentioned earlier in my remarks, we are going to tell you what we intend to do to manage it going forward. And in this case, that asset sale is a big part of that. So we'll see how the asset sale goes later this year. Then we'll see where the drilling throttle needs to be set. And then leverage will be somewhat of a byproduct of that. But when you look at the EBITDAX build that results from bringing these wells that aren't on production yet on production, that EBITDAX build will help to bring leverage down as well along with the asset sales. So we're very comfortable with the leverage where it is presently.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great, I appreciate that color. And then maybe just one follow on, the Mississippian results that you kind of outlined both in your release and then in presentation on the longer laterals generating over kind of 100% rates of return at the current strip, it would seem to me it would make sense to be redirecting activity there than many of the other plays just from a rates return comment that you guys both made. Can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on that? Does that encourage you to buy more acreage? You added another 7,000 acres, but as -- should we look at this as becoming a much bigger part of the portfolio on a longer-term basis?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","This is Jeff. Let me start again and then Ray will probably add a little more color but yes, I think the key thing is to look at the position we've built. And you can go through some simple back of the envelope math that I've done with several of you at conferences. And that could be 1 billion to 2 billion barrels type of resource potential on upside. It's huge, particularly for a company our size coming with rates of return that you mentioned. So what you're seeing is we'll be increasing activity there. And we think it's a great play. We got a great team up in Oklahoma City that manages it. We've been in that area since 2004. So we've got infrastructure, office, good local knowledge. But I think what you'll see as we continue to drill and assuming continued success, which I believe we'll have, you'll see us ramp up activity throughout this year. And we haven't again -- we haven't set our budgets for next year and we'll continue to look at that and present to the board late this year. But it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that we could run something like in the order of 5 rigs next year and maybe the following year, 2014, maybe go into 10 and the following year to 15. If we follow a schedule like that, that allows us the opportunity to not only hold that acreage but really significantly ramp up our oil production NGLs. And you get great rich gas with that. So Ray you might talk a little bit about things we have in place and things we're doing to start leading us down that path.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, Dave, this is Ray. I think the results that we've seen so far this year are really impressive. Our guys have done a great job thinking through the future. And we did a really good job, we were really disciplined in the way we put those leases together up there. We stayed very disciplined in making sure they were consolidated because we knew handling saltwater and all those things was going to be big, play a big role in the economics of the play. So it's taken some time to really put a lot of those corridors together to put a lot of the plans in place to get the midstream infrastructure and power infrastructure and all of those things in place. And one of the things that we don't want to be guilty of is just going fast for the sake of going fast. And we're trying to take a very disciplined approach and ramp up as it makes sense to ramp up. In other words we don't want to bring rigs in, complete wells and then not be able to flow them. So we're really -- that play is really dictated a lot by handling a lot of fluid at really cheap prices to get that oil production. And so I think the guys have got an excellent plan. I'm really confident in what they're doing. And like Jeff said, I think we do have some pretty aggressive plans in the future to ramp that play up. Now I think you'll start hearing and seeing that as we get into the early part of next year, you'll start seeing that really happen pretty quickly.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","The other thing -- if you look on our website Ray talked about a very efficient plan that we have. There's a diagram in there that shows that. And the other thing when we finally release our specific detailed land maps that we have in the Marcellus I think you'll be impressed with the big blocky dominant position we have and obviously the early drilling looks great.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. I really appreciate the color. One just last one to sneak in. On the Miss Lime, how do you guys think about the NGLs and how are you going to manage that in that area of the country? I know you've been very focused on it up in the Marcellus, but any color you can give us with respect to NGLs pricing outlook around the Miss would be helpful.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, one I'd say, again, you get a nice, so we have a liquids component and a big piece of that is oil. We have 2 facilities in place able to handle and process liquids and NGLs and with the third one that will be up by the end of the year. So we have good diversity. We have a strong marketing team. And I think really we'll be in good shape there.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Brian Lively of Tudor Pickering Holt.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the 3x EBITDAX commentary. Just wondering if that is -- is that your covenant levels or is that just the internal comfort from the management team?","Roger S. Manny","Brian, it's Roger. Our covenant is 4 and a quarter, 4.25x. So it's clearly a management comfort level. We talked with rating agencies. Everybody is comfortable with us kind of being here in the low 3s. Using that financial flexibility, quite frankly, financial flexibility to us is a lot more than just having a $1.75 billion committed credit facility under a $2 billion borrowing base. It's the cost structure, it's the hedging, it's the operating control. As I say being able to set the drilling throttle where it needs to be. All those factors together make us very comfortable being in that low 3 range. But we're not going to come anywhere near the covenant limits. That's just not the way we do things.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Right, so if we're thinking about 2013, and I know it's a function of commodity prices, but do you guys expect to use the 3x debt to EBITDA sort of a throttle such that we would either have to look at slowing activity or doing more asset sales in terms to keep the leverage below that ratio?","Roger S. Manny","I think at this point it's a wait-and-see game. We'll see how the asset sale goes. And we'll just play it accordingly. I mean one of the big factors that's different about Range is when you look at our reserve to production ratio, whether on a total proved reserve basis or just approved develop basis, our ratio is about double the other shale players. And that's really indicative of the quality of our plays. And also the diversity of the plays. We have a lot of assets contributing a lot of value to the company. So we've sold $1.8 billion in assets in the last 10 years and we've not leveler our assets. So it comes down to making some of those hard decisions. We'll make them just like we always have.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, I think another key point too is our strategy has been growth at low cost on a per-share basis debt adjusted and really the other part, we say periodically and building high-grade the inventory. Like Roger said, over the years we've added in not only sold $1.8 billion worth of properties, we added in things like the Marcellus. We added in things like the horizontal Mississippian. I think in the future the St. Louis looks pretty exciting. We're looking at the Cline, the Utica, the Upper Devonian. So it's that constant process of building shareholder value by adding in higher quality plays and periodically divesting of things that are either no longer competitive in our portfolio or that we're not going to fund anymore even if they're quality properties like the Ardmore Woodford grade properties that's small position for us and it's going to be worth more to somebody else than us.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And are there any properties right now that you guys are thinking given the high grading that's happened? Are there any other properties that you can think of that are moving more to the non-core and could be monetized?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Sure, I mean we always look at our portfolio. We always we forward-frank it, we look at the upside, we look at the other potential. We make that decision. I'm not on the call today going to talk about what that is but yes, we absolutely -- Chad, Stevens and his team are on top of that.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay and just final question and I'll hop off. But if you were to keep CapEx flat in 2013 versus 2012, do you have a sense of what growth it would look like?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, I mean, one, we haven't made all those iterations. Like I said a lot of it ends up on where you end up focusing. If we focus in the liquids rich portion and we stay within cash flow, we would grow on the order of 15% to 20%. If gas prices moved up substantially and we added in a bigger component of that, you can see this year for that amount, we're drilling at 35%. Like I said, if you just focused 100% on dry gas, literally you could theoretically probably double the numbers we have. But it's early. Right now, I think we're doing exactly the right thing. We're staying disciplined. Oil prices are still high, gas prices are relatively low. Moving into our liquids rich areas in Southwest Pennsylvania and focusing on the high rates of return there, as well as the great rates of return like Dave Kistler mentioned earlier in the horizontal Mississippian, I think it's the right thing to do. The other thing is if you look at our company our size we're $9 billion to $10 billion company depending on the stock price in the day. We have got such a huge position that is predominately derisked and again you can look in our IR presentation, but we have literally got the opportunity to grow tenfold from where we are today. We're only a 5 TCF company and not counting ethane or those things, we have got the opportunity or resource potential to grow 44 to 60 Ts. And again some of the highest rate of return plays out there. If you focus in just on the Marcellus shale, we've got the opportunity and we're only a 5 TCF company. Our net resource potential in the Marcellus is 24 to 32 TCF. That's massive and it's largely derisked. This is a play now that is basically the largest gas field in the United States and recognized by most as the highest quality too. So we've got a great portfolio. We will continue to work it as we go throughout the year. We're working internally with the divisions on what we think maximize the shareholder value, present it to our board and then let you guys know, but we're in great shape.","Operator","The next question is from David Tameron of Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you guys talk about your drilling plans in the Cline? It looks like you shipped a little bit from Sterling over to Glasscock. Is that -- can you just talk about the reasoning behind that if I have that correct?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Let me start out again and Ray may want to pile on and I probably shouldn't start every time, so I'm going to let Ray and Roger start some. I get excited, you can probably tell. If you look at our legacy, because really what you're describing is predominately our legacy position in Conger Field. Conger Field straddles the Sterling Glasscock line. So we've got a big position over 90% -- for about 90% of it's held by production. And so far, we're excited by our first 2 wells. The other neat thing is if you look at that is there's a lot of drilling off on the western side of us and Devon has a 500,000-acre position just East of us basically. So we're surrounded by -- and there is a slide on the website that Ray and Roger are looking at right now that shows our activity relative to Laredo and Concho and Devon and others that are out there. So what we've done literally is just or scattering a few wells across our acreage because the interval itself is relatively consistent. It's 270 to 330 feet thick across the entire 100,000 acres. And we believe it's got a lot of hydrocarbon in place. So what we're doing is just trying to look across a large area from our wells and we're going to factor in what our competitors are and partners and hopefully we'll share some data with them. And it's got great upside, great potential, but the good part there it's all HBP. So we're in -- we have no rush. And the other thing I like to say going into a higher level is it fits the Range model. We like to get in areas that have stacked pays, a lot of hydrocarbon in place that -- and get really high-quality technical teams that just continually work on how to extract more and more of it out of the ground. That's the same model in Appalachia, same in Midcontinent, same in West Texas for us.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So at the time being I'm just -- it looked like earlier you were planning to drilling some Sterling wells and they've moved -- all of your wells have moved further west. Is that an indictment of Sterling or is it just -- it's more of a...?","Ray N. Walker","Maybe I think we're mixing wells. If you look on our presentation on the slide, originally, we had 3 wells planned in Sterling County, those were Cline Shale wells. The wells on the western edge are Wolfberry vertical wells. And if you look at that slide, we've kind of got a little dashed line kind of circling where the potential is for that Wolfberry. In our last conference call we talked a lot about that -- how the Wolfberry vertical is really only potential over on the Glasscock County side. So what you've seen is with all of the offset activity like Jeff was referring to, we've basically are learning a lot from what's happening all around us. We've got tons of logs and scientific data all across this field. So we've logged the Cline Shale many, many times. And so really we're kind of in a validation mode, it's HBP. We don't have to be in a hurry. The Wolfberry wells are looking really good, and we can stamp those out quickly, like a good decent rate of return as oil production. And so all of those reasons, what you saw us do was shift a couple of those horizontal Cline test over into basically drilling Wolfberry wells while we have that rig out there. So if you're looking at Permian activity, that's probably what you're seeing.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And just to reiterate what Ray said. The entire 100,000 acres as perspective for Cline, it's perspective on the Western side. Still could be 100, 150, maybe 200 wells. But it's predominately the Wolfberry is just perspective on the side. Maybe that's what you're thinking.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My bad. I think I misread that chart. One more question. Could you just like talk about Lycoming? And you originally talked I know if you go back 6 months, you talked about allocating a big chunk of CapEx next year to that county. Now it sounds like you're reducing the rig count and I guess because some of the issues you mentioned, but can you just talk about some of the challenges up there and why lay down a rig up in Lycoming?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","This is Jeff, I'll start. There are several considerations there. The wells up there are great. The team has done a great job of ramping up production. They're phenomenal. We've got wells that average 10 million a day, big reserves, some that are over 20 million a day, so we got a great position up there. But there's really 2 issues. One issue is giving -- even as good as the wells are, given where natural gas prices are versus liquids, if you look at on our website, you can look at the rates of return in the wet Marcellus in the Southwest and the super-rich and compare to Northeast. Even though the Northeast is good because there's a lot of liquids that come with the wells including condensate and NGLs in the Southwest where rate of return is higher. Then you got one other consideration too, is you got the drilling for holding acreage. The 2 areas, the only 2 areas really in the entire company, we have to really drill a lot the whole acreage is in Southwest Pennsylvania and in the horizontal Mississippian play. It so happens those are our 2 highest rate of return projects, so we'd be directing anyway. The leases up in the Northeast tend to be a lot bigger. So we're at a point where at the end of the year, really just by running one rig next year, there's continual drilling clauses because the leases are bigger and some of the leases are as big as 20,000 acres. So literally one well per year, we'll hold that in perpetuity. So there's no pressure to drill up there from holding the acreage that we want to hold the point of view, coupled with just where oil and gas prices are now. The good news is we got a great team. You got good economics up there. I believe gas prices -- some of the analysts on the call are calling for $4 gas next year or maybe $4.50 the year beyond, so we have really got the ability to ramp that also. Like I said earlier, we've got high quality gas assets. We've got high-quality oil assets and within gas, we've got high-quality wet gas and high-quality dry gas.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Looking at the NGL production trajectory here. The production has been relatively flat the last couple of quarters and I just wondered, as we look ahead to the next few particularly in the fourth quarter where you expect more and more meaningful ramp-up. Do you have a lot of -- could you quantify the amount of NGLs, non-ethane that are currently behind pipe for from wells that have already been drilled, i.e. can you just kind of talk to wells that may have already been drilled, but from a propane and other NGLs perspective just aren't online today?","Ray N. Walker","Yes, if you look at the press release, I think it lists the number of wells that we've got in Southwest PA. And I think there's something like 56 wells waiting on completion and maybe something like 50 wells that are waiting on a pipeline hookup. Like I said in my prepared remarks primarily the delay in bringing those pads online has been pipeline infrastructure and that pipeline infrastructure has been delayed because of some permitting issues for the actual pipeline construction phase and the stream crossing part of that. The good news is we've resolved those issues. I mean to just come absolutely clean, we underestimated the impact of those, both West and Northwest early this year and we just didn't a allow enough time to get far enough ahead of those. So good news is we've worked with E&P leadership, they have resolved those issues. Now we have a predictable permitting process in place. We know how long it's taking. And moving forward, we don't expect to see that. I think another part of the good news and you'll see a significant ramp-up in NGLs in the third quarter and the fourth quarter is as we bring these pads online that were delayed, I mean they're literally sitting there just waiting for a pipeline to get there. And that part of it is really kicking into gear over the next quarter. It will be -- fourth quarter I predict will be much bigger than the third quarter just because it's going to take a couple of months for this stuff to start dominoing as we go forward.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","But we should have a great fourth quarter.","Ray N. Walker","Oh, yes, fourth quarter just like I said we believe we'll see when you compare fourth quarter this year to fourth quarter of last year, we will see 40% liquids growth.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And that's all from -- the incremental to get there is all from basically wells that have already been drilled and it's just an easing of the midstream bottleneck or some additional drilling or some wells that you're not sharing with the NGL component is, is still required?","Ray N. Walker","Well, we're still drilling wells. So you still got new wells coming into the mix as we go. But yes, there is a big backlog of wells in the wet and super-rich area where we were really trying to ramp a lot of this infrastructure up in the last 6 months to 12 months or so.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then lastly going back to, I think it was David's question just before just to finish up on kind of Cline versus Wolfberry. Is your decision to move to shift to a little more towards vertical of Wolfberry from horizontal Cline because of a negative relative view on the Cline because or is it because you just think you're going to get the information that you would have otherwise been drilling that well from others -- other operators that are drilling around you?","Ray N. Walker","I would classify it as 2 things. One is we are seeing a lot of offset activity more than we previously saw earlier in the year. And we do expect to learn some from that. And then I think the second reason is the Wolfberry wells are looking pretty good. And the team is doing a great job. Costs are coming down. Just in 3 wells I think we saw like -- I forget the exact number of 24% cost reduction. And we believe that they're going to see significant cost reductions even in the next few wells. They've got some new ideas in drilling and completions. And so we really believe that the Wolfberry wells have looked so good. And since it's HBP acreage and we know a lot about all of that already in the Cline, it just made a lot of sense to redirect some of that capital to get some of these Wolfberry wells drilled upfront. And the just kind of take our time with the Cline, learn from the offset activity at the end of this year we can look at it. And we still have the potential to drill another Cline well before the year is out. Right now we've just kind of got that on the drawing Board.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I think another -- I agree 100% with what Ray said. Another point to add to that is when you look at shale plays -- I mean the Wolfberry is just comingling a bunch of traditional horizons together on the vertical well. The Cline shale is really a shale. So back to shale plays and you got this interval that's plus or minus 300 feet thick. Typically what happens in successful shale plays and not all shale plays work, but in the ones that do work and you can see it in all of them in Marcellus, Barnett, you pick it. And as you continue to drill and learn, the results tend to get better. When you learn how to -- where do you optimally land it vertically in the section, what's the length of lateral, number of stages and typically as you're learning how to drive up production per well, in over a number of wells typically then you get economies of scale and you drive down costs. For us it's held by production position that we're excited about. In fact, what we're really excited about it is that the first 2 wells rather than, for example, go back to the Marcellus, the first few wells there were awful. Our first couple of wells here actually were pretty good and were economic even off of our first couple of tries. So, if you project forward to -- if you drill that 100,000 acres on a 100 acres pacing could be 1,000 wells or 50, could be 2,000 wells. So there's a lot of running room. It's a very exciting play and early on, it looks like we got a big hydro -- saturated hydrocarbon section that the first couple of wells are good. But there's -- we don't have to carry 100% of the R&D like we did in the early years in the Marcellus. We'll drill some wells, but we'll also learn from our partners in the industry out there or other companies in the industry.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And the strong vertical rates that you're seeing, is that a function of multiple or -- the multiple zones or are there specific zones like the Wolfcamp where you think down the road it may make sense to draw horizontally?","Ray N. Walker","It's a combination of all of them. I mean this is like any completion well out there, different areas show different results, but it's really a combination of all of it.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Not to say that down the road, that you won't zero in on the horizon and try some horizontal wells. I think that potential is there too.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, absolutely.","Operator","The next question is from Anne Cameron of BNP Paribas.","Anne Cameron - BNP Paribas, Research Division","Just a question about the Mississippian. You brought -- I mean you released your IPs or your first 2 wells and it looks like it was a breakout of about 60% crude. Yet your EUR is 25% crude. So I'm just wondering if you can comment on how fast the crude drops out of the production stream.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Let me start and then I will actually ask Alan Farquharson who is the head of engineering to comment. But when you look at it on a high-level actually I think we talked about 4 wells. And remember the combined rates for 4 wells and then we zeroed in obviously on the 1 that was well over 1,000 barrels per day. It had a very high oil rate in there. Again the neat part is very early on into the play. We had great results from 2,000-foot laterals. Now we've gone to own, at least that one, close to 4,000 foot with more stages. And it didn't cost a whole lot more, it's a packers plus type completion, so adding the stages and drilling the laterals isn't that expensive, though we've got significantly better results, shifting the curve up could be from 400,000 to 500,000 to 600,000 barrels. And therefore you can look at the add-on line and the rates of return much higher like David Kistler I believe mentioned earlier. But Alan, you want to zero in on those projections?","Alan W. Farquharson","I don't have the exact decline rate of the oil, but I think what you see is historically and a lot of these reservoirs since it's a relatively completions dry reservoir, you're going to look at oil declining and your gas oil ratios goes up over time. So over the long haul, over the life of the well, if you don't look -- as we look to a lot of the vertical wells, you see the gas rate it stayed relatively stable, but the overall gas oil ratio was increasing. I have to go back and kind of look to give a little bit more color on exactly what the decline rate is. But we're not -- I can tell you this, it's not falling out of the bottom very quickly. So it is declining as which you would normally expect it to do. And remember, since it is -- since you look at that time 0 graph, a lot of the production early on is going to be oil. So that gives you a fairly representative decline rate of what your oil is going to be. You're not going to see a significant change of gas oil ratio, that early over the first year. So if you honor the data that's in there and kind of use what the IP is, that kind of get you a relative sense of what we look like.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And a couple other comments. Obviously the economics that we have on our website include all of that and have factored all of that in there. Plus again, we're showing the 0 time plots for all the wells that we've had so far and what that historic data looks like.","Anne Cameron - BNP Paribas, Research Division","And similar question, different play. The 33 wells that you brought on in Southwest PA look like they are 14% condensate, which is a good bunch oilier than both your wet and your super-rich curve. So especially because that included the 5 dry wells, and because the NGL is kind of lower, could we see like a change in composition for both of those type curves?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Let's say one thing what you're seeing is we're shifting where we're drilling the wells. So as we continue to move -- and there's a map in there again on the website that shows different Btu lines and I think we denote 1,050, 1,350, but there is a gradation as go across there. And as oil prices are high and condensate prices are high and gas is low we've shifted a lot more of our drilling into the wetter areas. So yes. Therefore, that could happen with time and we'll keep you updated on -- what those results are.","Operator","We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Mike Scialla of Stifel Nicolaus for our final question.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask you a few things about your NGLs. You said you were close to an agreement on third outlet for ethane. Can you elaborate on that at all?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Obviously, we can't. As soon as we can, Mike, we will put that out.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I wish we could say more, but we can't.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I understand. Sounds like Enterprise is considering changing that ATEX line from ethane only to wide-grade. Would that cause you to change your plans if that were to happen?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","We've been focused on multiple outlets and multiple contracts, and again, we've got a great team up there led by Chad Stephens who is here in the room with us and his team, the guys who work for him does a great job. Craig Davis, Curt Tipton and company. So we continually look at those things. I think the good news is there's more and more options are developing in the basin. It's turning into like I said the largest gas field in the country and ultimately, when you consider the other horizons have the potential to be the largest gas field in the world. We've got a great position. More and more of those options are developing all of which ultimately enhance the value of our properties.","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Let me switch over to the Utica. You were kind of quiet about your Northwest Pennsylvania acreage for a while. Can you talk about maybe why that was and why now that you're confident that you're in the wet gas part of the play up there?","Ray N. Walker","That's a legacy asset that we've had for a long time, 25 plus years. And I think over 300,000 acres in the shallow rights. And we've had different teams, different divisions within the company look at it over time. And essentially through a group of events more or less. When we sold the Barnett, we took some of those really highly gifted technical folks that are working on the Barnett. And we said, \"Why don't you go look at the Utica up here underneath Northwest PA? We're bound to have some lease rights there? And lo and behold, they looked at it, saw a good potential. It was about the time the stuff in Ohio was looking pretty good. And we have 190,000 net acres. And so they've done a tremendous amount of really good technical work, putting together, lots of information. Some of that's in the presentation where we've shown type logs and we've shown that it's on strike. It's about the right depth. It's got a lot of the same characteristics of some of the successful wells over in the wet Utica in Ohio. So we think it's got a lot of potential. There's a lot of smart people that are in and around our position up there, leasing or drilling and testing some wells and doing some different things. And so we're kind of at the point now where we believe it's got great potential. It could be phenomenal. We're essentially at the point where we really just got to get some horizontal wells drilled and tested and see what we have there. The well that we're currently drilling right now is -- we're doing a lot of diagnostics on it. And we'll be completing that well here in a month or so once we get all that data in and look at it. And hopefully by the next conference call, we'll be able to talk about that and have some really great results. And assuming what we learned there and everything we learn over the next couple of months, we've got another well teed up to drill in October. So I think when we get to the end of the year, like I said in my remarks, we'll know a whole lot more about that play and what the potential is going forward. And we can kind of put it into the portfolio. We don't have any of that in any of our resource potential right now. So we're really excited about the upside potential that we see there. So...","Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. In the last call you talked a lot about your RCS completion technique, the improvement you were seeing there in recoveries. Is that something that you are continuing to implement. Is it becoming the predominant completion technique in the Marcellus? And also have you tried it outside the Marcellus?","Ray N. Walker","We have tried it to a limited extent outside the Marcellus. We're looking at more stages along the lateral and literally all these plays that we're looking at. It's -- while we have done it a lot, I wouldn't quite classify it as the predominant completion method yet in -- at least in our Marcellus, we've certainly done more of them. We're certainly intrigued by the results. They're all looking really well. Unfortunately, we had a delay that we talked about earlier, in some of these wells coming on line. So I think over the next quarter -- 2 quarters, we'll really get to see a lot of those wells come online that we tried some of the RCS and some of the super-rich and the really wet Marcellus part of the acre -- wet part of the Marcellus acreage. And once those wells come online and we get a few months under our belt on production, then I think we'll be better equipped to answer that question. But right now we're encouraged very well by it. And it really -- if it works like it has shown us in the early wells, it's going to really improve our economics.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Range is on target to meet our production goals within our capital budget. We're driving down our unit cost in the process. Because we have very large acreage positions in some of the best plays in the country, we should be able to achieve double-digit growth in production and reserves on a per share basis net adjusted for many years. Plus we continue to be one of the lowest cost producers in our peer group and are getting better.","In addition, the 5 enhancements to our portfolio, the super-rich Marcellus, the super-rich Upper Devonian, the wet Utica, the horizontal Mississippian play and the Cline oil shale play all offer significant upside to Range. Additional news on all of these plays will be coming on our third and fourth quarter calls. I'd like to point out that we still have 10 callers in the queue, and we're  not able to take questions in order to honor the time of the call, but I really encourage you to give us a call so that we can follow up on all those questions.

Production was up 34% versus the first quarter of last year. Total unit costs were down 10% versus the prior year, with LOE leading the way, down 23% from last year. DD&A dropped from $1.68 per Mcfe to $1.46 per Mcfe. Importantly, our operational successes are beginning to significantly flow through to our financial results. Despite prices being down 3%, our cash flow increased 34% year-over-year from $163 million to $219 million.","Looking further into 2013, growing production, coupled with improving well results, which Ray will discuss shortly, and lower per unit operating expenses for the entire year should result in substantial increases in Range's cash flow for the year.  In addition to the operational success, we also had 2 other key accomplishments in the first quarter. We sold our New Mexico assets plus Powell Ranch for $275 million. We also issued $750 million of 5% senior subordinated 10-year notes. Both transactions allow us to continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet.","As we previously announced, we're expecting production to grow at a rate of 20% to 25% for 2013. More importantly, we believe that we have line-of-sight growth of 20% to 25% for many years. All of this projected growth is on our existing plays. The reinvestment risk is low, and the projected rates of return are very good.","The growth is mostly driven by our approximate 1 million net acre land position in Pennsylvania, specifically by low-risk, high-return drilling in the Marcellus Shale. In addition to the Marcellus Shale, we're projecting impactful growth from the Horizontal Mississippian, Upper Devonian, Utica, Cline and Wolfberry plays. Given the high return of our plays, which is led by our liquids-rich and oil plays, our cash flow should grow at a faster rate each year than our production growth of 20% to 25% per year. With our projections, using current strip pricing, we expect to reduce our leverage with time, even with a slight outspend as we drive up production and cash flow.","Let me take a few minutes and reflect on U.S. E&P business in general today. With successful application of horizontal drilling, coupled with multiple-stage hydraulic fracturing, the industry has unlocked large-scale, repeatable oil and gas plays and shale formations across the country, such as the Marcellus, Eagle Ford and Bakken. In addition, this technology is being applied to old areas that have a rich hydrocarbon charge and a lot of hydrocarbon left to recover, like the Permian basin. The key to being a top-tier oil and gas company is to have a large position in the core area of one of the top quality plays. Range is clearly one of a handful of companies that meets this criteria. We are blessed by having approximately 1 million net acres in the state of Pennsylvania, which includes a very significant position in the liquids-rich portion of the play. Our position is further differentiated by the fact that in our area, we have not only the Marcellus, but we believe we have great stack pay potential in the Upper Devonian and Utica. Plus, where a play is located is also very important from a marketing point of view. Our discovery, the Marcellus, is well located in the northeast portion of the United States.","Gas from the Marcellus will not only supply the northeast United States, but gas from the Marcellus will move into the Midwest and Southeast markets. It's also strategically located relative to existing pipeline infrastructure, as well as the export facilities and harbor, in the Philadelphia area.  It's this position that gives us the confidence to project 20% to 25% growth for many years.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.","Ray N. Walker","Thanks, Jeff. On the operations front, the synopsis is all about executing the plan with better efficiencies, lower operating cost and improving well performance in what we all now recognize as one of the highest-quality plays in North America. With continued strong execution in our approximately 1 million net acre position in Pennsylvania, combined with our stack pay potential in the Utica and Upper Devonian, our emerging plays in the Mississippian, the Cline and the Wolfberry, we believe we can drive increasing value for our stockholders for many years into the future.","Let me start with and spend most of my time this morning on the Marcellus. We continue to recognize substantial improvements in well performance that we believe will lead to real upside in our plan. These improvements are a result of longer laterals, RCS completions, better frac designs and the application of new targeting technology. To illustrate this, during the first quarter, we brought online a 6-well pad in the super-rich area at 14,040 boe per day that's 65% liquids. That's 2,340 boe per day average per well. Additionally, we're bringing online a brand-new 6-well pad as we speak with slightly shorter laterals in the same area that also looks very good at 1,860 boe per day per well with 64% liquids. Now in and of itself, these are impressive wells with great production rates and outstanding economics. The punchline is that these new wells are in an area that already had 8 offset producing wells with up to 5 years of production history, and the new wells are substantially better than the previous wells.","I want to stress that these 24-hour production rates from each of these 12 wells are actual rates to sales, but yet they're all constrained by limitations of the facilities and gathering system. In spite of being choked back, which is by design, by several metrics, these new wells are simply better than those nearby older wells. In our view, the improvements are because the new wells were targeted better, had 30% longer laterals and had optimized RCS frac designs when compared to the older wells. For the new wells, the gas rate per frac stage is 28% higher for the first 20 days, and the gas rate per equivalent lateral length is 125% higher. Importantly, production per dollar spent is 140% higher than the older wells for those first 20 days. This is really important, so I'm going to repeat it again. The new wells' gas rate per frac stage is 28% higher, and per equivalent lateral length is 125% higher. And the production per dollar spent is 140% higher than the older wells for those first 20 days.","Clearly, this illustrates the potential upside that we could see going forward as we go back into previously drilled areas. These 12 wells also support our belief that we have not yet drilled our best well in the wet and super-rich Marcellus. As we apply these new designs and technologies along with longer laterals, we expect that our well results will continue to improve. And as was the case in this example, and I'm repeating myself again, we can expect substantial upside going forward, even in areas where we've previously drilled.","On the last call, we discussed 5 new wells in the super-rich area that also had impressive production rates. As follow-up on those 5 wells, the 3-well pad, after 30 days of production, was producing 1,085 boe per day per well, still at 65% liquids. And the 2-well pad was producing 1,257 boe per day per well, still at 58% liquids. I think the results of these 17 super-rich wells demonstrate the impact of improving well performance and economics as a result of our team continuing to unlock and apply new technologies. In fact, 11 of those 17 wells now have more than 30 days production and, for the first 30 days, are 45% to 50% above the super-rich type curve in our presentation. The key is it's still early, but we are really excited about the long-term potential that, that shows. Our technical team is really taking advantage of our improved reservoir modeling, which can only come with time and more data.","What we're excited about is the potential upside that we see all across the Marcellus, including in the dry areas. We've been talking about these techniques for quite some time but now are seeing tangible and impressive results and again, recognizing real upside in well performance as we go back into previously drilled areas. Today, we have over 430 horizontal Marcellus wells in Southwest PA on our 540,000 net acre position, which are producing approximately 500 million cubic feet equivalent per day net. If we were to develop the entire position on 80 acres, that's 6,750 wells. Best to-date, we've only drilled about 6% of our wells on 80-acre spacing. If you could drill all 6,750 wells today, when you do the math, we have the potential to grow our Southwest Pennsylvania production to almost 8 bcf equivalent per day. Of course, this is assuming we drill all our acreage on 80s and all the wells are equal and, at the same time, and so on.","Obviously, I'm not saying we will grow at 8 bcf equivalent per day, but it does give us confidence that we have a very large and high-quality asset that we can grow significantly for many years. Remember, there are over 1,650 producing Marcellus wells, which significantly de-risk our acreage. And again, this estimate does not include the Upper Devonian or the Utica or 40-acre spacing, all of which, we believe, are highly prospective across our Southwest PA acreage.","If you factor in all the things we're seeing, improving well performance, increasing capital efficiencies and lower operating cost, and you add to that 40-acre development in portions of the reservoir and additionally, you tack on the stack pay potential of the Utica and Upper Devonian and the potential of our other plays across the company, I think you can see for yourself why we have confidence in our ability to grow production at 20% to 25% for many years, essentially doubling our production every 3 years or so, which, in about 6 years, takes us up to 3 bcf equivalent per day as a company. And we believe it continues to grow significantly from there.","Shifting to Northeast Pennsylvania, while continuing to hold acreage with 1 to 2 rigs running, our technical team is focusing on delivering great wells, reducing cost and increasing efficiency. Two significant wells were brought online in Lycoming County and are described in the press release, and our plan for the remainder of the year is to continue with the 1-to-2-rig program in that area.","Now I'll bring you up-to-date on our emerging plays and start with our Mississippian play in Northern Oklahoma. We ran 5 rigs during the first quarter. Efficiencies are improving quickly. For example, we've seen our spud-to-rig-release days decrease from 37 days down to approximately 20 days in a short span of just 9 months. We've had some good news on a couple of other fronts. We've gotten a better result from pooling than we predicted, and we're ending up with almost 100% working interest in our wells rather than the prediction of 80% or so. Also, the team is making much better use of our saltwater disposal infrastructure, therefore, not needing to drill as many disposal wells this year. As a result of the rigs getting faster, higher working interest and less saltwater disposal wells needed, the good news is we're going to be able to utilize fewer rigs this year for about the same number of net producing wells. We're still working out the numbers, but we should be able to finish the year with fewer rigs as we do plan to stick to our CapEx budget.","The team did have some noteworthy wells and updates on previous wells that are detailed in the press release. In this play, it's all about location in a core sweet spot area, execution, controlling cost and steadily and thoughtfully building out infrastructure. And I'm happy to report that the Midcontinent team is doing a great job on all fronts.","In the wet Utica, Northwest PA and the Cline in West Texas, we're continuing to closely monitor offset activity, along with trading data and results as wells in both areas are completed and brought online by our peers. Again, we have large acreage positions in both areas that are largely HBP, and our plan continues to be to watch, trade and learn before we make any further development plans. Later this year, we expect that there'll be significant information that we can talk about in both plays.","For the first quarter, we exceeded our production guidance primarily due to some better-than-expected timing of pads coming online, combined with some really good well performance, both of which happened in the Marcellus. Like I was talking about earlier, some of these multi-well pads coming online are really impressive, and just a few days ahead or behind schedule can really impact our production in any given quarter. While we're likely to see quarter-to-quarter variability, we still expect to come right in at 20% to 25% growth for the year. Although we lost approximately 18 million cubic feet equivalent per day from the New Mexico sale that was effective April 1, guidance for the second quarter is set between 880 million and 890 million cubic feet equivalent per day with 20% liquids.","Remember in the last call, during Q&A, I kept referring to and restating, \"Did I tell you about those 5 super-rich Marcellus wells?\" We had a lot of fun with that, obviously. But there were a few folks on the call that caught the real meaning. It really is the Marcellus and our large acreage position in Pennsylvania that will drive our share price for many years. You could sum it up into 7 key points: number one, the sheer size of our acreage position in Pennsylvania at approximately 1 million net acres; number two, the largely de-risked nature of our Marcellus potential, largely in Southwest and Northeast PA; number three, the stack pay potential of the Utica and the Upper Devonian and the potential of the wet Utica and Northwest PA; number four, the tremendous economic impact of the liquids in our wet and super-rich area in both the Marcellus and the Upper Devonian and the developing markets for those products; number five, the high-quality dry gas assets both in Northeast and Southwest Pennsylvania; number six, capital efficiency improvements as we go back into areas where infrastructure is already in place, combined with the lower unit cost; and number seven, substantial improvements in well performance as we incorporate better RCS designs, better targeting and longer laterals.","As we begin to appreciate all these things going forward, it really is all about what those 17 super-rich wells illustrate. We've only just begun to get a glimpse of the upside as our technical team continues to accelerate its understanding of the reservoir and delivers results. What it means is as we work our plan for 20% to 25% production growth year-over-year for many years going forward, we have great confidence in our team and our assets. In short, we are confident in our plan to deliver substantial shareholder value for many years to come.","Now over to Roger.","Roger S. Manny","Thank you, Ray. The first quarter of 2013 produced continued improvement from last year in most all financial measures, on both the income statement and balance sheet, higher revenue, higher cash flow, with lower unit cost and declining leverage.","Reflecting first on the balance sheet improvements this quarter, we requested and received unanimous ratification of our existing $2 billion bank credit facility borrowing base and $1.75 billion binding commitment. At quarter end, approximately $1.6 billion of the committed credit facility was unused. Shortly after filing our annual 10-K in February, we issued $750 million in new 10-year, no-call 5 senior subordinated notes at 5% fixed interest. The combination of the new 5% notes, the December 2012 call of our 7.5% notes and pending call of our 7.25% notes reduces the weighted average interest rate on our long-term, fixed-rate debt by 58 basis points. This balance sheet improvement further reduces our interest rate volatility while extending our first bond maturity to 2019, 6 years out.","On April 1, we closed the sale of our New Mexico assets for approximately $275 million. The sale will produce about $84 million pretax gain in the second quarter, and proceeds from the sale were used to repay debt. Adjusting the first quarter debt to trailing 4 quarter EBITDAX ratio for the asset sale reduces our leverage ratio from 3.2x at year end to 2.8x.","Moving to the income statement, cash flow for the first quarter was $219 million, 34% higher than the first quarter of last year. Cash flow per fully diluted share for the quarter was $1.36, $0.03 above analyst consensus estimate of $1.33. EBITDAX for the quarter was $259 million, 31% higher than last year. Cash margin was $2.75 an Mcfe for the first quarter. That's 2% higher than last year, even though realized prices were down.","Earnings calculated using analyst methodology, which were adjusted for certain noncash and nonrecurring items, was $53 million for the first quarter of 2013, more than twice last year's figure of $24 million. On a per-share basis, analyst -- earnings were $0.33 per fully diluted share. That's $0.04 higher than analyst consensus.","Natural gas futures prices increased between the end of the year and the end of the first quarter. And while this is good news, the gas price increase made our hedges less valuable at the end of this reporting period compared to the end of the last reporting period. And this explains the $97 million noncash mark-to-market loss on our hedges, which was primarily responsible for our GAAP net loss. GAAP net income was further reduced by $42 million in noncash deferred compensation expense. That's due to the fact that our stock price increased from $62.83 per share at year end to $81.04 per share at the end of the first quarter. So even though the shares required to fund the deferred comp obligation have already been issued and placed in the plan, because the shares are held in the Rabbi Trust, GAAP requires that we expense the amount of the value increase.","Lastly, as discussed in the 10-Q, we recorded a legal contingency of $35 million, which is included in the G&A expense line. The bottom line impact of these items was a GAAP net loss for the quarter of $76 million compared to a loss of $42 million last year. Please remember, as Rodney mentioned, that all non-GAAP numbers I just mentioned are reconciled to GAAP in the IR tables posted to our website and in the press release.","Running down the first quarter cost performance and guidance figures, cash direct operating expense, including workovers, was $0.37 an Mcfe, $0.11 or 23% below last year's first quarter. Second quarter is expected to be in the $0.38 to $0.40 per Mcfe range. Third-party gathering, compression and transportation expense came in at $0.79 per Mcfe for the quarter, $0.11 higher than last year, due to continued system expansion and a greater percentage of our production coming from those expansion areas. Second quarter expense for this item is expected to run $0.82 to $0.84 an Mcfe.","Production and ad valorem taxes for the first quarter were $0.14 an Mcfe, and that includes Pennsylvania impact fees of $0.09 per Mcfe based on total company production. In absolute dollar terms, total production taxes for the quarter were $11.4 million, of which the Pennsylvania impact fee was $7.1 million, and non-Pennsylvania production taxes were $4.3 million. Production taxes in the first quarter of last year were significantly higher as last year's first quarter marked the initial implementation of the Pennsylvania impact fee, and that included the $24 million retroactive payment. Second quarter Pennsylvania impact fees are expected to approximate $7 million, and total production taxes per Mcfe should be between $0.15 and $0.16.","First quarter exploration expense, excluding noncash comp, was $16 million, down 24% from last year's first quarter, with the timing of seismic expenses prompting the reduction. Our seismic budget for 2013 is only slightly below that of 2012, so we anticipate second quarter exploration expense to come in between $18 million and $20 million. As expected, abandonment and impairment of unproved property during the first quarter was $15 million. That's significantly less than last year's figure of $20 million. The second quarter will likely continue to see this expense fall, down in the $15 million to $17 million range.","Cash G&A expense for the first quarter was down $0.05 below last year at $0.45 an Mcfe. We came in a tick over guidance on this expense due to some nonrecurring expenses associated with the deployment of several hundred new field vehicles, approximately 150 of which, we are proud to say, are fueled by natural gas. The second quarter should see cash G&A expense back down in the $0.40 to $0.42 range.","First quarter interest expense is $0.54 an Mcfe, which was $0.08 below last year. And while we expect unit interest expense to resume its downward trend later this year, second quarter interest expense is estimated to be in the $0.58 to $0.59 range due to the timing of the new note issuance versus the old note redemption, the asset sale closing and the fact that we replaced some lower-cost, floating-rate bank debt with that higher-cost, fixed-rate debt.","Our first quarter DD&A rate per Mcfe was $1.46, $0.22 less than the first quarter of last year. As the E&P business is highly capital-intensive, our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense figure is, by far, the largest absolute dollar expense item on the income statement. The significance of a $0.22 reduction on this unit cost in just 1 year provides clear evidence of the improving capital efficiency that both Jeff and Ray mentioned. The DD&A rate per Mcfe is estimated to be in that $1.46 to $1.48 range next quarter.","Range has continued to add new natural gas and NGL hedges for the next 3 years as we seek to generate greater predictability of cash flow to underpin our capital program. And please refer to our press release and website for the details on our current hedge position.","In summary, the balance sheet saw a significant improvement in the first quarter, with lower leverage, higher liquidity, lower long-term financing cost and reduced exposure to interest rate and refinancing risk. On the income statement, looking through the mark-to-market accounting losses caused by higher prices for natural gas and higher Range stock price, one can see another solid quarter of production growth and cost control, driving significant double-digit cash flow growth over last year.","Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Ray, a couple questions. You talked a lot about the new, I guess, 12 wells or 14 wells in the super-rich area and how they were better than other -- your older wells in the area. A couple questions. You have a little bit longer laterals, maybe some more frac stages, but what were some of the primary drivers behind that performance? And even though you had a little bit longer laterals, you're still in the mid-3,000 range. Is there the opportunity or likelihood that you would continue to expand that lateral link into the 4,000, 4,500-foot level? And if so, what would your expectations be?","Ray N. Walker","Yes, Ron, great question. I think the drivers of that improved performance are really all of those things combined. Better targeting has certainly been significant, and that involves some of the new focused ion beam scanning electron microscope, pictures where they take -- they model some of this rock at the molecular level almost. And what we've seen is being able to use some of these new technologies and really how the technical teams figured out how to apply those, and where we actually placed that lateral in the rock has made significant changes. And these wells, in the 2- and 6-well pads that I've talked about in the super-rich area nearby the 8 previous wells that were -- some of them are up to 5 years old, the difference there is, on average, they're about 30% longer laterals. And when you combine that with the RCS, that's almost twice as many frac stages in the -- basically, on a per-lateral kind of comparison. So really comparing all those or combining all those things together is really what makes that difference. And I like to talk about the fact that this is really a good indication of, I think, what we're seeing going forward and the application of all the technology. And we've gone back, and of course, we're really excited about all this, and we keep going back and looking at these and how they're comparing to our overall averages and our type curves. And like I said, it's really early. But I think it's really key to point out that these wells, on average, are posted between 45% and 50% above the type curve that we've got in our PowerPoint. So that's pretty exciting. It's still early. It's only 30 or 40 days on some of these wells, but we think that that's going to be really key. As far as longer laterals, yes. I mean, I think over time, you're going to see us migrate to that. In these cases, you're somewhat limited because you were going back into units, in some cases, that had already been formed around it on all sides, so you're sort of limited in some of those cases. But remember, these economics are really, really good at the lengths that we're at today. And they're good in the PowerPoint, so you got a, say A plus B equals C, and they're going to be a lot better overall. So we're pretty excited about it. But to answer your question, yes, we are going to be going longer over the next several years, and we are going to continue to refine some of these technologies. We've got some other ideas. The technical team is just doing a wonderful job up in Pittsburgh, so we're really excited about what they're seeing.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And Ray, you might mention, when you go back into some of those units and drill some of the efficiencies, you think we might see going...","Ray N. Walker","Yes. Yes, and that's another good add that we're seeing, too. When you go back into these areas, these new -- whether it's a new pad in that area, it won't have to pay as much money for water impoundments, for instance, because it will use an impoundment that's already there. If we're going back and adding a well on a pad that already exists and say we want to drill a couple of more wells there to go kind of backfill the infrastructure, in a lot of cases, they don't have to pay a lot of money for new infrastructure. They don't have to pay for new pad construction or new roads and that sort of thing. So we could see several hundred thousand dollars less on the upfront cost, which is also really significant going forward. And I think all of those things just continue to enhance our story and what really translates down to shareholder value going forward.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, a corollary to that, and then I'll let someone else jump on. Is there anything special about this particular area where you drilled these wells within the footprint of older wells, or would you expect similar-type results as you enter other older areas? And then you mentioned, I don't know if it was you or Jeff, in passing, a little bit the 80-acre spacing, but you mentioned the potential for 40-acre spacing. Do you think that's going to be prevalent across most of your acreage in Southwest and Northeast PA?","Ray N. Walker","Well, we've got at least a couple. I think there may be 3 40-acre pilots that are out there, and some of them have well over 2 years of production now. We have not released any data and don't really plan to anytime real soon. But I'll tell you they're all encouraging at this point. And just from a pure standpoint of doing this kind of thing for a whole lot of years, a lot of us would tell you that there's no doubt as you're in these liquids-rich areas that you're probably going to go to denser spacing over time. So I think that's -- the answer is technically yes. I think a good portion of the wet and super-rich area will probably develop on 40s eventually. But we see that much further down the road. We've still got a lot of room to go back in and infill the rest of the 80s, 60s, whatever combination of lateral lengths and distance between laterals that we come up with over time. So to answer your question, yes, we will be down-spacing significantly going forward.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I think another key thing to say there, too, is on -- if you look at our website and we go through it on our pitch book, what Ray referred to earlier, we got 1 million net acres in the state of Pennsylvania, highly prospective for multiple horizons. And you just zoom in on the 540,000 acres in the Southwest, which Ray did in his example. There's 1,650 wells there, up to 7 years' worth of history on our discovery well, which kicked the whole play off. And we go through in detail on our website, starting on Page 12, 13 and so on, and we break out all the dry, the wet and the super-rich. And really, there's over 1,650 wells that have delineated it, and that acreage is really all high-quality. So we think it's all very prospective, very low-risk, a lot of -- it's a big data set. It's not 7-day rates or 30 or 60. It's up to 7 years' worth of history on over 1,650 wells. So on 80-acre spacing, since we think it's all prospective, potentially 6,750 wells, and like Ray said, we've drilled only about 6% of that on 80s. But it's all highly de-risked with high returns. So we've got a lot of drilling. And the good news, there's data all over the place out there. So we think those techniques that Ray described will be very applicable, really, across that acreage.","Ray N. Walker","Yes. And just another final word, just so Jeff doesn't get the final word, if you look at the 20 super-rich wells that we turned on in the first quarter, those wells averaged about 65% liquids and the IP on those and boe per day is not a lot different than these wells I've been pointing out here. So I think the hints are, yes, we do expect to see those kind of results. We're pretty excited about this. This is a big deal.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And Ray, was there any difference about this particular area of going in amongst the older wells or\u2026","Ray N. Walker","No. Not appreciably, no.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, when you think about the placement of those laterals in the Southwest Marcellus, is that something that you can apply that same technology across your portfolio? And should we be looking to you guys doing that across all the Marcellus and maybe even testing some of that down in the Miss Lime and potentially seeing an uptick from EURs across the board?","Ray N. Walker","Well, the answer is yes. I mean, we are looking at this everywhere we're working, in the Cline. We're looking at applications in every single play. I think what we tried so far, we've seen varying levels of improvements. And I think it's going to vary a lot based on reservoir rock conditions. And I think the jury is still out because we've only really been applying this last part of last year and early this year, and so it's going to take some time. But I think all our experts would tell you yes, we do expect to see some improvements. But at the same time, we're going to also be doing longer laterals in general everywhere, and we're also doing the RCS-type completions in a lot of cases, too. So it's really going to be a combination of all those things, not just the targeting by itself. But I do expect that we'll try all of those things in pretty much every play.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, appreciate that. And then looking at the Miss Lime just for a second, you put up a couple wells that were very, very strong in your release. EURs look good, but the EURs would generally based off those IPs that you shared with us on the new wells, showed that there's some decent variability between the wells. Maybe I'm misinterpreting that, but looking in other parts of the Miss, different geographies, that's certainly the case. What are you doing to kind of think through or try to avoid having that sort of statistical aberration between all the wells?","Ray N. Walker","Well, the chat, which is really what we're playing on the Nemaha Ridge, is very variable. It's probably not good grammar. But it varies in thickness, and it varies in the fact that it's -- it's not everywhere. It's very prevalent. It's much more prevalent on the uplift than it is other places. But what we're trying to do with more and more time is trying to determine where that is. We're using our 3D. We've got 4,500 historical wells in that area. And one of the original ideas in putting that lease position together was to really stay close to the historical oil production and try to be around the better historical vertical production because your horizontal results are always going to be a multiple of your vertical. So the best place to look is where the best wells were. So we've got a lot of well log history and different things. And the chat play is really a conventional-type play, for lack of a better description, which is sort of unconventional in today's world. But it has high porosity. It has high permeability, there's lots of fractures. And it's going to be -- I think the standard deviation of results is going to be larger in a play like that. It has to be. So the key is determining why the good wells are good and trying to find more of those as we go, and that's going only going to come with time. Just like we've seen in the Marcellus, with more time, more data and more modeling and more understanding of all of these different rock properties, that's the same thing that we're going to go through in the Mississippi. And we're really early. We'll continue to update the type curves as we get more production at wells throughout the year. But so far, we're really excited with what we see, and it's holding on. And it's going to be a good emerging play, we think. But again, it's still early.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes. I think the other thing, there's variability, but I think at the end of the day, the key is what's the average of the program. So if you look at the average of our -- on Slide 26 on our website, if you look at the average of our 2009 to 2011 horizontal wells, they're 485,000 boes type curves or the 0 time plots here in the back. With the costs where we think we are or where we're close to, those generated, strip pricing, 91% rate of return. So really, the average is the key. Granted there's variability, really, in all plays, if you look at the average of the 2012 program at 600,000 boes, and it's over 100% rate of return. But we're learning. Just like we did in the Marcellus, we got progressively better with time. We learn with time. We'll see as we drill forward here how it eventually drills out. And you don't know until you drill it and you get long-term history. But looking at the old historical wells and looking at the 3D and the data that we have, personally, I don't think we've drilled our best areas yet even. We've started around where we started our development in Tonkawa field, and we just expanded around that. Again, I'm very happy with the 2009 through '11 program and 2012, and we'll see what it looks like going forward. But there's -- we still think it's a very attractive play. Nothing -- because we have 1 million net acres in Pennsylvania and you got stack pay potential, that's what's going to drive the 20% to 25% line-of-sight growth for many years. Again, and there's -- if you look at the whole Marcellus play, there's over 7,000 wells and up to 7 years history that have de-risked it, so that's the driver. But the Mississippian is exciting. Our potential in the Upper Devonian, the Utica, the Cline, and those other -- Wolfberry, all those other plays have value, too.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great, I appreciate that. One last question just in the Miss. When you talk about your time to drill those specific wells and we look at kind of the initial plan to ramp to 7 rigs, then 10, then 15, it would seem like also, with the increased working interest in wells, you really don't need to ramp rigs even materially over the next 2 years to be able to drill your objective of wells. Is that a fair way to think about that? Am I overstepping in terms of -- you're throwing out 20 days to drill a well and trying to work through that math, or how should we think about that as we model stuff out?","Ray N. Walker","No, Dave, I think you've nailed it. I mean, we just need to quit talking about rig counts because the drillers are just getting too good too fast. And just like we saw in the Marcellus, we had to quit talking about rig count, and it's really the number of net wells we're going to put online each year. And our plan is still to ramp up activity, but you may not see it near as much in rig counts going forward as we thought earlier on because just in 9 months, they went from almost in half. And we've seen wells 16 days or less, and I predict they'll be a lot less than that a few months from now. So you're exactly right. I think rig count is going to be really difficult to model. We can't even do it internally any more. It's just too \u2013 they're changing too fast.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Scialla with Stifel.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I got on your call late. I seem to be challenged by understanding time zones, so I apologize if you addressed any of these in your prepared remarks, but I missed them. Some people are worried about future condensate prices in certain parts of the country, and it looks like your Marcellus condensate prices, at least as a percentage of WTI, have increased each of the last 3 years. Just wanted to see if you could talk about how you see the market dynamics of the condensate market going forward in your areas?","Rodney L. Waller","Well, this is Rodney. And one of the things that we're blessed about is being where we are in the Appalachian area, you're in a very high-demand area, from White Plains down to Baltimore. Canada has brought a lot of imports of C5s and condensates as part of the development there. What you've seen on the slide that we have in the presentation...","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Slide 36. It's out there if you're looking.","Rodney L. Waller","Yes, Slide 36. Is that as we get to larger and larger volumes and we have the economies of scale, it allows us to go to different markets than what we are otherwise able to go to. And usually, those are premium markets. So we think there's still upside in the condensate market in Appalachia. There's always the ability to stabilize condensates and have them to qualify for export if that is required. So we think gasoline blending is another potential use that we haven't tapped into yet. So we think there's still growing and expanding markets. And the blessing that we have here is any demand that you have in Appalachia, if it has to be sourced, would have to be sourced from the Gulf of Mexico, which is going to add a huge amount of transportation cost. So we have some built-in margins in every one of our products, whether it's NGLs, condensates, propanes, we have this built-in differential because the only other way to get it is to buy it from Mont Belvieu, which is going to cost you money. And so we're just basically totally disconnected from the Gulf and the challenges that are going on there with all the NGL markets and the condensate market.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So condensate prices could weaken in the Gulf and you wouldn't be impacted by that?","Rodney L. Waller","We can't set the index, but we can have alternative export and other alternatives that could stabilize prices much better than any wells in the United States.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And that's why going back again to that Slide 36 or whatever, our prices have just been climbing with time. And we're in a great position not only for condensate but to move gas. And that position, particularly in the Southwest, is right on top of a lot of historic infrastructure that we're able to move gas in a number of directions. We're close, again, to the harbors in the Philadelphia -- harbor in the Philadelphia area to be able to -- and we got our ethane export agreement in place. We're currently exporting propane. So it's not only finding a large field and then having a million-acre footprint in the state and then being in some of the core areas, but also, all the advantage of having that infrastructure there is really critical, coupled with the team.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on your NGL price, I guess 37% of WTI for the first quarter, would you expect that to come down some in the second half once Mariner West goes into service?","Roger S. Manny","For NGL -- yes, when you put the ethane into the NGL, that will come down because what you're adding to the NGL barrel is the lowest dollar value of the total barrel, but production will go up. And so yes, that will happen over time. So be able to do that will help develop for you by next quarter how those fit into it. But with 5,000 barrels, you're not moving it that dramatic this second half of 2013. In 2014 and '15, obviously, there will be big changes in those because you would have much greater values. But also remember, the ethane that we're going to be selling in the second half of 2013 is going to be at a higher price than probably anybody else in the United States. Again, Appalachia's totally differentiating itself as to what we're trying to do with multiple markets that we can serve.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So maybe some modest percentage decline in that percent of WTI but nothing material for second half of '13.","Rodney L. Waller","Yes, we can help you model that, Mike.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, and to think about it in aggregate, when you look at that contract with Mariner West, it's at a gas index, so we're actually kept whole as a company plus a little bit with the efficiencies that come. So it's an economic uplift for us in general when you consider everything, as is Mariner East as well.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes. And then you mentioned that you're watching offset operators in some of your emerging areas like the Cline, the Utica and Upper Devonian. I don't know if you mentioned this in your prepared remarks, but anything new there that has made you more or less encouraged by any of those plays?","Ray N. Walker","This is Ray, Mike. In the Cline, we're continuing to see a bunch of activity. We still think there's going to be about 50 wells completed and put online in that area this year. We are seeing some good wells pop up here and there, close to 1,000 barrel a day IP type things, on both sides of this, east and west. So we're really almost a donut hole in the activity there. We got a people all around us, north, south, east and west, and so we're really watching that closely. And then in the Northwest Utica, certainly, there's a lot of guys that are really active up there, Halcon, Seneca, Shell, quite a few, Hilcorp. I mean, there's some -- there's going to be -- we still think about a dozen wells up there that year, and actually, Halcon at IPAA last week or so was talking about a couple wells that they're beginning to start flowbacks on. So I think we'll have quite a bit of data over the next couple of quarters that we can start talking about.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. If you are more encouraged by any of that data, any chance you'd allocate some capital toward those plays this year, or is it more likely a 2014 event?","Ray N. Walker","I think it's more than likely a 2014 event. We'll need to see some of the stuff, some production history, and it'll take a while to digest that. And then it'll go into the mix when we put together the budget for '14. And I suspect that's the earliest it would happen.","Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one for me. You had mentioned that you've had some 40-acre space pilots in the Marcellus on for a couple years. Any reason for holding back the data there? Is it competitive reasons, or is there some unitization issues or something that would impact how you would go about saving the acreage?","Ray N. Walker","No, there's no particular reason for holding it back other than -- I think the best way to describe it, and hopefully, nobody shoots me for saying this, is we just don't want -- we don't want to think about it too much yet because we think -- going back into drilling, actually, drilling on 40 acres is down the road somewhere. And I think we've got a lot of going back into areas to finish up the 80s, and we've got a lot of that kind of work to do before we get to that point. So I think you're just not going to see any for a while, but it is encouraging data. And I think we will come out at some point.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes. Let me talk about that a little bit because I think it's a key point. Like Ray said, again, going back to 14 on our slide deck, just in the Southwest, we've drilled about 6% of our wells. So we've got a lot of drilling to do on 80s because we think that whole area is prospective, and of course, on 40s. And we think a lot of it is prospective for 40s. I think there's a couple of key thoughts that come out of that. One, again, that's what gives us confidence to say we think we can drill at 20% to 25% for many years. So again, if we can -- and if you're growing at that rate on a compounded basis, roughly, every 3 years, you're doubling. So take, and I always roll back to around year end, around 0.8 Bs net, round it down, 3 years out, around 1.6 Bs net and going to around 3 Bs per day net, which would be phenomenal. That's why we think we can do that. I think the other key thing to think about with the down-spacing is, when you look at all the numbers we have for resource potential in aggregate for the Marcellus, is the recovery factors in that 30%, low 30% of gas in place or hydrocarbon in place, liquids in place. Through a combination of what Ray discussed, which is better quality wells going forward, through a combination of RCS, better landing, a little longer laterals, a few more stages, we can really drive up recoveries from our wells. The other way we can drive it up is through drilling the wells closer together, instead of 1,000-foot apart like we're drilling now 500 feet apart, which some other operators are already doing. So when you look at those 2 things combined, do we think we have the potential to take our recovery factor in the better areas from 30% roughly to maybe 50%, 55%, maybe even double it on the high side? That potential exists. So if you take some from 30% to 50% but you got the giant acreage positions we have, that's a lot of value. That's a lot of NAV. That's a lot of stuff that gives us confidence that we can grow consistently at 20% to 25% per year. That, to me, is the real significance of it. And it's not just growth, but it's higher-quality growth for all the reasons that Ray said earlier, those first wells again, or back in earlier this year, performing. And it's early, and it's just a handful of wells, but they're 45% over our type curve for the super-rich area. That's really impactful in terms of modeling and NAV and value creation.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to go back to the commentary in the release about the extent of which continuing to hold acreage by production is limiting your ability to really go after some of these wells. So I'm just wondering if you can give us an update as to where are we in that process and at what point would you feel comfortable revising higher because it looks like we're heading out where the type curves on some of the super-rich results you've announced last night.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, I think if you flip to Slide 12 on our website or in our pitch book, it shows where our approximately 1 million net acres are, and then for each one of those areas, it shows a percent HBP. So the main area, we have the HBP is in the Southwest. And which predominantly, a lot of the dry stuff, most of it, a lot of it, is HBP. So it's predominantly in the wet and super-rich. So for the well designs we have been drilling, and again, you can look at them, like Ray mentioned earlier, they're really high returns, whether you look at rate of return, return on investment, PVI or whatever you want to look at. So we got really high returns doing what we're doing. The exciting part, though, is they can get better. So what we've done is sort of artificially constrained ourself over the last few years because we're in a different position than really I think when you look at it on a net acreage basis in Pennsylvania, I think Range probably is number one . So we have the largest position in the highest-quality, largest gas field out there, plus we have a position in the wet part of it, as well as really high-quality dry acreage. So we're trying to hold acreage, as well as drive up production per share, reserves per share and cash flow per share. Having done that, we constrained our wells to things that are probably less than optimum, still generating really high rate of returns. So going forward, as we hold more and more acreage, what you've seen every single year, back from when we first started releasing the 0 time plots, is every single year, as we have migrated towards all those more optimum completion techniques, our reserves per well have gone up, including -- if you go back even a year ago, we were at 5.9 Bs in the wet. So in the Southwest this year, we're at 8.7. Of course, there's a giant liquids component to that. So they're going up every year. Will I expect that they'll stop going forward? No. I would expect that they'll get better as they go forward as we continue to do all those things. We've done it every year in the past, and we're continuing to do things that we know will work based on what we've done and based on what others are doing. So it's balancing and trying to capture that opportunity. Again, going back to Page 14, we've drilled on 80-acre spacing, 6% of our wells. If you use 40, it's 3%. Did we optimize the first 3% to 6% of our wells? No. But we've generated, I think, some really good returns and really good performance. And for the remaining 90-plus percent, I think they're going to get better and better.","Ray N. Walker","Yes. Another thing, I'll just tag on a little tidbit, one of the measures that we often look at is recovery per 1,000-foot of lateral. And a few years ago, we were in that 2 bcf per 1,000 foot of lateral in kind of in the wet area per se. Last -- in these type curves we've got today, we're in that 2.7 range, in that same area, so that's a really large percentage increase in the recoveries per 1,000 foot of lateral length. And so just as important as increasing the lateral length is the more you get per 1,000 foot of lateral. And clearly, these new wells that we were talking about earlier in my remarks, the 2 new 6-well pads plus the 5 wells from the previous call, look like they could be 45% to 50%. I mean, they are for the first 30 days, 45% to 50% above the type curve that we have in the book. So we're seeing major improvements in recoveries per 1,000 foot of lateral and at the same time, going longer laterals. So we all totally agree that these wells are going to get better as we go and our ability to drain the rock is going to get a lot better as we go.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right, guys. Maybe just sort of a clarification. Jeff, when did you expect to be done with the bulk of the HBP process on the current line?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, okay, let's flip back. When you go to the Northeast, there, we have on Slide 12, 145,000 net acres, 69% HBP. The key thing is at this point in time, although we're not in HBP mode there, we're in a continuous drilling mode. So we just need to run 1 to 2 rigs per year, and we'll hold all the acreage that we want to hold there, the high-quality acreage. If you go to Southwest, that 51% probably goes up roughly 10% to 15% per year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go to Marshall Carver [ph] of Heikkinen Energy Advisors for our final question.","Unknown Analyst","In terms of the 20% to 25% growth per year over the next few years, does that cook in any of this improved well performance that you're seeing, or is that based on the current well performance or even the well performance that you were seeing in late 2012? Could you give me some clarity around that 20% to 25% growth?","Ray N. Walker","Yes. Well, first, I want to correct. It's not for just a few years we're going to grow 20% to 25%. It's many years. But yes, some of that is built in there in the type curves that we updated first part of this year. So yes, there is some of that. But clearly, what we're seeing in some of these recent wells is, like I've been saying, 45%, 50% above that already. Now it's still early, and it's hard to put an EUR on the well with only 30 days of production. And they're somewhat choked back and constrained by design and...","Jeffrey L. Ventura","None of that's baked into it.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, none of that's baked into it at all, and certainly, none of it's baked into it in the dry areas and the other plays, which we -- that's just  one more thing that gives us confidence in the ability to grow it at 20% to 25% for so many years going out there. It's just a really high-quality portfolio of assets.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","If you're modeling it going forward, we're comfortable with the 20% to 25%. That's why we've been saying it consistently. If you're going to model that because our wells have improved every single year since we've been in the play, I wouldn't model it flat going forward. I think the proper way to model it would be to build some of that in there. In fact, I've built a lot of it in there.","Ray N. Walker","Bigger and [indiscernible].","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, and what I'm saying is we'll grow at 20% to 25%. But the quality of the wells and the returns on the investment will get better with time as you build that in there.","Ray N. Walker","Yes, absolutely.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","In closing, I'd like to make 3 points. One, given Range's large, high-quality, low-risk acreage position and drilling inventory, we believe that in addition to growing production 20% to 25% this year, we have 20% to 25% line-of-sight growth for many years. Secondly, given the high returns in our liquids-rich and oil plays and assuming current strip pricing, our cash flow is expected to outpace our production growth. We're also projecting that with current strip pricing, we'll be reducing the leverage of our company with time as we drive up production and cash flow. The third point is that we expect our well results to continue to get better with time as we have demonstrated over the past years.","Having drilled only a small fraction of the wells that we ultimately expect to drill in the Marcellus, as we refine our targeting of our laterals, drill longer laterals and optimize our completions with RCS and additional stages, we're convinced that we have not drilled our best wells yet. Led by our approximately 1 million net acre position in Pennsylvania, we project that we'll consistently drive up both production and reserves on a per-share basis, debt-adjusted, for years to come. Plus we continue to be one of the lowest-cost producers in our peer group and are still improving. We believe that this plan will translate into substantial shareholder value in the months and years ahead.","I know that there's several other people that were queued up for Q&A. Please give our IR team a call, and we'll try to handle all those questions as fast and as best as we can. And thanks to everyone for participating on the call.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.","Rodney L. Waller","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported outstanding results for the third quarter of 2013 with record production and a continuing decrease in unit costs. Both earnings and cash flow per share results were greater than First Call consensus.","The order of our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.","In addition, Chad Stevens, our Senior Vice President in charge of marketing, will be available to answer questions after our prepared remarks, and Mr. Pinkerton, our Executive Chairman is also available.","Range did file our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on the home page of our website, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we have posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliations of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call.","Now let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Thank you, Rodney. Before we get into the details of the third quarter and into Q&A, I would like to say that Range has a really simple story. At Range, we believe we have the opportunity to grow production 20% to 25% per year for many years. This is led by our Marcellus Shale position in Pennsylvania. Growing on a compounded basis of 20% of 25% per year means that we can double our net production every 3 to 4 years. Not only is that great growth, it comes with some of the best returns in the industry.","As shown on Slide 28 in the investor presentation on our website, our pretax rate of return for our super-rich wet and dry areas in the Marcellus in southwest Pennsylvania is currently projected to be about 100% for all 3 areas.","What differentiates Range from its peers is the size and quality of our position. We have approximately 1 million net acres in the state of Pennsylvania. When the stacked pay potential of the acreage is considered, we believe it's like approximately 2 million net acres. This is shown on Slides 9 and 10 in the investor presentation.","We're also advantaged in that a lot of the acreage in Pennsylvania is in the southwest part of the state.","When mapping hydrocarbon in plays for the Marcellus, the overlying Upper Devonian shales and the Utica\/Point Pleasant play, the southwest portion of Pennsylvania, and notably, Washington County is the only place where you can stack all 3 horizons.","Stated another way, if you consider all 3 horizons, the maximum hydrocarbon in place is in southwest Pennsylvania, with Washington County being an optimum place to be. This is shown on Slides 11 to 14 in our investor presentation.","The southwest Marcellus offers other advantages. This is the only area where there are prolific dry, wet and super-rich fairways of the Marcellus. Again, our acreage in Washington County is particularly well positioned in all 3 fairways.","Southwest Pennsylvania also contains better infrastructure and takeaway capacity. Given that Range was a first mover in the Marcellus play, coupled with our strong marketing team, we believe we have secured enough firm transportation and firm sales to move essentially all of our projected production in this area to good markets. The result is that we have the ability to both grow production and do it with good netback realizations.","Range has a consistent long-term strategy of growing our production and reserves per share, net adjusted with the top quartile or better cost structure. We have a long-term track record of successfully delivering on that strategy. Very importantly, we're growing in one of the highest rate-of-return plays in the business, possibly the highest.","As I mentioned earlier, if we grow production 20% to 25% per year for many years, then our production will double in 3 to 4 years and then double again and so on. Depending on where commodity pricing is, our cash flow will either grow proportionally with production or possibly in excess of production growth.","If cash flow just grows proportionately with production, then our cash flow will double in 3 to 4 years, and then double again and beyond. Based on our cash flow multiple for our stock, then our stock price will double in 3 to 4 years and then double again thereafter.","I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations for the quarter.","Ray N. Walker","Thanks, Jeff.","Over the last few calls, I've discussed many of the technologies that we've introduced down hole, things like RCS completions, enhanced frac designs, better targeting and increasingly longer laterals. Not only do our teams do a great job down hole, they are also making impressive strides on the surface. One of the best measures of that performance is direct operating expense, and compared to the prior-year quarter, our direct operating expenses on a per unit basis are down 15%.","In the southern Marcellus, we averaged 166 frac stages per month in 2012. And this year with the same amount of frac crews and equipment, we're averaging 196 stages per month, which is a staggering 18% improvement at this stage of the development.","Last year, our facilities team, who developed the first 0-vapor protocol designs in the basin, was building facilities that already exceeded the new EPA standards, which in and of itself is a great accomplishment.","Recently, they fine-tuned that design, resulting in a 20% upgrade in condensate pricing at some of our sites. And they're working on expanding that application, which we expect to add real value going forward. They were also able to realize a 15% reduction in facility costs this year at the same time.","On the land side, we're developing 75% more acreage per pad year-over-year. So when considering operating expenses, facility designs, logistics, marketing and even the efficiency of which we're developing our acreage, I believe our teams are among the best out there, and I want to congratulate all our teams across the company.","We are exceeding our operating targets across-the-board. Third quarter production for the company came in at 960 million cubic feet equivalent per day with 23% liquids, which was above the high end of our guidance, which was 940 million to 950 million with 22% liquids. We can attribute the exceptional growth to better-than-expected timing, along with increasingly strong well performance both occurring in southwest Pennsylvania.","Marcellus production for the third quarter averaged 756 million cubic feet equivalent per day, net to Range, and for the first 9 months of this year, averaged 718 million. When compared to the same time period in 2012, that's a 40% increase year-over-year in our Marcellus production.","Additionally, we reached another major milestone in the Marcellus where over a period of several days, we produced over 1 million gallons per day of NGLs, net to Range, with an additional 8,300 barrels per day of condensate.","In northeast Pennsylvania, we have 1 rig running. During the third quarter, we brought online a step-out well in Lycoming County with a 24-hour IP of 23 million a day and a 30-day average rate of 15 million a day. At 60 days, the well cumed over 3\/4 of the Bcf.","In the last couple of weeks, we brought online 2 more wells on that same pad under constrained conditions at a combined rate of over 42 million a day. The average IP to sales of those 3 wells, again all were under constrained conditions, is 22 million a day with an average lateral length of 5,000 foot, 23 stages and an average revenue interest of 86%. As we further develop this area with longer laterals and more stages, we expect even better returns.","In the super-rich area in southwest Pennsylvania, we brought online 24 wells in the third quarter, with an average IP to sales of 2,657 Boe per day, with 66% liquids. Now just for clarification, all the rates that I quote today for the super-rich and wet areas of the Marcellus include 80% ethane extraction. The average 24-hour IPs during the third quarter were 43% higher, with condensate rates being 54% higher than the previous quarter. That's a really impressive group of wells. And again, my congratulations to the southern Marcellus team for a job very well done.","The 17 super-rich wells that we've been tracking in our presentation and over the last few calls are still holding up nicely and performing well above the 2012 curve. With 240 days online, those wells are 43% above the curve, and we've updated that information on Slide #18 in the presentation.","Specifically at the last call, I announced the brand-new, super-rich well that had just IP-ed that week at over 5,700 Boe per day with 63% liquids. As a further update, for the first 30 days, the well averaged over 2,700 Boe per day with 61% liquids and cumed almost half a Bcf equivalent. And at 60 days, the well averaged over 2,100 Boe per day with 60% liquids and cumed over 3\/4 of a Bcf equivalent.","As further confirmation of that area, that well was 1 well of a 4-well pad that had an average 24-hour IP per well of 4,143 Boe per day with 63% liquids, which is including 571 barrels per day of condensate per well.","After 60 days, the 4 wells on the pad averaged almost 2,000 Boe per day with 61% liquids each. The average lateral length is a little over 4,000 feet with 22 stages. Again, here's another example of some really strong wells that support our belief that we've not drilled our best wells yet, as we continue to see better and better results.","I'd like to call your attention to the fact that we've added a new slide in our presentation on Page 17, showing our top-10, super-rich Marcellus wells.","When comparing on a 24-hour IP basis, we have 5 of the top-10 wells in the basin, including the Utica. On a normalized initial production rate per thousand foot of lateral basis, we have 8 of the top 10 liquids-rich wells in the basin. Again, we use 80% ethane recovery in our numbers and only considered wells with more than 60% liquids. Also, the range IPs are based on actual 24-hour production to sales, and in most all cases, our wells start out constrained by facilities.","Our super-rich wells are already basin-leading wells, as you can see by this data. But as we drill longer laterals and continue to see improvements like we've seen over the last year, there's no doubt that our super-rich acreage position is a class-leading asset that would yield even greater value than we see today.","We've now released gas in place or sometimes referred to hydrocarbon in place maps for each horizon -- the Marcellus, the Upper Devonian and the Utica -- that also show our perspective acreage in each case. All this is shown on Pages 11 to 14 in our presentation, so let me walk you through those now.","When you look at the Marcellus gas in place map, you not only see southwest and northeast PA as 2 distinct core areas from a gas in place standpoint, they have also proven to be core from a productivity standpoint, even though they exhibit different reservoir characteristics. You can definitely see the high gas in place area in northeast PA with highly productive dry gas wells. You also have southwest Pennsylvania as a highly productive area. Even though the gas in place is not as high in southwest Pennsylvania and the reservoir is thinner, the porosity and permeability are much higher than exhibited in northeast Pennsylvania, and you have the additional enhancement of the liquids and condensate. There are now over 7,000 wells with data supporting both these areas as being core and highly productive.","Looking at the Upper Devonian, you see the highest gas in place area in southwest Pennsylvania, where Range drilled the first horizontal in 2009. We have tons of data on the Upper Devonian as we drill through it on our way to the Marcellus, and we continue to believe that it'll be highly productive. We've done significant testing and have cracked the code as we announced earlier this year with a 10 million cubic feet equivalent per day Upper Devonian horizontal well, with 60% liquids in the super-rich area, yielding what we believe is tremendous upside potential going forward.","There's also been significant testing of the Upper Devonian throughout the basin, validating what we show in this analysis.","Range also drilled the first horizontal in the Utica in 2009, leading us to be the first to recognize the stacked pay potential of the Utica\/Point Pleasant underneath southwest Pennsylvania.","When you analyze the data and all the offset activities, the largest amount of hydrocarbon in place in the Utica is centered across our 540,000 net acre position in southwest Pennsylvania, namely, in Washington County. This may seem a little contrary because most of the Utica activity to-date has been targeting the liquids-rich portion of the play because that's where everyone got started.","There hasn't been a lot of dry gas Utica drilling, simply because most of it's located under the Range Marcellus activity in southwest Pennsylvania. Recently, we've seen a nearby well completed in the dry Utica\/Point Pleasant making 11 million a day with only 8 stages that confirms our analysis. Under our Washington County acreage, we have the Point Pleasant interval, which is the key productive interval that's over 140-foot thick, with early estimates of over 150 Bcf of gas in place at high pressure at approximately 10,700 feet. And we now have a confirmation well nearby, all of which equals what we believe is really good potential for high volume, high return gas production.","With longer laterals and enhanced completion designs, we believe the Utica\/Point Pleasant and Washington County is very perspective, and we're currently working on plans to drill a horizontal Utica\/Point Pleasant well in southwest Pennsylvania in 2014. When you stack all 3 plays together on Page 14, the largest gas in place in the basin is clearly in southwest Pennsylvania, namely under the Range acreage position. We secure all rights to all depths since we drilled Marcellus wells.","A real upside going forward is that we expect significant gains and capital efficiency as we go back and develop the Upper Devonian and the Utica\/Point Pleasant as much as the infrastructure of roads, pads, midstream and water will already be in place and paid for.","Again, all of these yielding substantial durability in our growth projections with low investment risk. We control all the horizons in the highest gas in place acreage in the basin, and we have great diversity with super-rich, wet and dry gas production, all with some of the best returns in the basin and getting better.","On the midstream and marketing front, we and our partners are doing well in staying in front of our capacity needs. We have contracts and commitments in place to support our needs, not only through the next couple of years, but for a number of years going forward. Mariner West is starting up, and we expect it to be fully functional later in the quarter, and thereby, alleviating any issues associated with BTU pipeline specs for Range in southwest Pennsylvania.","Since Range discovered and pioneered the Marcellus focusing mostly in southwest Pennsylvania, we still, today, maintain our first-mover status in positioning ourselves to take advantage of the pipeline infrastructure that already exists in the region, all of this resulting in competitive netbacks.","We're the largest wet gas producer in the basin, and our portfolio of marketing arrangements for all our products is among the best out there. An example of that is our 3 ethane deals, providing us both operational and market diversity for the long term. Once in operation, we expect these 3 contracts to provide an uplift in overall revenue.","In our press release, we describe some of those details and make a comparison to today's pricing, showing that once these 3 projects are running, ethane would be selling for an equivalent gas price today of approximately $4.13, net of any transportation, plus we'll receive an additional 8% propane, meaning an additional $0.40 to $0.50 per mcf.","This is substantially better than selling ethane as BTUs in the gas stream. Our expectation has always been and will remain to have very few wells that aren't flowing or aren't hooked up to gathering at the end of every year. And I believe our inventory of wells waiting on infrastructure is among the lowest in the basin.","We've consistently met our volume targets every quarter, involving extensive coordination and planning efforts with our partners going out 3 years and beyond. And we've been turning our wells into sales quickly. We've had no significant curtailments due to interstate pipeline issues because our team has been instrumental in helping to solve issues that could affect the flow of our gas. And our sales prices in each region of the basin compare favorably.","In summary, our team has us well positioned with firm transportation, firm sales and a plenty of compression and processing capacity to support our growth trajectory for the coming years at terms that are among the best in the basin. We don't say it enough, so I want to say it publicly to our marketing team because I know that they're listening today: job very well done. Chad Stevens, our Senior VP in charge of marketing, is with us today on the call and can provide additional details and answer questions during the Q&A.","Now let me spend just a few minutes on some of the other activity across the company as all our teams are doing a great job, lowering cost and hitting their marks.","In the Mississippian play in northern Oklahoma, we just completed a 12-mile step-out well that had daily production of over 300 barrels of oil per day for more than a week and has produced on average -- has produced an average of 330 Boe per day with 94% liquids, which is 85% oil for the last 30 days. This production mix is significantly different from the southern part of the play in that it's a much higher percentage of oil. And the production profile is much flatter, thus yielding really good economic returns. Again, being higher value oil and a flatter decline yields very good economics, and we believe this well helps to de-risk a large portion of our acreage.","We've also applied some new completion designs on 4 of our recent wells that, while early, are showing significantly better results. Again, it's early, and this is only 4 wells with 65 days online, but they're performing 45% above the 600 Mboe type curve. We expect to bring online 4 more wells with new completions during the fourth quarter.","In fact, just this week, one of those wells came online, initially moving 780 Boe per day with 82% liquids, and we're pretty sure the oil will go higher as it's only been online a few days.","Importantly, even with these larger designs, the well costs will be flat to our current $3.2 million, which is exceptionally good news. The average 24-hour IP for our Mississippian wells brought online in the third quarter was 622 Boe per day with 75% liquids, and that's our highest average IP for any quarter today. All of this to say, we're seeing real improvement and encouragement in the Mississippian.","Our Conger properties, we continue to closely monitor horizontal Cline and Wolfcamp activity. And of note, we're currently working on 2 7,000-foot laterals, one in the Cline and one in the upper Wolfcamp. The Cline well just started flowback after a 28-stage completion and with only 13% of the load recovered, the well is flowing up casing at over 400 psi, making about 1.2 million a day in gas with 500 barrels of oil, which is over 850 Boe per day. And the pressure, gas rate and oil rate have been steadily increasing for days. These are really encouraging results this early in the flow back, being much better and much sooner than anything we've seen to date.","On the upper Wolfcamp horizontal, we just set pipe on a 7,000-foot lateral, and we'll start to frac in a couple of weeks. As we complete these 2 wells and watch the offset activity, we continue to be very encouraged by the potential that we have on our legacy position for horizontal Cline and for multiple intervals of Wolfcamp development.","I should also point out that we just finished a very successful vertical Wolfberry program this year at Conger, completing 14 wells. One of those wells was a successful step-out to the east side of Conger and is significant in that it sets up potential on the east side of the field.","We believe the EURs on those 14 wells will be consistent with our previous estimates, and the well costs during the year were actually reduced to the $1.9 million range near the end of the program, thereby resulting in very good economics.","Based on this performance, coupled with the step-out on east Conger, we could now have up to 1,000 potential Wolfberry wells at 20-acre spacing at Conger.","Our production guidance for the fourth quarter has us right at the high end of our 20% to 25% year-over-year production guidance, which means the fourth quarter should be about 1 Bcf equivalent per day with 25% liquids. I'd like to point out that we're achieving the high end of our guidance, even though we sold approximately 18 million equivalent per day in production with the New Mexico properties earlier this year.","Also of note in our guidance for the quarter, over half of the new Marcellus fourth quarter wells will be coming online in December and will not have much impact on our 2013 volumes.","In closing, we're exceeding our operating targets. Production is growing at impressive rates, anchored by our growth in the Marcellus and expenses are falling. We have solid marketing and commercial arrangements in place in Appalachia to handle our growth for many years at attractive terms.","We have approximately 1 million net acres in Pennsylvania positioned in the core, meaning both from a gas in place analysis and from a marketing standpoint. When you add up the stacked pay potential, we have more like 2 million net acres in the largest producing field in North America. We believe all of this positions us well to deliver 20% to 25% production growth at industry-leading returns, building shareholder value for many years.","Now we're to Roger.","Roger S. Manny","Thank you, Ray.","Over on the financial side, the third quarter was positive and predictable with another quarter of substantial cash flow growth, approved cash margins and continued unit cost expense reductions.","Revenue from oil, gas and NGL sales, including cash settled derivatives, was $424 million, 20% higher than last year. Cash margins for the quarter of $2.74 per mcfe were up 7% from the third quarter last year and slightly higher than the second quarter of this year.","Cash flow for the third quarter was $244 million, a 29% increase over last year's third quarter, while cash flow per fully diluted share came in at $1.51, 28% higher than the third quarter of 2012.","Third quarter EBITDAX was $286 million, 24% higher than last year. GAAP net income was $19 million for the third quarter, while earnings calculated using analyst methodology, which excludes asset sales, derivative mark-to-market entries, various nonrecurring items, was $57 million or $0.35 per fully diluted share.","As Rodney mentioned earlier, the non-GAAP measures I just mentioned are fully reconciled to GAAP on the various supplemental tables posted to the Range website under the Investor Relations tab.","Looking briefly at our cost performance compared to guidance for the third quarter, all of the cost items came in at or below guidance.","A few of the cost categories warranting special mention. Our third quarter direct operating expense at $0.34 in mcfe, which continues to fall as we build volumes in our low-cost, high-return Pennsylvania shale plays. Third-party transportation, gathering and compression unit cost was $0.69 for the third quarter. Approximately half the favorable variance to guidance, was due to higher volume utilization of existing facilities and the other half was due to a prior adjustment taken during the quarter.","Fourth quarter should see this expense go back to the $0.77 to $0.79 per mcfe range, as additional capacity is added to accommodate future production growth.","Year-to-date, our 6 major unit cost expense categories have declined approximately 9% below year-to-date 2012 levels. Expense guidance for the fourth quarter of this year is set forth in the earnings press release. And looking further out to 2014, we anticipate a reduction in unit cost expense for these same 6 categories of approximately 7%.","There were no significant changes to the Range balance sheet during the third quarter. Though the income statement continues to benefit from the early 2013 refinancing of our higher cost senior subordinated notes into lower coupon notes with longer maturities.","Just last week, the Range bank group unanimously reaffirmed our $2 billion credit facility borrowing base and $1.75 billion credit facility commitment, providing us approximately $1.2 billion in committed available liquidity and approximately $1.5 billion in total available liquidity under the borrowing base.","The third quarter was an active one on the hedging front, as Range added to its 2013, 2014 and 2015 hedge position with additional natural gas, oil and NGL hedges, including propane and butane hedges. The Range website and press release tables contain detailed hedge volumes and prices that investors may use in preparing their estimates.","In summary, the third quarter of 2013 was another solid quarter from a financial perspective, marked by higher production and continued expense control, driving improved cash margins and a 29% year-over-year increase in quarterly cash flow.","Jeff, back over to you.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, looking at the firm transport you added in Marcellus, it's now about 1.5 Bcf a day in 15, would certainly imply a growth trajectory north of 25% if we're just looking at filling those volumes versus FY '13 volumes. If I think about what you've outlined in the Miss and the Permian, it would seem that, that would certainly be putting you on a corporate production growth basis that would be towards the high end of that 20% to 25% for the future years. Can you help me understand why it wouldn't be traversing more towards the high end? Or why you're putting that kind of a range around it at this juncture?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes. I mean, one, we're looking at long term. We really believe it will be 20% to 25% per year for many years. And by many years, we've said it in the past, we think we can double in 3 to 4 years, double again and beyond that. So I'm talking about for 5 to 10 years. For a long, long time, we think we have that kind of growth. And I think importantly, when you look at the gas in place maps in there that I think are significant, it's a new disclosure, it helps to really justify why we believe that. And there's a lot of data and a lot of control for that. So I'd spend some time looking at those, and we'll be glad to work with you on them. And then, what we look at are a variety of things. We look at oil and gas prices. We look at infrastructure buildout. We look at timing. Ray has talked a lot about the pace we've drilled at. And with the pace we've drilled at, how just consistently, year after year, the wells get better and better and better. And I think that will continue, so we really try to roll all those things together. And then the practicality of it is, we work on it. We present it to our board in December and come out with -- to the market sometime usually in late January, early February. But I do believe, we can grow for a long, long time at those rates. Some years, it will be at the high end. Other years, it may be in the middle or low end, and that's a function of product prices and timing and all kinds of other things.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","I appreciate that clarification. And then just thinking about the multi-stacked pays, sort of the gas in place that you talked about. You've outlined how capital efficiency benefits will come from that. When would we really start to see those capital efficiency benefits rule through? And what I mean by that is when do you think you'll be truly developing Upper Devonian or Utica, given that you're only scratching the surface in the Marcellus interval with about 7% of your identified locations drilled at this juncture? So I completely understand that, that drives capital efficiency growth in the long term. But in the short term, can we expect being able to leverage that stacked pay? Or is that something just to highlight longer-term inventory?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","This is Jeff. Let me start and I'm sure Ray or Roger or others will chime in. But one, I think it's really important to look back since we started. Again, I think you've seen capital efficiencies every year, you're right, though, driven by the Marcellus. So we've seen everything, not just production, climbing, but we've seen unit cost in really every single category start to come down. And that will continue on. But you're correct, when you start to add the other horizons, like Ray said, I think that will continue. In the short term, you'll see us -- by short-term, I'm talking about like 2014, a lot of the focus will continue to be on the Marcellus. But like Ray mentioned, and he can talk a little bit more in a minute, you'll see us come out and try a horizontal Utica well in Washington County next year. We're really excited by the prospect. And when you look at the gas in place maps for the Utica and zooming in on page -- if I can get there quickly on Page 13. When you look at the highest amount of gas in place, and we feel good about that, there's a number of control points from old existing wells or even coupled with the modern data and the well just offsetting us about a mile off of our -- the edge of our acreage that has a relatively high rate from a short lateral with not a lot of stages. We feel confident with those maps. So you'll see us try that next year and confirm that, that high rate production that we believe is there. And then you're probably start seeing in '15 and '16 a bigger mix of those types of wells.","Ray N. Walker","Dave, I agree totally with everything that Jeff said, but I want to go back and emphasize what he said earlier. I think we're already seeing a lot of that stuff hit the bottom line. Our unit costs, quarter-to-quarter, we're down, I think, 9%. Our operating expenses are down 15%. We've seen the cost of our facilities on our well sites decrease 15% just from the beginning of this year to today, we've seen our well costs come down and our well performance go up. We are -- at all times, in the Marcellus, we're beginning to go back in to some of these locations that already had the location built. The water impoundment's there. The facilities are already there. We're already doing that in a small way, as we go back in to drill additional 80-acre wells or maybe even to do additional infill well. So I think it's just going to be a gradual process, but we're still very much -- we've only drilled about 7% of the acreage, we've still got a long ways to go. But like Jeff said, we're going to be testing the Utica. We're really confident of what we're going to find there. We've already cracked the code on the Upper Devonian. So we just see a really -- a lot of durability and versatility in our story going forward. And I think that's the real story.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Appreciate that. And maybe just switching real quick to Miss, and I'll let somebody else hop on. When you look at doing these larger fracs there and -- obviously, early days, but increasing the uplift, relative to your previous wells, obviously, that drives the rate of return higher, which would probably put it above, certainly, what you're showing in the Marcellus since they're competitive right now. Does that mean that as we look towards '14, a larger percentage of your CapEx budget could be allocated to the Miss versus the kind of the 17% you're allocating currently?","Ray N. Walker","Well, we're still -- I mean, it's a great question. And we are really, really encouraged by what we see so far. But again, this is only 4 wells. It's only 65 days online. We'll bring 4 more wells on with the same sort of designs in the fourth quarter. We simply need to see more production history on these wells to really understand it. And it's hard to say how long that's going to be, but until we get more data to really support our ability to allocate capital in the Mississippian, we're going to kind of stay at the mode we're at right now and doing some more -- we'll do some more delineation wells. Stepping out, we'll prove up some more areas, and we'll continue to evaluate the larger frac designs. But again, we are highly encouraged. I mean, everything we're seeing right now from the step-out well, from the larger fracs, everything looks really good. But this is still emerging and we'll consider all that when it comes time to recommend a budget to the board in December, and we'll go from there. And I'm sure, we'll announce it like we typically do in February of what our plans are.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just going back to the gas in place maps, can -- I mean, you obviously gave us a lot of color during the prepared remarks. But can you talk about how should we think about recovery factors within those? And I guess, we could go back and do a gas in place number for Range, specifically, but how should we think about just recovery factors in those 3 areas?","Ray N. Walker","Well, that's a great question and it's something we talk about a lot at Range. First of all, I think the industry's ability to estimate the hydrocarbon in place is getting better and better as time goes on. I mean, typically in the past, we underestimated that. I think most of us in the industry, we believe, today, we're still underestimating it some. But we've also seen with the horizontal development, the RCS completions, the better frac designs, the better targeting, there's no doubt that we're pushing our recoveries up into the 30% range, maybe 35% range. But ultimately, there are -- probably, the shale with the most history is the Barnett, which is not really applicable or that analogous anymore to the Marcellus because it's so much better than the Marcellus. But you can see things, hear people talk about recoveries up in the 50% to 60% range. Certainly, we've seen that in unconventional reservoirs like the Cotton Valley and the Wilcox and the Almas [ph] and Jonah Field and places like that. So there's no question it's going to go up into those ranges. But how we get there, how long the laterals are, how close we space them together, do we put them in multiple intervals, all of those questions are yet to be determined. It will be years before we get to that point. But I think if you estimate something in the 25% to 35% range, you're going to cover most of what everybody believes today.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","This is Jeff. Let me throw a little more color on. These -- my gas in place maps -- and remember they're really hydrocarbon in place because liquids are gaseous in the reservoir. But when you look at the maps, you see clearly core spots, like on Slide 11 in the Marcellus, there's one in the northeast and one in the southwest. And the gas in place or hydrocarbon in place is really critical. The other key part of that would be in addition to the map is permeability, which this doesn't encompass. But it's interesting, that at least from my observations, the higher flow rates and the better permeability tend to be in areas where you have the maximum hydrocarbon in place. So I think the recovery factors, when you are in the core of the play -- and then back to that comment, it's really important where your acreage is or you're core or non-core. And that's true of the Barnett or Fayetteville or Haynesville or any play. So in the core, typically the recoveries are higher. And I think in the core parts of the plays, maybe they'll be pushed ultimately, like Ray said, to 40% of 50%. In the non-core areas, they may be very low. When you're out in the no-man's land somewhere, it may be 5% or 0% or -- so where you are in the plays is really critical. And again, I think that's why these maps are so important. If you think about hydrocarbon in place and then rock quality and where they are, were in the Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica, and then sum all 3 together on Slide 14, that's a bull's-eye right on top of our acreage. Going the other way, that's why we leased a lot of the acreage and why acquired and put our roots there.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And are you at -- I don't know, Ray or Jeff, whoever, are you at 30% today?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Well, the other part of that is -- and I'll turn it over to Alan in a minute, Alan Farquharson, who's our Senior Reservoir Engineer. We've drilled historically because we have such a big position. A lot of our wells are 1,000 feet apart. We announced last time that drilling the wells 500 feet apart that we think that's very successful as well and the recoveries may be on the order very high. They're in the book and you can look at them. We've had up to 3 years worth of history on our infills, so I think the 500-foot spacing will work. As well as -- or some of the other partners or not partners -- competitors, actually, in the area have drilled on 500-foot successfully as well. Peers is probably a better word. So it's not just Range that has said that. EQT has successfully drilled on tighter spacing and others. So I think it's a combination of drilling the wells on tighter spacing, 500-foot, say, or whatever it ends up being; better targeting; longer laterals; more RCS; those are the things that will tend to drive it higher. But let me turn it over to Alan.","Alan W. Farquharson","Dave, just to add on to Jeff's comments, it really comes down to, as he said, what your spacing is and how you're completing your wells, et cetera. When you get into these plays early on, I think everyone looks at a relatively low end, in terms of gas in place numbers or at least in terms of recovery factors. And then from there, as you continue to learn from it, you expand your recovery faster based upon well performance. What's great about these wells in the Marcellus is you can see that the ones that Ray alluded to on the call that we've updated performance on, these things are really, really flat in terms of well performance. So you're getting a significant contribution from a near wellbore. With that, we think where we currently are is probably, if you look at about 1,000-foot space in between wells in some of those estimates, the range of what you're given is probably reasonable for where we are in the Southwest. We think that with some of the recent productivity we've seen on our wells up in, like Lycoming County, we think that you're going to possibly see us a significantly higher recovery there, in terms of 1,000-foot spacing. So it's a range of outcomes more than anything else.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Alan, let me ask you a question. For the resource potential numbers that we have in our book for the Marcellus, what do you think the average recovery factor that we're currently using would be?","Alan W. Farquharson","For the resource potential that we're out, excluding the tighter spacing, we are probably in the 25% to 35% range, probably in the low-30s to the 35%. Then, as we added in the infill potential, we think that gets us up into the low- to mid-40s.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","And my point being was leading question. The resource numbers that you'll see from us because we're in the areas of the high hydrocarbon in place and with the good permeability, the bias is those numbers will go up with time.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's all great color. Let me just ask a second question and I'll let somebody else jump in. In your guidance section of the press release, the total wells planned to sell went up to 196 from, I think, it was 173 before. Is that -- and I talked with David about this a little bit last time, but is that just acceleration into '13? And if so, what's kind of going on there with the thought process there?","Ray N. Walker","Yes. Most of that, David, is in the southern Marcellus. And it's the result of -- it is accelerating some wells, but it's because the guys are just getting way more efficient. They're drilling faster and completing faster. At more efficient use of their capital, they're able to put more wells online than we originally planned. So that's why I made real clear that statement that I said in my prepared remarks that more than or a lot of those wells were coming online in the month of December. They're not really going to impact our volumes at all this year. But the well count officially does go up because that's the way we track it, so it's just timing, more than anything.","Operator","And our question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You talked about a Utica well, it sounded like in and around Washington County and it sounded like an industry well that de-risked the formation, at least in you all's mind. Can give a little bit more color here? And then obviously, you talked a lot about southwest PA, getting 540,000 acres. I mean, what percentage -- do you guys have any estimates on what percentage of that may ultimately be developed for the Upper Devonian and Utica?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Yes, that's a great question, Leo. If you flip to Slide 31, you can see it sort of zooms in on our acreage position in and around Washington County. And when we map -- and the key well we're talking about there is that Chesapeake covered well, the 3H. So if you flip to Slide 31 for those of you that can do it real quick on your computers there, the Hubbard well is 1 mile west of our acreage. It's right on the western edge. It tested 11.1 million per day, with a lateral length of 2,900 feet and 8 frac stages, so that was a key test nearby. So you can envision that if you drilled, say, a 7,500-foot lateral or 7,000, 8,000-foot lateral, and you tripled the frac stages from 8 to 24, if it was proportional, that well would be over 30 million per day. Even if you pull it down a bit, you got 25 million to 30 million of per day type potential. A really important point, though, is that's a test nearby. There's other wells that were drilled historically in and around Washington County or, say, in Washington County, that we have control on that were drilled for -- they're old Trenton-Black River tests or deeper tests to give us control points and relatively modern logs to know what the Utica\/Point Pleasant thickness is, what the porosity is, what the water saturation is, what the reservoir pressure is. All those types of things that you use for math to get gas in place.","So when you take all that data -- plus we have a 3D seismic over basically a lot of that acreage. So when you take all that and you integrate that in -- back on Slide 13, you can see that the big bull's-eye, the big red and orange area really lays -- it's across our acreage there. So we have a lot of historical well control in Washington County to generate the map on Slide 13. Then you come back to the Slide on 31, and now we have a recent modern horizontal test. Although it's a very short lateral with not a lot of stages, it had a pretty impressive IP. So back with more optimally targeting the well into the thicker, higher gas in place, we think is better rock quality. We think we have wells that could be 25 million, 30 million per day, if we're successful there and when we get a big acreage position. And then it rolls back into all the comments Ray said. One, is we drill Marcellus wells, which are low risk. We're holding all the depth rights. We're holding up for Devonian, Marcellus and Utica, as well as everything else. And then we have roads infrastructures, gathering and all those types of things. So there'll be the economies of scale. So we look forward to next year to drilling and testing that, and then, ultimately, in 2015 and beyond, starting to roll some of the Utica and Upper Devonian back into our plans.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. Really helpful color here. I guess, is there, based on your mapping and the logs you've seen -- people have drilled through the Utica. I mean, is there kind of a ballpark kind of amount of target acreage? Is it safe to say something like more than half of your acres [indiscernible] perspective, can you throw out any color [ph] about stuff like that?","Jeffrey L. Ventura","Sure, go back to Slide 10 and we tried to do that there. When you look at that dry acreage, we think 400,000 acres of that is perspective. So the orange and red blobs, ultimately, will correspond to about 400,000 acres. 400,000 acres with all that gas in place and you multiply it out and then put a recovery factor on it. If you've noticed, we do not have any Utica resource potential. I think you'll see that come in, in a big way and verified by the well that we'll drill next year.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, just jumping over to transportation. Obviously, guys, you focused a lot of that in your press release and your prepared comments. Can you just maybe just talk about sort of your longer-term transportation goals? I mean, do you guys intend to get a lot of the gas kind of out of the basin, potentially go into the Midwest, Midcon or Southeast? And can you maybe talk about how you see that trending over time in terms of you all's goals?","Chad L. Stephens","Leo, this is Chad. Thanks for the question. As we've seen the play grow and the volume of gas grow, we've focused on diversity, diversity pipelines and transportation, markets and buyers, and how we sell our gas, what industries we sell our gas into that spreads our risk and spreads our opportunity. So yes, we're now looking outside the basin, have been for quite a while, looking to the Midwest and the Southeast. And as we do so and layer in firm transportation, you'll see more of our gas sold at indices outside of the Appalachian basin.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matt Portillo from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions for me. Just back to the Marcellus for a second. With the multiple stacks potential, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about kind of planned pad development. And ultimately, as you guys look at the multitude of horizons here, how you may adjust the number of wells per pad or how that may improve some of the drilling efficiencies you guys are seeing? And then I have a second follow-up question just in regards to your Permian acreage and some of the drilling you're doing there.","Ray N. Walker","Sure, Matt. It's a good question. We typically design these pads for more wells than we actually drill, the first pass-through. We will typically drill anywhere from 2 up to 6 wells per pad in today's world. That's trying to optimize our capital efficiency and that we get economies of scales, the more wells we put on a pad. But yet we're still trying to build infrastructure and delineate all of those different issues by stepping out as much as we can and doing that. As we go back, we have the ability to put a whole lot of wells on there. And I don't know if we could quote a number today because we've had various evolutions of designs as we go forward. But I think there will be a point in time where you could have 20, 30, 40 wells on a pad. There's no question about that. The real technology breakthrough that we need going forward is the ability to do multiple laterals out of a single wellbore. That technology does exist today, but it's extremely expensive. It's just simply cheaper to start over and drill a new grassroots vertical for each well today. But I think there's no doubt that, that's coming down the road. And what the good news is, in our overall long-term design -- and again, I can't stress this enough. We look at this project, really, for a long, long term going forward, 10, 15, 20 years out, because we think we have the resource potential as we've continued to demonstrate with gas in place maps. We keep rolling out more information as we gain confidence in history and have become very confident of what we're putting out there, that we can actually grow this for many years. So that's in all of our plans for midstream infrastructure, whether it's compressors, whether it's processing plants, how we power those compressor stations and processing plants. We're looking at how we would stack wells together, how we would handle condensate on these well site facilities. All of that's going into that plan. So to answer your question, although I can't give you a black-and-white answer, is it's a lot of wells.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And a second follow-up question, just in regards to your Permian drilling program, could you give us a little bit of color on, I guess, just around the acreage that you have in kind of the southern Glasscock area. And then as you guys mentioned, kind of the step-out Wolfberry test, I wanted to know kind of the implication on the number of locations. I think you guys mentioned up to 1,000 locations on 20-acre spacing, and how you may be able to accelerate development if that's kind of successful with incremental delineation here?","Ray N. Walker","Well, let me -- on Page 67 in our presentation, for those of you that can, is a good map showing that. But we have about 100,000 acres -- 90,000 to 100,000 acres, that's all HBP. It's the legacy position. We've got hundreds of wells across it. We've tested virtually all the intervals, pretty much all across the field now at one time or another. Our Wolfberry program this year, we allocated it some additional capital out there. They were making really good progress. I think the wells were -- we were projecting the EURs over 200 Mboe for about $2.3 million. In 14 wells this year, they drove the cost down to less than $2 million down to $1.9 million range and the EURs look like they're going to be at expectations, if not better. So that was a really successful program. One of those wells -- typically, we've shown the Wolfberry potential, on Page 68, as the west edge of that field. One of those wells that we drilled this year was over in the east side. And it's turned out to be a really decent well. We've still got some things to figure out. There's no doubt about. It's one well. It's early, but we think it now potentially opens up 800 more locations. There were 200 20-acre wells on the west side, so this could open up the rest of the field. We say that because we've got so much log data and historical information as we've drilled through it in the years past. As far as the Cline and the Wolfcamp, we potentially have Wolfcamp horizontal potential in multiple Wolfcamp intervals. We're watching that actively closely to the west of us there. And some to the south, there's been some impressive completions. It's very early in the play. We are watching it. The good news is, is all the operators out there, our peers, are trading data and we're all learning from each other as we go. And we felt good enough about it that we've drilled, now, a 7,000-foot Cline, which we're really encouraged by. I mean, we haven't seen any of the wells clean up like this, this early. Our first 3 wells, we were in the 30% to 40% recovery before we saw any real oil or gas production. This well was showing it at 5% or 6%. So pressure's climbing, oil rate's climbing, gas rate's climbing. So we're really excited about this, and hopefully, we can talk about a lot of good news the next time we release information about that well and the Wolfcamp. So it's really encouraging. We think the Cline is perspective across the entire acreage position. And the Wolfcamp, I mean, we just need to get some wells completed and determine that. But again, we have vertical penetrations through it all across the field. So it's pretty encouraging. It's pretty exciting. So we're going to see how these wells do. We'll give it some time, watch the production history, evaluate what we believe we could drive the cost down to, and it may be competitive once we get to that point. But chances are, it can be a really, really good oil play for us.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And just last question there. In regards to that eastern Wolfberry well, is it fair to assume that it was performing fairly close to your western position, as you mentioned kind of encouraging results initially?","Ray N. Walker","Yes. That's fair. Yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Had a couple quick ones. One was going back to those beautiful gas in place maps. You're drawing that 1,050-BTU contour. If I look at the Upper Devonian, I would've thought that would be further to the east since it's stratigraphically higher? Are you being conservative? Is there potential for more wet gas in that Upper Devonian?","Ray N. Walker","Well, the Upper Devonian's only somewhere between 300- and 500-foot shallower than the Marcellus, so from an age standpoint, it's not that much different. So it may be a shift to the -- very slightly, but it's very slightly if at all. Also remember, we've got almost as much information on the Upper Devonian as we do the Marcellus because every time we drill a Marcellus well, we drill through the Upper Devonian. We get a really good indication how thick it is, what's there, every time we go through it. And we've done enough testing now, and us and our peers across the basin, I think, we've got a real good confirmation of those analyses that we've performed to date. So we feel pretty confident in that Upper Devonian map. I mean, there's a lot of data behind that and it should hold up really well.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","The follow-up is kind of further down the road. Have you guys given any thought to how you might develop some of the more Pittsburgh metropolitan area? I mean, clearly, you've had experience in the Barnett in a pretty densely populated area?","Ray N. Walker","The short answer is no. We're not going there. We don't really have experience in the Barnett. I mean, Range never did that in the urban areas, per se. And I don't know -- I mean, there's still a moratorium on drilling inside the Pittsburgh City limits. So I can't imagine anybody wanting to tackle that. The urban development, coupled with the surface topography and all that, it's just going to be a nightmare. So trust me, I used to live there.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","I grew up there. Pittsburgh's a lot older city. It's a lot more urbanized. And we have such a great position in areas where we can operate. So we're going to stay focused where we are.","Operator","We are nearing the ends of today's conference. We will go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America for our final question.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to go back to the 500-foot spacing question, if I may. I wanted to try and understand what this means in terms of your development plan. I know that you're HBP acreage is essentially done. The 80% interference number, I guess, an 80% EUR number, I guess, it was mentioned in the prior presentations. How should we think about the primary development pattern? Are you going after the 1,000-foot first and then do the infills? Or what's the implication if you do the 500-foot from the get-go? And I've got a quick follow-up please.","Ray N. Walker","Well, that's a really interesting question. And to answer your question, we're probably going to do both over the next couple of years. We're actually going back into -- next year into couple of locations to drill some 500-foot infills. So I think several months after we bring those wells online, we'll have data to talk about. We're also going to be looking at some 500-foot grassroots developments. There's a lot of advantages, potentially, to that in that you get a better, more complex fracturing network when you frac the wells closer together, stress shadowing and some of those impacts can be a real positive influence on your results. So we're really interested in all that, and we're starting to develop those things. We took a lot of time to look at our 500-foot spaced wells versus the 1,000-foot spaced wells before we came out with that data earlier this year because we wanted to have a high degree of confidence in what we were putting out. So we feel really confident in those numbers, but again, there could be a lot more potential upside. And again, we only put out data for the wet and super-rich. We will be working on the dry area, too, just to see if -- what the numbers look like there.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My follow-up, I guess, my last question. No one has really talked about the Mississippian too much today. I'm just wondering if you could -- I know you've gone back to the more aggressive fracs. How are you feeling about how that asset has now been de-risked relative to your expectations? And I leave it there.","Ray N. Walker","Well, earlier this year, as all our teams are focused very much on lowering costs and becoming more capital efficient. Earlier this year, we tried some smaller frac jobs and, of course, we talked about on the last call how the results didn't look that good. We've now gone back to pumping a much larger fracs and those wells look really, really encouraging. We're pretty excited about it. And -- but again, it's only 4 wells. It's only 65 days. But they're substantially above the 600 Mboe curve. We did a step-out well that's got really, really good oil production. It's about 85% oil, which is way higher than anything else we've seen. Even with these larger fracs, we're keeping our well costs flat at $3.2 million, and I expect the team will be real successful even driving that down. So we think the play has got a lot of potential. It could be a really nice oil play at 4,500-foot or less. In Oklahoma, I mean, it just doesn't get a lot better than that. So we're pretty excited about it. The team up there is pretty excited. They're doing a great job. But again, we just need more time. We need to make sure that, like we do in all our plays, like we've done in the Marcellus and everywhere we've worked, we try to make really data-based decisions, performance-based and it's all about performance and reserve growth per share and keeping our cost structure low. And all of those things are really important to us, and so were going to take our time and make sure that play is emerging for us. But all indications at this point are really good.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jeff, is the Woodford perspective on your acreage?","Ray N. Walker","I'm sorry, you broke up on the first part of that?","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm sorry. Is the Woodford perspective in your Mississippian acreage?","Ray N. Walker","Yes, there is a some perspective Woodford, especially on the southern end of our acreage. We haven't tested that yet but we're monitoring some offset activity. I think Devon has drilled some wells and there may be a few others now that I hadn't kept up with. But our team up there is watching that really closely, and we may test that at some point.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session.","I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.","Jeffrey L. Ventura","As I stated at the beginning of the call, Range has a very simple story. Given Range's large, high-quality, low-risk acreage position and drilling inventory, we continue to believe that we have 20% to 25% line-of-sight growth for many years. Led by our approximately 1 million net acre position in Pennsylvania, we project that we'll consistently drive up both production and reserves on a per-share basis, net adjusted for years to come. We believe that this plan will translate into substantial shareholder value in the months and years ahead.","Rodney just let me know that there's still at least 15 more people on there that have questions, so I'd encourage you to follow up with our IR team, and we want to get all those questions answered. Really appreciate everybody being on the call. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time."]}}
