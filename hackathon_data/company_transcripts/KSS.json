Welcome to the Kohl\u2019s Q2 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call.","Certain statements made on this call, including projected financial results, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Kohl\u2019s intends forward-looking terminology, such as believes, expects, may, will, should, anticipates, plans or similar expressions, to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause Kohl\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements.","Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those that are described in Item 1A in Kohl\u2019s most recent annual report on Form 10-K, as well as maybe supplemented from time-to-time in Kohl\u2019s other filings with the SEC, all of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.","Also, please note that replays of this recording will not be updated. So if you are listening after August 14, 2014, it is possible that the information discussed is no longer current.","At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I will now like to turn the conference to our host, Mr. Wes McDonald, Chief Financial Officer of Kohl\u2019s Department Stores. Please go ahead.","Wes McDonald","Thank you. With me today is Kevin Mansell, Chairman, CEO and President. I\u2019ll walk through our results for the quarter and Kevin will give us some more color in terms of merchandising and marketing, and then we will end the call and take your questions.","Our comps sales decreased 1.3% for the quarter. Components of the comp were as follows, average unit retail up 3%, units per transaction down 1.1% for an average transaction value increase of 1.9%. Transactions per store decreased 3.2%.","Total sales for the quarter were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 1.1% from the second quarter last year. Year-to-date comp sales decreased 2.3% and total sales decreased 2.1% to $8.3 billion. Kevin will share some more details on our sales in a couple of minutes.","Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 39.0%, which were 6 basis points lower than the second quarter of last year. All of our decrease can be attributed to a higher mix of lower margin sales. For the spring season, our margin rate increased 16 basis points over last year.","Our SG&A expenses decreased 2% and leveraged 20 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Our credit card business reported a $13 million increase in revenues this quarter. In our stores, both store payroll and controllable costs decreased as did our overall corporate expenses.","Our retail distribution centers reported lower costs but our E-Commerce fulfillment centers reported higher costs. Advertising expenses were also higher as we continue our efforts to drive traffic to the stores and online, year-to-date SG&A decreased 1% and deleveraged 30 basis points.","Depreciation expense decreased $3 million to $222 million for the quarter. Most of the decrease is due to the maturing of our store fleet.","Net interest expense was $85 million for the quarter up $1 million due to the $300 million debt that we issued in September 2013. Our income tax rate was 36.6% for the quarter. This is lower than we expected as we had a favorable state audit tax settlement during the quarter.","Net income was slightly better than last year for the quarter and diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $1.13 for the quarter. Year-to-date, EPS increased 2% to $1.73. Net income was $232 million for the quarter and $357 million year-to-date.","Consistent with Q1, we ended the quarter with 1,160 stores, gross square footage of 100.34 million and selling square footage of 83.72 million. This fall, we open -- we plan to open four stores including one store that was temporarily closed in the first quarter for a complete rebuild.","We completed 16 remodels during the quarter. This is an addition to the 15 that were completed in the first quarter. We have two more remodels which will be completed later this month.","Capital expenditures were $374 million for the first half of 2014, $90 million higher than the first half of 2013. The increase is a combination of earlier remodels, the purchase and build-out of our Texas call center and higher IT spending.","We ended the quarter with $746 million of cash and cash equivalents and generated almost $300 million of free cash flow for the season.","Inventory per store was 1% higher than at the end of last year\u2019s second quarter but units were 3% lower, excluding receipts that we accelerated into the second quarter in anticipation of a purchase order system upgrade for some of our replenishment merchandise, inventory per store decreased low single digits.","Additionally, clearance units are down almost 20% from the end of Q2 last year. AP as a percent of inventory increased from 36.2% at quarter end 2013 to 37.9% this year. The increase is primarily due to timing of inventory receipts.","For those of you looking to update your models, our second quarter weighted average diluted shares were 205 million and we had 204 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.3 million shares of our stock.","On August 12th, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.39 per diluted share, which is payable September 24th to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 10th.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide additional insights on our results.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks, Wes. As Wes mentioned, our second quarter comps decreased 1.3%, which was consistent with the expectations included in our annual guidance. More importantly, we saw strong improvement throughout the quarter. Results were especially strong in July as we reported a positive comp for the first time in several months.","I\u2019m especially pleased but not surprised by the renewed momentum in our E-Commerce business. Last year, our E-Commerce sales were affected by the re-platform from July through October. July sales this year returned to rates that we have not seen since updating our platform last summer, they ran up over 30%.","On a regional basis in our stores, the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions which have underperformed in recent quarters outperformed the store average. Warmer weather and pent-up demand contributed to the improvement.","The Southeast and the West regions also outperformed the store average, both regions have consistently outperformed other regions over the last two years, and the Midwest and South Central underperformed the store average.","On a line of business basis, home was the strongest business, with solid comps in both luggage and electrics. Children\u2019s was also positive and was driven by the infant toddler business, including new non-apparel online offerings and the Jumping Beans Disney partnership.","Footwear outperformed the company but was slightly negative, athletic shoes were again the strongest category. Men\u2019s and accessories were consistent with the company. Men\u2019s was led by young men\u2019s and active, and accessories saw significant strength in beauty.","Women\u2019s was slightly below the company. We are extremely pleased with the progress we are seeing in our Juniors business. Juniors outperformed the company with the strongest women\u2019s category for the second consecutive quarter and produced a strong positive comp. Active also produced a positive comp.","As you know, national brands are a key component of our greatness agenda and one of the many areas that we are focused on to increase traffic and grow sales. National brand comps were higher than private and exclusive comps for the fourth consecutive quarter and were positive for the first time in many quarters. Year-to-date, national brand penetration has increased 90 basis points to 46% of sales.","As we enter the back-to-school season, we are encouraged by the sequential sales improvement that we experienced throughout the second quarter. I believe our customers will be excited by the newness that they find in our stores when shopping online this fall.","In mid-September, we will launch both IZOD and Juicy Couture. IZOD will bring another strong national brand to our men\u2019s sportswear and dress clothing department, which already include brands such as Nike, adidas, Levi\u2019s, Van Heusen and Converse.","Similarly, Juicy Couture, a proven casual luxury brand will offer another exciting athleisure apparel option, as well as handbags, fashion jewelry, bedding and home accessories.","To expand our offerings in the rapidly growing active and wellness area, we are excited to introduce the Puma brand in spring 2015 in a number of stores and Gaiam Yoga product this quarter both in-store and online.","In addition to adding new brands to our existing portfolio of powerful and well-recognized brands, we will be introducing a number of notable improvements to the shopping experience.","We will be piloting buy online, pick up in store at approximately 100 stores this fall. Once successful, the pilot will be rolled out to all stores nationwide. Buy online, pick up in store provide our customers with another option to shop when they want and where they want.","Our loyalty program is currently available to customers in approximately one-third of our stores. The response to that program has been incredibly positive. We will be rolling out the program to the remainder of the chain in October just in time for holiday shopping.","I believe that will eventually be more impactful than our industry-leading private brand credit card program and allow us to create a much more emotional and personal connection with our customer.","Just as exciting as the new loyalty program is a new beauty department. The new beauty environment was completed in an additional 47 stores in July and will be expanded to another 178 stores in August and September.","Stores with a new beauty department continue to outperform other stores, both in the beauty department and across the entire store. We continue to see lifts versus our control groups of approximately 2% in the higher volume stores.","From a marketing perspective, we continue to explore disruptive and surprising new ways to reach our customers. More broadly, we continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing strategies and modify channels as necessary to ensure we are maximizing the return on our advertising investment.","Finally, by the end of the third quarter, approximately 800 of our stores will be equipped to fulfill online orders. We think this will improve shipping times and provide additional e-fulfillment capacity during the peak holiday season.","Last quarter, I walked you through our greatness agenda, amazing product, personalized connections, easy experience, winning teams and incredible savings. These are the pillars of our greatness agenda.","These are the fundamentals that drive our day-to-day operations and our long-term decisions, but perhaps more importantly these pillars are a unifying strategy for more than 140,000 Kohl\u2019s associates in our stores, merchandise, distribution, credit, IT and other corporate functions.","I\u2019m pleased with the positive momentum that the greatness agenda has already generated and I\u2019m confident that this momentum will continue to grow throughout the back-to-school and holiday season.","In closing, as part of our practice of issuing annual earnings guidance at the beginning of each fiscal year, we plan to provide an update to this guidance once per year, typically at the end of the third quarter. We may choose to provide additional updates to our guidance in the event of extraordinary circumstances.","With that, we will be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we will go to Charles Grom with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Good morning, Kevin. Good morning, Wes.","Wes McDonald","Hey, Charles.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Just wondering if you could give a little flavor for the sequential trend in the quarter if you could quantify that for us and if you could give us any color on August sales and just amplify your commentary on back-to-school?","Wes McDonald","For the second quarter, I think the way we would characterize it is it was consistent improvement over the quarter and it ended with positive comps in July, up 2% and the strongest part of the July period was definitely the end of the month at the beginning of the back-to-school period. We don\u2019t comment on in quarter sales results but I would just say that the start to back-to-school as indicated from our July performance was exceptionally strong.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just to clarify, so going forward, we shouldn\u2019t expect to get a guidance update from you guys at the end of the first or second quarter and the practice will be to, just give an update at the end of the third quarter, so should we take away that you are still comfortable with the 405 to 445 view?","Wes McDonald","I mean, that, first of all, the facts you have, that\u2019s correct, that plan is we will give annual guidance at the beginning of the year. We think it\u2019s probably appropriate at the end of the third quarter when 60% to 65% of our sales and earnings are in that we would update it.","We just don\u2019t think it serves any purpose to provide continual updates on an interim basis absent some extraordinary circumstances. Something that would cause shareholders to believe we were deviating from our plan for the year, we would definitely inform everybody.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Okay. Great. And then, just if you could expand on the progress of the head merchant search and when we should expect to hear that announcement?","Wes McDonald","Sure. I mean, the search continues, we are making, what I would describe as excellent progress. I think I indicated earlier in the year, Chuck, that my objective was always to finish this search in sufficient time prior to our already scheduled end of October Analyst Day, so that the new leadership team would be in place and I don\u2019t see anything that would preclude us from doing that at this point.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Okay. Great. See you in October. Thanks.","Wes McDonald","Thanks.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan","Hey. Good morning, guys. So you guys have a number of initiatives, which should be accretive to back half comps, we\u2019ve talked about E-Commerce, loyalty, beauty? I guess what is the best way to think about the core underlying base? Now what are we building off of and any initiatives to the core?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, obviously, we are highly focused on the improvement in the core underlying trend. We\u2019ve put a lot of focus in the third and fourth quarter just because as you indicated many of the drivers of the incremental traffic are all happening beginning this September, October, but we are highly focused on underlying trends.","So as an example, that is why we are talking about the improvement in our Juniors business because that is clearly, as you know, Matt, been a drag on our business and that is no longer the case.","I think home is probably another good indicator of how we are focused on the underlying trend. That has, in the recent past been a bit of a drag on our overall underlying trend and that looks like it is improving a lot. Wes, I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add?","Wes McDonald","Yeah. I mean, I think, when Kevin talked about the July comp being positive too, that didn\u2019t all come from E-Commerce. We got a lot better in the brick-and-mortar stores as well.","I think the basis really is to get the stores to run in a flat comp and then with the E-Comm growth, we can get to the two and hopefully once we get some momentum from all these initiatives, we can do better than that. But the key is to get the brick-and-mortars from running negative to flat that\u2019s what the rest of the businesses have to do over and above all the initiatives we\u2019ve talked about.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan","Great. And then in terms of July and it sounds like early August in the back half, I mean is it traffic that you really saw as the difference here in same-store sales or I guess, anyway you can break down some of the components of that plus 2 that you saw in July to help us think about the opportunity looking forward?","Kevin Mansell","Well, Wes, can give you that better\u2026","Wes McDonald","Yeah. I mean, traffic definitely has to improve and did in July. So that\u2019s good. The average transaction value should remain relatively constant for us to get back into consistently running a positive comp. We have to get traffic at least to flat.","Kevin Mansell","And then in terms of drivers on a category basis, I think, pretty much across the board the back-to-school businesses were strong, some of them were exceptionally strong.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan","Great. Best of luck, guys.","Wes McDonald","Thanks.","Operator","And next we will go to Oliver Chen with Citi. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen - Citi","Congratulations on really solid results and momentum. Regarding your inventory levels and the clearance being down year-over-year, does that bode well for the gross margins in the back half and if you could speak to, I mean, your comments about a higher mix of lower margin sales, will that trend continue, if you could just help us understand the puts and takes in that line item, that would be great?","Kevin Mansell","I will touch, Oliver, on the inventory and maybe, Wes, can give you some more color on the mix opportunity. On the inventory level, I actually think we feel like we are in great position on inventory.","We would have easily achieved our original goals of a low single digit decline in inventory per store but we made, I think, a really strong strategic decision to accelerate receipts on what we thought could be a slowdown coming in the dock strike possibility.","And secondly, we just launched, I think, Wes referred to it, a new PO system and just to avoid any complications as we move through that process, we accelerated basic replenishment receipts.","So, more broadly, I think your question is about inventory management and I think, Wes, would probably tell you, we feel better about our inventory management right now than we have in a long time and generally, that is certainly the driver of merchandise margin and if we manage inventories right, we will come out well on margin.","Wes McDonald","Yeah. I mean, the goal for the back half would be to be slightly down at the end of the third quarter and then down sort of 3% to 4% at the end of the year, is kind of what we are driving towards.","In terms of low margin versus high margin businesses, it\u2019s really just a reflection honestly that home and kids performed better than some of our other areas, kids is a business that is obviously very price-sensitive and carries a lower margin than the company and we had very strong business.","And our home business mostly in the hard side of home and electrics, which is also a little bit lower, so I expect as we get through the back half that hopefully all six lines of businesses will improve and the mix won\u2019t be an issue, but it was still just slightly down to last year.","Oliver Chen - Citi","Okay. And the comparisons you use in third quarter but then get a little harder in fourth quarter? Is there anything we should know as we look at our models on the GM line?","Kevin Mansell","No, I mean, I think that the important things to note about the fall and holiday are that all of the key initiatives that we\u2019ve talked about since the beginning of the year to drive our business. Our E-Commerce acceleration, our beauty rollout, our loyalty launch, our national brand focus are on target, on time and scheduled to happen. So I think it is a lot less about the comparisons and a lot more about the initiatives taking hold to drive the business.","Wes McDonald","Having said all that, I would expect more improvement in the fourth quarter than the third. That is just the way it normally happens. Most of your agreements with vendors in terms of margin occur on a seasonal basis, so you will settle up in the second and fourth quarter and that is where I would expect to see the most improvement.","Oliver Chen - Citi","And our last question on a follow-up is the junior\u2019s performance was very exceptional. What do you think is happening there in terms of your success and your back-to-school trends sound really encouraging. How do you attribute that, it feels like there is a bit of a mixed consumer picture, so you are likely gaining share?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I think juniors has been improving. So it is not necessarily brand new. I think we probably ran a positive comp in the first quarter as well in juniors, so we saw some traction. While it might not have been positive in the fourth quarter last year, the trend was clearly moving in the right direction.","So I think fundamentally there is a great leadership team in place in our juniors business. They are definitely delivering on our focus on narrower assortments but deeper assortments. They are definitely delivering on speed to market with exciting new product and styles. So I think it is the fundamental pieces of our business that are definitely driving it, but it\u2019s not necessarily brand new, I think, Wes.","Wes McDonald","Juniors, I think has been improving for -- this is the fourth quarter in a row. It\u2019s been on an upward trend.","Oliver Chen - Citi","Thank you. Best regards.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Yes, good morning, Kevin and Wes. Just going back to your comments on the loyalty program, I know one-third of the stores have it today. Could you quantify or remind us what is the performance of those stores versus the rest of the chain?","And then also if you could just clarify the comments you made about the beauty, the stores with the beauty concepts? I believe you said it -- those stores are outcomping the rest of the base by 2%. Is that correct?","Wes McDonald","Yeah, loyalty is 150 basis points basically. That\u2019s been pretty consistent. That is what we have built into our expectations going forward. The Milwaukee launch that we just did had the same initial lift after a couple of months as Texas and California did. So we would expect it to achieve at least that, if not better. And so I feel pretty comfortable with that lift.","The beauty stores, we are getting so far just a lift in the higher volume stores. So it\u2019s the sort of more than $15 million, that\u2019s what we are talking about on the 2% lift. The stores under $15 million tend to have a very significant lift in beauty, but we are not seeing an overall lift in the store quite yet.","We have tested a new configuration in those lower volume stores that provides a little bit better environment for the product to really pop. And we haven\u2019t gotten enough months behind us yet to read that. That is just getting installed right now in about 80 stores. So we will have more to talk about on the third quarter call perhaps, but certainly on the fourth quarter call on that.","But we are very confident that we are going to get a lift in beauty in those higher volume stores. And we have actually accelerated the number of stores next year to do close to 400 stores to roll out beauty next year, which will give us at the end of \u201815 close to 900 stores.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, a thing I would add to that, Paul, is I think Wes would agree that the evolution of these two initiatives, while perhaps seemingly painfully slow to you, to us, they have allowed us to learn along the way and then evolve the final product that gets delivered to the customer in a great way.","And so the loyalty -- Wes is using a loyalty in this existing historical result of a lift of 1.5% and that\u2019s definitely the right way to look at it. But the product that we will now deliver to customers in October, I believe, and Wes would echo is a better consumer product and that\u2019s why we are so optimistic about the results on the other two-thirds of the store.","Beauty, I think is identical to that. We are focused on higher volume stores first naturally because we have seen that work. And so we are going to move forward. The lower volume stores got the lift in beauty, but not the lift in the whole store. And so we made adjustments and those adjustments are now coming to fruition in the stores we are launching right now. I think our expectation is they are going to address that issue and we will see similar kinds of lifts in those stores.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Moving to SG&A, it was a good performance in 2Q. But I believe the credit benefit helped by about 30 basis points or so in the quarter, how should we think about credit or what are you forecasting for the second half and are there any other factors that may swing growth rates in expense?","Wes McDonald","Yeah, credit did better than I anticipated. In fact, most of the lines versus our plan, you guys always focus on last year, but almost every one of our areas beat their SG&A expense plan in the quarter. The two that did not were for strategic reasons.","We are spending more money in our ESCs to drive speed through the facility to get product to the customers faster and also do what we would call practice peak every day. So we are able to meet the big spike in demand, that\u2019s going to occur in the fourth quarter.","And then from an advertising perspective, we are doing a lot of testing in terms of things regarding personalization and different ways to drive traffic to both stores and online. And some of those have been successful and worked well, some of them didn\u2019t work, but that is why you test.","So going forward for the fall, we are not going to spend less money than last year, that\u2019s for sure. And we also have to roll out beauty, which requires additional payroll that wasn\u2019t in there last year as well as loyalty, which is also going to require SG&A. I would look at the SG&A guidance we gave for the year and bank our good performance for the spring, but kind of go back and look at what we guided for the year.","I\u2019d say for the year we should be closer to the low end of our guidance than the high end, but it is definitely going to be higher than what we experienced this spring.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Lastly and very quickly, the buyback guidance of about $1 billion for the year, is that still your target, Wes?","Wes McDonald","Yes, it\u2019s still our target. I mean, we have been pretty consistent in what we do. We put in a target for 250 every quarter. We put in a grid, we let it run. This year, it got -- this quarter, it got a lot closer to the 250. There is room to go above that within the plan that we filed.","So it\u2019s possible we could get to $1 billion, but it is also possible we could get under. We\u2019ll continue to put that grid in and target 250. So if we were -- if we hit it, we would be at $900 million for the year. But if the stock moved in a direction that was lower, we\u2019d buy more and get closer to the $1 billion. But I\u2019d say right now I\u2019d achieve $900 million and it could be higher than that.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Good luck, guys.","Operator","My next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America","Thank you. Good morning. Could you talk about drivers behind the higher AUR this quarter?","Wes McDonald","A lot of that is national brand, right. We are focusing in on national brand. That carries a higher AUR and they have outperformed four quarters in a row and run positive comps. So it is not that like items are higher than last year. It\u2019s really just a lot to do with the mix of business.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America","And then on the remodels, any analysis behind those that tells you what types of returns you are getting and what should we expect in the out years?","Kevin Mansell","Sure. I mean, that is definitely a topic that we will be talking about pretty thoroughly at the end of October at the Analyst Day meeting. We\u2019re trying to look at refreshing our stores in a new and different way, Lorraine. So the traditional way that we might have done it in the past, which would be to go into a store and completely remodel that store, that will still be in place for stores that definitely need that, stores that haven\u2019t been touched in a while or stores that are more mature or stores that are very heavily shopped, high-volume stores?","But we are also trying to take a different view and say what are we doing that would create a new experience in every store, not just in a subset of stores that we are going to spend capital on, on a remodel. And we are going to go into quite a bit of detail on that at the Analyst Day. And it\u2019s going to be everything from technology improvements, new creative ways to give the customer a new shopping experience, new ideas that we are going to implement. And we\u2019ll definitely -- it is a key topic for the Analyst Day meeting. But we don\u2019t have any news to share with you on our remodel program far beyond this year.","Wes McDonald","Yes, I guess the best way to think about it is, in the last four years, we spent roughly $300 million to $350 million in what I would call store refresh initiatives. But remodels used to be $100 million this year on our net stores -- and this year, they are $33 million. There\u2019s just a lot of initiatives that we have that are touching every store instead of just a subset.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question id from Paul Swinand with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar","Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on both the national brands and the beauty initiative. Is that attracting a new customer or is that just selling a higher price product, a higher end product to the existing customer base?","Kevin Mansell","If you take them one at a time, both of them are intended to do both. Both of them are intended to drive our transaction value in the store. The key proponent propelling, so for both of those initiatives, is really all about driving visits. And I think, Wes, on the beauty side of the business, we are definitely\u2026","Wes McDonald","Definitely skewing younger on the younger side of that with more -- we get more customers in the 18 to 34-year old range than we had previously.","Kevin Mansell","On the beauty initiative, I think we are also getting more visits.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar","Yes.","Wes McDonald","I\u2019m sorry. So there\u2019s actually more transactions happening in the stores in which we launch beauty. The national brand initiatives is probably a little tougher for us to analyze the visits versus the transaction value. But as Wes said, it has really been the driver of AUR increases because we are not really increasing individual AURs, but the mix is causing the AUR to go up.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar","Okay, got it. And then just think about -- I think you mentioned the unit per transaction and the transactions per store being down. Is there any way to analyze that further? Some people are talking about customers targeting stuff online and even if they don\u2019t buy it, buying it in the store, but then not spending as much time shopping. Is there any analysis -- further analysis you can add or color you can add to that?","Kevin Mansell","I mean traffic, transactions per store for the most part have been the issue with our comps for the last few years. So that\u2019s why we are focusing on increasing and that is a function of better product and better marketing. So I don\u2019t really have a better answer for you on that.","Wes McDonald","I mean, as you well know, traffic into brick-and-mortar stores is generally a focus of probably most brick-and-mortar retailers. Many of the initiatives we are talking about, Paul, are definitely designed to push people into our stores by giving them a new, a different and sometimes unexpected experience from the one they have had in the past.","Those include things like buy online, pickup in store because we think that the convenience that that provides will really give customers another reason to make a visit that they otherwise might not have made. So it is all about traffic. I mean that\u2019s what we are focused on. It is all about traffic.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar","Okay, great. Best regards and best of luck back-to-school and going into the holidays.","Wes McDonald","Thank you.","Kevin Mansell","Thank you.","Operator","Then we\u2019ll go to Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Hi, good morning, guys.","Kevin Mansell","Hi Bob.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Kevin, couple questions. The first one, I think you said national brands. So this was the fourth consecutive quarter that comps in national brands were higher than private brands. Wes, can you give us an update on what you are seeing on the gross margin impact as that mix is shifting and like your updated thoughts around it from what they were previously?","Wes McDonald","Excellent question, Bob. It\u2019s the same as I have been telling everybody. It\u2019s been around 5 basis points of mix headwinds. So that really didn\u2019t have anything to do with the margin deterioration that I spoke earlier. It was really a function of where the comps increased and just overall business, not really a mix issue with national versus private and exclusive.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Got it. And then, Kevin, on the E-Commerce business, like the sort of revival that you are seeing. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunities in the back half of the year? I don\u2019t know if this is Wes or Kevin, but like the profit opportunities that you see and sort of how you are planning differently than you experienced in the second half of the year last year?","Kevin Mansell","Sure. I mean, I think the first focus, of course, we have, Bob, is on the top line. So we had, as you remember, a huge technology replatform of our E-Commerce interface that happened during the third quarter last year and it dramatically changed the pace of our sales growth for a period of time.","That is now in front of us and we think that\u2019s probably an unbelievable opportunity to drive top-line sales. We are probably more confident about that today because we just came out of the first month of that three or four month last year replatform and we ran well over a 30% increase in E-Commerce. So there\u2019s a lot of confidence about what E-Commerce sales are going to look like in the third quarter due to the anniversary of the replatform. Beyond that, there is a whole bunch of merchandise initiatives that are in place that we think are going to drive the top lines in E-Commerce.","On the bottom line, in terms of improving profitability, I would say our focus there is probably more on the fulfillment side. As you remember in the fourth quarter, while our topline sales on E-Commerce started to improve again, we really had some significant difficulties serving the customers through our infrastructure and we have had a year to plan and prepare for that.","We\u2019ve strengthened the organization. We have strengthened the process. We have strengthened facilities. We have gone from 200 stores to 800 stores in Ship from Stores. We are utilizing third-party providers on high velocity items. We have essentially changed almost the entire process of fulfilling in our EFCs. We\u2019ve made management and leadership changes in that area as well. And so I think all of us feel like one thing we are going to do this year for sure is serve the customer a lot better. And I think fundamentally that will lead to a better result in the bottom line.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Got it. Again, and then just one last question for you, Kevin. In the juniors business, can you just talk about -- has the grunge revival trend been a positive factor in what you are seeing there at all?","Kevin Mansell","You\u2019ve stumped me again, Bob. And the fact that you can answer -- ask these questions without laughing are beyond my belief. I will have to get back to you, but we will make sure Wes gets back to you with a succinct answer on that. Thanks, Bob.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Thanks Kevin.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo","Thanks, guys. I just want to go back to July for a second. Curious from a promotional perspective, was that part of the strength in July, was it more of a promotional month? Did that play a role in driving that positive comp that you saw? And then second, just looking out to IZOD and Juicy, can you just talk about what brands will be displaced by the introduction of those two? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell","On the month of July, no, I mean the promotional calendar was essentially identical to last year. And we had pretty good strength throughout the month. But as I said, when back-to-school took hold in the third week and then particularly in the fourth week, that trend of business improved quite a bit. It also improved particularly in those back-to-school businesses in areas like juniors, areas like young man, areas like kids.","So I would say no, promotional calendar, our timetable, our discounting really didn\u2019t, as I see, play any role in the performance. Broadly, IZOD and Juicy have taken space from some of our proprietary brands and without getting into detail about how many fixtures this brand lost or this brand lost. I mean, just in general that\u2019s kind of where the investment in inventory came from.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo","Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks.","Wes McDonald","Thanks","Operator","And we\u2019ll got to Dan Binder with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Binder - Jefferies","Hi, good morning. Just a couple points of clarification, on the high-volume stores for beauty, I was just wondering if you could just give us a rough idea of how many or what percentage of the store base falls into that high-volume category?","Wes McDonald","60%.","Dan Binder - Jefferies","60%. And then on the credit income of $13 million, I was just curious how much of that was actually above your expectation?","Kevin Mansell","Wes is looking right now I think.","Wes McDonald","For the quarter, it was a couple million above our plan.","Dan Binder - Jefferies","Okay. And then on the cash flow side, you obviously have great free cash flow characteristics, a little bit behind on the buyback versus the 250 per quarter, any thoughts about doing an ASR or perhaps taking the dividend payout ratio up?","Kevin Mansell","But at this day, each of those decisions is something, of course, we regularly discuss at the Board level. We are committed to the current guidance we have given on dividend. It\u2019s a discussion every year, so that could change at the beginning of next year and we might decide to do something different. I think Wes answered the share buyback ","Wes McDonald","Yeah. We did an ASR. We didn\u2019t feel like it was very beneficial to us at the time. I would be hard-pressed to see a situation where we would do that again. I think the more consistent way to do it is better. Like Kevin said, visiting the dividend payout ratio is something we will do at the end of the year with the Board.","We obviously have a lot more people invested in the stock that are interested in value and dividend. So that would -- take that into account every year when we talk about what we want to do for next year. But we are committed to increasing it at least 10% annually and we will take a look at that at the end of the year.","Dan Binder - Jefferies","And then on the back-to-school business, I think a lot of industry observers would say that that could be a precursor to a good holiday. Just kind of your thoughts broadly as you looked over the years what you think that tells you about your holiday, if it is telling or not telling?","Kevin Mansell","I think last year we had a really good back-to-school business and then business died mid-September. So I am not sure. When you do the math on the correlation, there is a little bit of a correlation there. But I think every year is different, every year is volatile. Weather for us is a big factor. I think we just got to continue to focus on our initiatives and getting better product. And hopefully we can continue the improving trend we had in the quarter.","Dan Binder - Jefferies","And lastly, on brands, you started this sort of new flow of brands each quarter, every other quarter. Any thoughts as you look beyond Puma, areas that you want to add brands and if you\u2019ve got stuff that\u2019s work in progress?","Kevin Mansell","Sure. I mean areas that we\u2019ve talked about in the past around our key initiatives would be areas we are highly focused on. So the active and wellness initiative, which is one of the major moves we are making underneath the pillar of amazing product. Active and wellness is going to be a category that we are going to continue to add new classifications as well as new brands.","I think a category like beauty, the results are creating an environment that we have a good story to tell. So we are going to be highly focused on trying to add more brands to our beauty portfolio. It is working and I think people are recognizing it is working.","Unexpected product is also another bold move that we are focused on underneath amazing product. And so we are trying to find opportunities that might make customers who visit our stores view the experience in a different and unique way. So we will probably talk a little bit more about that at the end of October. But we do think that is an opportunity as well.","Dan Binder - Jefferies","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter in a tough market out there. Kevin, I know you said a couple times that E-Commerce accelerated 31st July, better than 31st. Would you mind giving us what it was for the full quarter just so we can have it in our models and track that trend?","Wes McDonald","We are trying to -- it is starting to get blurred when we start to do both of this. I would tell you it is something we are not going to really be giving out going forward. The only reason we called it out in July, there was a lot of notes out there that doubted our ability to achieve the bump in E-Commerce that we said we were going to achieve and that\u2019s why we put it out there.","But the only thing I would tell you is it was a better increase for the quarter than it was in the first quarter. And we would expect it to continue to be better in the third and fourth quarters as well.","Kevin Mansell","Yes, I mean, in fact, the commentary on E-Comm in the second quarter is something that would fall under the extraordinary circumstances that we talked about because, last year, we were entering this period of the replatform and our sales dramatically slowed for a period of about four months almost total, 3.5 for sure.","So we thought it was really important in this particular case to kind of give you transparency and visibility into the dramatic acceleration as we hit that period. But in total, you want to just stick with Wes\u2019 earlier comment, which is we are planning I think E-Comm to contribute around 200 basis points. It is just going to get greater and greater and greater as we launch buy online, pickup in store.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Sure, okay. One thing with the different initiatives, I guess, of two of the big ones, beauty and loyalty. Are there any markets where those two intersect where you have got beauty and loyalty up and running in the stores at the same time and maybe you could talk a bit about those? I am trying to think about whether those stores are adding to the big goal that you guys keep talking about, which is traffic positive at brick-and-mortar?","Kevin Mansell","There definitely are markets in which stores have an intersection of loyalty and beauty. We don\u2019t really -- we haven\u2019t really launched beauty in a market environment. Now we are getting ready to. We are launching beauty in all stores in some markets in order to then market around that.","So Michelle\u2019s team will have an opportunity to start communicating that and as we get results on that, I think we will be able to provide visibility into it. But right now, it is sort of a case where there are stores in let\u2019s say, Milwaukee that have beauty and stores that don\u2019t, but the whole market has loyalty.","Wes McDonald","We try to keep them as separate as possible to be honest to try to measure the individual contributions.","Michael Binetti - UBS","I mean, is your instinct that we could see traffic turn positive as we get an intersection of these?","Kevin Mansell","","Well, that is certainly the goal for sure.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Okay.","Kevin Mansell","The assumptions that we are making, Wes covered pretty well. But whether or not, the goal all along has been to acknowledge that there is no single silver bullet to change our trend in traffic and it is going to require the intersection of a number of different initiatives all taking hold across the company. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll get positive traffic and that\u2019s the goal, but we are not relying -- Wes, jump in here but we are not relying on any of these individually to make it happen.","Wes McDonald","Yeah. I mean, what we really need is to have every line of business do what juniors did and move in the right direction absent all these initiatives and the initiatives would kind of be the gravy on top.","Michael Binetti - UBS","And Wes, I guess one last question, as we talked earlier in the year, I think you guys obviously, had a number of execution issues on top of the replatforming last year online. And the margins for the online business were a big concern of yours earlier in the year. Obviously, you\u2019ve got the replatform causing some accelerated E-Comm sales and it sounds like, Kevin, you said you have got some contingencies in place to make sure you guys can execute as we head into peak periods in the holiday.","If we try to add all that up, is there -- what\u2019s your thinking that\u2019s baked into how you guys have guided us for the year as far as what the opportunity is on margins to improve the E-Commerce business in the back half? Thank you.","Kevin Mansell","Honestly, we are focused on sales. And we are making assumptions on profitability in E-Commerce based on our past historical experience. That is what is really kind of driving it. Our focus is on the sales line and our focus is on the customer service line, as I covered earlier. It\u2019s all about how do we drive sales with our new platform and our new customer engagement in E-Comm. And secondly how do we give the customer an incredible experience like the one she gets in our stores every day. And where that leads to on the P&L basis strictly in E-Comm, we are working on, but we are not making any assumptions I would say that there is going to be some dramatic turnaround in profitability in E-Comm short-term.","Wes McDonald","I would say it is not going to be a headwind, but I don\u2019t expect a big tailwind either.","Michael Binetti - UBS","All right. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. This is somewhat of a follow-up to other questions on the call, but with E-Commerce now growing 30% plus. Can you just discuss some of the differences in trends in that channel versus the stores to help us evaluate how much is incremental versus how much is coming at the expense of the stores, for example, details on the customer overlap category performance?","Kevin Mansell","I mean, generally the answer is no. Because, as I said earlier, we are really just not in a position to be able to kind of break down the differences to the degree that we used to when they were very separate, so overlapping today. I\u2019d say, though having said that, merchandise categories and items that are exclusively offered on the web are driving sales on the web to a larger degree than merchandise categories and classifications that are also offered in our store. I think that is true, right, Wes?","Wes McDonald","Yeah.","Kevin Mansell","And that has been somewhat consistent over time, but if anything it perhaps accelerated as we\u2019ve made a big focus on driving sales and the merchandising teams in E-Commerce are looking for categories and brands that are unique that give a different experience.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","And then I guess just as a follow-up to that, are there geographies where there is a big delta between E-Comm and the stores. And how would you even start evaluating potentially closing stores or is there just not that big of a delta at this point? Thanks.","Wes McDonald","The most productive stores in the company are also where we have the highest penetration of E-Comm sales. So that would be mostly Midwest, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, but the most improvement is coming in places like the West and the South Central.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you so much and good luck.","Wes McDonald","Thanks.","Operator","And next we go to Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","Great, thanks. Hey, Kevin, just a question here on the E-Commerce business. Two things, one, would love to hear your thoughts on how mobile has been layering into your better performance. I know that mobile has been like a primary portion of your overall planned CapEx for technology, so how does that fit in with this acceleration in E-Comm?","And then secondly, related as well, if you think about your SKU expansion opportunities you just mentioned, the exclusives that are on the web. To what extent can you work with your vendors to really expand that online assortment and maybe just facilitate some drop shipping for consumers as a means to drive this? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell","Sure. I will take them one at a time on mobile and Wes can add whatever he wants to. But I mean, mobile is driving the E-Comm business. And essentially a large portion of the increase in mobile in E-Comm traffic has been accounted for on-mobile devices and the shift from desktop to mobile, both phone and tablet, is dramatic, accelerating and doesn\u2019t appear to have any slowdown insight.","The technology teams and the E-Comm teams have really done a great job in preparation for that trend and have built the infrastructure that we\u2019ve been launching and all of the new initiatives we are launching, things like Yes to You Rewards, the loyalty business, with the mobile platform in mind, in fact, at the forefront of their thinking.","So, I do believe that while we have got lots of opportunity to improve on all of the interface with our customers. This is an area that the team has really been ahead of the curve on and I think when we launch loyalty nation-wide, you are going to see the application on mobile devices is pretty spectacular frankly and its\u2026","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","Was it, Kevin, can I just pause on that point real quick and clarify? Are you seeing an-- I think everyone is seeing an increase in mobile traffic, are you also seeing an increase in mobile traffic and mobile conversion?","Kevin Mansell","","Mobile conversion itself, Wes.","Wes McDonald","It\u2019s getting better. The whole issue that we are all struggling with is conversion on a smartphone is a lot less than conversion on a tablet or a desktop. So one of our focuses for this year and into next year is in, as Kevin mentioned, is improving the mobile app to where it is easier and you can check out in fewer steps because on a phone, they are buying fewer units as well. So we have got to make it a lot easier for them to do.","And you talked about drop shipping or direct shipping, we already do that. It\u2019s about between 20% and 25% of our business is direct ship. So it is something that merchants are really focused on trying to expand categories in areas like big and tall, and special sizes where we are somewhat constrained by the floor pad there, but we can definitely broaden the assortment online in those types of businesses.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","Thank you so much, guys. Best of luck out there.","Operator","Our next question is from Liz Dunn with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a lot of little follow-up questions. So, on the 30% plus E-Commerce comp in July, you are saying that part of that is obviously anniversarying this period of disruption? Are you able to break out how much was that versus a lift that might be sustainable?","Kevin Mansell","I mean, the honest answer on that, Liz, is it is difficult. We definitely -- there are things that are happening in the business like the growth of our WebEx or our Web-exclusive product categories that would indicate, those are probably sustainable and those are unique and separate from the anniversary of the disruption.","But we also definitely want to acknowledge that last year there was a tremendous slowdown and therefore this year by default becomes an opportunity to anniversary that. So it\u2019s definitely both, but it\u2019s really, really hard. If we had a good answer on that, we would definitely give it to you. It is just really difficult for us to separate those things.","Wes McDonald","Yeah. I\u2019d focus -- we plan to grow E-Commerce 20% a year. So we underachieved that for a variety of reasons in the first quarter. We are going to overachieve that in July, August, September for sure, and then it should go back to a normalized 20% going forward.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie","Okay. The lift you have seen in beauty, so do I understand you correctly that that is really without marketing that beauty has changed because you haven\u2019t been able to market because it is not in any one market in total, is that correct, so it has just been the customer sort of discovering it?","Wes McDonald","Yeah. We have done some small marketing, like there is a couple markets that we have, real small but nothing like Milwaukee or New York that we\u2019ve seen. We\u2019ve seen a little bit bigger lift in advertised markets versus unadvertised, but I wouldn\u2019t tell you that we are going to get some additional lift after that because I just don\u2019t have enough data to say that with a lot of confidence.","Kevin Mansell","But fundamentally the results to date on beauty do not include any marketing component.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie","Okay. And then, finally, on the loyalty, I was interested in your comments that, I\u2019m paraphrasing, that you want to build a deeper connection with the customer and that you think that it could be more powerful than your card.","So two questions there, that sounds like it is more than just discounts, that there\u2019s more substance to it a then do those, whatever those benefits are that you have identified that you can offer to the customer, does that translate to the card as well, could it be a benefit to the card over time? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, first of all, definitely loyalty is not fundamentally focused on the saving aspect. So that\u2019s sort of a price of entry. We know that to have a great loyalty relationship with the customer that has to be some incredible savings aspect to it and that\u2019s fundamentally kind of underpinning our loyalty strategy.","But we also look at, given the number of loyalty programs across retail, hospitality and other consumer categories. It is very clear that some are extremely successful, some are very mediocre and some just really don\u2019t work well.","We are focused on trying to understand the components of the ones that are super successful and our program that we are launching in October combines the savings aspect, which is important, with a sharing element and a surprise element and a connection element that we think will make ours unique because that is really what this is about.","Just having another loyalty program, that is not going to do anything fundamentally, but if we combine all these aspects, we\u2019re trying to use best in class, they are not necessarily in our sectors, they are probably in many cases outside of our sector to design the overall overreaching aspect.","So far, the credit overlap has probably been the most exciting thing. I think as we went into loyalty, one of the concerns we had is we didn\u2019t want to do anything that would be positive on the loyalty side with a broad array of customers but somehow perceived negatively by our current loyal customer in our credit business and that has definitely not been the case.","And as we have looked at loyalty members by store, the percentage of members who are credit and noncredit is pretty exciting, we have more noncredit members that\u2019s the objective, for sure, but we also have a substantial amount of credit members.","Wes McDonald","Yeah. We also think it could, over time, act as sort of a feeder program into credit. We will be able to analyze our activity and if they give us information, we can actually even prescreen them when they come to the register and if they qualify, offer them an opportunity to apply for a Kohl\u2019s charge. So I think it is something that could actually augment the credit program at this point versus hurting it.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie","Okay. Great. Thanks. Good luck.","Wes McDonald","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question if from Richard Jaffe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel","","Thanks very much, guys and exciting to hear about July. I\u2019m wondering -- I am looking at the specific success stories within the July positive comp? Can you guys sort of drill in and answer on a high level or as much detail as you can? If you have got the product to back up the successes of July, if you weren\u2019t cherry picked and now have to chase successes but just the opposite, there is the inventory and replenishment possibly in the successful categories and key items?","Kevin Mansell","Well, we have tried to be, on the inventory front we\u2019ve tried to be particularly aggressive around our basic replenishment categories, you heard Wes talk about that, that we funded those businesses proactively. I don\u2019t think we see anything in our inventory plans that would cause us to be worried that we are going to run out of key items or categories. We have so much room to improve in inventory management, Richard, that...","Richard Jaffe - Stifel","Yeah.","Kevin Mansell","And I\u2019m pretty confident, we can run with less inventory, which I think we are looking for the end of the third quarter to be down probably 3% or so and inventory\u2026","Richard Jaffe - Stifel","End of the year.","Wes McDonald","End of the year.","Kevin Mansell","\u2026 more 3% or 4% to last year\u2026","Richard Jaffe - Stifel","Right.","Kevin Mansell","\u2026 that still get the sales results we\u2019re looking for.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel","And could you comment just on categories that have performed well, say, within Juniors or more specifically than you provided on men\u2019s as well?","Kevin Mansell","Active is one that I would highlight. Active has been great everywhere but it has been great in Juniors as well. Their results have been pretty broad. There are categories like dresses that have been spectacular as well on a brand basis. Our Candie\u2019s business, I think, Wes, has been dramatically outperforming, as we\u2019ve made some changes to the strategies behind that brand.","Wes McDonald","Young men\u2019s has also been very good and starting in the back, sorry, in back-to-school, so that is encouraging as well.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Wes McDonald","Thanks.","Operator","That will conclude this conference\u2019s Q&A session.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michelle Gass, Chief Executive Officer of Kohl\u2019s Department Stores. Please go ahead.","Michelle Gass","Good morning and welcome to Kohl\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today is Bruce Besanko, our Chief Financial Officer. We are very pleased to be reporting another quarter of strong financial results.","Comp sales on a shifted basis increased % our sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth. The increase was generally consistent with the November, December holiday results that we announced in early January. We are excited to report the increasing comp sales given the exceptional holiday season that we had in 2017. On a 2-year basis, our fourth quarter comp sales increased over 7%.","Our strong performance reflects the compelling product offering, great marketing strategy, and consistent execution in stores and online. We are encouraged by the transaction growth in 2018 as our customers continue to embrace the omni-channel investments we are making. The continued momentum this quarter punctuate the positive performance we've had every quarter in fiscal 2018, resulting in a 1.7% sales increase for the full-year.","We are delivering growth, while also improving both profitability and margin, reporting our fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion. Our long-term strategic initiatives and our commitment to our two top priorities of driving traffic and operational excellence are paying off. We are financially strong and our overall health in the business affords us the ability to drive the future we want to create.","I will now turn the call over to Bruce, who will provide details on our financial results. After Bruce's remarks, I will return to add more color in the business and update you on our key initiatives.","Bruce Besanko","Thanks, Michelle. As Michelle just mentioned, comp sales for the quarter increased 1.0% on a shifted basis, driven by the 1.2% increase for the combined November, December holiday period announced in January. Consistent with our reporting in prior quarters, this shifted comp adjusts for the 53rd week last year by comparing sales for the 13 week periods ended February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018. So our shifted comp sales of 1.0% is a like-for-like comparison.","And as a reminder, additional information on the calendar shift can be found in the appendix of the June 16, 2018 Analyst Meet and Greet presentation, which is available on the Investor Relations Pages of our Corporate website.","The strong sales performance was driven by positive transactions and a double-digit increase in digital sales, which was on top of the 26% increase in the fourth quarter of last year. From a line of business perspective, children's and men's outperform the company. Our core women's business, which excludes juniors, was flat driven by strength in modern casual and active categories.","Geographically, we saw strength across the country except for slight softness in the Northeast. The Midwest region was the strongest. We believe our strategic initiatives continue to drive the momentum in our performance. We also think our Q4 results were positively impacted by competitor store closures. The impact was especially strong in the Midwest, where we had a significant overlap with Bon-Ton stores and customer base.","Competitor closures will remain a unique opportunity to capture market share. We will continue to invest incremental marketing dollars and position inventory to ensure we capture a disproportionate share of sales and customers from these competitor store closings. Michelle will provide additional comments on the sales results in her remarks.","Moving on to margin and inventory. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations and increased 1 basis point over the prior year. For the fiscal year, our gross margin improved 32 basis points. Fourth quarter margin reflects increased mix headwinds from strength in categories such as electronics and toys, a higher penetration of digital sales during the holiday period and a continued shift in national brands.","Our inventory per store decreased 2%, slightly less than expected due in large part to West Coast port delays, which impacted the timeliness of seasonal receipts. The ongoing inventory reductions reflects our continued focus on managing inventory at the omni-channel level.","We continue to leverage on our key initiatives such as standard to small, localization, choice count reduction and speed to strategically reduce our inventory levels. Combined these efforts resulted in our 12th consecutive quarter of lower inventory levels and a 15 basis point increase in fourth-quarter inventory turn.","SG&A decreased 2% or $32 million to $1.7 billion for the quarter. Approximately $40 million of the decrease was due to the 53rd week in 2017. Once again, our stores organization did an amazing job managing their expenses as they offset wage pressures with expense savings from operational excellence initiatives.","IT expenses increased due to continued investments in the cloud and other technology initiatives to drive future efficiencies and growth. Marketing expenses were also slightly higher as we shifted our spending from earlier in the year to the holiday to drive sales and to capture market share from competitor store closures.","Depreciation expense of $239 million was $28 million lower than last year. The decrease was due to a $22 million IT impairment last year as well as the maturity of our store portfolio. Net interest expense was $16 million better for the quarter due to the benefit of this year's debt reductions, higher interest on our investments also contributed to the decrease.","Moving on to taxes, our tax rate was 24.8% for the quarter, slightly higher than last year, but generally consistent with previous quarters in our own expectations. As a reminder, last year's 5% rate was a result of tax reform and a one-time state tax settlement.","Operational excellence continues to be a key priority for the organization. We made tremendous progress over the last two years and have now achieved our goal of saving $250 million within the first two years compared to the original goal of three years. This effort has allowed us to maintain our expense leverage point of 1.5% to 2%.","As part of these efforts, we took several actions in the fourth quarter that are expected to generate annual SG&A savings of approximately $20 million and annual depreciation savings of approximately $5 million.","As we disclose in our 8-K filing in early January, we will close four underperforming stores in April, but will open four new smaller format stores later in the year. We are consolidating call center locations, which support both our Kohl's charge and our online customers.","Additionally, we offered a voluntary retirement program to qualify the hourly associates and impair certain assets. We incurred a $104 million in charges in the fourth quarter, as a result of these actions and estimate that approximately $50 million to $55 million of additional charges will be recorded in 2019. Most of the 2019 charges will to be related to future lease commitments at the four stores that we will be closing.","Additionally, we retired $413 million of debt in the fourth quarter, and as a result we reported a $21 million loss on extinguishment of debt combined with the tender offer in the first quarter and additional open market debt repurchases. We reduced our outstanding debt by over $900 million and extended the remaining maturity of the portfolio an additional two years. The debt reduction is expected to decrease annual interest expense by approximately $45 million.","On a GAAP basis for the quarter, net income was $272 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.67. For the year, GAAP net income was $801 million and diluted EPS was $4.84. Excluding the nonrecurring charges that I just mentioned, for the quarter net income was $366 million and diluted earnings per share increased 20% to $2.24.","For the year, excluding the nonrecurring charges, net income was $927 million and diluted earnings per share increased 34% to $5.60, which is $0.05 higher than the high-end of our guidance.","Looking at the store portfolio, we ended the year with 1,159 Kohl's stores, including one store which is temporary temporarily closed due to the hurricane damage. Gross footage was 99 million square feet and selling footage was 83 million square feet.","During 2018, we relocated the store in Wisconsin. We opened a new store format, a new small store format in North Carolina and we reopened a store in Texas, which was damaged by hurricane Harvey.","Now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year with $934 million of cash and cash equivalents. This amount was a decrease of only $374 million from last year-end, strong cash flows from operations, largely offset $943 million used for debt reductions.","As I mentioned earlier on a per-share basis -- sorry on a per store basis, our inventory decreased 2% and our units decreased 3%. In 2019, we expect a mid single-digit percentage decrease in our inventory levels and dollars. Our accounts payable to inventory decreased 170 basis points to 34.2%, driven by the timeliness of seasonal receipts driven by West Coast port delays as I mentioned just a second ago.","Moving on to capital management. Capital expenditures were $578 million for 2018, $94 million lower than 2017 and lower than our own expectations due to the timing of e-commerce fulfillment and IT payments. We expect 2019 capital expenditures of approximately $850 million.","Weighted average diluted shares for the quarter were 163 million and shares outstanding at year-end were 164 million. We repurchased 1.8 million shares of our stock during the quarter, bringing our total for the year to 5.7 million shares. Last week, our Board of Directors increased our dividend by 10% to $0.67 per common share. We've increased the dividend every year since first paying a dividend in 2011. The dividend is payable on April 3 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 20.","Looking forward to 2019, our initial guidance is for earnings per diluted share of $5.80 to $6.15 for fiscal 2019. This excludes approximately $50 million to $55 million or $0.23 to $0.25 per share. In nonrecurring charges that we expect to incur, principally in the first half of the year were related to the store closures and other actions I discussed earlier.","Our guidance includes an estimated $0.05 increase in diluted earnings per share, resulting from the impact of the new lease accounting standard that were required to adopt in Q1. We will adopt a new standard prospectively and won't restate prior periods.","We are finalizing our accounting procedures, but currently expect the new standard will increase SG&A expense by approximately $25 million or approximately 40 basis points. Decreased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $25 million as well as decreased interest expense by approximately $10 million. Substantially all of the charges are due to leases that change classification under the new standard.","Our guidance is based on the following expectations, which includes the impact of the new lease standard, but excludes any nonrecurring charges. First, comp sales of flat to 2% higher for the year with the first quarter at the low end of the range due to softness seen in February.","We expect our gross margin rate to increase up to 10 basis points for the year with the first quarter flat to down slightly. SG&A dollars are expected to increase 1% to 2% for the year. Excluding the impact of lease accounting, SG&A dollars are expected to increase 0.5% to 1.5%.","Depreciation expense will be $930 million, which includes a $25 million benefit from lease accounting and interest expense is expected to be $210 million, including the $10 million benefit from lease accounting. We believe our effective tax rate will be approximately 24% to 25%. And finally our guidance assumes share repurchases of $400 million to $500 million.","And with that, I will turn the call back to Michelle, to provide additional details on our results and an update on key initiatives.","Michelle Gass","Thank you, Bruce. I'll now provide more color on our Q4 sales performance and discuss our outlook for 2019. We are excited that the positive momentum we've seen all year long carried through into the holiday season. The key strategic initiatives in our Greatness Agenda around product, experience and savings, continue to create new opportunities for growth.","Our two key priorities on driving traffic and operational excellence keep us focused on the most important drivers to create a growing profitable business. These initiatives and priorities are even more important and beneficial to our business during the holiday season, when sales opportunities and competitive pressures are both at their highest.","It is in Q4 that all pieces of the equation, from product to marketing to operations across the stores and digital channels, must be working at optimal level. Everything came together as expected in Q4, resulting in a 1% comp sales increase this year and more than 7% growth on a 2-year stacked basis.","I will now give you a little more color on our Q4 merchandising, marketing and omni-channel results. First, I will discuss the merchandise strategy we had in place to drive our business across all categories and take advantage of real opportunities in the market.","I will start with active, which continues to be a key growth driver for the company. We continue to gain market share as we saw mid single-digit growth in active in Q4, and high single-digit growth for the year. Our active business, which penetrates now nearly 20% of our total business has accelerated every year since we launched the greatness agenda in 2014 and we see even more potential ahead.","In Q4, we had success across all apparel and footwear classifications in active. Our key active national brands Nike, Under Armour and Adidas all reported positive growth. It's also worth noting that fitness tracker, particularly Fitbit continue to perform really well. With the continued success we see in active, we will be extending the in-store active expansion strategy to approximately 160 of our highest performing active stores in 2019.","Next I will call out a few merchandising highlights by category. Our children's business led the company with strength across all categories. The introduction of LEGO and FAO Schwarz, along with enhanced in-store in digital toy experiences, drove a significant increase in our toy business.","We knew there was an opportunity to gain share this season due to a competitor closing and we're pleased with our progress. On the apparel side, we saw strength in active categories, national brands such as Carter's and our own proprietary Jumping Beans brand.","Our men's business also had another very strong quarter outperforming the company. It's worth calling out that men's reported its fifth consecutive year of positive sales and have consistently been a top company performer driven by a great balance of national and proprietary brand, fabric innovations, pursuing opportunities such as active, Golf and Big & Tall and smart inventory management. We expect the strength in the men's business to continue.","Our footwear business ran in line with the company for another quarter of positive comps, driven by strength in active brands, fashion boots and casual national brands such as Vans, Koolaburra by UGG and Clarks. Home also ran a positive comp coming off of an exceptionally strong Q4 in 2017. Drivers in home this quarter including key holiday items in electronics, in kitchen electrics such as the instant pot and in core categories including bedding and luggage.","Accessories was essentially flat for the quarter with strength in beauty and fashion accessories, offset by underperformance in handbags and jewelry. Our core women's business continues to be a key priority for the company. During the holidays, we saw strength in modern apparel, active, intermittent sleep, while juniors and women's classic underperformed.","Next, let me move on to speak about our marketing efforts. Driving traffic is our number one priority and it starts with how we engage our customers. During the holiday season, the team put in place a comprehensive and compelling marketing strategy, including an increased investment shipping some of our spent from earlier in the year into Q4. About half of our spend was in digital, allowing us to be more agile throughout the season and to deliver more personalized marketing messages direct to our customers.","We had strong positive comp sales during three of our key events in the season on November 1, holiday kickoff, Black Friday and cyber Monday. We believe this strategy for the season drove our sales performance and increased customer acquisition.","We continue to pilot our next generation loyalty program called Reward. We've learned that customers love the simplicity of the program and the rewards offering all centered on Kohl\u2019s cash. However, we also learned that we do not need to be as generous with customer rewards. Therefore, we will modify the program to optimize the rewards offerings to create the greatest impact. We will create these -- we will take these learnings into the next phase of testing, expanding the Kohl\u2019s Rewards program into additional stores this summer. We are planning a full chain rollout in 2020.","We continue to make great progress in our marketing personalization effort as we believe having more personalized touch points with our customers in the future will be a real advantage for us and a great benefit for our customers. We already see the personalization efforts generating more spend and higher conversion rate.","In our marketing we've increased the number of personalized impressions across media channel by 35% led by email personalization, which has increased 65% over last year. We've also been increasing the personalization of our website experiences. 100% of our site visits are now touched by personalization in some way, via personalized search, machine learning and product recommendations. We'll continue to expand and improve our capabilities across all customer touch points.","Now let me give you an update on our omni-channel strategies, including both digital and in-store. As Bruce mentioned, we reported a double-digit increase in digital sales, which is especially impressive given the 26% increase we reported in the fourth quarter last year. These strong results reflect a positive impact that our investments are having on customer engagement.","Investments in the mobile app, Your Price, personalized search, Smart Cart and fulfillment options such as BOPUS and BOSS are resonating with our customers and driving increased traffic and higher sales. Mobile again represented the majority of our traffic growth at over 70% of digital traffic and more than half of digital sales.","A key focus of our omni-channel strategy has been and will continue to be amplifying the role and relevancy of our stores. Our stores are a key asset and differentiator for Kohl's, we continue to innovate to make them more relevant and compelling for our customers. We continue to benefit from omni fulfillment capabilities with stores able to fulfill as much as 40% of digital orders. This is especially critical during peak season.","In particular, we saw accelerated adoption in BOPUS reflecting our greater focus in Marketing, Site Experience and Smart Cart. We are especially encouraged by BOPUS as it drives traffic into our stores and result in savings on shipping. We also introduced new mobile checkout functionality at a 150 stores to ensure we can checkout customers in an easy and timely manner.","And finally we piloted an enhanced ship from store capability called Omni Power Centers in 10 of our stores. These locations were equipped with technology and process enhancements that allow them to be more efficient in fulfilling digital orders. The successful pilot will lead to 135 store -- 135 store expansion in 2019 to further leverage stores in the peak digital demand.","Now let's look ahead to 2019. We are confident that we can continue to drive sales and improve profitability, given the deep pipeline of innovation and the focus we have across all areas of the company. First, let me talk about some of the exciting merchandising initiatives underway.","I will start with the opportunity in the plus size women's category. With 67% of women being size 14 or larger, we have a significant opportunity in the women's plus business. Later this month we will launch EVRI, a new women's private label plus brand that offers a broad assortment of modern wardroom essentials and relevant fashion.","We will also expand our plus size offerings in Nike this spring, further positioning ourselves as an active and wellness destination for the entire family. This summer, we will be launching the iconic Nine West brand at Kohl's. The introduction of Nine West elevates our overall fashion offering for women and millennial customer's. Customers will be able to shop Nine West shoes, handbags and an exclusive line of apparel in all of our stores with an expanded assortment online.","Moving to home in the fall, we will launch our strategic partnership with the Property Brothers Drew and Jonathan Scott with an exclusive home lifestyle collection, Scott Living at Kohl's. The introduction of Scott Living at Kohl's strengthens the company's offerings in modern home basics and d\u00e9cor, including furniture, bedding and bath, kitchen d\u00e9cor and more.","Next, I'd like to share some of the marketing innovations that we have planned for 2019. Running a world-class marketing function is essential and our ability to execute against our top priority in driving traffic. We know our future is about reaching new and existing customers in more personalized and relevant ways and we are building out our current capabilities to be even more agile.","Earlier in the call, I shared some of the progress we've already made in our marketing efforts to become highly personalized and that work will continue. We're investing heavily in customer analytics and machine learning to automate customer engagement at scale.","While we\u2019re always focused on connecting in meaningful ways with our existing customers, we know we have a particularly opportunity to gain share among millennial, especially millennial moms. We\u2019ve launched a millennial initiative inside of the company to be more direct in reaching this customer and create new experience that could compel them to come to Kohl.","As an example, we'll be testing an outfit bar concept in approximately 50 stores in Chicago and Philadelphia. The bars will include a curated assortment of millennial loved brands such as LC Lauren Conrad, Levi's, POPSUGAR, Nike and Adidas, which is updated every 30 days. The in-store experience will be mirrored on our digital landing page and it will be fully supported with digital and social media.","Now let me move on to innovation in our channels, both digital and in-store. Our growth in our digital business over the last several years has been a strength of ours. And while we\u2019re pleased with the ongoing momentum, we believe there's even a bigger opportunity. As such, we're investing to deliver a new site experience with improvements in customer engagement, enhanced capability and personalization.","We are also continuing to invest in optimizing our fulfillment network, leveraging predictive analytics in inventory deployment as well as the build out of our sixth EFC. We also believe we have tremendous opportunity to expand our online assortment. Our merchants are currently pursuing untapped opportunities across our online assortment, including extensions to existing businesses, adding new categories and offering new products to excite our customers.","And last I want to mention several planned innovations designed to enhance the store experience for our customers, with the goal of driving more traffic to our stores and even greater relevancy. First, we continue to see our rightsizing strategy as an important initiative to not only leverage our real estate assets, but also drive traffic to our stores through key partnerships.","We currently see an opportunity with grocers such as Aldi, smaller specialty shops, such as total line and fitness companies. And today I'm excited to announce our new partnership with Planet Fitness, which will initially include up to 10 Planet Fitness locations. We see the rightsizing strategy as a large opportunity for Kohl's with tremendous runway.","Next as I mentioned earlier, we will extend our active and wellness expansion to approximately 160 of the highest performing active stores, significantly increasing the amount of space allocated to active in 2019. Third, we recently announced a new strategic collaboration with WW, the new Weight Watchers Global Wellness Company. I'm excited to see where this partnership will take us on our journey to be the destination for active and wellness for the family.","Fourth, we\u2019ve been piloting a new beauty concept in one store. As you know, today the beauty business is small for us. However, we see this as a significant opportunity going forward. Over the last year, we brought in many prestige brands including Polo Ralph Lauren, philosophy and DOLCE & GABBANA. And we're creating an environment to capture even more great brands to build this business.","Next, Your Store. We continue to utilize the Your Store learning lab to quickly test new concepts, while building a longer term roadmap to refresh and evolve our stores. A good example of a Your Store test is the new service center we're piloting at two stores. This centralized customer experience at the front of the store is designed to address key friction points, including findability, purchase time, pickup and return.","Your Store labs allows to test and scale ideas like this that elevate and improve the store experience. Lastly I want to give you an update on our ongoing relationship with Amazon. We continue to be encouraged and learn a great deal through our returns pilot that we have now in approximately 100 stores. We've also been partnering with Amazon in selling devices within our stores, both in our traditional wholesale relationship as well as in 30 store within store concept.","Going forward and in partnership with Amazon, we\u2019ve made the decision to transition from the store within a store concept to a more robust wholesale relationship with Amazon as we founded a better way to serve our customers. As a result, we will be extending our assortment of Amazon branded products into over 200 stores.","As excited as we are about the amount of innovation in the company, we're equally excited about the progress we've made on our operational excellence initiative. This initiative is a critical enabler for us to find efficiencies across the business in order to fund the investments we want to make across technology, our people and in our stores to drive relevancy and growth. Bruce spoke to the progress we have already made and I can assure you this will be a significant focus as we look ahead.","So as we wrap up 2018 and head into 2019, let me pause and reflect on the progress the organization has made. Over the last two years in addition to growing earnings, we\u2019ve reported two consecutive years of positive sales growth, which is our largest increase since 2010. We've improved gross margin by 45 basis points. We've decreased average inventory per store by 10%. We bought back over $900 million of debt. We\u2019ve completed $700 million in share buyback. We paid out over $700 million in dividend. And finally, our free cash flow in 2018 was the highest it's been since 2009.","We are working from a position of strength. And as we look ahead, we're guiding to another year of positive sales growth and improved profitability. We will continue to work with speed and agility, while also remaining disciplined and thoughtful in our efforts to drive shareholder value.","In closing, I'd like to thank our amazing associates that are committed to Kohl's and who helped to make 2018 a great one. We're happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Bob Drbul","Hi. Good morning.","Michelle Gass","Good morning.","Bob Drbul","Good morning. I guess, the first question, Michelle, can you elaborate a little more on the Amazon, the relationship. Just curious in terms of the returns piece and the dedicated space and the -- there's a change going there, but just -- are there any metrics in terms of traffic or the benefits that you\u2019ve seen from that relationship that you could share with us on the pilot and the test?","Michelle Gass","Sure. As I mentioned in my comments, Bob, we continue to be really pleased with the relationship of Amazon. We are working multiple things with them. I will start with the device side of things. It was an experiment and one of the things were really driving in the culture these days is trying lots of things, so we tried the shop in the shop idea and what we're seeing is we\u2019re actually seeing great results through a wholesale relationship. We had a great Black Friday with Amazon devices. And so the learnings that we're taking in terms of how customers engage in the shop-in-shop, we\u2019re actually going to bring it into a dedicated space in over 200 stores, as I mentioned, with a broader assortment of Amazon devices, but it will be more on a self-serve environment, which is how our customers are used to shopping us. This was determined by both us and Amazon, and again we believe the products will be fantastic and the experience will be great for our customers.","And then as it relates to returns, we\u2019ve been at this now for about a year. We extended the returns pilot into Wisconsin mid-to-late last year, so we\u2019re now at a 100 stores. I think that the most important thing that we're seeing is how excited our customers and the Amazon customers are about this service. It's really unique. It takes a lot of the hassle out of returning items. It's free. They don\u2019t have to package it. The big question of course at hand is, how we go forward and we continue to be in conversations with Amazon. It really needs to be a win-win for both. So I'd say stay tuned on that front.","Bob Drbul","Got it. And, Michelle, just a question on the women's business. In terms of what's in the stores, I guess, you talked about February. But jumpsuit seem to be pretty prevalent and I\u2019m just wondering if you comment on that as a potential driver and whether it's strap jumpsuit that you see as a way to go this spring season?","Michelle Gass","Thanks, Bob. Very specific on the strapless versus strapped detail. Jumpsuits are in the trending now for the last year and we have a very broad assortment this spring. We think it's going to be a big hit this year. In terms of strap versus strapless, I don\u2019t know. Let the customer be the judge and we've got plenty of both.","Bob Drbul","Great. Good luck. Thank you very much.","Michelle Gass","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Next we go to Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen","Congrats. Congrats on the deal with Planet Fitness. It sounds really innovative. On the topic of women's classic and juniors, what are your thoughts as that integrate to millennial moms? And what percentage of mix is that business and what is -- what are the main point for strategy there just to reinvigorate traffic? And then a modeling question, just in terms of February, how did February help inform the guidance? You had such good momentum in Q4. I would love your thoughts on what's happening with February and also your thoughts on the year ahead? Thank you.","Michelle Gass","Thanks, Oliver. I will start with the women's business, and then I'll have -- Bruce talk a little more about February. In terms of women's, as you know, women's is a very important business for us. It's about 30% of our business and I\u2019d say on the whole for the year, we're really pleased. The women's business in total for the year was positive. In Q4, basically we saw certain businesses as really strong and then we had a couple of opportunity areas. So, in terms of what was really strong and where we put a lot of focus and investment, our modern contemporary business of brands like LC Lauren Conrad, Simply Vera Vera Wang, the L Brand [ph], those are all doing really well. They\u2019re on the speed platform, they're resonating. We got the right balance of basics and fashion. So we feel very pleased about that. Our active business continues and our intermittent sleep business had also a great quarter and a great year. And like I said, in total for the year, our totality of our women's business did well. The Q4 soft spots, if you will, really isolated to two areas, which is our women's classic and to juniors. Women's classic, I'd say Croft & Barrow is an opportunity for us. It's worth noting that in our private brands all of our top private brands for the year were positive outside of Croft & Barrow and we had opportunities. We had opportunities to bring more newness to that customer and the team is on it, and they are course correcting. And then with as juniors, we had some hits and misses on that business. I would say the good news about juniors is it's one of the fastest businesses we have. So again, the team is on it, course correcting and we anticipate improvement this coming year. You also mentioned a question around millennial, and like we're doing really across everything, the millennial opportunity will be a localized opportunity. We are starting in this 50 store test -- we today have great brands that resonate with millennials, our national brands that I mentioned like Levi's and our active brands, and then coupled with some great proprietary brands. The whole idea around carving out space for the millennial customer is to give them a destination where it's all in one place. And importantly to kind of mix up the brand, so we help them kind of solve their wardrobing challenges. So giving sort of outfitting solution. So it's a test. 1we'll see how this works, but our commitment to millennials is significant and we expect to make a lot of progress on that front.","Bruce Besanko","Oliver, let me comment on the month of February and how that is informing on our guidance. So, first of all, we are very confident in the full-year guide of flat to up 2% from -- for a comp, on top of the 1.7% comp this year. February -- pardon me, February is off to a slow start. We believe it's primarily whether driven, but it is starting below our plan. The weather impact from our vantage point, we believe is a combination of both cold temperatures across large portions of the country and significant precipitation in the form of rain, but principally snow. And both of those things are keeping customers at home. So we are off to a slow start, which is why we guided the way we did in the first quarter, but we are confident in the full-year guide. And as it relates to margin, we think the margin impact -- again, first of all, we are confident in the guide for the full-year, but we also think that this weather impact is affecting gross margin and the way that it affects Kohl's gross margin is that we're selling more of our fall inventory levels, which is on clearance or being more promoted, and so that's the effect we see.","Michelle Gass","And I would just add \u2026","Oliver Chen","Okay. Thanks.","Michelle Gass","I would just add one thing to Bruce's comment as well. This is -- well certainly not unique to us and we\u2019ve seen this before in terms of the volatility with weather, particularly as it relates to the first quarter and the third quarter. And typically what we\u2019ve seen in these situation is that where you may not be selling it when it's really cold or people are stuck at home with the snowstorm. Ones that weather returns, we do see pent-up demand. We had that experience last year as weather was a bit erratic as well. So I feel really good about the spring inventory, we are well positioned. We're extremely clean, our aged inventory is really down. So I'm excited. I think we\u2019re all anxiously waiting for that business -- for the weather to turn. But that being said, I think the team is ready. We\u2019ve marketing plans in place, and I think also our agile marketing efforts as I mentioned, allow us to once the weather turn, we will amplify and lean into the demand to even drive more. So as -- I reiterate with Bruce has said, while it's a slow start, we feel very confident in our annual guidance of flat up to 2%, so confident in our margin guidance of growing that again this year. So I think we\u2019ve got a fantastic year ahead.","Oliver Chen","Okay. So lastly on Planet. That\u2019s very helpful. Our survey indicates such broad appeal for this concept and it's a great comp and unit growth story with non-correlated traffic opportunities. Can you move this faster? What\u2019s your thoughts on the pace and some background on the rationale. It seems like a really win-win, especially as you dive into active further?","Michelle Gass","Yes, you got that. We see the Planet Fitness partnership as a real win-win, and in fact the teams are working to take advantage of the co-location in these first 10 stores to figure how we can -- co-market to these customers. So very excited about it. I think like everything, we have to build a few. We will learn and we will take it from there, but all our indications is this is going to be a great fit for us and for our customers.","Oliver Chen","That\u2019s great.","Michelle Gass","Okay.","Operator","Next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","Great and congrats on a nice quarter.","Michelle Gass","Thank you, Matt.","Bruce Besanko","Thanks.","Matthew Boss","Michelle -- I guess, Michelle, first on comps in 2019, maybe versus performance this past year, how would you rank the incremental opportunities by category and maybe what's the largest swing factor between flat and positive two comps for the year?","Michelle Gass","So thanks for the question, Matt. As I said in remarks, I'm really excited as we enter the year. I think for us the theme of 2019 is innovation. We\u2019ve innovation happening across all parts of our business. So if I start with product, there's innovation in every area. It's hard to single out a particular category. I will start with women's as we\u2019ve got a huge brand launch ahead of us this summer fall in Nine West. But I also think EVRI, which were in process of launching today, is going to be great. It's been some time in the making, the team has been very thoughtful on how to approach the plus customer in terms of product and basics and fashion. So I think between EVRI and Nine West we're in great shape. Our proprietary brands continue to be as focused as you know that\u2019s more than two thirds of our business with women's, so continuing to drive that speed agenda is really important. If I cut across all the categories, active is a priority. We\u2019ve deep partnerships with our partners and frankly the product elevation in EVRI business whether it's women's, men's, kids, footwear, that that's coming and that will continue to be lift for us, especially now as we expand in the 160 stores where we will have that broader assortment. On in-home, excited about Scott Living and Property Brothers. They\u2019ve got great broad reaches that relates to their television presence and I'm anticipating they\u2019re going to be involved as we market the product. The product was fantastic. So I just think the innovation really cuts across. And then if I move over to our channel, digital and in-store, it's all about creating a great experience driving traffic, the marketing focus will enable that. But in terms of in-store, we have a lot going on as I mentioned, something that are rolling and then others that are incubating as I mentioned around the rightsizing opportunity, the expanded active or experimenting with the Weight Watchers partnership. So there really is a great, great spirit of innovation happening at the company to make sure that we can sustain the demand.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then, Bruce, maybe on the gross margin front. I guess, what inning are we in today with inventory management? And maybe what are you seeing from efficiency initiatives that you have to offset e-commerce pressure over time?","Bruce Besanko","Good question. So on the inventory, Matt, I would say when I look at the levels of inventory turn in our past, we have still room to improve. We're certainly not in the early innings, but there's still a nice gap between what we once had from an inventory turn perspective and what we experienced even after these 12 consecutive quarters of reductions. So I think there's room. From an e-com -- as you know, e-com turns faster and it has a higher penetration particularly in the holiday. So I think there's opportunity there too.","Michelle Gass","The other thing I would add to Bruce's comment, inventory management has been a key enabler. We often talk about it in the context of margin, but it's also a sales driver. The speed initiative is part of that. I mean, one of the biggest benefits we have in speed is when we see things working, we can chase into units. And we\u2019ve literally chased into millions of units. It had a major impact to our business. I think the team is doing a really nice job of how they are thoughtfully producing choices to going deeper into the things that matter. And then as we see those things resonating, we are getting the turn. Like I said, then we can chase into them. The last point I'd make is while the bar raises on inventory management we\u2019re investing technology to increase our sophistication, predictive analytics to really know where and how to place that inventory. So that gives us, like I said, a further runway on this inventory management, inventory reduction and ultimately greater turns on our inventory.","Matthew Boss","Great. Congrats again.","Michelle Gass","Thank you, Matt.","Operator","Next we will go to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Dana Telsey","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the nice progress.","Michelle Gass","Thanks, Dana.","Dana Telsey","Michelle, as you think of national brands and proprietary brands, what\u2019s your outlook for performance of each? And you mentioned active, what are you most excited about there? And then just lastly on online costs, what changed this season and how you are executing fulfillment and managing SG&A? Thank you.","Michelle Gass","Right. So there are a few questions there. Why don\u2019t I take the proprietary and brand question, also touch on active, and then I will let Bruce touch on the cost piece. So first of all, I'm a believer that ultimately that the customer decides what brands are resonating with them and we are constantly editing our portfolio. So we are not necessarily driving to a particular mix per se, we are looking at what\u2019s relevant. And today as we sit here, national brands are penetrating in about 60% and our proprietary brands about 40%. I think as we look ahead, we\u2019ve got a great pipeline of innovation and newness and excitement really across both. Women's you touched -- you mentioned women's, Dana, and we -- as I said earlier, that\u2019s about two-thirds proprietary. So we\u2019ve got to be really focused on making sure that we\u2019ve got the inventory balance right, we\u2019ve got basics, we\u2019ve got relevant fashion, the speed initiative gives us more precision as it relates to getting that fashion, right, but I\u2019m really excited about what's ahead in our key brands. LC Lauren Conrad has been really just on a phenomenal growth trajectory. We\u2019ve more plans for that brand as we look out and I think we really have it right there. But I think even in our core private brands, Apartment 9 has been really positive in women's. Sonoma has been really positive. And in the areas where we\u2019ve got some softness, be it classics or juniors, the teams know what those issues are and they\u2019re actively course correcting. I think for active, I\u2019m very excited about how our pilot went, the 30 store test proving out that we can further extend in this really important category. I think importantly as we do, customer surveys and the like, customers are giving us credit for being a real player in active. I mean, there really has been a shift since 2014 when we began this journey. So there is lots of good examples across -- really across all lines of business of levels and innovation. I would call out on the men's side, as an example, getting into the golf business with their active brands has been a huge hit. The jacket and layering side, which hasn't been a big part of our business has been providing a lot of incrementality. And I mentioned on women's, we are going to be expanding into plus with Nike, which will also be a big win. So there's lots there. We\u2019ve got a great pipeline and looking forward to -- all we are going to bring to our customers this year. And then I'll hand it over to Bruce.","Bruce Besanko","Yes, so with respect to SG&A and the cost of ship, so first, Dana, we remain committed to leveraging expenses at a 1.5% to 2%. I think the company has done a great deal of effort, particularly with our operational effectiveness and excellence initiatives. And in fact, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, fiscal '18 was our second year and we are delighted to report that we are already at the $250 million mark in both SG&A and gross margin savings. So this third year here, which is fiscal '19, we have even more to go get. So that\u2019s all good. And then with respect to cost of shipping. Cost of shipping is an important element of the efforts here around operational excellence. We need to mitigate the rising cost of shipping by increasing store pickup penetration. We are doing that with BOPUS and our recent BOSS launch. We need to minimize split shipments and manage our cost per package, which is part of the operational excellence work that is under -- that we are undertaking. We need to help with speed to customer and driving the overall costs down. EFC 5 is one of the ways that we do that. There's more productive -- the EFC 5 is far more productive than the first generation of distribution centers. We announced we would be opening a sixth or begin investment in the sixth EFC here shortly. And so for all those reasons, we think that we can get the cost of shipping down and that\u2019s an element of the technology investments that we\u2019ve been making that we expect to deliver benefits over time.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark Altschwager","Hey, good morning and congrats on a strong 2018. Just to start out, Bruce, following up on some of those gross margin comments. How should we be thinking about that gross margin algorithm overall? Is it still 20 basis point headwind from e-commerce, offset by a positive merchandise margin?","Bruce Besanko","Yes, the headwind from cost of shipping remains in our view, 20 to 30 basis points. Now as I said with Dana's question, we intend to look at ways that we can mitigate some of that through operational excellence and through technology investments, but the 20 to 30 basis point headwind exists and to the extent that we move more sales into the digital channel that cost to ship may go up.","Mark Altschwager","Got it. And then separately, last year management spoke to some customer count metrics. I\u2019m wondering if you have any updates on that front. Was net customer acquisition up year-over-year in 2018? Are you bringing in younger customers? How do the Bon-Ton markets maybe compare to a control group? Just any color there would be great.","Michelle Gass","Yes, great. Thanks, Mark. We are very encouraged by our continued efforts around customer acquisition. And again in Q4, our new customer acquisition rate was up in the low double digits. So we are continuing to get those new customers in. We do see that the competitive store closures are helping that, but it's not just that. We are getting new customers really across the board. And as I spoke earlier about personalized marketing, that\u2019s a real asset now for us as we can retain and grow them into loyal customers.","Mark Altschwager","Thank you and best of luck.","Michelle Gass","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Our final question will be from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus on credit for a minute. Are you seeing any change in payment trends in your portfolio? And then also, what\u2019s your outlook for credit for 2019?","Bruce Besanko","Hey, Lorraine, let me take a stab at that. So let me just take a step back. Our credit operation is an important element of our loyalty program. In fact, as we talk about millennials, millennials are an effort that we are focusing on in credit as well. About a third of our new applications are coming from millennials, about a quarter of the new accounts are from millennial. So we think that that\u2019s a great opportunity as we focus on millennials. In the -- in fiscal '18, ex the 53rd week, we grew revenue and we grew profitability. The team has done a fantastic job in terms of managing costs. We consolidated the Dallas call center, is an example of that. Our fraud expense has been going down significantly. And so the team has done just a tremendous job in terms of ensuring that the credit operation, both on the top line and the bottom line remain solid. In terms of 2019, we haven't provided any guidance on the credit card profitability or the revenue, but we are hopeful that we can continue to convert some of the new customers that Michelle just mentioned that, particularly in the fourth quarter, where we had new customer acquisition that we can convert them through our loyalty ladder into credit cardholders.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Ms. Gass, any closing comments?","Michelle Gass","No, I just want to say thank you to everyone listening on the call today and we are looking forward to a great 2019.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over our host, Mr. Kevin Mansell, Chairman and CEO and President of Kohl's Department Stores. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. With me on the call is our Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Besanko, who will start the call by reviewing our key financial results. Bruce?","Bruce H. Besanko - Kohl's Corp.","Thank you, Kevin. Before I discuss our financial results, I'd like to say how excited I am to be at Kohl's working with Kevin and the rest of the leadership team. I've only been at Kohl's a few weeks and I'm already impressed by the caliber, the talent and leadership across the organization. I'll share more of my thoughts on the company in future calls.","Turning to our financial results, as we shared in our press release this morning, comp sales decreased 40 basis points for the quarter, a significant improvement over recent trends. The comp improvement was driven by transactions both in our stores and online. Though still negative for the quarter, transactions improved significantly over previous quarters and even more encouraging, were positive for the month of July. Average transaction value increased for the quarter driven by strong increase in average unit retail which was partially offset by a decrease in units per transaction.","From a line of business perspective, all the businesses reported improvement and several generated positive comps for the quarter. Our footwear business was especially strong and was driven by athletic shoes. Home and men's also comped positive. Accessories had the most significant improvement in trend for the quarter, though still slightly negative. Our children and women's business remained challenging. Kevin will provide more details on our sales results in a few minutes.","Geographically, performance was generally consistent across all regions. The West and Southeast were the strongest. The Midwest was consistent with the company. The Mid-Atlantic, Northeast and South-Central regions were modestly below the company average.","Now, moving down the P&L. Our gross margin rate decreased 6 basis points for the quarter. Margin increases which resulted from continued inventory management and improved markdown levels were more than offset by shipping costs. SG&A decreased $3 million for the quarter to $983 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A deleveraged 12 basis points. Our marketing and credit businesses both leveraged for the quarter. Marketing spend reflected continued efficiencies in our non-customer facing spend. Our credit business reported both higher revenues on the receivables portfolio and lower operating expenses. Store expenses were managed in line with the decrease in sales, and distribution, IT and corporate costs were also well-managed but didn't leverage on the lower sales.","Depreciation expense was $243 million for the quarter, up $9 million over last year's second quarter. The increase was driven by higher IT depreciation. Interest expense decreased $3 million for the quarter. Most of the decrease was due to lower interest on capitalized leases as the store portfolio matures. Our income tax rate was 37.4% for the quarter, a decrease of approximately 10 basis points from last year. For the quarter, net income was $208 million. Diluted earnings per share were $1.24.","Now transitioning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $552 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $148 million. The decrease is the result of lower sales and increased capital expenditures. Inventory per store decreased 2% and units per store decreased 3%, consistent with our expectations for a low to mid single-digit decrease for the year. Our AP to inventory ratio increased 55 basis points to 35.6%, driven by lower inventory receipts.","Now moving on to capital management. Year-to-date capital expenditures were $399 million, $59 million higher than last year. The increase was due to higher technology spending and to spending on our fifth e-commerce fulfillment center which opened recently.","We repurchased 2.4 million shares of our stock during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 6.3 million shares. Weighted average diluted shares for the quarter were 168 million and as of quarter-end we had 169 million shares outstanding. On Wednesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share. The dividend is payable on September 20 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 6.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Kevin who will provide additional details on our results for the quarter and an update on our key initiatives. Kevin?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Bruce. Let me start with a few comments on the overall results for the quarter and the progress we're making both toward our financial goals we have set for this year and our longer-term strategic objectives as well.","Results in the quarter continued to improve and showed progress across a wide range of metrics. As a result, the year is unfolding as we had hoped across almost all areas, and we are on track to achieve our financial goals we had set at the beginning of the year.","Bruce went through some of the numbers, but let me add some of my own color. First, I was pleased that second quarter sales improved to relatively flat to last year. That was an improvement over our first quarter by over 200 basis points in our stores and 400 basis points in our digital business. While traffic still remained slightly negative in the quarter, an improvement in traffic was the driver of the improved performance in sales. All regions and all lines of business shared in that improvement and, in July, transactions increased over last year.","For the quarter in total, regular price sales actually increased, while our much lower level of clearance inventory resulted in much lower clearance sales, which impacted our total sale results. While gross margin modestly declined driven by the impact of the growth in our digital business penetration, merchandise margin improved over last year as a result of the continued progress on our inventory management initiatives. We do expect that to continue.","Inventory levels in both units and dollars started and finished the quarter below last year and are well-positioned as we move into our critical back-to-school and fall selling periods. Expenses were managed below both plan and last year for the quarter, primarily as a result of the traction we are gaining around our focus on long-term, sustainable expense reductions.","Looking longer term, the results of the quarter and the year continue to reinforce to us that our goal to be a best-in-class omnichannel retailer is the right path for success. Our two priorities remain the same, and all areas of the company are focused on them: driving traffic and operational excellence. Our success in achieving our goals on those priorities will be driven by improvement in each of our key initiatives that are part of that strategic framework.","And looking at each of those initiatives individually, first product: our Active business produced a mid-teen double-digit increase over last year across both footwear and apparel, driven by the addition of Under Armour to our offering, but also sales increases with both NIKE and adidas. Under Armour in particular continued a very strong performance and beat the sales plan across almost all categories.","We've gained significant market share in active apparel and footwear in the first half of the year and expect that to continue in the back half based on assortment improvements and our momentum.","Total national brand penetration rose to 53% of sales for the quarter, up 300 basis points, driven by the Active category growth but also positive sales results from national brands like Levi's, Van Heusen, Haggar and Fitbit.","The largest improvement in sales trend compared to the first quarter actually came in our private brand portion of our proprietary brand portfolio. That improvement in turn was driven by the impact of our speed initiative in our supply chain and our effort to focus on our largest and most important private brands. As a result, there was marked improvement in our three largest private brands: Sonoma, Croft & Barrow and Apt. 9.","Two of our largest exclusive brands, Simply Vera Vera Wang and Lauren Conrad, posted double-digit sales increases in the quarter. In our focus on easy experience, our efforts to provide a best-in-class omnichannel experience accelerated in the second quarter. Online demand sales grew 19%, an accelerated growth rate from the first quarter. More importantly, our stores fulfilled 31% of our online demand units, significantly ahead of both last year and the fulfillment rate in the first quarter. Both ship from store and buy online pick up in-store improvement contributed to that result.","Productivity metrics improved resulting in a lower cost of shipping and fulfillment as a percent of total digital sales, which in turn improved our profitability. We have greater conviction than ever that leveraging our store base to accommodate continued growth in customer online ordering is the right strategy for us.","Digital conversion improved at a double-digit rate via better customer experiences on smartphone and smartphone app. This is critical, as this is clearly where digital traffic is going. Mobile accounted for 66% of our online traffic and 42% of our online revenue in the quarter.","Technology improvements on both the application and the device side and our omnichannel efforts are beginning to have a significant positive impact on the customer experience and on our cost of providing that improved experience. And finally, our fifth e-fulfillment center is coming fully on board next week and we believe that capital investment will pay off substantially as we enter the holiday season this year.","In our focus on savings and personalization, as you heard earlier, our marketing expense was both better than planned and better than last year. Several key marketing initiatives had significant impact driving these results: more targeted and personalized offers, Yes2You Reward redemption acceleration and a new pricing campaign we introduced as a part of our overall price clarity initiative.","We continue to believe that our efforts around personalization and using both data and new technology to drive response rates on our marketing spend will combine to provide us the ability to improve our productivity in our marketing over the longer-term.","The testing of the Your Price functionality online for customers continued to produce results, and we now intend to roll-out Your Price to all channels in Q3. As a reminder, Your Price is the personalized price of individual items based on your own specific offers and it has lifted conversion online.","We also launched a new smart cart application providing customers an opportunity to save more by choosing to pick up in-store versus ship-to-home on their online orders. We believe that can lower costs and also improve brick-and-mortar traffic at the same time. There were improved sales trends in both our Kohl's Charge and non-Kohl's Charge customer base, but as expected, the increase was more significant with our non-Kohl's Charge customer.","As you know, the components of our loyalty platform, Kohl's Cash, Yes2You Rewards and the Kohl's Charge card, have continued to grow in importance for us and the platform has been successful in driving customer behavior. We believe it's the best loyalty program in retail.","In order to further improve the impact of this program on driving traffic and sales, we intend to pilot an evolution of that platform next spring that we think will make it even better. We have three objectives in that loyalty pilot: simplify it, broaden the reach and make the platform even more rewarding. Expect to hear more details about that in our third quarter earnings call in November.","Finally, as I mentioned on the first quarter call, we're activating a very targeted effort to capture more than our fair share of sales from competitor stores that are closing in our trade areas. The marketing supporting that plan started at the end of July and will continue through the fall and holiday season. We do believe there's a significant sales opportunity for us to capture in several hundred stores, and early results on that are promising.","In our focus on store optimization, we believe that our improved results show that our store optimization strategy is the right one for us, and we continue to prioritize driving traffic into our stores along with leveraging our physical stores more effectively to improve both the customer experience and our own profitability.","Our second quarter traffic improvement, lower inventory levels across the company and improved metrics on stores' fulfillment of online orders all lend support to the rationale of our plan to amplify both the role and the relevancy of our stores.","Improvement in inventory management as a result of our standard-to-small store strategy has led to consistently lower inventory in those stores with virtually no impact on sales, a better customer experience and improved profitability.","As part of our small store strategy, we will open four new 35,000 square foot stores in October in more dense trade areas, as that concept is gaining traction from both sales and operational aspects.","As part of that belief that physical stores are a source of strength in an omnichannel world, we are testing and iterating our future store experience. The objective there is to more clearly determine what our stores will look like and how they will operate in the future. We call this initiative Your Store, extending the concept of personalization to the level of an individual store.","Our vision now is that every Kohl's store will be uniquely tailored to meet the needs of the community it serves. That will be accomplished by tapping into each store's customer analytics and insights to hyper-localize assortment, marketing and customer service, leveraging technology to raise the bar on a frictionless store experience and refining a store operation's model that is both more responsive to customer need and even more efficient than today. The testing of these Your Store idea started in May, and we expect to share more detail on the results and next steps early next year.","In summary, much as I said in the first quarter call, we continue to make progress across the company and embracing speed and agility is the path to improved performance. We have two priorities in doing so: driving traffic and operational excellence. While much of what we have shared has been around the driving traffic priority, we've also made very good progress on our priority around operational excellence.","As you know, over the last few years, our expense rate has risen, driven by hourly wage and benefit increases, the impact of our long-term technology investments and the growth of digital demand as a percent of our total business. That has led to lower levels of income over the same period. While we remain even more committed to our goal of achieving best-in-class as an omnichannel retailer, those headwinds continue to be present looking forward.","As a result, we've clearly seen the need to identify ways to work faster and smarter, and the organization has embraced that goal. We now believe that we can capture over $250 million of SG&A savings from our current annualized rate over the next three years, which will offset many of these headwinds. As you've seen in the improvement this year in our SG&A performance, we're beginning to get some traction on some of those efforts already.","And with that, we'll be happy to take some of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Good morning. Congrats on the solid quarter, and, Bruce, welcome. Wanted to start out and just confirm on the comp. You mentioned transactions were positive in July. Were total comps also positive in July? I think you've been seeing a nice lift in average transaction value in recent quarters, so I'm just curious if that's beginning to subside. And any other puts and takes there? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, I'm actually looking at that right now. It's pretty much flat for the July period. I think you know, Mark, that we've tried to consistently message that the key thing we think that has to change \u2013 and I know you are in agreement on this \u2013 for us to achieve better results is to improve traffic. And so we probably have a bigger spotlight on traffic movement and transactions increasing than we even do in our overall sales results because we know that's sort of the leading indicator that people are visiting our stores more often. We've had a lot of success on the conversion side in our stores. And so if we can get more people into the stores, we're pretty confident that'll lead to sales increases. Thanks.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks. And maybe following up on gross margin as well; down slightly in the quarter but it was the toughest comparison of the year. So I guess as the comparisons get a little bit easier and these various inventory and speed initiatives ramp, do you have more confidence that results could potentially come in at the high-end of the range provided?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, we haven't updated any of our guidance from the beginning of the year. I think at the beginning of the year, we telegraphed that we expect that most of the margin improvement to occur early, particularly in the first quarter. But certainly you're right. The improvement on our merchandise margin, which is margin prior to the impact of shipping and fulfillment on our margin, improved and we did do better. And certainly, you're right that we are seeing the results of all of our initiatives on fulfillment positively impacting our shipping and fulfillment costs. So our gross margin I think we feel like is moving in the right direction but we definitely haven't updated in any of the guidance, which assumed I think a modest increase for the year; most of it coming in the first quarter.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That's helpful, thanks. And best of luck.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning. The AUR increase in the quarter, was that 100% driven by lower clearance sales? Or were there any other factors that drove that?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I think it's a mix. I mean, clearance definitely had obviously an impact on it. As you know AUR is sort of an outcome of a bunch of different variables like the mix of our business, the percent of the business we do online, versus brick-and-mortar, where that business comes from a regular price and clearance perspective. Clearance helped our average unit retail improve for sure, but there's been a pretty consistent pattern of improved average unit retail results that are a factor of the mix that I just talked about. And of course it goes without saying, the factor of national brands growing in penetration, right?","I mean national brands have a higher average unit retail. National brands in our Active and Wellness business have a particularly higher average unit retail. So those are all kind of tailwinds for us from an average unit retail performance which basically circles us back to the original challenge for us, and it's what we're pursuing so aggressively which is to change the trend in traffic. Because if we can change the trend in traffic into our stores, then all those benefits that I just touched on become incremental and build on the traffic level.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then the headwinds that offset some of the lower clearance selling on gross margin, would you characterize that as an acceleration in online penetration? Or was that more national brand focused?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","The headwinds on average unit retail you mean?","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","On gross margin. So obviously...","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, I mean, fundamentally, the difference between merchandise margin, which increased, and gross margin which didn't, was simply a function of an accelerated rate of growth in our digital business. And as you know, the main factor there, it was a little bit of a mix factor for sure, but the main factor there is that there are shipping and fulfillment costs that come into play that are a headwind for us.","I think more and more as I just alluded to with Mark, more and more we're getting more confidence that we can manage our merchandise margin up as a function of a lot of different things, and that will offset the impact of that headwind on shipping and fulfillment. And then secondarily, I think more and more we're gaining confidence that the strategy to amplify the role and relevancy of the store by leveraging the store inventory and using technology to drive fulfillment from our stores is helping that as well.","Bruce H. Besanko - Kohl's Corp.","Can I just add on to that, too Kevin. Lorraine, this is Bruce. The cost of shipping, that delta between the merch margin and the gross margin that Kevin was talking about, that cost of shipping was this quarter, and continues to be in line with sort of the 20 basis points to 30 basis points the company has discussed in the past, so it's that omnichannel component that's in the cost of shipping.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And then one last quick one. You've commented on NIKE performance in some prior quarters, can you give us an update on that just with the Under Armour pads now in the store for the full quarter?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","It's been great. Obviously that was a point of attention for us because introducing an amazing brand like Under Armour into our Active business doesn't help if all it does is move sales around from some other brand, but as I alluded to, NIKE, and in fact adidas, another really important brand in Active and Wellness, both had positive sales increases in the second quarter in the face of a massive Under Armour extension, and it lifted our overall sales in Active, in apparel and footwear up by I think in the range of like 14%. So, really positive, extremely positive.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. Please go ahead.","Paul Lejuez - Citi","Hey, guys. Paul Lejuez. Kevin, you spoke about transactions turning positive in July. Was that at the store level specifically? Or are you talking about overall, including e-com, and whatever your answer is there, is it coming more from your customer shopping more? Or are you getting the new customer into the store?","And then separate for Bruce, just curious if in your short time there, if there's anything you're seeing within the organization that you'd describe as low hanging fruit in terms of just the way to do things cheaper, faster, smarter, any thoughts there? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","The transaction number \u2013 this is Kevin, Paul. You get your name butchered every time I feel bad for you.","Paul Lejuez - Citi","All good.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","On the transaction side, we provide transaction data based on the total business, and so that increase in July is a reflection of both the combination of the brick-and-mortar and the digital business together, though they improved across the board.","In terms of where that came from, is it more from existing customer visits or more from new customer visits? It's a combination of both. Some of the news in terms of identification of new customers, frankly, is extremely encouraging. I hesitate to share some of that detail with you right now because it's relatively early, and as you know, we've introduced a big new brand in the spring season that we think has helped that. But I think what we're seeing in the data is that new customers are a more meaningful part of the overall change in trend. And so while it's encouraging, I think we'll let that go for a quarter or two and then we'll probably be in a position where we could share some more detail on that. Bruce?","Bruce H. Besanko - Kohl's Corp.","Hi, Paul. Good to speak with you. It's been a long while. So in terms of my perspective, I would say that the company has done a very good job managing margin and managing expenses over time. And as Kevin said, we're targeting $250 million of expense reductions which we believe will offset some of the headwinds the company's been facing. So it's probably a little too early for me to say more than that, but maybe I'll add just a little bit of color in terms of what I'm seeing at Kohl's and part of the reason why I joined, which may be helpful.","First of all, I'm delighted to be here. While retail has been a challenging sector and the department store sector has been particularly challenging, Kohl's in my view is well-positioned for the future. We have a great strategy. I think we have the right focus in terms of operational excellence and driving traffic. The company has got a great set of assets including a terrific management team with a really deep bench. I think the store base very strong, 90% are off-mall. There's 80% that are within 15 miles of folks in the U.S.","So it's a very strong store base. We're going to continue to invest in it. We're making a significant investment in our omnichannel experience to be, as Kevin mentioned, best-in-class omnichannel player. We have a strong, healthy credit card portfolio, which is another key asset and competitive strength. We have a great mix of national brands, private brands, exclusive brands. And so, there's this very significant focus by the company's leadership team on customers and I think that's a particular strength.","And then, just finally, we've got a really strong balance sheet. Wes and the management team here including Jill Timm have done a great job setting a capital structure that supports the company's strategy. So, over time, I'll figure out where there may be additional opportunities but as I said, I couldn't be more delighted than to be here. And I think the progress the company is making in terms of the operational excellence under Jill's leadership has been terrific.","Paul Lejuez - Citi","Thanks a lot. Good luck, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning. On the Active pad, with the Under Armour \u2013 and you said, Kevin \u2013 leading sales, have you increased your expectations for Under Armour for the full year contribution? And I was just wondering if you might have any update around the expectations to what that could do to help the comp in terms of the top line for this year? And the second question that I have is around the marketing and advertising with competitive store closures. Do you have an estimate on the actual dollar opportunity that you see as you pursue this marketing and this type of approach in the back half of the year?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Bob. On the Under Armour business, the short answer is yes. By default, if I am saying to you that we exceeded our plan in the first quarter with Under Armour and we exceeded that plan in the second quarter with Under Armour, we are going to exceed the original plan that we had for the year.","In addition, we've worked with them and they've been very responsive and very flexible and supportive of opening up our ability to accelerate the rate of growth into the fall and the holiday season with product and delivery. So my sense is that the positive impact from Under Armour on our Active and Wellness initiative is only going to continue, and there's a possibility of course that it could grow.","More importantly to me, on the Active and Wellness pad, certainly equally as important is that it has really turned into a big positive for the business. And so I'm as excited about the fact that we were able to introduce a massive new brand like that and still get a sales increase with the biggest brand that we have in the entire store, which is NIKE, and to me, that is what's most exciting.","On the marketing thing as it relates to the competitive closures, no, we wouldn't share that kind of detail. I think we'd be getting into a lot of proprietary information. As you can imagine, it's market-based, so we'd be going down a slippery slope. But I would just say to you there's no question it is incrementally positive. I mean, there's no question in my mind that as we activate a targeted effort, it is going to be a positive tailwind for us in sales and I'm looking forward to that as we enter the back-to-school season.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. And then, Kevin, on the Active and Wellness pad, is that gross margin accretive in total, or is it still sort of national brands versus private brands in terms of the mix \u2013 the adverse mix on national brands?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I mean, generally on a rate basis, as you know, private \u2013 our proprietary brand assortment delivers a higher merchandise margin rate. But as you also know, that has never been a focus of this company. Our focus has always been about putting the best foot forward with the customer on product, and the brands that we have in the Active business are what people want more of, and so we're going to give them more of that. And we think that will lead to driving more traffic and driving more sales. It's all about dollars, it's not about rate. So certainly, the national brands deliver a little bit lower rate than private brands.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. It's been over a year since we had the 15 store closings that took place in the second quarter I believe last year. I just wanted a little bit more details on the analysis done in terms of sales that moved online or moved to other stores, what you were able to recapture, and just any other thoughts around maybe future door closings or how you're thinking about long-term store count?","And also back to the prior conversation around SG&A, just maybe more specifically on the second half, how we should think about the rate of growth for expenses relative to what we saw in the first half? Thank you.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Paul. I can probably take a stab at the first part, and Bruce can probably add some information on the second part relative to the SG&A.","On the store closure analysis, as we indicated at the end of last year, there were some pretty consistent findings through that period of closure. And generally, what I would say is that the retention of sales from closed stores by other Kohl's stores in the same trade area have continued around the same rate, which is around 30% or so. Of course, they range, but generally around 30%; that there is an impact on a market when you have fewer stores in it and share of mine is therefore decreased, and as a result, those areas where we've closed stores, the rate of growth in our omnichannel business has been a little less and that was a finding early on, and it continues to be so.","Everything that we've learned from that store closure pilot has been that reinforcing the importance of a great physical footprint. And we've said over and over again, and we have seen nothing that doesn't support this. In fact, I think the thesis is growing stronger. Certainly, probably smaller stores, certainly, as I alluded to, we are testing Your Store, which is a concept to what does the store look like in the future both operationally and from a customer experience standpoint, they're going to look different. But I don't see store closures has a meaningful impact anywhere in the near future. That doesn't mean there won't be individual stores, just like always, who will look at the financial performance of and make a conclusion to make a change. But, in general, we feel great about the portfolio we have. We're opening new stores this fall but they are very different than the stores we've opened in the past. So, I feel good about that for sure. You should not expect to hear anything about store closures this year.","Bruce H. Besanko - Kohl's Corp.","I would just add to your comment too, Kevin, on the stores which is this company, like you would expect, goes through economic analyses in terms of our store performance and we make the right judgments based on cash flows. And so, the company will continue to prune its portfolio over time, but we've got a really strong store base at this point.","And then, I know you had a question in terms of the SG&A, so let me just make a couple of comments. One is don't forget that this year is one of those anomalies in which our company will have a 53rd week. I'd refer you, Paul, back to the original outlook that folks gave at the beginning of the year just to kind of refresh on the impacts of the 53rd week, which will obviously have an impact on SG&A. In terms of \u2013 let me just make a comment on the second quarter and then I'll move on to the second half, which is where your question is. So we had a good second quarter. As we said in the prepared remarks, we had $3 million less than the prior year though. On a rate basis, we deleveraged by about 12 basis points. I think this whole story goes to the fact that the company has done a great job in terms of managing costs over time and is starting \u2013 in the second quarter, it's showing some of that effort.","I would just then \u2013 in terms of the second half, I think we should begin to start seeing some of the impact from this work on operational excellence that Kevin has talked about and that I know Jill had mentioned in our prior call. So we're going to do things differently, and I think that will result in greater efficiencies, more productivity and so on.","And so, we have the entire organization focused on the operational excellence, and so I think we're probably maybe three quarters of the way through an initial review of all these costs. And so on an annualized basis, I think we're comfortable that we could achieve expense savings of over $250 million over the next three years, some of which may begin to appear in the second half.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you for that color. Very quick follow up on earlier comments about July. Just wanted to ask more specifically about the early read on back-to-school. Any discussion around what you've seen or what your expectations are or how you're positioned in this back-to-school selling season and how you're faring in those particular categories?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Early reads on back-to-school are good. Some categories were outstanding; some were okay. That's always the case early in the season. It's a long season because it goes for us from essentially mid-July through just past Labor Day.","From a category perspective, you kind of know this already, of course, but Active category is really an important category at back-to-school and we're particularly performing well there. I mentioned Levi's is a particularly strong performer again in the second quarter. So, I think that's an indication of how we feel about our denim business overall. We've got some improvements coming in some of the businesses that have been more of a laggard business, like children's. So it's certainly early, Paul, but I'm positive.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good luck.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you help me reconcile a few things here? As I look through the components you gave us to think about the comps, the traffic was positive in July but lower in the quarter. And then I think you said the average transaction value was positive in the quarter. It seems like the back half there is that ATV went negative in July, despite \u2013 you know you mentioned lower clearance levels, better inventory, higher national brand penetration. Was there something specific related to ATV in July that's been the negative that we should think about?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I mean the short answer is no.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","And one of the things I try to avoid is to obsess over individual metrics and individual periods because, of course, we look at these metrics not just on a monthly, quarterly basis; we look at them literally on a daily basis. And they can get you to really wrong conclusions. The fundamental message I'm giving is the improvement in our sales trend was driven entirely by an improvement in traffic. And I think we believe that's going to continue. And so that \u2013 you can look at all these other numbers monthly, weekly, forward-looking, backward looking but it's about traffic. And so we've got to get traffic positive. We do that, there's a lot of good things coming.","Bruce H. Besanko - Kohl's Corp.","And the reason we made the comment about July being positive was, just to that point, to emphasize the fact that we've seen a trend shift from earlier in the year, and so the sequential improvement for the quarter was great and the improvement in July was particularly noteworthy.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","That's a good point. Let me ask two quick follow-ups, July, so as our look at positive transactions in July, you said it improved. I don't know if that base line is from first quarter. It sounds like it's positive year-over-year, but as you break down \u2013 to help us get out of the detail of just July, how sustainable do you think that is? Should we think about this as the work that you've done to drive traffic in your stores can stabilize in a slightly positive territory on a year-over-year basis going forward?","And then separately, I just wanted to ask on the $250 million in cost saves, you said a couple times that it will offset some of the headwinds. Can I interpret that as meaning less deleverage going forward but still a deleverage path or how to think about what the $250 million means in the context of actual dollar growth? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","On both of those, again, without getting into the weeds on traffic \u2013 and I probably belabored this point in our prepared remarks \u2013 but as I said, driving traffic is the single biggest priority for the entire company. And so, do we believe that the things we are doing are making an impact on that? Yes. We can point to actual results, as Bruce just alluded to, that back that up.","We haven't changed our guidance for the year. We have assumptions that were built-in at the beginning of the year that, of course, aspirationally we want to exceed. We'd love to do that, and we think the way we're going to exceed it is through this traffic metric. So optimism is here for sure. We can point to specifics to back up that optimism, but nothing has changed.","On the headwinds thing, we haven't provided guidance beyond this year, and so to get into, hey, does that savings on an annualized run rate offset all of the headwinds, most of the headwinds, some of the headwinds, we're not prepared to talk about that.","I think the main message, Michael \u2013 and I think it's a really important message for investors is \u2013 investors have challenged us to say, hey, we understand the difficulty in the sector that you operate in, and you seem to be doing a good job managing through that and there are a lot of good things coming, but at the end of the day over the last few years your net income has fallen. It's fallen because you haven't been able to find a way to offset these increasing expenses.","We're going to put a stake in the ground in saying, okay, we have a way to offset these increasing expenses, and we'll provide more color on that as we go forward and when we get to the point where we're going to provide future guidance, we'll definitely give you more detail around the specifics.","Bruce H. Besanko - Kohl's Corp.","Just to build on what you said, Kevin, totally on board. We're going to continue to invest in the business to drive traffic and to drive sales. One of the investments will be in our people. In order to stay competitive with the industry, we're going to continue to make investments in technology and our omnichannel experience. We're going to continue to make investments to deliver value to our customers in terms of marketing and other things. So this is the right process, and we believe that this process in terms of operational excellence will make us stronger and it will indeed help in terms of the cost structure going forward.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks a lot, guys.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Courtney Willson - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Courtney Willson on for Oliver today. Thanks for taking our question. Just on your women's business, can you provide more detail on your progress here? Which parts of the business you're most pleased with? And then where you're most focused on improvements in the back half? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Sure. There was progress obviously in the women's business. It probably goes without saying that the most significant, solid part of the business is the Active business. They shared in the growth in Active just like the men's and children's areas did in apparel and like footwear did, so I would see that continuing to go into the fall season for sure.","The softer part of the business in women's has been the Sportswear business, both contemporary and classic sportswear, and that's not news. I don't think \u2013 that's not a news flash for anybody. That has been driven by an underperformance in our proprietary brand portfolio because proprietary brands over-penetrate in the women's apparel area more so than anywhere else in the store, and as we've had more disappointing results in proprietary brands, naturally that has impacted that business a little more disproportionately.","I would point you to the comments we made around our speed initiative. That's our solution to that. We're seeing traction on that for sure in the second quarter. Our private brand performance led in terms of improving on the trendline basis and women's was a critical part of that. And so I think embracing the speed initiative on sourcing is the solution to changing the trendline in private brands, and private brands is the pathway for us to change the trendline in women's apparel. So that's how we're looking at the fall.","Bruce H. Besanko - Kohl's Corp.","And, Kevin, you've got \u2013 between you and Michelle, you've put a new leader in charge of the women's business about six months ago and I think I had a chance to spend a few minutes with them the other night and I think he's got a lot of enthusiasm behind those initiatives.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Yes, for sure.","Courtney Willson - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the details.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Just looking at your balance sheet. So sales have declined I think around $600 million since 2012 but inventory is still actually up a degree, I think, about $50 million over that period. I guess, how much room do you see to continue to cut inventory levels in the stores? And then just any concentration as we think by category where you really think that you still have the most meat?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I'm going to answer that \u2013 this is Kevin \u2013 just because I don't think Bruce is in a position to be able to talk about this as well. We're looking at inventory management in the exact same way as we're looking at our operational excellence initiative on the expense side, and that is sustainable, consistent, long-term reduction. And the way we get there is on a multi-part platform. Our speed initiative and our sourcing strategy is going to allow us to deliver product more often and closer to need. The strategies we have in place to hyper localize our assortments make us better at presenting relevant merchandise on a store-by-store basis and not presenting things people don't want.","Our standard-to-small store strategy has been incredibly successful. I think we've alluded to you in the past, Matt, that standard-to-small store strategy where we've taken 300-plus stores which are standard in size and created footprints inside the store on a physical basis, on a fixture basis, and inventory basis that are much smaller has resulted in somewhere in the range of 10% less inventory and essentially no change to sales. So that's made us more profitable.","So as I look out forward, our focus is just on the sustainable and consistent reduction, and I wanted to make sure I pointed out in the prepared remarks, we came into the quarter with less inventory in units and dollars, we came out of the quarter with less inventory in units and dollars, and I see that continuing going forward.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just a follow-up to circle back to expenses. So on the $250 million in SG&A savings you outlined, it actually lines up with trough levels five years ago as a percent of sales. So it makes sense. But is the primary takeaway here that it will really help to offset some of your sales-driving initiatives and may not actually show up as aggregate bottom line SG&A dollar reduction? Am I thinking about that right?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, obviously, a lot depends on what the revenue line is, right. There are some of our expenses that are variable, and so if sales start to improve, there are variable expenses that move along with it. Store payroll is the obvious one you always know. But, yes, I think you're kind of generally thinking about it the right way, which is we're saying to ourselves, okay, \"Look, we haven't been successful at driving sales yet. Yes, there's a lot of optimism. Yes, we can point to all the green shoots. Yes, there's improvement in the second quarter.\" But it's fair for investors to say to us you haven't done it yet on the sales line.","Therefore, what we should do is ensure that while we remain committed to the longer-term future as an omnichannel retailer and that requires us to make these investments around technology, around average hourly wage and benefit, and obviously continue to ship and fulfill more of our customers' needs online, we have to find a way to offset all those increased expenses. And that's basically what we're saying is we believe we can do that. And I think you are thinking about it the right way. Yes, in a perfect world, we'll actually be able to reduce the expenses. And trust me, that's where we're focused on, but I think what we are saying today is for the first time that we believe we have a pathway to offset those things.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good morning. You referenced, Kevin, I think in your prepared remarks about some assortment improvements planned on the athletic pad in the second half. Could you just elaborate on that? And then on the footwear strength, obviously led by athletic, could you just speak to also how the fashion footwear, the nonathletic performed during the quarter? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Sure. I mean overall in the assortment improvement, what I'm suggesting is that the trend line that we've had in active apparel and footwear which began some time ago, we had planned and have activated more offering as we move into the back-to-school holiday period just broadly. So our pads for Active and Wellness have increased in size.","Michelle is also developing a secondary plan, which outsizes our active apparel even further, and we are going to experiment with how high is up on that. And then uniquely, I would say more to Under Armour, we entered the Under Armour partnership with certain expectations, and they were very aggressive. I think we alluded to the fact that it was going to be the biggest brand launch we've ever had and it was. But we've realized and they've realized that there's actually more opportunity. And so I think some of the responses to the original and initial reaction by customers are incorporated into our fall and holiday, and so we're lifting, particularly in some areas like footwear, where we think we've got big opportunity.","On the footwear business itself, to be totally honest with you, Erinn, I can have Bruce get back to you on the specifics. There's no question athletic drove the footwear increase, but I do think there is some substantial progress on sort of at leisure or active casual with certain brands that are pretty promising. One of the brands I know early in the first quarter that didn't perform as well was Skechers. And Skechers I think had by far the biggest improvement in the second quarter in terms of performance, but I don't want to get \u2013 I'm not comfortable with all the detail on that, but we can definitely get back to you on that.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you. And then if I can just speak to the accessory category, you talked about that being the most significant improvement quarter-on-quarter. What categories within accessories did you see kind of glide that path toward better results? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, one of the categories that had in particular a big change in trend was jewelry, particularly fine jewelry. We had a super-successful Mother's Day event. We had consistent performance throughout the second quarter in jewelry. And I think you know that in prior quarters jewelry was definitely a big drag on our overall accessory business. So that was actually a big change in trend. Fashion accessories I think were strong as well, but if I had to call out one thing, accessories was essentially the worst-performing business we had in the store in the first quarter, and it had the biggest improvement by far in trend in the second quarter. And if I had to call one single thing, it was the fine jewelry business change.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Bruce H. Besanko - Kohl's Corp.","Can I just jump in on the footwear question, I'll just answer that now. The kids did well. It was a good comp. Men's did fine. And then juniors, we missed on juniors. That was a challenging area.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Hey. Good morning, Kevin and Bruce. You spoke to Under Armour being a massive initiative, massive expansion. Could you qualify the comp growth for us here in the second quarter?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","We don't provide specific detail of the impact of individual brands. I do think, Chuck, at the beginning of the year we sort of indicated that we thought it had the potential to lift sales in the like 0.75% range on a comp basis. It's exceeded its plan a little bit in the first four or five months. So if anything, you might say it's probably helped a little bit more than that. But I think that's kind of a good general number. When we get to the end of the year and we're able to look back at the entire year, we will probably be able to give you some more color on that.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay, great. And when we think about the national brand offering into 2018 and even in 2019, what parts of the floor do you see the biggest opportunities to increase your national brand presence?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, two things: one, of course, we're working hard on that, so there's nothing I can share specifically around it. But I would say generally, to be honest, Michelle's probably primary focus is we have some really powerful national brands currently in the portfolio that she sees as having big opportunity, and a lot of them are around this active and wellness space. And I'm not just talking about active apparel and footwear, but wellness throughout the whole store.","Many of those brands are national brands, naturally, whether they're in the soft home area or they're in our accessory area or they're in the core active apparel and footwear area. We need more national brands for sure in our core apparel areas, and so that's our focus. We're definitely pursuing them in a big way. And we're pointing out in most cases that the reaction that we've had to the Under Armour launch has been spectacular, and I think that's an indication for others as to what the possibility is. And that combined with the fact that I think we're one of the few companies who has a well-articulated strategy to continue to have a massive physical footprint; in fact, perhaps expand it to those smaller stores, is a really good selling proposition for brands.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Great. And then just to dovetail off that, one of your non-direct competitors down in Bentonville has been on a pretty big acquisition spree of late, acquiring a number of customer-facing e-commerce brands. And given the strength of your balance sheet, I'm wondering if that's something you would look to explore to try to get younger and the Millennial shopper?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Yes, I mean, all options are on the table, of course. We've I think tried to be specific in terms of how we approach our capital structure. The most important thing for us, the most important thing is to plow back investment into our existing business. And that's both into the physical part of our business, but as we've talked about a lot, the digital part of our business. So that's the number-one priority.","Number-two priority, of course, is to maintain and hopefully increase shareholder return through a strong dividend program. And as you know and I think Bruce alluded to, we continue to buy back shares because we think that's an appropriate utilization of funds. If we identify investments outside the company that we think can accelerate our effort to drive traffic into our existing stores that would certainly be something we would be interested in.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay, great. And just last question. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on the smart cart initiative? What's the associated discount with that, and has that rolled out across the entire chain at this point in time?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","No, it's going to roll out in the third quarter. Just as we did with the Your Price initiative, we'll roll it out first on desktop in order to track the results effectively. I think the plan, without being able to get into all the specifics, I think the plan is to test various offers and ideas to see what response gets the best reaction from customers and proceed accordingly. But I think based on past, this is going to work. No question about it. This is going to be a very successful strategy. And the only reason we're rolling it out in the way we are is that we've learned over time, walk before you run, learn how customers react, and find the right sweet spot as to what is the exchange that we're going to make with the customer to entice them to consider that trip to the store as opposed to us incurring the expense of fulfilling it to their home.","And we'll learn that through the period, and then I would expect that we'll roll it out across all platforms, and we'll roll it out with a more consistent application. But I'm really excited about this initiative because we're kind of back to where we started. What's the number one thing we want to do? Drive traffic to our stores. We have this growing digital business, but a lot of it is growing by us shipping to customers, or sometimes of course we're fulfilling that from the store to ship to customers, but it's going to their homes. We need more of those customers who choose to come into the stores, and that's why I'm excited about this.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Great. Thanks, and good luck.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, as we have passed the bottom of the hour, that was the final question for today.

Good morning and welcome to Kohl's third quarter earnings conference call. We are pleased to report that our business recaptured momentum during the third quarter, returning to growth with a comparable sales increase of 0.4%. The quarter started off positive in August, driven by our third consecutive year of growth during the back-to-school season and ended strong with October being the best performing month.","A few of the key highlights of the quarter included an acceleration in our active business, continued strength in digital, improved performance in our stores, and improvement across all of our lines of business versus the first half. In fact, all of our lines of business were positive except for one, which I will address later. This gives us confidence as we move into the important holiday season. We have an increasingly relevant product offering. We're seeing positive traffic trends and we have a compelling marketing plan in place to drive traffic and sales.","Our opportunity to drive growth and capture share this holiday is significant. We are leaning into growth and investing in customer value to drive engagement and new customer acquisitions. Our holiday kick-off event on November 1 was successful exceeding our expectations.","I'd now like to welcome Jill Timm as our new Chief Financial Officer, who many of you already know. Jill is a well-respected and seasoned finance leader with a great understanding of our business and the retail industry. She joined Kohl's in 1999 and most recently served as EVP of Finance, leading the finance organization and our operational excellence strategy, as well as supporting many of our top strategic initiatives. Jill has been an invaluable partner to the entire leadership team, and I am confident that she will continue to contribute significantly to the business.","I would also like to thank Bruce Besanko for his significant contributions to the company. Bruce added great value across many parts of the business during his time here and further strengthened our overall finance organization. We wish him well in his retirement. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jill, who\u2019ll provide details on our financial results. After Jill\u2019s remarks, I will return to add more color on the business and update you on our key initiatives.","Jill Timm","Thank you, Michelle. I'm honored and excited to lead Kohl\u2019s finance organization during this very exciting time. Kohl's is an outstanding company with a strong foundation and promising future, and I look forward to continuing partnering with Michelle and the entire leadership team to successfully drive our strategic initiatives, create new opportunities for growth, and drive value for our shareholders.","I will now discuss our Q3 financial results. Comparable sales increased 0.4%, representing a significant improvement from the first half of the year decline of down 3.2%. As Michelle indicated, we had successful back-to-school season. However, we experienced softness during the middle of the quarter as we saw an increasingly competitive promotional environment, a seasonally warm weather, and encountered modest disruption from all of the activity taking place in our stores as we launched a record number of brands. ","We reacted by enhancing our marketing offers and investing more in pricing. We are pleased with how the business responded with sales accelerating in October. Digital sales growth remained strong increasing at a mid-teens percent rate, which is on top of a mid-teens increase in the prior year. We also saw notable improvement in our stores during the period. Overall the West, Midwest, and South Central were the strongest regions. ","From a line of business perspective, all improved relative to the first half of the year. In particular men's, accessories, and footwear outperformed the company, while home and children were in line, and women's was below the company average. Importantly, all lines of business were positive during the quarter except women's which was down 1%. Michelle will provide additional comments on our sales results in her remarks. ","Moving to gross margin, third quarter gross margin decreased 67 basis points. Margin contracted more than we planned at the time of our August earnings call. As we progressed through the quarter, we made the intentional decision to be more aggressive with our pricing in response to the competitive environment and to build momentum in October ahead of the holiday season. ","This decision, along with the unfavorable mix due to the underperformance in our women's business impacted our gross margin. While cost of shipping continue to be a headwind, it normalized in Q3 and was in line with our expectations. SG&A increased 3.2% as we expected or $44 million to $1.4 billion. The increase was driven by a combination of the following. Store expenses increased as expected due to factors including costs related to the significant number of brand launches, wage rate pressures, earlier holiday hiring, and the Amazon Returns program.","Marketing expenses increased to support our efforts to accelerate sales, and technology expenses increased as we continued to prioritize investments. And due to the new lease accounting standard, rent expense was higher. ","Depreciation expense of $227 million was $16 million lower than last year. The decrease was primarily due to the maturity of our store portfolio, as well as the adoption of the new lease accounting standards, which essentially offset the related higher SG&A expense. Net interest expense was $11 million better for the quarter, due primarily to the benefit of last year's debt reductions and the adoption of the new lease accounting standard.","Moving on to taxes, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.6% as compared to last year's 17.6%, which benefited from favorable audit results. As it relates to one-time items, during the third quarter we recognized a $9 million gain on extinguishment of debt related to the purchase of leased equipment that was accounted for as a financing obligation.","On a GAAP basis for the quarter net income was $123 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.78. Excluding the non-recurring benefit that I just mentioned for the quarter net income was $116 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.74.","Looking at our store portfolio, we ended the quarter with 1,159 Kohl's stores, gross footage was 98 million square feet and selling footage was 82 million square feet. We opened four smaller-format stores during the third quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $490 million of cash and cash equivalents. This was a decline from last year as strong cash flows from operations, over the past year were used to repay debt in addition to funding our annual share repurchase program and dividends. Our inventory dollars increased 1%, which was an improvement relative to last quarter's 2% increase. We continue to expect to end the year with approximately flat inventory dollars.","Moving on to capital management, capital expenditures were $678 million year-to-date, $220 million higher than the prior year. As a result of our sixth e-commerce fulfillment center and increased investment in our store strategies including refreshes, new stores and right-sizes.","Kohl\u2019s weighted average diluted shares and shares outstanding at quarter-end were $157 million. We repurchased 2.7 million shares of our stock during the quarter. Last week our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.67 per common share. The dividend is payable on December 24th to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 11th.","Turning to guidance, as you saw in the release we are revising our annual adjusted earnings guidance to $4.75 to $4.95 per share. Our updated annual guidance incorporates our year-to-date results and the investments we're making to take advantage of the opportunities to further accelerate our sales and capture market share. We expect the heightened promotional environment to continue through the balance of the year. For the top line, we now expect comp sales of down 1.5% to down 1% for the year, which implies Q4 comparable sales in the range of flat to up 1%.","As it relates to gross margin rates we now expect it to be down 60, 65 basis points for the year, which reflects our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter. For SG&A we expect expenses to be at the high-end of the existing range, which is a 1.5% to 2% increase for the year. As a reminder approximately 40 basis points of the increase in 2019 is related to the new lease accounting standards.","And lastly, our guidance continues to assume share repurchases at the higher end of the $400 million to $500 million range.","I'll now turn the call back to Michelle, who'll provide additional details on our results and an update on our key initiatives.","Michelle Gass","Thank you, Jill. Let me touch on our Q3 performance and then move into providing an update on our key initiatives for the holiday season and beyond. On last quarter's call, we highlighted the return to positive comparable sales trend late in the period. This continued into August and led to another successful back-to-school season, driven by growth in many of the key areas we leaned into including Active, Denim and our children's business. ","However as Jill indicated, we experienced softness in September, as we saw an increasingly competitive environment and unseasonably warm weather. It was also an incredible amount of activity taking place in our stores during this time, as we launched a record number of brands. Given the heightened competitive environment, we responded by investing in pricing and enhancing our marketing offers recognizing the importance of entering the holiday season with momentum.","Our decisive actions were successful and enabled us to deliver a strong sales performance in October. While the quarter didn't meet our expectations I am pleased with how the entire team responded and worked with speed and agility to successfully execute all of our initiatives. In doing so, we positioned the business for a strong holiday season.","I'll now give you a little more color on our Q3 sales. Active continues to be a key growth driver in our business. Active sales increased 7% compared to last year. Active apparel sales increased at a high-single digit rate, driven by strong performance from our three key national brands Nike, Under Armour and Adidas, as well as additional relevant brands including Champions. And Active Footwear returned to positive growth with solid results from Adidas, Under Armour, Band [ph] and ASICS.","During the third quarter, we added Under Armour, Big & Tall and further executed against our in-store active expansion strategy. We increased the number of stores with additional active space to approximately 160 from 30. And we added 100 Adidas shop-in-shops expanding the penetration from 75 to 175 doors.","Now some additional details on our lines of business; Men's led the company driven by Active and Big & Tall. Our team business was also strong and benefited from the launch of our expanded online assortment with fanatics. Men's casual apparel was also a strength and from a brand perspective Levi's and Hagar, as well as our private brands Sonoma, and Apartment 9, all experienced solid growth. ","Our accessories business performed well once again and was above the company average, driven by strong growth in beauty, which was led by fragrance. We are also particularly pleased with the growth we're seeing in fine jewelry and in our gifting categories. Footwear also performed above the company average and we're pleased to see this return to growth after a soft start to the year. Growth was driven by Active and our women's dress casual business.","Home improved significantly in Q3, driven by the introduction of our new brand, Koolaburra by UGG Home and Scott Living, as well as innovation in many of our key categories like housewares and electronics, where we saw strong growth in vacuums and gaming. Home in particular, benefited from our investments in pricing. Children's continued to be solid and performed in line with the company. During the quarter, we saw strength in key classifications, such as Active and licensed entertainment.","And lastly, let me address our women's business, which made progressive improvement relative to the first half of the year, but was our only negative performing category at down 1%. We continue to be pleased with the strong performance we are seeing in our Active and Intimate business. However, we are seeing mixed results in casual apparel. In the short-term, we've made a number of moves to position the business for long-term health. This included exiting the Dana Buchman brand and introducing Nine West and Elizabeth and James.","With these introductions we refloated the layout of the women's area in our stores. So the brand adjacencies would better align with customer shopping preferences. While this has some disruption in the short-term, it positioned us well for the long-term. Of note, while women's underperformed in our stores it outperformed in digital, which shows our new brands are resonating with our customers.","So speaking of digital, we continue to be pleased with the momentum we're seeing. As Jill noted, digital sales increased at a mid-teens rate in Q3, which was on top of a similarly strong mid-teens growth last year. Mobile continues to be the primary driver of digital growth, with particularly strong performance from the Kohl\u2019s app. During the third quarter, the Kohl\u2019s app grew significantly faster than digital overall, with nearly double the traffic growth and nearly tripled the sales growth, as our loyal customers have increased their usage.","We also continue to see benefits from customer adoption of BOPUS and BOSS. In Q3 in store customer pickup penetration further increased as a percent of digital orders. We are also improving on speed with 95% of bogus orders available within one hour, which positions us very well for the holiday rush.","Our stores are also fulfilling more digital ship to home orders and this holiday we will expand the number of stores from 10 to 135 carrying incremental inventory to support the peak volume periods of our digital business.","Now let me share a brief update on the Amazon returns program. As you know, we completed the nationwide rollout of the Amazon returns program late in the second quarter. We continue to be very pleased with its overall performance. And based on the results we are seeing, we remain confident that it will have a positive contribution to operating income in 2019.","With the extension of the program consumer research indicates that customers are very satisfied with the service. They find it simple and easy to us and they intend to use it again.","The program is driving incremental traffic into our stores and we are particularly encouraged by the disproportionate amount of new customers, which on average are also younger than the typical Kohl\u2019s customer. We are very much looking forward to the holiday season, which will be the first with Amazon returns in stores nationwide.","The entire organization is focused on delivering exceptional customer service and ensuring that we are capitalizing on increased traffic. While we are pleased with the conversion rate, and it's performing consistent with our pilot stores, we are continuing to innovate and test ways to further improve productivity. Few examples include enhanced training, testing different offers and merchandising the customer service area to drive impulse purchases. ","I will now provide an update on our key initiatives for holiday and beyond. We remain very confident that we are set up to have a strong holiday season. This is driven by four key strategies. First, as I just mentioned, we will have Amazon returns in stores nationwide this holiday for the first time, which will drive additional traffic into our stores.","Second, we have more new brand launches than ever before. Third, we have a robust marketing plan and we'll be investing in value and pricing to drive new customer acquisitions. And fourth, we expect our strong double-digit growth in digital to continue.","The Holiday season is when Kohl\u2019s is at its best and this year will be no different. Our customers will discover new brands and be inspired by new gifting options literally at every turn. We're pleased with how we kicked off the holiday with our Black Friday preview event on November 1st. As we now look forward to the holiday season, we are confident that we have the right plans in place as we move into the key shopping weeks including new brands, exciting collaborations, new partnerships and leaning into key gifting categories. ","As it relates to new brands we're delivering a record amount of newness this holiday. In September we launched Koolaburra by UGG Home and Nine West footwear, apparel and accessories. In October, we launched Scott Living, our collaboration with the property brothers Jonathan Andrew Scott, which fills an important wide space opportunity in offering modern home decor. And recently, we launched our partnership with Ashley and Mary Kate Olson where we became the exclusive retailer of Elizabeth and James branded apparel, handbags and accessories.","We view each of these brand launches as an investment in driving future growth, while modernizing the Kohl\u2019s brand and attracting younger customers. Collectively they are off to a good start. In addition, we have exciting collaborations in place this season. We just introduced an exclusive limited edition women's apparel capsule designed in partnership with globally renowned designer Jason Wu. ","We also just launched in collaboration with Ellen DeGeneres on an assortment of pet offerings. New partnerships are also a key focus for us. Through our expanded relationship with Fanatics we've become an even stronger destination for team logoed sportswear and are attracting new and younger customers. And of course being the holiday season, we are leaning into key gifting categories.","We've expanded our cozy platform, doubled our toy assortment and are introducing new gift sets and beauty fragrance and fine jewelry. We will support our position as the leading destination for Active for the entire family with newness across sleeves [ph] and outerwear and we expect a strong licensed entertainment business, driven by the upcoming releases of Frozen 2 and Star Wars.","As we think about our marketing efforts, we know we need to be bold and strategic to cut through the increasingly competitive environment. The holiday period is the best time to capture new customers and we will take full advantage of maximizing this opportunity. We are committed to giving customers the most compelling and differentiated reasons to make Kohl\u2019s their holiday shopping destination. This season we are building on the strength of our marketing foundation and experimenting with new innovative ways to reach our customers both our core loyal customers and an increased focus on reaching millennials. ","We continue to make progressive improvement in our personalization efforts, reaching customers with the most relevant messages for them. For the holiday season tens of millions of our customer connections will be personalized in some way. Our ongoing testing demonstrates that we see an increase in both traffic and conversion through these personalized messages. ","And we continue to leverage digital media more extensively and more efficiently to reach customers where they are. As an example, this past quarter we completed our effort to bring digital search in-house. And we're partnering with Google to increase the use of machine learning and our media buying. We have also significantly increased our use of social media to reach both our core and younger audiences. ","Based on all of the efforts I have highlighted we are well-positioned for a strong holiday season and are strategically increasing our investments to fuel growth and customer acquisition. We believe that investing in the short-term will support our strategies to drive profitable growth over the long-term. ","I will now transition to our customer experience initiatives underway in both our stores and digital channels. From a digital perspective and as I mentioned on last quarter's call we began piloting a new site experience to elevate the customer experience, including more product storytelling, more personalization and better search capability, while also continuing to deliver a strong value message.","While it's early days and we're only testing a small portion of our traffic we're seeing good engagements. Based on the results we will look to further expand the pilot to a greater portion of our traffic early next year.","With regards to our stores we continue to make significant investments to improve the customer experience. While new brand introductions have been an especially important element of this in 2019, we are also stepping up our investments in modernizing our store base through a greater number of full refreshes. This will remain an important part of our strategy going forward.","And beyond that, let me highlight a few of these investment areas in our stores. Active continues to represent a centerpiece of our strategy and is another way our customers are experiencing modernized Kohl's. As I mentioned earlier we have expanded the penetration of Adidas shop-in-shops to 175 stores. We have also increased active square footage by 25% in approximately 160 of our highest performing stores. These stores feature a wider selection across all zones, additional fixtures and unique items.","And another example of how we're dedicating more to Active is the expansion of our women's plus assortment. Building on the success of Nike Plus this quarter we're adding Adidas and Under Armour Plus. Based on the strong Q3 results and our ongoing tests with the customer we continue to see Active as a long-term growth opportunity.","In Beauty we're making great strides in our pursuit of significant long-term growth. We launched several new beauty brands this quarter expanded the pilot of our new beauty experience to 12 stores and rolled out our new beauty impulse concept in 200 stores and online. While beauty is a relatively small business for us today it is growing fast and we have plans for it to be much bigger in the future. We look forward to sharing more with you early next year. ","Some of the other in-store experience projects include the outfit bar and Curated by Kohl\u2019s. The outfit bar merchandising concept continues to test well and we are evaluating the opportunity to expand the pilot beyond the 50 current stores next year. And we continue to be excited about Curated by Kohl\u2019s, our new innovative platform where we are showcasing emerging digitally native brands. We launched it last month in about 50 stores and online and are encouraged by the early results.","We're partnering with Facebook to bring Curated to life through social marketing efforts and to help identify brands that are creating a following on both their Facebook and Instagram platforms. We look forward to bringing new brands onto the platform next year.","We are also making progress with our store optimization strategy. During the third quarter two new right-size locations were opened by our partners and we expect several more to open in the fourth quarter. In addition, we opened four small format stores and see the potential for more in the future. Through both our rightsizing and small format strategies we continue to learn which will inform our future actions.","And lastly, let me remind you that we remain focused on our operational excellence initiative, which touches all parts of the business. We've been successful in saving well over our target of $250 million during the past three years and this has funded many of our growth initiatives. Our focus and efforts on this front will continue going forward.","In closing, although, the quarter didn't meet our expectations, I'm pleased that the business returned to growth. A direct result of the innovation the organization is driving across the company. And we expect the impact of these initiatives to continue to build. We remain firmly committed to driving strong financial performance and shareholder value over the long-term.","I'd also like to thank our incredible associates around the country. We introduced a lot of change into our business this quarter with the ramp-up of the Amazon returns program, the launch of several significant new brands and a lot of newness across the entire business. The team continues to execute very well and we're encouraged by the momentum heading into the important holiday season. We are ready to deliver an outstanding experience to both new and loyal customers at a time when Kohl's is at its very best. ","We're happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. ","Oliver Chen","Hi, thank you, and congratulations, Jill. Regarding promotions, it's been a promotional environment for a while. So I would love your thoughts on how this is different this year. And also what are your thoughts on what you're seeing with traffic? It sounds like you're pretty happy with traffic, has it been volatile?","And then finally would love more color on reflowing the layout of women's as it was a short-term disruption, but it seems like what the customer ultimately wants, how do we put that in the context of a lot of other new introductions that you're adding to the store? Thank you. ","Michelle Gass","Thanks, Oliver for the question. So, I'll address each of your questions sort of separately. First of all, your question around the promotional environment, as we expressed in our remarks, we did see a heightened promotional environment in the third quarter, and especially as we entered into the more traditional fall season in September.","I think for us at Kohl's, we stand for value. We have the best loyalty program in the industry, and we're really known and famous for delivering outstanding value. So, we must maintain and preserve this position.","We're at a really unique time at the company. And with all of our initiatives, all the innovation, the new brands, the traffic we're seeing for Amazon Returns, it's really important that we capitalize on this moment and drive market share and customer acquisition. ","So given the landscape and it is what it is and our guidance reflects that we expect that to continue into Q4, we are going to lean in and make this short-term investment in pricing and promotion as we need to make sure that we can capture these customers and importantly get them on our loyalty ladder for the long-term.","Secondly, to your point on traffic, overall traffic for the quarter, we are pleased. And while as I said in my remarks, we would have expected a different -- better results for the quarter, we made tremendous progress in both traffic and sales. From the first half of the year, we\u2019re up 360 basis points to get to a positive comp. And for us, momentum on the business and driving long-term health in the business, it has to start with growth. ","And then that has to start with traffic, and traffic has been and will continue to be the number one priority, and we are seeing really solid traffic in our stores, and that's coming from the initiatives we are launching, our marketing efforts, and yes the ramp up of the Amazon Returns program. I would say where the volatility took place in the quarter was we came out of the gates really strong in back-to-school. Things softened up in September. Combination of factors, promotional environment we\u2019ve hit on, weather becoming unseasonable and unfavorable for us and then we did have some disruption in our business, which I think speaks to your next question on the women's business.","That being said, we addressed all of those things and we leaned in when the conditions improved and ended the quarter with a very strong October. And then lastly, I was just going to hit on your women's question on the reflow, which is a deliberate action on our part to setup the women's business for long-term growth and health.","We have a very aggressive and thoughtful strategy, which includes exiting brands that we don't see as part of our portfolio going forward and introducing new relevant brands that will resonate with our core customers, as well as drive a new younger customer. And that includes brands like Nine West of course, Elizabeth and James, the Jason Wu collaboration and there'll be more to come in the future. That did require us to exit Dana Buchman. We have plans to exit more as we look forward, and we took this opportunity to actually reflow the women's pad in our store so that the brand adjacencies would make sense.","We know from history, anytime you're moving things around in the store, that's going to create some short-term disruption. But we're confident in the rebound. And importantly, the women's business digitally outperformed the digital average and the new brands are doing great. So I have great confidence we're making the right moves for the long-term.","Oliver Chen","Just a follow up on women's, it's been a tough category across the sector and for you in this way. What is your thought on what's happening with that shopper and timing of reception of the new brands and store layout just to assess the nature of risk within the women's apparel category?","Michelle Gass","Oliver, you're absolutely right. I mean, there's a lot of choices out there for women. I think for Kohl's, we stand for value, we stand for style relevancy, and we really stand for that casual apparel sector. And that's where we're leaning in to really have that right balance of your casual basics as well as your fashion relevancy. As I highlighted in my comments, the Active business which speaks to how she's living today, the Active at leisure, we had a very strong quarter in women's apparel in Active, also Intimates, she's coming to us for the basic.","Where we're course correcting is to make sure that we can drive a better balance as it relates to kind of basics and casual apparel, the T shirts, the Denim, et cetera, with fashion relevancy, and that's where we're leaning into brands like Nine West and Elizabeth and James. But I think ultimately, where Kohl\u2019s wins is in this terrific balance of both that kind of casual, active, and fashion.","Oliver Chen","Thank you, best regards. ","Michelle Gass","Thank you, Oliver.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. ","Bob Drbul ","Good morning. Jill, welcome on your new role. I guess just a couple of quick questions for me. The Amazon Return program, are you seeing -- is there a number or anything you could share with us in terms of the new customers that are coming into the store that are making purchases at Kohl's or signing them up as new Kohl's car holders or customers from that perspective? And then just curious on the variation between August and October, and I guess could you also just give us any update in terms of how November has trended for you so far? Thanks.","Michelle Gass","Thanks, Bob. So as it relates to Amazon returns, we are really pleased. I mean, this quarter, fully scaled it. We are seeing performance very consistent with our pilot. And I think we're especially pleased with the level of new customers which you were asking about, so we are seeing a disproportionate amount of new customers relative to the amount of new customers we generally acquire. And we're seeing a younger customer, which is also very exciting and right in line with our strategic priority.","Today, our conversion rate, so for people coming in who are shopping is also very consistent with what we saw in the pilot, which when you net that all out for the year will be accretive to our profitability. But we're not stopping there and we have a lot of focus, we see the tremendous opportunity to drive even further conversion. And so we're doing things like enhancing training for our associates, we're testing different offers, we're doing that as we speak today and we're adding incremental merchandising opportunities right in the area where the Amazon returns are accepted.","So my hope is that we can drive that conversion even further, but it is today, meeting expectations. I do think really importantly too is that the way we're doing it is hitting the bar of both Kohl's, and Amazon in terms of the customer experience. And we are very pleased with that. I mean, we've done statistical surveys, and the customer is very satisfied with the program. They see it as simple and easy, which is intentional, and importantly, they intend to use it again. So very happy with that. And I'll let Jill actually talk about the quarterly sales flow. ","Jill Timm","Hey, Bob. So August, as we indicated started out really well. We had a very strong back-to-school season, but we did see a softening in September, some of that driven by the unseasonable weather. What we did then is we reacted as Michelle indicated, and we leaned into our value equation and we drove momentum into October.","So we actually ended October incredibly strong, and we're building that momentum as we move into the holiday season. I think another data point for the strong holiday that we're expecting is the fact that our ad leak was very successful and that showcased a lot of our products and our merchandising strategies that we're going to continue to lean into as we move into the holiday.","So I think the way the quarter came out was just a little bit of softening, but we reacted well, we found out what worked with the customer and we feel confident with our merchandising strategy as we move into the all-important holiday season.","Bob Drbul ","Got you. And just a question on the footwear piece of it, I think you didn't call out Nike as one of the brands, can you just maybe just give an update on what you saw from Nike or what you're seeing from Nike and why it wasn't called out at this point? Thanks.","Michelle Gass","Yes. Sure, Bob. So as I mentioned overall for each of those brands they were all positive and the brands had particularly strength in apparel including Nike. On the footwear side and I believe we talked about this on the prior call, we did see softness on Nike footwear. They are all over it and this past quarter we saw improvement in Nike footwear from the first-half. We're not all the way to positive yet but I'm confident we'll get there it's a very big priority for them and we have new platforms coming in. ","Bob Drbul ","Thank you very much. ","Michelle Gass","Great, thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thanks, good morning. Looking at all the investments needed to drive this positive comp in 3Q and 4Q, could you help provide a roadmap to margin stabilization over the coming quarters?","Jill Timm","Yes, so Lorraine, I think a couple of things, if we stand back and look at the history of Kohl\u2019s, we've had a strong discipline around inventory management and that's really been a key enabler for us to expand margin in the past. Clearly Q2 we were impacted by the soft spring season and our inventory was up 2%. So in Q3 we did make progress our inventory was only up 1% and we really did this despite the fact that we supported all the new brand launches within the quarter. And you've seen that we have our commitment to get back to flat by the end of the year.","So we do believe that inventory management will be a key enabler, but of course we're going to continue to take that over a paced approach because we always want to ensure we're protecting sales.","I think second, we've done a lot of testing around personalization and we're going to lean more into targeted offers as we think that'll be more productive from a customer perspective. And then third we're going to continue to drive proprietary brands, you see that with the new brand introductions specifically in women's and that will obviously benefit our merchandise mix as well. So I think those are three key enablers that are going to help us get back to a healthy margin.","Michelle Gass","And I would just -- I would add to Jill\u2019s comment and reiterate, this is a really unique time for the company. We have a record level of exciting initiatives, we've got this new Amazon returns program, we just got off the ground, we are seeing more new customers. And so we have to make sure we're putting our most assertive foot forward to capture these new customers and get them on our loyalty ladder. So it is an investment to drive new customer acquisition and traffic to ensure we are positioned for profitable sales growth over the longer-term.","Lorraine Hutchinson","And just any timeframe on when you think that you'll be able to drive that profitable sales growth?","Jill Timm","Yes, obviously, we don't give long-term guidance at this point. I think when we come back out in 2020 we will be able to give you some more details. But I think first it starts with growth for us, so we want to continue to lean into our number one priority of driving traffic. Obviously, we're continuing to work through inventory management, so we're going to see those types of things starting to take hold as we move in to the next year. ","And then we continue to leverage our second priority of operational excellence to find efficiencies within all these processes and take out the costs whether it'd be in margin or SG&A that will help us deliver the long-term growth. So I think you'll get more clarity on that as we move forward, but know that we're going to start with growth and we're committed to our operational excellence initiatives to help do that profitably over the long-term.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Michelle Gass","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. ","Dana Telsey","Good morning, everyone. As you think about the level of promotions required to drive the sales and you mentioned home being a key category of promotion, how are you thinking about the investments that you mentioned for holiday, is it solely promotion, is it advertising, how do you how do you triangulate what the key strategic investments are and where they fall in terms of the penetration rate? And as you think about 2020, Michelle, given all the newness that you have in holiday, any updates on what we should be looking forward to for 2020? Thank you.","Michelle Gass","Thanks, Dana. So to your question around investments for the Q4 time period, I mean, that's exactly what it is. And we're really investing across all parts of our business. I mean, clearly, starting with ensuring that we're showing up with compelling value. And that takes the form of pricing, it takes the form of promotion, and of our loyalty program. And we have a pretty sophisticated model where we look at what levers are to be applied when.","You mentioned home and I think that's a good category to look at. It had a really tough start in the first half of the year and we're really pleased this quarter that we got it back to positive growth and roughly consistent with the company. And home in particular is where we disproportionately lean into pricing, where we've seen a lot of that competitive activity, we also brought forward some new promotions, et cetera.","As I was saying earlier, it's just absolutely critical that we maximize this opportunity right here right now to capture the new customers, especially coming in for the new brands, we're launching all the innovation and then new traffic and new customers who are being introduced to Kohl\u2019s for the first time through the Amazon returns program.","So, our investment will certainly -- we have, like I said, we have sophisticated models, pricing elasticity models that we use against the competitive environment to make sure that we are appropriately pricing ourselves and offering the right promotions. I would say that, the team has really built up its muscle to be responsive and operate with agility so that when conditions are not in our favor, like whether we can pull back and when they are in our favor we can lean in.","And that's to the other part of your question that, while certainly pricing is -- investing in pricing is a part of it, it's also investing in media. And I mentioned in my remarks, we're seeing very good results of bringing in our digital search capability in house also elevating our partnership with Google with some new tools so that our search activity can be that much more impactful.","So when we lean in, we get the right message, the right value, we will also elevate our efforts from a marketing standpoint. And I just can't reiterate enough I mean, holiday not only with all the initiatives we have, but holiday is such a key time period for the industry and for Kohl's around exposing all we do around our innovation and our product offering and not just the newness, but also the strength of our core offering we talked about Active earlier it was up 7% we expect that momentum to continue. So our organization priority one continues to be driving sales, driving traffic to fuel long-term customer acquisition, which ultimately leads to long-term sustainable and profitable growth.","As it relates to 2020 well, as Jill was just saying, we haven't put guidance out there, per se. I mean, you can expect to see the same kind of top line energy and focus, driving excitement within our core business, bringing in new brand. That's a key strategic priority for the company. ","The team is hard at work, we have new things that we\u2019ll be sharing and rolling out next year, while we also drive our operational excellence discipline. And that includes the focus on inventory management, overtime, we expect to get back to margin expansion and certainly the focus on our SG&A and our expense structure. So, I feel very good, like I said, I think we're at a point in time to make these investments. But I feel very confident in the strategies we have ahead.","Dana Telsey","Thank you. ","Michelle Gass","Thanks, Dana.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Walvis from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Alexander Walvis ","Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. I have -- my first question is around the smaller stores I believe you opened for this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about, how those are performing and how the strategy is evolving that I think you said that there would be more of those to come, so any color on that would be would be interesting as well?","Michelle Gass","Yes, so I'll take this one. So we did open four stores and we're somewhere in the 15-ish range right now on these stores. So just for clarity sake, they're about 35,000 square feet, compared to our average at about 90,000 square feet. So it is a much smaller footprint. We have been in the spirit of Kohl\u2019s and what we do testing and iterating along the way. ","I will tell you, I feel very good about these last four that we've opened because we've learned from the first versions of those and how to take kind of the best of Kohl\u2019s to merchandise things differently to modify the adjacencies based on what you need in a smaller format.","So I'm really, really encouraged and to the comment of I think we have more opportunity. I mean, there's still -- people are still building stores even in this environment. For us, especially given our omni-channel reach, the intent would be to find places where we can build these small footprint. And what we do know is when we do have a presence in the neighborhood that that also helps drive our digital businesses as well.","So, while, we certainly haven't put any specific numbers out there, and I would consider we're still in the piloting stage. We're getting smarter about these stores and you can expect to hear more from us next year on what our plans are.","Alexander Walvis ","Great, thank you. And then my second question is on the promotions expected to remain elevated through the holiday season, any color at this stage on, what we should expect into next year for promotional activity and gross margins. Is there -- do you have a timeline in mind on how long the elevated promotional environment is likely to last?","Jill Timm","So, Alex, I don't think we have any guidance into next year other than, we're going to deploy the initiatives that I had mentioned around inventory management, targeted offers and driving proprietary brands that will continue to help lift our margin moving forward. I think Q4 is always a unique time of year. So as we saw the heightened promotional environment moving out of Q3, we fully expect it's going to maintain within the holiday period, because it always brings a new level of promotions.","So we wanted to ensure that our guidance gave us the room to react appropriately, so we can continue to be relevant to the customer drive sales, as Michelle said, acquiring new customers. Over the last two years, we've mentioned to you that we've acquired customers in the low double digits during this timeframe. And this year, we have the unique Amazon returns partnership that we're able to capitalize on, to actually accelerate that customer acquisition.","So we look at this as not only just an investment in terms of the sales growth, but really from a long-term perspective bringing in those new customers. And as Michelle said, evolving them to the loyalty ladder, so they can continue to unlock value with Kohl\u2019s.","Alexander Walvis ","Fantastic. Thanks for the color guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gabriella Carbone","Hi, good morning. This is Gaby Cabone on for Paul, thanks for taking our question. So tariffs haven't been mentioned yet, was wondering if you could discuss how that impacted results this quarter and kind of what you're expecting for the rest of the year? And then if you can just give an update on how your conversations with vendors are progressing? Thanks. ","Jill Timm","Thanks, Gabby. So from a tariff perspective, we have our arms around that and what I want to say is we have an amazing merchant team that's worked closely with our vendors, so that we were actually able to offset tariffs and not really have an impact to our business this quarter, while still delivering great value to our customers. I think, we continue to employ our diversification strategy, which we've been doing for quite some time, and will continue to do that to further reduce our exposure to China.","However, we do recognize this is a fluid situation. So everything right now is embedded in our outlook. But if the tariff numbers would change, we would have to go and come back and reassess that.","Michelle Gass","I would add on just a comment to Jill's point, if you take a step back for us from a sourcing strategy standpoint, we have been on this kind of journey and mission for some time and moving business to other parts of the world to have a great diverse supply base. And that's been in full support of our speed to market opportunity. When we talk about some of the other opportunities, we have in inventory management, et cetera one of the biggest initiatives supporting us is speed to market and we've reduced roughly 40% of our timeline end-to-end and that's been in due part by diversifying, our supply base and producing in areas and with vendors who can get us product quickly.","So I would just echo what Jill said on the tariff piece, in particular and with China, we're in great shape, we have very deep, long enduring relationships with these vendors. And for me, it's managing that, but also ensuring that we've got a great diverse supply base that can support us on our speed agenda.","Gabriella Carbone","Thanks. And then just a quick follow up, I understand you're making all these new, strategical investing, could you kind of prioritize them for the rest of the year?","Michelle Gass","Can you elaborate a little bit more on that in terms of\u2026","Gabriella Carbone","Just kind of how should we be thinking about in the way you're prioritizing these investments you're making? Where do you feel is the most important? ","Michelle Gass","Yes, I mean, the way I would think about it, especially if we're talking for the fourth quarter, is ensuring that we have a very strong holiday season and I think that comes with a number of factors. I would reiterate that we are entering the period with momentum, we have a strong holiday kickoff, we have lots of great activities planned over the next couple of months. Then I would speak to our strategic initiatives that we are investing behind.","We're investing behind both our core business. I mentioned the Active investment as an example, we just expand and we just completed that expansion to 160 doors. We added roughly 100 shop-in-shops of Adidas, so overall Active is in great shape. And we see Q4 as no different in terms of driving the Active business. So that has been an investment as well as the investment on our lineup of all the newness and new brands. So that's point one.","Two, I mean, clearly we've been leaning into the Amazon returns program. We just had our really first ramped up quarter. This will be our first holiday with Amazon returns, so we're leaning in and investing there. Our digital business has been a strong performer. We will continue to support and invest that business to make sure we can maintain that double-digit growth.","And then marketing, which we've spoken about given the competitive environment, we have to make sure that we are relevant and that we are leaning in during this really critical period where it's naturally for Kohl's been a place where we've acquired a disproportionate amount of new customers and now will only be exaggerated this quarter given all the new brands that we're marketing behind and of course the returns program.","So I'm really excited, I feel like we have positioned ourselves, we have positioned the quarter and guided appropriately, so we will make these investments so that we exit the quarter with a strong holiday and importantly a whole bunch of new customers that we can now build loyalty for long-term profitable growth.","Gabriella Carbone","Great, thank you so much for all the color. ","Michelle Gass","Great. Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. ","Chuck Grom","Hey, thanks. Good morning. A few questions for me, first, curious how the cadence of actual Amazon returns into your store progressed throughout the quarter, and is it possible to quantify the list? ","Second is in the pilot locations for the returns, curious, if you test some of these value investments to get new customers on the loyalty ladder I guess that gives you the confidence that these price investments will actually pay off? And then third with all that you're doing I\u2019m a little bit surprised that you guided to the two year decelerating here in the fourth quarter. I'm just curious, if you could speak to maybe quantify how November started off and I guess what -- why the expected slowdown on the stack? Thanks.","Michelle Gass","Okay. So I'll take the first couple of here Chuck. First of all on the cadence on Amazon returns, we were still ramping. I mean we have close to 1,200 stores. We rolled it out across the system. So I think it's fair to say that during the quarter, we continued to see things ramp consistent with our expectations. And the fourth quarter we'll continue to be the same. So we're not breaking out the particular cadence, but what I can tell you is that there has been an ongoing ramp as customers get used to this new service.","And as I quoted in the research that we've collectively done I'm particularly encouraged with the strong customer reaction that they intend to use the service again. The conversion rate is consistent with what we saw in the pilot. And that is adequate to meet our financial objectives, but we are testing and experimenting with some new offers as you just asked about. On that front, we're in the testing phase. So we have nothing yet that we're rolling out, but know that we have multiple tests going on and we have the technology capability in order to test and try.","So I fully expect that we\u2019ll be implementing some new value offers by early next year, if not before. We are to your point on getting on the loyalty ladder. It's early days. So it's really difficult. I mean, we're only a few months in to track the kind of ongoing stickiness of who's converting to Kohl's charge, et cetera. But we will be monitoring that. And we have over efforts to be messaging the value that you get with Kohl's charge at that point of interaction with the Amazon return customer.","And then, I'll let Jill address the guidance piece. ","Jill Timm","Yes. So I think, we feel really good with the momentum that we pulled out of Q3. We feel good with the ad leak as that positions us well for the holiday. However, as we said it's a very competitive environment. So as we gave our Q4 guidance we wanted to be thoughtful. We put up a 0.4 comp, so this really bookends that's comp for the quarter, but could just an acceleration. So I don't love the two year stack. ","I could challenge you to stand 3-year stack were up of the two-year stack I could challenge you to say on a three year stack we\u2019re up nine. So that's another way to look at it, but I think we feel really good about how we approach the holiday period of the strategies that we've employed and the momentum that we've gained as we move out of October, but really just want to be thoughtful, Chuck, as we gave guidance. ","Chuck Grom","Okay. And then just bigger picture, I think, Lorraine, asked about this earlier about your margin structure, clearly it looks like you\u2019ll end the year close to say 6%, 6.5% that's way lower than where you've been. Should we think about this as sort of the new normal for you guys as you kind of focus on value and try to gain customers down the road.","Michelle Gass","So, Chuck, so let me just reiterate, I do believe we are at a very unique point in time given all the initiatives what we've been talking about over the last hour, unique time to get new customers and invest in them because of our initiatives, Amazon returns, et cetera. But we are very committed to growing both the top-line and the bottom-line overtime. And while we haven't put out 2020 guidance you can expect to hear from us next year. We have lots of efforts underway, things we've talked about, some things we haven't yet talked about to fortify and continue to accelerate our top line sales.","Like I said earlier, we're pleased from where we started the year to where we are today, we saw a material improvement in the top line. And then as it relates to our profitability we have a number of initiatives building on the success we've had with operational excellence and inventory discipline. So you absolutely should expect from us that overtime we look to drive sales and expand margins.","Chuck Grom","Okay, great. Jill, congrats. ","Jill Timm","Thank you. ","Operator","And we have time for one last question that question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Baird. Please go ahead. ","Mark Altschwager","Great, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I'm curious on the traffic and spending trends you are seeing from some of your more loyal customers. It sounds like you're pleased with what you're seeing from a customer acquisition standpoint. So just trying to reconcile that with a flat to 1% comp trajectory, maybe bigger picture as you transition the brand portfolio to really focus on that younger that new customer, how do we assess the risk of cannibalization of your existing sales base versus driving incremental top line growth? Thanks.","Michelle Gass","Thanks, Mark. Great question. I think it's absolutely critical for us to protect, preserve and grow the core customer base, while we complement with this newer and arguably younger customer for the future. We have to do both. We have many strategies that are aimed at both, our product strategies, whether we're talking on the apparel side, we've been talking about on the women's side like a Nine West. ","We're seeing that brand resonate especially with existing customers Elizabeth and James might skew a little younger, but again we see the existing customer pick up on that and certainly all the home innovation speaks squarely to that core customer in addition to the new.","From a marketing standpoint and especially a loyalty standpoint protecting our core is vital. And in fact, we did see as we think about our newer customers versus our Kohl's Charge customer we did see sequential improvement in the third quarter versus the first half of the year. So it demonstrates even in the third quarter that we are seeing this enhancement improvement, but know that we're taking a very thoughtful balanced approach to make sure that we preserve the core, while we reach for these more new customers.","Mark Altschwager","Thank you.

So if you are listening after May 10, it is possible that the information discussed is no longer current. Thank you.","I will now turn the conference over to Wes McDonald, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thank you. With me today is Kevin Mansell, Chairman, CEO and President. I'll start off by talking about our financial performance, and then Kevin will walk through some of our merchandising, marketing initiatives and close with some comments, and then I'll give guidance components for the second quarter.","Total sales for the quarter increased 1.9% to $4.2 billion. Comp store sales increased 0.2%. Average unit retail increased 4.9% while units per transaction decreased 3.3%. This resulted in an average transaction value increase of 1.6%. Transactions per store were down 1.4%. Kevin will provide more color on our sales by region and line of business in a few minutes.","Our credit share was 56% for the quarter, an increase of approximately 270 basis points over the first quarter of 2011. Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 35.9%, 220 basis points lower than the first quarter of last year and below our expectations of a decrease of 160 basis points.","Our SG&A expenses decreased 0.2% for the quarter, well below our expectations of a 3.5% increase. SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged approximately 50 basis points for the quarter. Credit provided the most significant leverage, but we also saw positive results in our store payroll and other store expenses.","Moving on to depreciation. Our depreciation expense was $201 million in the first quarter this year versus $191 million in the first quarter of last year. The increase is due to new stores and additional e-commerce fulfillment centers. As a percentage of sales, depreciation was 4.7%, approximately 10 basis points higher than last year.","Net interest expense was $82 million this quarter, up $6 million compared to the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due to the $650 million of long-term debt issued in October 2011.","Our income tax rate was 35.5% for the quarter compared to 36.3% in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a favorable settlement of state tax audits.","Moving down to net income. Net income was $154 million for the current year quarter and $201 million for the first quarter of 2011. Diluted earnings per share were $0.63 this year, down $0.06 from last year.","On to the balance sheet and some metrics for your models. We ended the quarter with 1,134 stores. During the quarter, we opened 9 new stores, including 1 relocated store and closed 1 location. Gross square footage at quarter end was 99 million square feet, 3 million higher than April of 2011. Selling square footage increased 2 million to 83 million.","We ended the quarter with $1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $640 million from April of 2011. The reduction in cash is primarily due to share repurchases. We have repurchased approximately $2 billion of stock since the first quarter of 2011. Cash equivalents are in money market fund, CDs and commercial paper.","Moving on to inventory. We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion worth of inventory, a 7% increase over April 2011. Inventory per store is up 3.7%. Kevin will talk more about inventory management in a few minutes.","Moving on to CapEx. CapEx expenditures were $177 million for the first 3 months of 2012, $44 million lower than the first quarter of 2011. The change reflects lower spending on both remodels and new stores and e-commerce fulfillment centers, partially offset by higher technology spending.","We opened 9 new stores in both March of last year and March of this year. As a reminder, we are planning to open approximately 10 new stores this fall compared to 31 last fall. We've also reduced our remodel plans from 100 last year to 50 remodels this year, and we remodeled 40 stores in the first quarter. We'll remodel 10 additional stores in the fall.","During 2011, we also had a lot of spending related to our second and third e-commerce centers. Spending on our fourth e-commerce center is ramping up right now. AP as a percent of inventory was 47% versus about 44% last year. The increase is primarily due to normalized day turns with our import vendors, as well as an increase in March and April receipts.","From a capital structure perspective, we repurchased 6 million shares of our common stock during the quarter and have repurchased almost 71 million shares since reactivating the buyback program in the fourth quarter of 2010. All of these purchases were made under 10b5-1 plans.","Weighted average diluted shares were 245 million for the quarter. For your modeling purposes, I would use 241 million diluted shares for the second quarter and 239 million shares for the year. This assumes $250 million in share repurchases in the second quarter at an average price of $50 a share.","Earlier this week, our board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. The dividend is payable June 27 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 6.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who'll provide additional insights in our results.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks, Wes. As Wes mentioned, comparable store sales increased 0.2% in the quarter. From a line of business perspective, Men's, Children's and Accessories outperformed the company average.","Men's had strength in casual sportswear, basics, dress shirts and young men's. Children's was led by boys and by girls. Notable performers in Accessories included fashion accessories and handbag, sterling silver and watches.","The Women's area was essentially flat.  Active and updated sportswear were the strongest categories with low double-digit increases. Footwear was slightly negative despite a low double-digit increase in Women's shoes. Home reported a low single-digit decrease. Strong performers in Home included tabletop, bath and towels, and electrics.","From a regional perspective, the cold regions, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and the Northeast, significantly outperformed the warmer South Central, Southeast and West regions. The Midwest and the Northeast regions reported low single-digit increases. The Southeast and South Central regions reported low single-digit comp sales declines and the West reported a mid-single-digit decline.","E-commerce sales increased 34% from first quarter of 2011 to approximately $250 million in sales.","On a product front, we launched several new exciting brands in the quarter. Rock and Republic launched in Women's, Men's and Footwear in February. Sales of this premium denim and sportswear brand have significantly exceeded our internal expectations.","We also expanded the ELLE and Simply Vera Vera Wang brands into our beauty offering. We're excited about these opportunities that these new expansions bring to our beauty business and the opportunity to grow this underserved business.","We are also conducting a sales productivity test in approximately 50 stores in 3 markets, Houston, Atlanta and Salt Lake City. We've expanded our Home selection in these markets. We expect to add 2 additional markets with 20 more stores for Back-to-School. Our plans are to read these tests through the balance of the year. We intend to make changes to our remodels and new stores based on the results of this test and initial plans we have for other areas of the store. Those changes will not take place until 2013.","Private and exclusive brand penetration increased 300 basis points over the first quarter of 2011. Approximately 53% of our sales are now in private and exclusive brands. Several of our largest private brands, Croft & Barrow, SO and SONOMA reported strong sales; and Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and Rock and Republic generated higher penetration as did more mature brands such as FILA, Food Network, Lauren Conrad, Mudd and Simply Vera Vera Wang.","On the gross margin side, we're obviously very disappointed in our gross margin performance. The difference between our expectations and our results was primarily in the depth of our promotional markdowns as we did provide great value to our customers especially around opening price point private brands. Clearance levels were very similar to our expectations. We do understand better how the customer will react to the lower prices and have reflected that in our gross margin guidance for the second quarter, which we expect to be similar to the first quarter. We would expect gross margin to improve in the fall season but still be down from last year. We are seeing cost decreases in the apparel areas for fall season in the mid-single-digit range, which will help on the gross margin side.","On the other hand, in expense management, I'm very pleased with our expense management, again, as we leveraged approximately 50 basis points for the quarter. Our credit business, again, generated significant leverage for the quarter, but we expect this improvement to moderate in the later quarters of the year and in April we annualized our new relationship with Capital One.","Substantially all of our operating stores also reported lower costs as a percentage of sale. The strongest improvement was in our store payroll organization as our technology investments continue to drive sustainable efficiencies. Other store controllable costs and fixed expenses were also well managed. Advertising costs did not leverage due to incremental spend to support the new brand launches during the quarter, and we also invested incremental spend on our spring television marketing campaign.","In our 2012 guidance we discussed in February, we shared our belief that gaining momentum on the top line would be a very gradual process, and it certainly has been in the first quarter. We've been focused on our value, product and promotion along with providing great customer experience both in-store and online. We do believe that value message is resonating with our customer, and we're priced in line with our major competitors and executing our promotional strategy while providing extra value with discounts for our credit card customers and through Kohl's Cash and buy more save more events for all.","We believe our product is now more on trend, and we are focused on narrowing our assortment to ensure we have enough depth in items we believe in. We are happy with the feedback on our spring marketing campaign and expect to continue with that theme through the Back-to-School season.","Our progress on sales has been hindered by not having enough inventory units in the stores. We entered the quarter down about 6% in units in the stores and about 9% in the seasonal categories with receipts arriving in late April. During much of the quarter, some of our seasonal categories were down as much as 20%. We plan to be close to flat by the end of the second quarter, which is where we want to be positioned for the fall season.","I expect our inventory levels to continue to hinder our sales in this second quarter, and the second quarter sales expectations as a result are similar to our first quarter performance. We will continue to look for ways to be more efficient across the company. Our expense performance in the first quarter was a result of sustainable improvement in the stores and distribution centers, as well as continued strong credit revenue performance. We have a continued rollout of our electronic signing initiative in the next 2 quarters, which should also help our expense performance as well.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Wes to provide details on our second quarter earnings guidance.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thanks, Kevin. Our second quarter earnings guidance is as follows: Total sales increase of 2% to 3%, a comparable sales increase of flat to 1%. We would expect May to be below the quarter, June to be approximately with the quarter and July to be well above the quarter. Gross margin rate decline of 200 to 250 basis points. SG&A expense should be flat to 1.5%. Depreciation expense of $206 million, interest expense of $80 million, a tax rate of 38%, a share count of 241 million diluted shares and share repurchases of $250 million for the quarter at an average price of approximately $50 a share. Including these estimated share repurchases, we expect earnings per diluted share of $0.96 to $1.02 for the second quarter. Our fiscal 2012 guidance remains the same at $4.75 per diluted share.","And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So a few questions, as we look out and in terms of being more efficient with spending, can you talk about if there's any changes in your marketing program?","Wesley S. McDonald","Marketing?","Kevin Mansell","Yes. I think she's asking about marketing.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, our advertising expenses did not leverage in the first quarter. I would not expect them to leverage in the second quarter as well. With more units, we obviously expect to do better on the comp line in the back half of the year, and hopefully at that point, we'll start to leverage. If you recall last year, we had a big launch of Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony in the third quarter. That was a -- sort of a unique spend. So we won't spend that kind of money in the third quarter this year. So we should do better in the back half.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and then also on the expense side, you talked about doing a great job in terms of store payroll and other store expenses. With store payroll, is that mainly E sign or is there anything else driving that, and then also can you talk about the other stores expenses that were levered?","Wesley S. McDonald","I think it was a lot to do with E sign, and we obviously continue to try to be more efficient in the stores and manage payroll as best we can to sales. Other store expenses, we've invested a lot of capital to manage electricity usage and that was down about 4% or 5% for the quarter so that provided some savings. We also saved money in terms of CAM. Obviously, it was a very light snow season that I would expect most retailers to have saved money in as well. But the majority of it was really with store payroll.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, Kevin, with just some of the changes taking place on the competitive landscape, can you talk about any opportunities you have in terms of gaining share and maybe how that plays out in the back half of this year as you have more inventory?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, I think our big opportunity remains internal, Deb, to be honest with you. There obviously are a lot of changes happening in our industry. But our inability to generate the kind of store-for-store sales success we've had in the past, there's really been a function of us not having the kind of value we need to for our customer and not having the inventory levels in the right categories for the customer. So it's a lot about price, it's a lot about promotion, and it's certainly a lot about products. So I think the reason that we feel so optimistic about the fall and holiday is that we well understand the changes we need to make to our merchandise assortment in terms of communicating our value. And what's happening in the competitive landscape is sort of in the background on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Kevin, I know you're disappointed with the gross margin performance in the first quarter. It sounds like we should expect the same in Q2, but maybe can I shed some light in terms of what learnings you had in terms of what went well, what didn't and what tweaks we should expect to the plan in the second quarter?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, the things that were positive we knew -- we felt we knew that as we brought down our price points, particularly around opening price points our private brands and we illustrated those in our marketing, that we would, in fact, get accelerated unit demand. And that definitely happened. So throughout the quarter, there was a dramatic change in the trajectory that we had, sell-throughs and actual units around those key items. And that was very visible to us in the selling rates across those items. Unfortunately, we just didn't have the kind of depth of inventory to support it, and it didn't, as a result, I think, translate to the top line to the extent that it will as we start to build those inventories more effectively. From a portfolio perspective, we also did well with our new brands. So it's not all about our focus around opening price point, we can provide great value around what we would consider kind of our best brand, sothings like Rock and Republic and Jennifer Lopez or Marc Anthony, which resonated well, in addition. But there's no question that changing the value that we offer to customers is making a difference in how they respond to the product. And that we think, combined with deepening the level and continuing to work on the on-trend nature of what we offer, is going to be a tailwind for us as we get later in the second quarter and then certainly into the third quarter.","Wesley S. McDonald","Adrianne, this is Wes. I also think the majority of our gross margin pressure was in the private brand because that's where we took the biggest price reduction. It's also where we have the biggest cost increases when we start to get cost reductions in the back half. Private brands should perform better. We still expect our gross margins to be down in the back half, but nowhere near to the extent they are in the spring. National brands for the quarter kind of were at the same level as what our total company was from a gross margin perspective and exclusive brands by their very nature since they're a little bit less price sensitive and more in our better and best price points, gross margin was down still but significantly less than the company.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just a follow-on to that it sounds like the inventory investments you think is key to help sales growth. Since you ended the quarter with inventory up 7%, how should we be thinking about that inventory to sales? Obviously, it looks like it's going to be outpacing your comp plan in the near term. How do you -- give us the confidence in terms of as you build inventory, how do you mitigate any sort of markdown liability that might come along with sort of a heavier inventory debt?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I guess from my perspective, you're also starting to see cost reduction, so units might be up, but costs might be down. So your dollar increase in terms of inventory won't be as great. We look at it more on an inventory per store basis versus a overall inventory. So our inventory was up 3.7%. I would expect at the end of the second quarter for it to be somewhere in the mid to high single digits on a per store basis. That will give us enough units we think to do much better. You got to remember last year, we were down significantly in inventory. So if you go back to 2010, we're probably sort of flattish. And it's not going to be across the board. There are certain areas we're going to be investing in like kids definitely reacted very well to price reductions we took in the first quarter. We're going to be very aggressive for Back-to-School on that from a unit perspective. Obviously, that's a big season for the kids business and areas like Missy's updated and contemporary, we need more units. Classic inventories on the Missy side, we won't be as aggressive in. That business is coming back a little bit. It's probably the best quarter we've had in close to 2 years on Missy's classic, but you're not going to see the kind of unit growth in that area that you will on the other 2 I mentioned. So we're trying to be smart about it. It's not going to be across the board, and we're certainly cognizant of the fact that it's a little bit bigger unit increase than we have had in the past, but we're still trying to normalize where we think demand is. Private brands definitely were hurt by the lack of units. We started March in a pretty good shape and then when it got hot, those 2 weeks in the cold-weather regions, we blew through serious amount of units in 2 weeks. And that really dampened our April sales. Most of our seasonal categories for the month of April were down at least 20%.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then, Kevin, when you talk about the value product and experience sort of that's where you're focused on to turn things around. Obviously, we're seeing the change on the...","Kevin Mansell","Lost you, Adrianne.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. Kevin, I guess as you look at the horizon over the next several quarters from a merchandising perspective, where do you see your biggest opportunities? And then from like a new brand opportunity, Rock and Republic seemingly gone very well. How's the opportunities in terms of the availability of new brands or product development from that standpoint?","Kevin Mansell","Sure. I mean, I think as we look at fall and holiday just on a quarterly basis, just getting a little ahead of ourselves, but clearly our biggest opportunity is holiday. And we really underperformed in the fourth quarter last year, and that was, in particular, around categories that were more gift-related across the whole store, of course, but gift-related categories. So that is clearly something we're really focused on being prepared to correct this year. I think second, as Wes kind of mentioned, opening price point was an area that didn't perform. And it was really a function of us not supporting it with the kind of levels of inventory as we navigated through higher costs last year. So our inventories and opening price points being aggressively planned up and from the positive perspective, it's happening as costs are coming down. So we're definitely buying into the right time. There's other things as well, Bob, but I would just say big picture, it's not about the fall and holiday. You say, hey, they're really focused on building their value assortments, which are a lot about opening price point, that 30-plus percent of our business that's our private brands and making it right. And then as they get into the later third quarter and fourth quarter, it really, really focused around a lot of different categories in the store but all around our gift strategy. New brands continue to be important to us, but I think the last year has pointed out pretty clearly that while we need to continue to introduce new brands, and we will, we would expect to have some new announcements for you for the fall season to share with you probably later this quarter and be delivered in the fall. It's almost more important for us to make sure that we have new styles, new colors, new aesthetic in our existing brands and keep those brands fresh because those are all very important to our sales success.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, and Kevin, when I was in the stores this quarter, it seemed like colored denim trend was a good trend for you and -- but it seemed like you guys might not have had a broad enough assortment. Is that something that you're expanding for the fall? Is that where you see an opportunity?","Kevin Mansell","Yes, I mean, definitely we had colored denim, and we're -- there's no way we had anywhere near enough depth on it. I mean, it was a big mess, and it's definitely an area that as we looked at our competitive set, particularly in the specialty store world, they did a much, much better job of having depths of inventory there. That is clearly something we are correcting, and as we move into Back-to-School, I think, that the expectation that colored denim will be really important to the business, and we'll own it in the kind of depth we want.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Swinand with Morningstar.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask about that credit uptick, I think you said in the prepared remarks it was up a little over 2%. What's driving that because some of the other retailers have been flat. Is it greater penetration with existing customers? Are you able to get better approvals with the new rules out there or is it actually driving new customers into the store? And how's that all working? If you gave us some color that'd be great.","Wesley S. McDonald","I think it's definitely not coming from approval rates. We still have -- with the new regulations, it's more difficult to approve people than it has been in the past. We've made some changes or going to make some changes in June and July from our scorecard perspective, that should give us a little more increase in approval rates a couple of hundred basis points. But it's really just, I think, continued recognition from bank card customers that they can get additional value if they're willing to sign up for a Kohl's card. So that's been really what we've done since we went public back in '92. The 9 years I've been here, the credit share has increased pretty consistently. We have markets that are over 60%. So we still think there's room we have markets that are in the 40s. So we still think there's room there. So it's just a question of time in the market. The older markets tend to be closer to 60, the younger markets tend to be in the 40s. So over time, we would expect that credit rate to continue to increase.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on Adrianne's -- I think it was Adrianne who asking about the units. And on a unit basis per store, are you actually down? The dollar inventory is up, I think, you said 7%.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, units were down 6% per store, and seasonal categories on average were down 9%. But that was a late-breaking development with receipts that came late in the quarter. So like I said in the comments, some of our seasonal categories in March and April, depending on the week, were down 20%. So we're going to be in a better place. We're going to improve each month. We expect to end the quarter on a unit per store basis sort of flattish. We obviously also have one of the things that you guys have to take into account when you're looking at our inventory total growth, we're buying inventory now for 4 EFCs versus basically 2 last year. So that's going to require a little additional inventory to support the 40% growth we expect in E-com.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.","Your next question comes from the line of Michelle Clark with Morgan Stanley.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","[Audio Gap] and a key reason for the recent comp weakness, how much of recent comp weakness is attributable both to the fact that Penney is having to significantly step up promotional activity as sales are coming much weaker than they expected there?","Kevin Mansell","I'm sorry. We didn't hear the whole...","Kevin Mansell","Your first part of the question cut off, yes...","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sorry. Okay, so I'm just trying to get at -- you had mentioned that not having enough value price points and then not having enough units are the key drivers behind the comp weakness for you guys as of late. I'm wondering how much is stepped-up promotional activity at JCPenney weighing on your ability to comp.","Kevin Mansell","It would be hard to answer that question, Michelle, without knowing how their sales were. I mean, being honest about it, if their sales in the first quarter were up over last year, then I think we have to say okay we maybe lost some shares to JCPenney. If their sales in the first quarter are less than last year, then I'm thinking it'd be hard pressed for us to convince ourselves that we lost some share to JCPenney. So without knowing how their business is, it's really difficult to answer that question. So I would imagine whenever they do release sales, you will have better insight and say, hey, if Penney sales were better than last year then maybe part of Kohl's weakness is due to that and you'll be able to make a better judgment. It's impossible for us to make that judgment right now.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, but you don't see -- we've noticed significantly stepped-up promotional activity there throughout the quarter, but you don't think that that's a big negative to you guys?","Kevin Mansell","The negative to us is exactly what we've been discussing on the call so far. That's what's driving the lack of sales.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, Wes, you had mentioned that credit was a big benefit to SG&A expense in the first quarter. Just wondering if you can give us incremental color there, how much was the stepped up credit income year-over-year, and how should we be thinking about that as we go through the rest of this year?","Wesley S. McDonald","I mean, it wasn't the entire beat I would say. Credit was the majority. Stores all in was very close to credit. We had things that were below in terms of millions of dollars, it was around $20 million. I would expect that to not be as good in the rest of the year, but it's still going to be a benefit. We don't have the situation that another competitor talked about where they had a big onetime situation last year where they had a big influx of income and credit. Ours will be more consistent throughout the year.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, credit is a tailwind in the first quarter and the way Wes is describing credit for the rest of the year is built into the guidance we give you.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, there's no upside to what I just told you. I mean, it went from 3.5% to flat, and I just guided flat to 1.5%. So if you're looking on the upside, it's already built into the guidance.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. It's included in the guidance, got it. and then you mentioned on the cost comp cadence during the quarter that May would be well below the quarter average and July well above? Can you...","Wesley S. McDonald","I didn't say -- I just said May was going to be below, not well below.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, below. And then July above. What are the drivers of that?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, the biggest thing was actually last year we thought we missed a lot of business in July. We had a very good June. We ran 2 credit events in June and got eliminated in LPS, and we think we pulled some business forward. That's now normalized, and we have an ad calendar July that hopefully will be a much stronger July.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then the reason for May?","Kevin Mansell","It's just really more, I mean, the whole quarter is really just more about the cadence of what we know position and promotional support to that. And so as we're looking at each month and of course, last year plays into this, as Wes said as well, but as we're looking at each month, there's a much higher confidence that we\u2019ll positioned to drive our sales by the time we get to the later part of the quarter. And we also have more of an opportunity on the year-over-year basis as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Nomura.","Tracy Kogan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","It's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. Two questions. The first one for Wes. I was wondering about the performance of the E-com business from a margin perspective. With your EBIT margins down overall, I was wondering if E-com was also down or was it just bricks and mortar? And then secondly, as you anniversary the J. Lo, Marc Anthony launch in the third quarter, I know you said marketing, you did not expect to be up, but just wondering what you have planned to go up against that.","Wesley S. McDonald","From an E-com perspective, it was obviously down -- when you're down 220 basis points in gross margin, it's hard to be up in either area, brick and mortar or E-com. As relative to marketing goals, we're still finalizing our marketing plan. My point is we're not going to spend $20 million launching J. Lo and Marc Anthony in the third quarter. We might spend $15 million of that on something else, but I don't think we're going to spend the entire $20 million.","Tracy Kogan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Any type of launch to go up against that?","Kevin Mansell","We are planning new introduction to the fall season, and I'd expect to be able to share that with you probably middle part of this quarter or so. Newness is important to us. So we're not going to slow down on introducing new brands where they're appropriate and new partnerships. But it's also clear from our sales trajectory in the last 2 quarters, in September of last year, we had the most successful and largest brands launch in the company's history, and we then proceeded to have the worst quarter in the fourth quarter that we've had in many, many years. So you don't want to get so fixated on new brands to drive the business. It's got to be overall breadth of brands that drive the business, and the new brands are just a little bit extra. So there will be a new introduction in the third quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Any update on a new store prototype or any tweaks to the remodel program to look forward to?","Wesley S. McDonald","We kind of talked a little bit about that in the script. We're testing the expansion of Home in those 3 markets we mentioned, Atlanta, Houston and Salt Lake City. So if you guys want to travel down there and check them out, that's part of what we're looking at. We're also looking at other areas of the store where we're not as productive as the overall store. That will be sort of in a test in a couple stores in terms of just trying to figure out how it will look. But you won't see any of that really until 2013. My expectations for 2013 new stores kind of what we've been telling you, 20 new stores until we tell you something different. And then in terms of remodels, depending on the results of the tests, I think we'll probably stick with 50 remodels for next year and get some of the kinks out of what we're trying to do in some of the other areas of the store other than the expansion of Home.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then from an SG&A perspective looking past 2012, how should we think about 2013 from an online infrastructure? Where do you stand today and should we be thinking about a ramp-up in SG&A around that longer term?","Wesley S. McDonald","No. I think we've kind of guided to SG&A leverage point at 2%. We obviously did much better than that this quarter. I'm not signing up to leverage at a flat comp and a multiyear plan. That'd be pretty difficult. So I would use 2% for your modeling. We're undergoing a very methodical sort of profit improvement project through the entire company. We've split it up into 5 waves. We're through 2 of them. We expect to finish it by the end of the year, and hopefully we'll have some savings that we can bank on in 2013 and '14. Not at liberty to tell you the details, but it's not an insignificant amount. How much we choose to reinvest in driving the top line kind of remains to be seen, but I would just use the 2% for now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Klinefelter with Piper Jaffray.","Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Kevin, I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the inventory, Q1 inventory. I mean, in light of -- I think you're suggesting or Wes suggests seasonal inventory down, I think, 20% when you get into April, significantly outperformed in March. Put that in context with the overall business delivered in the first quarter. I mean, clearly there was more demand for seasonal products across the industry. But in hindsight coming in, it came in too low on that inventory. What sort of backup plans do you or did you have for seasonal, how fast can you get back into it, and the same for the colored denim or any other fashion products that are trending well right now.","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, I think the conversation around inventory for us is a very important one because it's definitely a key element of why we've not been able to recover on the top line as quickly as we would like. Seasonals product, which is a very important part of our business, as you know, Jeff, because we're definitely a Buy Now Wear Now kind of retailer with our customer, did not recover to the degree that we would like. It's just taken us longer than we would have expected. And even as we did recover and we were able to pull forward, it occurred at the same time as we were driving lower prices on those products. So we went through from a sell-through perspective a lot more units than we expected. And I would -- I think you're right in asking about trends like colored denim. I think generally, we're dissatisfied with the speed to which we're recovering on that. It's going to happen. We feel really good about what we see coming in May and June to prepare us for July, August Back-to-School, and we'll be in a much, much better place. But it is taking a little longer than we would like, and so it's certainly an area of focus for us how do we move more quickly and how do we identify those opportunities more quickly so we can react to them. High level though, we've made a calculated decision as we went into the fourth quarter last year about where we wanted to position our inventory, and that was also true for the first quarter of this year. And we're living with the results of that.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, we can't afford to airfreight things. So when you make a decision in January to be more aggressive on price, it's going to take you to June to get the number of units you want to be where you want to be. And that's just the reality of the private brand supply chain and how fast we can get things in.","Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I'm just thinking back on I recall, we went through a cycle like this back in kind of the '03, '04 time period. I think there was a skew toward basics product, basic inventory kind of in your assortments, and I believe you started talking then a lot more about exclusive brands and getting a little more fashion content. It just feels like maybe we're going through another one of those cycles. Is the organization -- has there been a change in the organization the way you're set up to react and respond to these fashion trends as they move faster today?","Kevin Mansell","Yes, I mean, the short answer -- and we don't obviously have enough time on conference calls to go into that kind of detail, but there's no question that the experience we had in the fall holiday season caused us to really rethink the entire buying, planning and product development structure we have. It's not dissimilar to 9 years or so ago where we had to rethink certain parts of our company and support it with more infrastructure, both technology and people. It's similar in thinking to that. There have been a tremendous amount of changes as a result of the experience we've had. And so we've made, relatively for us, massive changes in our buying organization and then, of course, planning kind of parallel as you know buying, so those changes spilled over into planning. And our focus around exclusive brands and our focus on the need to move more quickly and be more trend right has also caused us to make a lot of changes in our product development area as well. So there's pretty significant changes. As I said, Jeff, we can't get into the detail on those on the call, but they're new positions, the company has restructured the pyramids in the company. So we're more efficient and more streamlined and more focused around categories that we think are opportunity businesses for us because everything you're touching on was clearly apparent in our results, and it made it clear to us we needed to act quickly.","Wesley S. McDonald","From a CFOs perspective, '03 and '04 was different problem. We had too much ugly woman stuff back then. Now we're chasing units. So it's a good problem for the merchants to have. It's a good problem for the vendors to have. We're trying to buy more products that's on trend. So that's a very inspiring message for the merchants to go out there and get more inventory. They like that.","Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I appreciate the perspective. One last thing. Just what's on the prototype, what is motivating that new prototype? Is it kind of learnings from E-commerce, is it competitive environment, anything else you can add to that?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I think it's all of the above certainly. I mean, certainly number one is a recognition that online, which continues to grow at a very high rate across the industry and as you know for Kohl's at a much, much higher rate, is a potential cannibalization of brick-and-mortar retail that sales could be happening. And so it's caused us to just think about the longer term, it's not a short-term thing. It's longer-term thing of, hey, if these rates of growth continue, what does that mean about what should be inside our stores in terms of what we sell to maintain if not return to higher sales per square foot? And so we've looked inside our store and looked at categories that we believe have opportunity for us, either as it relates to a lower share of market compared to our core business, or categories which have been running at a higher rate of growth over the last 5 years or in some cases, both where we have a low-share market even though we've been running at higher rate growth. And all of those things are kind of playing into rethinking how we allocate space and the way our stores are presented. We're fortunate, as you know, Jeff, in that we've historically allocated a significant dollar amount to capital around remodeling our stores. And so what we really are able to do is simply rededicate that capital in a different way. But I think we feel like we have a marvelous opportunity. We don't have to spend more money. We just have to utilize the money we're already spending in a different way.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, the goal is really to try to get $10 more square-foot, I mean, deal from $220 to $230. Home is not the highest productive square foot we have in the company, but we think it's opportunity from a line of business perspective. Categories that sell online very well, we think could sell on the store very well. We're taking a little bit of space away from Children's. That's our lowest productivity on a sales per square foot basis. Now part of that is because obviously the AURs in kids are a lot lower than some of the other areas. So we have to be careful that we're driving the overall business of the store and hence, the reason we're testing it through the balance of the year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Maybe kind of difficult to answer, but when you look at the first quarter as a whole, how much do you think your comp softness was really kind of self-inflicted because of the price investments and because of the lack of inventory, and I guess how much of that do you expect to kind of lead into May and into the second quarter?","Kevin Mansell","I mean, those are -- it's always a hard question to answer because you don't want to ignore competition. I don't want to pretend like it's not real, but I think our judgment is as we look at our performance over the fourth quarter and first quarter than almost all the results that we've got were purely self-inflicted. They were -- we have nobody to blame but ourselves, and we understand that. We understand the things we have to correct to change that. That's not, as I said, to minimize the intensity of the competition and changes that are happening in our industry or other retailers performing and executing better. That's always the backdrop, but I think the vast majority of our disappointment is our own execution. And we've -- as you know, Chuck, tried very hard to take those head on in not just a small way but across the company organizationally and process-wise to drive change. And I think our feeling is that we're seeing the change coming, it's coming, but not surprisingly as we expected. It just is taking long, a long time. And so yes, certainly our guidance that Wes gave you for the second quarter is certainly predicated on the fact that this change is coming slowly, and it's not going to change quickly and as a result, it would be foolish for us to set expectations that we might have difficulty meeting.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And then where you have reduced prices -- you alluded to this I think early in the Q&A in brief. So where you have reduced some of the prices and you do have the inventory, could you maybe give a couple of examples of the elasticity or the response rates that gives you the confidence that when you get into this, the Back-to-School period, your sales will accelerate?","Kevin Mansell","Yes, I mean, 2 -- without giving you a specific item example, I mean, 2 places that it was very clear, very quickly that by adjusting our value, we changed the trajectory of demand. One was Children's apparel, for sure. It was dramatic. It was phenomenal. It was very strong, and the response from the customer was very, very strong. And then secondly, broadly across the store, in a small way in the first half, but in a much bigger way, we will be in the second half, we've focused around what we call great value items or key items, and there not in one particular area. They could be in Home, they could be in Apparel, they could be in Footwear. And on those items, those great value items as we implemented changes to our pricing structure, we saw the sell-through rates accelerate consistently across all the items. So it wasn't a one-business phenomenon. It was very clear that there was a lot of elasticity as we change the prices. So we've got a pretty good solid basis in making the decisions we're making for the fall.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's good color. And then just one for you, Wes, maybe. You're keeping the full year at $4.75. It sounds like the former gross profit margin guidance of 70 basis points maybe a little bit worse. Can you give us a little bit of complexion of the outlook for the full year, both on the margin front and also on the buyback? Would you still expect to do $1 billion, or could we see a little bit more?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I'm not getting into the fall season because most people don't even give guidance anymore. So I'll stick with my second quarter guidance. We're not done the fall plans yet. We're wrapping them up. Margin is going to be down in the fall. Could it be down more than I originally thought in February? Yes. Is SG&A going to be better than I originally thought in February? Yes. So we get paid to get to the guidance in different ways, so we're just going to try to get to the guidance, and give you guys the details as best we can when we're fully informed. Right now, I'm not fully informed about margin for fall. So from that perspective on the buyback, $250 million is probably on the conservative side depending on where the stock is for the quarter. We could buy back more depending on where we are and where interest rates are. We could issue more debt in the third quarter. Modest, we're not talking huge lever, but maybe $250 million or $300 million and use that to buy back stock. We haven't made a decision on that. We'll talk about it in our next board meeting and probably talk to you about it next quarter as to whether or not we're going to do that or not.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, generally I think, Chuck, that the pressure that our lack of sales in the last couple of quarters has put on our share price, the only positive outcome of that is it's put us in a buying position because we have pretty good feeling about the fall and holiday in the future, and we just think that the current trading price is -- it's a buy. [indiscernible] sets the guidance on the buyback, but we're certainly going to be aggressive about it.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could sneak one more in. I know you did make some changes in the merchant team sort of diverging the responsibilities up amongst, I think, a few more people. Can you shed a little bit of light on how quickly you think that can lead to better trends in some of the categories where you have been underperforming?","Kevin Mansell","I think the answer is going to be by area. We expect that a new executive team driving our online business who's onboard and up and running. It's going to have an effect to accelerate online sales even further for the fall and holiday. We've named a new executive to run our young female businesses, our Junior and Children's businesses. And I feel really good that she's going to have a major impact for Back-to-School. So the answer is going to depend by area, Chuck, based on when the team started and how quickly the timeline is from a process standpoint to make an impact. Certain areas are going to be faster than others.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Liz Dunn with Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I guess a few questions. Starting with the marketing, you mentioned that you didn't leverage marketing, and I understand that's a -- or advertising, and I understand that's a little bit because of the sales shortfall. But what is it that you're pleased with, is it these ads featuring Dana Torres and that kind of thing, or can you just talk a little bit more about the marketing strategy, and what's leading you to think that that's headed in the right direction?","Kevin Mansell","Sure. As you said, if you strictly look at it on a leverage perspective, we didn't leverage in marketing. We spent -- we increased marketing more than sales increased, but I think our judgment is that's primarily the product and the depth of inventory. When you look at it from a more qualitative standpoint and say, okay, what were we looking to do in the first quarter with marketing? We were looking to change the way our print and direct-mail ads look so that our price points were much more prominent and much -- provided much more clarity to customers around our value. I feel like while we\u2019re not there, we've made tremendous amount of progress there, and it's very visible to me and the ads look different and they feel different and the customer is seeing the price points clearly in the ad, and they're going to see it clearly in the store. When it comes to message behind that, our message really is it's exciting to shop at Kohl's. Our sales are absolutely amazing. And if you shop those sales and watch our value, you're going to have a great feeling and a great experience. And I think that broadcast campaign that you're referring to does a good job of saying that in a very overt way. So from a qualitative perspective, I think we've taken some steps that to me are in line with what our objective was. If you're looking at it strictly on a quantitative standpoint, advertising didn't leverage. I didn't expect it to leverage. I don't think Wes expected it to leverage.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. And then why not at this point just -- and perhaps the answer is there's not any opportunity to do so, but why not reaccelerate store growth? Is that something that's off the table for the foreseeable future?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I don't think -- I mean, we're continuing to open stores, which is probably a bit unusual in our industry to be honest. If you're objective about it and look at our competitors, there's really nobody who continues to open up the numbers of store as we are. So we are continuing to open stores, but I think we also are pretty objective about this and we're saying, we have some issues to solve internally. We need to focus most of our attention around improving the metrics of our business. And once we feel better about that, we can produce results not just talk about it, then we'd be in a better place to consider new opportunities to grow.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, and we're not -- I mean, to be totally honest, we're not happy with the performance of our new stores in the last few years. And when we opened them in the recession, they're not hitting our pro forma because the economy is not where it was when we developed the estimates. And in a lot of cases in some of the mild and hot markets where there are housing issues, housing growth stops. So we're not getting the kind of lift that we normally would get as the trade area matures because there's still open lots there. So from that perspective, I think 20 stores a year is what I would use going forward. If we start to do better and our results are better, we certainly could accelerate that.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

Please go ahead.","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you. Good morning. With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President. I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results, and then Kevin will provide more details on our Greatness Agenda initiative and then we'll take some of your questions.","Comp sales decreased 1.8% for the quarter, below our expectations, but significantly improved over first quarter results. Transactions per store were down 4.8% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 300 basis points, comprised of a 310 basis points increase in units per transaction and a 10 basis point decrease in average unit retail. From a line of business perspective, Men's was the strongest category, while Home was the weakest. All other businesses were generally consistent with the company average. On a regional basis, the Southeast, Midwest and West were strongest. The Northeast, South Central and Mid-Atlantic were below the company. Kevin will provide additional details on sales in his prepared remarks.","Gross margin increased 53 basis points for the quarter, a significant improvement over the 140 basis point decrease we saw in the first quarter. The increase was driven by savings in both promotional markdown and permanent clearance markdowns. Our SG&A decreased $19 million to $986 million for the quarter and deleveraged only three basis points on a 2% decline in sales.","Our teams continue to aggressively and effectively manage store payroll as sales trends change versus our plan, but we were unable to leverage those expenses versus last year. IT and corporate expenses also deleveraged. Partially offsetting these increases were slightly higher credit income and lower variable store cost and marketing expenses.","Depreciation expense was essentially flat to last year at $234 million. Our interest expense decreased $6 million to $78 million for the quarter as we saw the benefits of last summer's refinancing. Our income tax rate was 37.5%. The tax rate decreased approximately 40 basis points from last year as a result of Federal tax credits that were enacted in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $140 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.77. During the quarter, we recorded $128 million of expenses related to the store closures and corporate restructuring that we announced in February, bringing the year-to-date total to $192 million.","As you saw in our release, the second quarter charge includes: $119 million in future store lease obligations; $23 million in software licenses, which did not align with the strategic vision of our restructured IT leadership team; and $7 million in severance and other costs, which were partially offset by the write-off of $21 million in net lease obligations that were previously recorded on our books. Of the year-to-date charge, $57 million is non-cash write-offs of assets and liabilities that were previously recorded on our books. All the severance will be paid out within two years. The $119 million lease obligation charge represents the discounted value of rents and other lease liabilities under non-cancelable lease terms.","Our real estate team was able to terminate leases at three of the locations during the quarter. They're actively working with landlords and potential subtenants at the 13 remaining lease locations. Assuming worst-case scenario that we are unable to terminate any additional leases before their maturity, the $119 million will be paid out over the next 13 years. The maximum expected payment in any given year is less than $10 million.","Actual costs reported for the quarter were $18 million higher than the high end of our prior estimate. All of the overage is due to the write-off of the software licenses. We do not expect material charges in future periods. Excluding the store closure and restructuring charges, net income increased 5% to $221 million and diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.22 per share.","We currently operate 1,150 Kohl's stores with gross square footage of 99.1 million square feet and selling square footage of 82.7 million square feet. We also operate 12 FILA outlets, which opened during the current quarter. We ended the quarter with $700 million in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $234 million from last year, due to the timing of last summer's debt refinancing. As you may recall, we had $317 million from the refinancing proceeds on balance sheet in July of last year that we used to pay off bonds tendered in August. Year-to-date, we generated almost $450 million in free cash flow, a $525 million improvement over the first half of last year.","I'm very pleased with our inventory initiatives and our ability to decrease inventory dollars per store by 6% from the second quarter of last year, despite the challenging sales environment. Units per store were 7% lower than the second quarter of last year.","Our accounts payable as a percent of inventory decreased 182 basis points to 35%. All of the decrease is due to lower receipts, especially in late June and in July, which have a larger impact on the A\/P to inventory ratio than receipts from earlier in the quarter.","As you may recall, in the second quarter of last year, we had an extraordinary amount of early arriving receipts due to improvement times in transit times after the West Coast port operations returned to normal.","Capital expenditures were $340 million for the spring season, $37 million lower than last year, which included higher beauty spending as we finished the roll-out of our enhanced beauty environment, now in all stores, and some corporate campus spending as we consolidate space here in Wisconsin.","Weighted average diluted shares were 181 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.7 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 181 million shares of stock outstanding. On Tuesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on September 21 to shareholders of record on September 7.","After reviewing our results for the spring season, we are updating our guidance to $3.12 to $3.32 per diluted share. Excluding the store closure and restructuring charges, the guidance would be $3.80 to $4.00 per diluted share.","The guidance includes the following assumptions for the fall season: total sales decrease of 2.6%, up 0.6% to last year; a comp sales decrease of 2% to flat to last year; gross margin rate improvement of approximately 20 to 40 basis points over last year; and SG&A dollar growth of 0.5% to 2% over last year.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide some additional insights on our results.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Wes. The second quarter was below our expectations on the sales line. May was the weakest month of the quarter. June was aided by warm weather early in the month, along with favorable calendar shifts, with Memorial Day falling in fiscal June and Fourth of July moving to fiscal July.","July finished very strong, as we moved our credit event a week closer to back-to-school, and those businesses, especially Juniors, Young Men's and Girls, performed extremely well. Our seasonal businesses in the quarter followed a similar trajectory as the total company sales.","A little more color on our sales. Men's was better than the company, with strength in active, Young Men's basic and dress clothing, and shorts and swimwear.","Footwear ran with the company, with strength in Kids and Men's dress casual and weakness in Women's. Children's showed relative strength in Girls and Boys, while Infants and Toddlers was more difficult, as we continued to work on revitalizing our Jumping Beans brand.","Women's showed strength in active, intimates and swim, while updated contemporary and classic sportswear continued to remain more difficult.","Accessories continued to be driven by beauty and fine jewelry, with the remainder of the business being challenged. And finally, Home trailed the company, but showed significant improvement from the first quarter, as both bedding and luggage were strengths.","We did a very good job of managing our inventory, gross margin and expenses during the quarter. Our gross margin rate increase of 53 basis points was better than our plan, due to both better initial markup and lower promotional markdowns. Our inventory per store is now down 6%, in line with our expectation. We continue to expect to make progress on this throughout the year, targeting end of third quarter levels of down mid-single digits on a per store basis.","Our receipts will be down in the third quarter and slightly up in the fourth quarter, as we bring in more transitional receipts than we did last year for the holiday season. We're being very conservative in our cold-weather categories, as we expect the third quarter to be soft and the fourth quarter improving versus last year's mild winter.","On the SG&A line, almost every area of the company was able to pull back on their planned expenses to allow us to spend less than last year in dollars and significantly less than our plans. I continue to be impressed by the team's agility to pull back on expenses in a difficult sales environment.","Now I'd like to take a few minutes to update you on some of the initiatives within the Greatness Agenda. In our focus on product, on national brands, our first quarter launches of Stride Rite in children's shoes and the relaunched New Balance in the active area continue to pay dividends. The launch of Stride Rite helped kids' shoes to outperform, and New Balance achieved a 9% comp for the quarter. Our national brands in total were up low single digits, with active and wellness leading the way with a mid-single-digit comp. Nike continues to be very strong, achieving a low double-digit comp in the quarter. The active and wellness category itself is now 18% of our total business. Finally, national brand penetration increased approximately 200 basis points in the quarter.","We're incredibly excited to add Under Armour to our active and wellness category in early 2017. We've already established a strong leadership position in the active and wellness area. And adding one of the most sought-after brands to our portfolio of offerings will allow us to project that leadership even more fully. As you know, this area has consistently been one of our fastest-growing categories in the store. And we would expect that adding Under Armour will extend that period of growth, accelerate the rate of growth and attract a new customer to our store at the same time.","We relaunched SONOMA in the first quarter and have been happy with the results in both Men's and Women's as they've seen improvements versus their trend. One big initiative that we need to take across more of our private and exclusive brands is the need to improve our speed to market. We started to do this with our SO brand in Juniors, and we're achieving double-digit comps this spring on less inventory than last year. Michelle is working with our product development teams to reduce the end-to-end cycle on our private and exclusive brands by 25%, on average, and we have a goal of approximately a 40% reduction in Women's. This takes the success we have seen in SO for this initiative and we're rolling out this to Candie's in Juniors as well as Urban Pipeline in Young Men's. Missies' apparel will be the next area of focus.","Our localization efforts are proving out and 2016 will be the year that all of our planning efforts for unique assortments by store will come to life in 90% of our assortments across all stores. As we exit the second quarter, approximately 70% of the assortment is already localized. We saw a modest lift in the spring season, achieving higher sales and lower inventory per store versus our control groups, but would expect the effect to improve as we gain more experience and enter key transitional periods by quarter two into quarter three, where localized assortments should have a much bigger impact.","In our focus around omni-channel initiatives, we continue to see strong results in digital demand, with online generated demand achieving a mid-teens increase, as we expected. We continue to invest in technology and training in our stores to allow us to ship from store and provide buy online, pick up in store capabilities, providing faster shipping times and more convenience for the time-strapped customer.","In the second quarter, the combination of ship from store and buy online, pick up in store sales reached 21% of total dollar online demand and 23% of total unit online demand, both increasing versus the first quarter. We do believe we have a big opportunity there, both short and long-term, which we think will only continue to amplify the role and relevancy of our brick-and-mortar stores.","And finally, our Kohl's app was downloaded by more than 13.5 million customers, continues to grow in both downloads, but, more importantly, usage, particularly aspects like the digital wallet.","On a store update basis, we opened 12 FILA stores in May and two additional Off\/Aisle stores in March. In both cases, we're generally pleased with the results and implementing operational changes as we learn from the results. We'll be opening six smaller-format stores in the third quarter, adding to the two 35,000 square foot smaller stores we opened in the first quarter. Even more importantly than in our standard prototype stores, we've seen the importance of flexibility and localization in our offerings, as each trade area is unique, due to both the small trade area and small store size. In 2017, we'll be looking for a small number of these stores to open in more populated markets to ascertain the potential and the possible use as a tool to serve trade areas where our full-size stores have too much square footage.","In conclusion, I'm very happy with the efforts the organization has made around rightsizing our inventory and the resulting improvement in merchandise margin and cash flow. We reached our objective, aggressive objective, of reducing inventories from last year by 6% per store at the end of the second quarter, and that will position us well to continue that rightsizing through fall and holiday.","I'm also equally pleased with the team's ability to manage expenses down in a tougher sales environment.","We continue to work to create more momentum in our sales trend. And this is our primary focus as we enter the fall and holiday. While the second quarter performance in sales certainly improved over the first quarter, we did have declines in foot traffic in our stores generally, and this needs to be reversed for the positive. The key areas of focus in continuing that improvement in sales are, of course, marketing and merchandising.","On the marketing side, we're centered on projecting all of our loyalty components, rewards, Kohl's Cash and credit offers, more completely. And on the merchandising side, our focus is on improving our speed and agility across all of our businesses, but, most importantly, our largest one, Women's Apparel.","As you heard in our assumptions for the remainder of the year, we're looking to continue to improve on each of our key metrics, but have stayed conservative in the level of improvement expected.","Thank you. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Introducing Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter, guys.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","When we think about 2Q and the sequential comp improvement that you saw from three months ago, I guess my first is where did you see the largest performance gap in terms of improvement? And then just looking ahead, you have a lot of upcoming initiatives, some new brands, what's the best way think about the sustainable comp beyond all the noise that we're seeing this year?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Wes?","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. I mean, I think all the areas improved, obviously, over the first quarter. I think the areas that probably improved the most were: Men's, which led the company with a positive comp; and Home, although negative, was very difficult in the first quarter. We made some marketing changes, adding some tab (20:54) distribution in both June and July, which we think disproportionately helps Home and we think that's going to be pointed in the right direction for the back half, which is a very important business in the fourth quarter.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is Kevin, Matt. On the more sustainability aspect of the comp looking forward, I think, as we sort of alluded to in the call, we're obviously very focused on the two most important elements, merchandising and marketing. On the merchandising side, I would say we're going to continue to drive our national brand strategy, in particular continue to amplify the importance of active and wellness because we think that's a trend that's taking hold very strongly. And while we have a good leadership position, I think expanding the portfolio with Under Armour is going to make a massive difference. We're actually going to invest in the stores across the whole active area to make that area stand out more as part of the launch of Under Armour.","And then secondly, in merchandising, we touched on the fact that we know that we have to be faster in our product cycle from beginning to end on our private and exclusive brands. And so we've seen the success in the areas where we piloted. And I think Michelle and the team is focused on expanding that to Women's across the board, and then, of course, to the overall store as well.","On the marketing side, I think we touched on probably the most important thing, which is continuing to wrap-up all of our loyalty efforts more successfully, so pulling together the credit offers, Kohl's Cash and Yes2You Rewards. And I think as we analyze the results of our business over time, we probably have had opportunity there. They've often stood alone and weren't well-connected in the communication with the customer. So I think Michelle feels pretty strongly that that's going to be a major opportunity going forward.","So merchandise and marketing are our focus. Brands on the national side, continue to add them, but drive the ones we have. Most importantly, improve the speed around our private and exclusive brands, and then really focus on loyalty as a concept in our marketing.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just a follow up, on the store base, could you just help talk about the evaluation of the fleet underway? How you're weighing the need for potential closings longer-term versus some of the cash flow that you're getting in some of these locations today; I guess any closings next year and then just thoughts longer-term?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's Kevin again. I can give you part of the thinking, and then Wes can get more specific to the financial aspect.","I mean, overall, as you know, we've closed some stores this year, and I think our expectation is we're going to be able to probably understand more about the impact of that on markets and other trade areas inside of markets that might positively benefit from those store closures.","I don't expect us to be able to do a thorough analysis to get a good understanding of that until next spring, because we really need to go through the fall and the holiday season to analyze that to a great degree. As a result, we honestly don't expect any store closures next year, as of right now.","The second part of that answer, long-term, is we think that our stores are really important. And, as we noted in the call, more and more, we're seeing the role and relevancy of the store come to life through being able to use our stores as shipping points for customers as they go online to buy product, but also as pick-up points as customers choose the convenience of buying online but picking up in the store and, therefore, avoiding any shipping or time delay as well. And so that number continues to grow.","I think Wes was pretty excited about the fact that it reached 21% of dollars, 23% of units. I expect at the end of the third quarter, it's going to be even higher. And I would really expect at the end of the fourth quarter, it's going to be massively higher, just because of the nature of the business.","As it relates to specific financials around stores, Wes could give you a good handle on that.","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I mean, I think we mentioned in the past, we look at it on an incremental cash flow basis. As we look at our lease expirations for next year's, we don't have any stores that are underperforming that are going to expire next year on a lease. So we won't be closing any leased stores next year, for sure.","There are some owned stores that are underperforming. We'll keep monitoring that. But to Kevin's point, until we get through holiday and understand how good we are at forecasting retained sales, it would be difficult for us to go ahead and say we're going to close more stores until we know how accurate we are on that.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just first on the SG&A guidance for the back half, just as we model that out, do you expect much variability from Q3 to Q4? I think last year, it was flattish in Q3 and up quite a bit in the fourth quarter, so just any help on how we should be thinking about that.","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","It really will depend on our results. I think we'll have more SG&A in the fourth quarter, if the sales are at the higher end, with incentive compensation and things like that, but I wouldn't expect any great variability. Certainly didn't expect the performance that we had there this quarter; everybody in the company, especially in store payroll, did a great job of pulling back on expenses, but nothing material.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. And I wanted to dig into loyalty a little bit. First, can you just update us on your efforts on converting the Yes2You members to credit customers? And then, bigger picture, now that we're close to two years into the program, just talk about some of your learnings; how effective the program has been in driving incremental visits or increasing transaction sizes, and how the engagement among members has evolved over time and any changes planned for the program moving forward.","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","I think from a loyalty perspective, we got a very nice lift last year. Our learnings from the second year is that we have to continue to create new ways for folks to get excited about loyalty. We started to do some events. We just did one the last week of July, where we combined our Friends and Family Event with the triple points for loyalty customers and that's some of the things that Kevin was talking about earlier about marketing. It's important to market the event, but the three biggest things we have driving our sales from a marketing perspective are credit card penetration, Kohl's Cash and our loyalty program. And we can't get those in front of the customers enough and get them to understand what the value of that is.","As far as getting them to translate into credit card customers, I think we've seen some success there, but, honestly, we have a big data opportunity to marry the sources of data that we have within the company. There are people that register for our website on kohls.com that provide us that information. There are people that register on the loyalty profile. We need to marry that information together, along with trying to get some income information, so we can be able to prescreen those at the front register. We're going to be able to start to do that in more volume after we roll-out our new point-of-sale program in the third quarter, but I don't expect to see significant enrollments in that until the spring of next year.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, one thing that has proven out, Mark, and I think Wes would tell you is for sure the Yes2You customer who is also a credit card customer, is by far the most engaged, consistent shopper in terms of visits and dollars spent at Kohl's than any other customer we have. And they're also the most profitable customer for us. So I think from that perspective, we clearly are on the right path and, as Wes kind of alluded to, what we need to do is accelerate the engagement of Yes2You customers who aren't credit card customers to consider moving that way.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful. Thanks and best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the back half gross margin guidance of plus 20 to 40 [basis points]. Are you still planning for your inventory to be down as much as receipts were down coming into the third quarter? And, if so, are there further opportunities to reduce clearance and initial promotions?","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Our inventories plan to be down mid-single digits, so kind of like where we ended the second quarter. We always have a level of conservatism. Fourth quarter is always very competitive. I think you guys know that the e-commerce business spikes significantly in the fourth quarter. That is a bigger headwind to gross margin from a shipping cost perspective, so we're still going to see more improvement in the fourth quarter last year, given our performance. We expect to see some improvement in the third quarter, but I think it's just a level of conservatism, not knowing what's ahead of us, but from an inventory management perspective, we're going to hit those numbers. The team is really focused on bringing those inventory levels down. And I think you've seen, by our results in the second quarter, what benefits that has.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research","Thanks. And I think you talked about bringing in more transitional product after holiday. Can you give us a little context on what that might look like coming into the first quarter?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, first of all, it's baked into the inventory assumptions Wes gave you, which is continue to keep inventories down mid-single-digit. I think Wes and I and Michelle would say if we could do better than that, we'd be happy, but that's currently, certainly, our focus right now, but there's a pretty big shift because due to high inventories last year, as you know, we were unable to deliver in the mid-November to mid-December periods fresh receipts that will allow us to transition out of holiday into spring, and that's going to be a pretty big change.","So I think our viewpoint is when you think about how we would then be positioned both for our late holiday selling, but, more importantly, into spring, we're just going to be in a much better place because the percentage of our total units on hand that'll be transitional will be much, much higher than it was last year.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Just a quick two-part question, on the localization efforts you guys been piloting that, at least with a group of stores, a little bit longer than the rollout for the company; just wondering if there's any data points around kind of longer tail insights you've had from that pilot store group that you can share about gaining confidence in the second half gross margin. And then, secondly, Kevin, maybe for you on the active wellness, really great to see Under Armour come into to the store; the overall category, sounds like it's up mid-singles. Nike is up low doubles. Just wondering how to reconcile those two just a little bit; are you transitioning out some brands as you prepare for space or are there underperforming brands within active wellness? Thank you.","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","On the localization, we've sort of piloted versus control group, we're getting about a 70 basis point lift in comp in the areas that are localized versus the ones that aren't, with about a 40 basis point reduction in inventory. So that's a pretty good result from our perspective. I think as we learn more as we continue to get better at this, it really is a combination of art and science. So the absolute inventory levels are easier to control. Trying to figure out what the difference is in assortment is a little harder. I suspect we'll get better as we go throughout the year on that. And then Kevin can take the other question about...","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, on the active wellness area, I think the way we're looking at that, Neely, is that the business is obviously growing faster than the overall apparel business. Certainly if you look at it industrywide, the rate of growth is slowing just because the denominator is getting bigger, the business is bigger and bigger and it's certainly a lot bigger for us, but it continues to grow a lot faster than the rest of the store.","And so active and wellness is going to be getting more space. It's got more inventory dedicated to it in our stores. And we're going to be going through this holiday a pretty major transformation of the presentation and space allocation and fixtures in our active and wellness areas in the stores to prepare for the Under Armour arrival that will include updating and amplifying the rest of active and wellness in addition. There aren't any major brands that are going away at all. We just are seeing the continued move of consumers who are moving into that space. And I think it's a long-term sort of life change for American consumers, and we're just reflecting it in our inventory and space.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you so much, you guys. Best of luck out there.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Wanted to ask a question on the top line. I believe you mentioned that July ended well and there is momentum heading here into the third quarter. You also spoke positively about the Children's and Juniors business. And I also know, Wes, that I think Thanksgiving's a little bit earlier this year, which could be helpful to 4Q. I guess I'm just surprised you didn't guide to the possibility of positive comps; if you could just maybe rectify that for us.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think what we've done in terms of the forward look is consistent with the way we always look at guidance, Paul. At the end of the first quarter, we really didn't update our guidance. And the reason we didn't is we just felt like we didn't have a firm data point to be able to give you a true insight into the look through the year. Second quarter is now over. We see the improvement in the business. We see some of the inventory strategies taking hold, the resulting improvement in margin. Some of the SG&A initiatives that Wes and his team have implemented are taking hold as well. So we're just in a better position to use the current trend year-to-date to apply to the fall and holiday.","Yeah, it goes without saying, Wes mentioned some of them, there is opportunity. We could do better on inventory. If you use second quarter as a data point, we could do better on margin. But I think it makes sense for us to just say, hey, year-to-date, this is where we're at and we're looking for continued improvement on each of the lines, but we don't want to get ahead of ourselves either.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Fair enough. That's helpful. And then, just to also better understand the comp composition, could you just tell us what drove the UPTs up, I believe, three points, and just if there's any opportunity for AUR to increase in the back half or should we continue to believe that is flattish?","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","I mean, I think AUR will increase in the back half, due to increased penetration of national brands. We ended the quarter with less clearance than last year, but we were aggressive at pricing that through the second quarter to get rid of it. So I think that was part of the AUR drop, which hopefully will not be an issue in the back half, as clearance continues to be lower than last year as we \u2013 certainly in the fourth quarter, as we've moved throughout the fall season. But I think the units are up because the product is more salable. People like what we're \u2013 there's more positive parts of the business now than there were in the first quarter. So some of those Back-to-School businesses that we mentioned, like Young Men's and Juniors, were positive for the entire quarter, not just for July, so that gives us some hope going into back-to-school.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you, and good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Dan Binder from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Hi. It's Dan Binder. Thanks. Obviously, a tough industry backdrop; I was wondering if you could share a little bit of market share color, if you have any, and what you're seeing on industry promotion. And then, just lastly, kind of following on to the last question, the issue seems to be traffic. Obviously, if the product's more salable and UPT is up, what more do you think you can do to drive traffic?","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, we don't really have the NPD data for the second quarter yet, but I'm assuming that it will tell us that Amazon continues to gain market share, as do off-price. We did a lot better in the second quarter than we did in the first, so I think that will probably help us out as well.","From a traffic, Kevin talked about it, we're doing a good job with the credit card customer. They continued to shop us and shop us more than they did last year. We have to continue to make inroads with the non-credit card customer. That's part of the things we talked about. I think Mark asked a question earlier on loyalty, trying to engage them more, trying to round them up to a higher level of reward to get them to come in more frequently and raise the response rate, to hammer home the differentiation of us providing Kohl's Cash and the Yes2You Rewards versus our competition.","All of that takes time. It's not going to turn on a dime, so we just have to continue to do that. If you start to notice our broadcast, I think you'll see a more consistent theme on highlighting those vehicles versus just saying what the current event is. And I think over time, that's going to resonate with the customer and get them to come into us more often.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, I think Wes definitely covered the key points. And if you think about what we covered in the call, Dan, we're definitely trying to bring up the message that we know that we've got to improve our speed strategy in private brands. And we've been working on that and we're now starting to get confidence that we can scale that across the store. So that's a big one. And I think Michelle is now more confident than ever that wrapping loyalty platforms together allows us to move customers up through Yes2You and credit card combos that would lead to higher engagement and higher sales.","The other part that I think is probably important for you to understand is that we do think that we have a big opportunity to amplify both the rollout, but, more importantly, the relevancy of our store base. So we made some store closures. As Wes said, we monitor stores all the time, but there are no stores that we would anticipate closing next year, right now. And the indicators through things like our ability to ship from store more effectively and less expensively, and buy online, pick up in store adoption rates, I think give us a sense that that's also a key element for us to see the value in having a broad network of brick-and-mortar stores. I think it's a big advantage.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","That's a good segue to my next question. Wes, at one point, you'd given us sort of a rough idea of what the gross margin headwind was for each point of penetration in e-commerce. With the learnings on ship from store, take into consideration split shipments, the things you're doing around that, has that impact to gross margin changed versus what it was looking like a year ago, as we get an increase in e-commerce penetration?","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","No, I still think it's going to be about 30 basis points in total for the year. Shipping cost is about 20 [basis points] and then mix is about 10 [basis points]. The BOPUS portion of that is obviously the biggest advantage in terms of profitability. That's moving up nicely, but not to the point where it can help us out significantly yet. I think the fourth quarter will be a big indicator of how good that can be.","You alluded to split shipments. That's something we're working on very diligently. The ship from store option for us makes us competitive with Amazon Prime in terms of we can get the shipment to the person's house in less than two days about 90%-some of the time. So speed is a big initiative from that perspective, but if we have to ship it in two packages, that's a problem. So we're continuing to fine-tune our algorithms to allow more packages to go together and not split the shipments. And I suspect we'll have more improvement as we move into the back half of that.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, is it fair to say, Wes, that the opportunity on the online margin is more about improving the net merchandise margin the next few years?","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, the shipping cost, given where we think online is going to go, is going to probably be around that 30 basis points, but if we can increase the apparel penetration through the combination of having both better product and smartly extending assortments in things like special sizes and big and tall, even in footwear with some of the wide shoe options, that'll allow us to do a lot better from a merchandise margin perspective. We made a lot of progress online from a clearance perspective and cleaning that up. And I think there's also opportunity with reducing SKUs, which will help as well.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","And just a last item, anything more on brands for this year in terms of brand announcements or opportunities, any particular categories or anything you're ready to talk about?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. Nothing to share with you right now, but, as we said, that continues to be a key focus for Michelle, both adding new brands to our portfolio but also strengthening the ones in key areas. Active wellness is a great example with Nike. And then, secondly, the speed initiative in private brands has an equally important role as she sees the mix of national and private brands evolving.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. Please go ahead.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks, guys. Macy's announced a store closing program today. I'm just curious if you've noticed any pick-up in your stores that are close to the last class of Macy's stores to close? And I think this was asked earlier, but just in the context of Macy's, does it make you think any differently about what the right number of stores is longer-term? I know you say you don't have anything lined up to close next year, but what's the right ultimate size of the fleet? Thanks, guys.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Wes might be able to answer the first part. I can definitely reiterate...","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, we haven't really seen it. Because they're in malls, very similar to when Penney's was pursuing their different strategy, we didn't see a big pick up. We haven't seen a big pick up from the Macy's closures. I would think the mall-based retailers would see more of that.","And then, from a store closure perspective, it's hard to predict the future. If we can start to drive top-line sales more consistently, that should make the stores better. We mentioned earlier, I don't see any stores that we're going to close next year. When we get a better idea of what the retained sales are going to be from the 18 that we just closed in June, that will tell us what our projections are going forward and make us feel better about either we'd be more aggressive on closing stores or more conservative, once we get that information.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And just generally, though, Paul, again, I think we all feel that the role of brick-and-mortar stores in our future, we're actually more convicted about it than less convicted about it. Now, there can be individual stores, as we go through the next few years, that Wes might determine financially don't make sense to have, but if you think about all the things we're talking about, whether it's the rollout of these 35,000 square foot stores as a potential to replace larger stores over time, or it's all of the easy experience initiatives that we're implementing, or it's the adoption of buy online, pick up in store and our utilization of ship from store to make customer convenience on online orders easier and, as Wes just said, faster, they all, to a great extent, kind of point us toward saying that having a really strong base and portfolio of stores is an important element of why we're actually going to be successful in the future. Fewer stores, generally, are not going to be a ticket to success, in our mind. That doesn't mean if stores don't pass a financial hurdle, that we won't close them or downsize them. We will.","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, we'll have smaller stores in the future. As leases come up, I think it'll be smarter for us to relocate into a smaller store the next five years. But I think Kevin's right. Distribution points, as digital becomes a bigger part of everybody's business, is important.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. And then, just one separate one, how can we think about the launch of Under Armour? How big can it be in year one and maybe long-term as well, how big can that business be for you guys?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, obviously, we don't scale things like that in terms of volume or that externally. Internally, we have a plan. I think the way Michelle spoke about it when she announced the launch of it is it will be the biggest launch that we've done. And it's going to be funded accordingly. And, more importantly, from my standpoint, Michelle is looking at the overall active area, because, as you just heard in the script, we have brands in that area that are performing at an extremely high level. So we're not looking for Under Armour to diminish the rate of growth in other brands. We're looking to expand our opportunity in active and wellness, and also expand for Under Armour, points of distribution to reach customers that they have not been as successful reaching. So we feel great about that.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Good luck, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Michael Binetti from UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter, tough environment. Could I just ask you really plainly for our models, what are you baking in as your assumption on traffic for the second half, inside the same-store sales guide? I know you gave us a couple pieces. I just want to make sure I'm clear.","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Traffic is going to be down. You give us credit for being smarter than we really are. So I'm just thinking we're going to be down somewhere between down 2%, which was the run rate we had just recently, and flat. We think there are a lot of things moving in our direction to get to flat. If we get to flat, it's going to be because traffic is less negative. I don't think traffic has to be positive for us to be flat, because between a combination of either more units or slightly higher AUR, or hopefully both, we're going to have a higher transaction value.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, I guess the one thing that we talked about in the quarter, and you mentioned it a few times today, is the speed initiative on private label. Can you just help us think about what the overall opportunity is there? And I apologize if you mentioned this directly, but maybe the margin contribution you're seeing there? I know you've given us X% of private and exclusive label will get there over time, but maybe just how to think about how that impacts the margins?","And then, I guess secondly to that, is that obviously, you're focusing on private and exclusive, but some of the other chatter around the industry has been some of the national brands trying to integrate more deeply with their retailers to see if they can speed up in that wholesale retailer relationship. Is there any opportunity to do that as you look beyond what you'll be able to do on the private label side? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's Kevin. I think there definitely is opportunity in the national brand portfolio to improve speed. And it's definitely a focus for many of our key suppliers. We are probably talking more about it with you on the private brand side because we completely control that. And we know the elements of the cycle, from design all the way through delivery, that we can take time out of on, and we've piloted and experimented and seen the results.","I mean, I think, frankly, Michelle would tell you that she believes the metric that will improve if we effectively scale-up speed, beyond where it's been tested and piloted so far, will be sales.","Yeah, there's a corresponding positive that comes with more effective inventory. And, therefore, if sales improve \u2013 as you know, margins on private brands are quite a bit higher. And so there's a possible margin implication that would be to the positive as well, but I think that the number she's looking to change the trend line on is implement speed in order to have relevant product, which will sell better, turn a little faster and, indirectly, I think, raise our merchandise margin because we'll just be doing better in private brands.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Richard Jaffe from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much, guys, in a very comprehensive call. Just a question on the private brands and their evolution, clearly, there are some winners and losers in that portfolio. And wondering if there's an editing process that'll occur over the next year or so, where some of the private brands go away and are replaced by national brands or by expansion of the private label. So wondering how you're thinking about the private label brand portfolio and the opportunity now to edit it down a bit, to focus it. Thank you.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's Kevin. There's definitely editing opportunities in our private brand. And when I say private brand, I'm including our exclusive brand portfolio, so the entire portfolio represents almost 50% of our business. And I think the factors that will impact that will be how quickly we can scale up the speed initiative, will probably tell us pretty quickly which of the brands benefit the most from that, and, therefore, will point us in the right direction in terms of downsizing and then eliminating others. We definitely know that that's an opportunity for us. We have broadened the base of private and exclusive brands that we have to offer over the last five years quite substantially. And I think Michelle feels like there's a chance to tighten it up.","Our big private brands, though, the $1 billion-plus brands of SONOMA and Croft & Barrow and Apt. 9, they're not going away. And those are the ones that probably will benefit the most. There's always good things and bad things in the private exclusive brand results, but, generally, the really good things have been the brands like SO that have had the speed initiative applied, and also things like SONOMA, where we've kind of relaunched it. And the things that have struggled more are those brands where we haven't had any adoption of the speed initiative. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys, and nice progress. We were just wondering, I guess two questions, one about the guidance cut. So it seemed like Q1, you may have missed your internal plan by $0.10. It seems like you've more than made up here in Q2. So with the business improving, we were wondering why you're taking down the full year guidance. What metrics are you seeing or you're being more cautious on? And then the second question is, with the lower SG&A levels, are you finding that you have a new lowered leverage point going forward? Is your D&A now maybe going to grow a little slower or come down? Can you maybe talk about go-forward what are some things that can continue? Thanks very much.","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","All right. You're pretty new, Brian, so I'm going to help you with this. Well, first of all, we didn't take the guidance down from where the consensus was. You guys took it down for us, so we thank you for that. But the reason it's at $3.80 to $4, is if things don't improve from today, the quarter that we just reported, we'll make $3.80. Our internal expectations from a sales perspective are to improve. If we can hit those, we'll make $4.","From a leverage perspective, we've lowered our internal goal from a 2% to a 1.5%. We did much better than that this spring. I mean, if you do the math on the numbers I gave you, we should leverage at a little bit above a flat comp for the year. I can't sign up for that forever, but we do have a lot of initiatives going forward where I hope to do better than the 1.5%, but that's what we're committing to at this point.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Super. And just a final question on the beauty side, any updates there on what you're seeing from the expanded assortments?","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, this was the last batch of roll-out. The new beauty environment in the stores we just rolled out in the spring averaged about a 34% comp in beauty, which was similar to the first two stages. So it is now complete and it should continue to comp in those 267 stores in the 30% range through the balance of the year and slightly into next. So that's been a big success, and we're very happy with it. Michelle is working on trying to get additional brands to strengthen that environment now that the physical environment's rolled out.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Super. Thanks very much, and good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. We had a question about weatherproofing and your ability to really navigate the environment when weather is more risky and when weather is an opportunity. How would you dissect what factors may lead to that happening over time, whether it be categories, and it looks like speed is a great opportunity as well?","And then, if you could help us, just for our knowledge, dissect what's happening to your consumer as we kind of reconcile low unemployment and some wage growth against what's been tougher on traffic.","And just our last question is on Amazon. With the competition evolving on Amazon, what are you focused on just to ensure you're un-Amazon-able? Like where do you think your customer overlap is and product overlap? Thanks, guys.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","A lot of questions, Oliver. On the how we think about navigating the weather changes that happen in regions and parts of the country over time, I think generally, there's two answers to that, Oliver. One is, and I think Wes may have mentioned it; if not, I'll make sure you know. As we look into the fall and holiday, we've planned down seasonal categories substantially more than the overall business. So we feel like we want to make sure that we're in front of that and not chasing it. And we'd much rather be in a position where we run low or do have to chase product in highly-seasonal categories, so the plan has an aspect to it.","The longer-term answer is definitely the speed initiative, because many of our national brand businesses are less weather-sensitive, and most of our private and exclusive brand product is actually relatively highly weather-sensitive. So I think longer-term, we feel like the speed initiative is the solution. We've positioned private and exclusive brands I think, Wes, on an inventory basis really well going into the fall and holiday. We are down...","Wesley S. McDonald - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, we're down like mid-teens.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In total inventory. So I feel like we're in a really good place on that.","In terms of consumer behavior, I think there isn't any new news there. We had modest improvement in our business and in traffic, but it's still negative. So until such time as we can implement these merchandising and marketing changes, we don't want to plan for traffic to turn positive. And so, as he said earlier in the call, we're planning traffic to be lower than sales in the near-term.","In terms of competition, I think Wes also addressed that a little bit earlier, we continue to see and we expect that both Amazon and, generally, off-price space is gaining share. And so to the extent we can, we are really focused on making changes to our business model that would just allow us to compete more effectively. And one of the things that we're probably doing and have a stronger point of view about is the importance of our stores to do that. We're in a good position in that we have stores who pass our hurdles and are financially performing, but traffic is down. So if we don't get that turned around, at some point, we'll have to be looking at those stores more effectively.","We're piloting these much smaller stores as perhaps replacements so we can continue to have points of distribution, but they're less square footage. And then we're trying to utilize them as points of distribution through BOPUS and ship from store strategies. So I think Wes and I, Michelle, Sona, Rick Schepp, we all feel like stores are a really important part of our future and we just have to make them work harder for us with customers. And having more presence in markets has an impact on brand awareness and share awareness beyond just distributing product and access points. It just makes you a more important competitor in any particular market across the country.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks a lot. Solid results, and best regards.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Wesley S.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Wes McDonald, Chief Financial Officer of Kohl's Department Stores. Please go ahead.","Wes McDonald","Thank you. Good morning. With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO, and President. I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results. Kevin will then provide more details on our Greatness Agenda initiatives. We'll then open up the call to your questions.","Comp sales increased slightly in the quarter at 0.1%. Though we aren\u2019t satisfied with the level of the comp sales, we are pleased that we are starting to show come consistency in our sales results. This is the first time since 2011 that we have achieved three consecutive quarters of positive comps. ","The metrics of the comp sales increase are as follows: Average unit retail up 2.3%, units per transaction down 1% resulting in an average transaction value increase of 1.3%; transactions per store were down 1.2%, partially due to the shift of the tax free events from July into August. ","From a line of business perspective for the quarter, footwear performed better than the company with strength in Athletic and Men\u2019s Dress and Casual Shoes. Women\u2019s, Home, Men\u2019s, and Accessories were in line with the company. In Women\u2019s, our Missy\u2019s business continues its improvement with a 2% comp with strength in updated contemporary, active, and classic sports wear. On the home side, we had strength in premium electronics, luggage, and outdoor recreation online. ","In our Men\u2019s business, strength remains an active; and in accessories we had strength continuing in beauty and fine jewelry. Children\u2019s performed below the company with toys performing well and some softness in apparel, also partially due to the tax free shift. ","Junior\u2019s although still negative did improve its performance in the second quarter. Geographically, which includes online originated orders, the strongest regions were the West and Mid-West. The Northeast, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic performed essentially in line with the company, while the South Central trailed the company average. ","Gross margin decreased slightly for the quarter down 6 basis points, and is up 5 basis points for the spring season as we remain on track to achieve our gross margin guidance for the year of flat to up 20 basis points. ","SG&A increased 2% and deleveraged 42 basis points to last year for the quarter. This was slightly less than our expected range of expenses to be up 3% to 4%. We were able to leverage in our logistics areas and credit operations. Marketing expenses were slightly deleveraged as we invested in some of our first quarter savings into the second quarter events. ","Store and corporate expenses are relatively fixed, and we were unable to leverage those expenses on a modest comp increase. We remain on track to see our SG&A expenses grow 1.5% to 2.5% for the year. ","Higher IT amortization was the primary reason for the $11 million increase in depreciation expense for the quarter. Interest expense was $84 million for the quarter, essentially flat to last year. We incurred a loss and extinguishment of debt which represents the premium paid to bondholders related to a $767 million cash tender offer completed this quarter. Our income tax rate was 37.9% for the quarter, higher than last year by 130 basis points. Last year\u2019s results included some favorable state audit tax settlements during the quarter. ","Net income for the quarter was $130 million with earnings per diluted share being $0.66. Excluding the loss in extinguishment of debt, earnings per share were $1.07, a 5% decrease to last year. We ended the quarter with 1,164 stores, gross square footage of 100.5 million, and selling square footage of 83.9 million square feet. We did not open any stores during the quarter. ","Capital expenditures were $377 million for the spring season, consistent with last year. Store refresh spending was consistent year-over-year, but shifted from new stores and remodels to cosmetics. We continue to make capital investments in IT to support our omni-channel initiatives. We ended the quarter with $934 million of cash and cash equivalents. ","Inventory per store increased 9% and units increased 8%. The excess inventory is a result of slightly lower than expected sales and pre-positioning fresh fall receipts to drive sales for the back-to-school business. This includes an aggressive build in Active, our best performing business. In addition, as port operations have returned to normal on the West Cost, we have seen early receipt of fall goods as our orders were written during the period of disruption. ","The net effect of our receipt pull forward was approximately $120 million at cost. Looking ahead, we expect new receipts for the remainder of the fall season will be flat to a year ago. Our investment in fall inventory is in four major areas that have been performing well: Active, Premium Electronics, Entertainment and Licensing, and Cosmetics. ","As a reminder, we now have 900 stores in our new beauty environments, with our new beauty environments and new brands. We are planning a modest increase on trend in the remainder of our businesses for the fall season. As a result, we expect a low-single-digit increase in inventory units per store at the end of the year, and in 2016 we are planning to see low to mid-single digit decreases in our inventory units per store. ","AP as a percent of inventory decreased from 37.9% last year to 36.8% this year. The decrease is primarily due to the early fall receipts arriving in June, which were already paid for by the end of the second quarter. ","Weighted average diluted shares were $197 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 6 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 196 million of shares of stock outstanding. ","On Tuesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share, which is payable September 23 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 9. During the quarter, we completed several transactions which further strengthened our balance sheet. In July, we completed a cash tender offer for $767 million of our highest coupon debt. We also exercised our right to redeem 318 million of 2017 notes, which were not initially tendered. ","We used the proceeds from our $1.1 billion debt issuance to pay the principal of the tender debt. Tender debt premiums and accrued interest are being paid in cash. These transactions reduced our effective interest rate by 65 basis points and will reduce our annual interest expense by approximately $17 million. They also extended our average debt maturity by more than 3.5 years to a little over 13 years. We have no debt maturing until 2021 and our weighted average cost to debt is 4.88%. ","In conjunction with the refinancing, we incurred a loss of approximately $170 million. A $131 million was recognized in the second quarter. We expect another $39 million to be recognized in the third quarter when the reaming 2017 notes are settled. We also successfully amended and extended our revolver for an additional two years from 2018 to 2020. The amendment also reduced fees on undrawn balances. There were no changes to the financial covenants included in the agreement. ","Absent the effect of the loss in our extinguishment of debt, we now expect our earnings per diluted share to be at the low end of our previous guidance of $4.40 to $4.60. ","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Kevin who will provide addition insights in our results. ","Kevin Mansell","Thanks Wes. As Wes indicated, sales in the quarter fell short of our original expectations. That was driven by a modestly lower level of seasonal demand over the quarter, a larger than expected tax-free shift, and a later than expected back-to-school selling start. While our bold moves around the Greatness Agenda continued to produce expected results, the underlying business trend was softer as a result. ","Looking at results under each of our pillars in the quarter and new initiatives coming this fall, I\u2019m excited to share the following: Under Amazing product, national brands continue to experience significant growth, up approximately 6% for the quarter and the season as penetration for both periods increased above 250 basis points.","This was driven significantly by strong growth in our active and wellness bold move with brands line Nike, New Balance and PUMA. We are also happy to announce that we will be launching the Stride Rite footwear brand in early 2016 to continue that momentum. ","Under easy experience, we continue to build a world class digital experience. Response to our new app has been very favorable with over 2 million downloads this year alone and we now have over 8 million total users. Our wallet feature within our app has also been a big success with about 30% of our mobile traffic related to wallet use.","During the quarter we completed the rollout of Buy Online, Pick Up in Store to all stores across the country and we\u2019ll begin to market this feature across all of our platforms this fall. Attachment rates are very encouraging in the premarketing phase and land at about 25%. Based on these early results we now expect Buy Online, Pick Up in Store to be a significant percentage of our digital sales and a driver of incremental store traffic this holiday season. We are planning accordingly. ","We also now have our new beauty environment brands in 900 of our stores and we continue to see total store lifts on these implementations at the same plus 2% rate versus our control stores. Personalization efforts continue to driver our marketing changes and already this year we have delivered over 130 million personalized mailers, over 120 million personalized emails along with millions of personalized digital and wallet impressions. ","This fall will also mark the first broad implementation of our localization strategy. By the end of this fall 40% of our business will be unique, localized assortments with the expectation that all departments will have unique localized assortments by the end of next year. ","And finally, our Yes2You loyalty program continues to grow with 2 million more members added in the quarter, allowing us to reach 32 million total members. Over half of our transactions are now with loyalty members and almost three quarters of Kohl's charged transactions are also loyalty member transactions. We intend to launch a number of new enhancements and will celebrate the anniversary of last year\u2019s launch in October with a major event. ","In closing, we remain committed to the Greatness Agenda and believe these initiatives will deliver our sales goal. Although sales for the second quarter didn\u2019t meet our expectations, we are definitely pleased to see more consistent positive comp store sales results, especially in a quarter that was negatively impacted by our later start to the back-to-school shopping season. ","At this time I\u2019ll turn the call back to our operator who will provide instructions on asking questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee CRT. Please go ahead. ","Charles Grom","Hi, good morning guys. ","Kevin Mansell","Good morning.","Charles Grom","Just on the guidance, I figure out the $17 million benefit on interest expense, it sounds like you are backing the gross margin and SG&A guidance that you gave last quarter. So how should we think about comps in the back half of the year and then if you could just fill in the blanks on D&A and the tax rate and your buyback plans. ","Wes McDonald","Well the $17 million in an annual number. So you can think of more like between $3 million and $4 million a quarter, and we are not backing away from \u2013 I mentioned in the script. I mean we still believe our guidance for gross margin will end up somewhere between flat and 20 basis points for the year, and SG&A will be up somewhere probably closer to the higher end for the year between 1.5% to 2.5%. ","So, it will require a little bit of an increase in comp into the fall season. To hit the 440, we probably have to run close to a 2 comp from the back half. We talked about the tax free shift, obviously it hurt the second quarter, obviously it will help the third, and so it doesn\u2019t require a large amount of improvement to get to where we need to be for the back half. ","Charles Grom","Okay and then just Kevin you talked about the later back-to-school start and then also the shift. Have you been able to kind of quantify that for us, what would have the comp been or maybe where was the comp trending through the first 12 weeks of the quarter?","Wes McDonald","The comp would have been better for the quarter by probably about 50 basis points. That was really just isolating the two days of the tax free shift and with Labor Day shifting back a week, that\u2019s hard to really ascertain, but we have started see some strength in our back-to-school business as we have been through in August. ","Kevin Mansell","I mean I think the other part of that is Chuck is that\u2019s actually the math on the benefit that we get in August that we lost in July. So Wes\u2019 100% right on that. The related piece which I think is more difficult to quantify, but we think is relatively meaningful is that it also drove a later back-to-school selling season. Those two factors, both the shift to back tax free and the later Labor Day, and so I think he and I both feel that we probably would have been trending more like around a 1 comp for the quarter absent those things all together. ","Wes McDonald","Chuck you also asked a couple of other questions. For D&A, I think the year will probably end up around 930 and the tax rate is going to probably be around 37.5% let\u2019s say.","Charles Grom","And you still expect to do $1 billion in buyback. ","Wes McDonald","Yes, as you can probably tell, we were more aggressive on our buyback this quarter, and we tend to target $250 million a quarter. We ended up doing more than that, so I think we\u2019re pretty close to $550 million for the spring season, and our target\u2019s still $1 billion, but we think the stock is cheap. We certainly could do a little more than that, but we\u2019re targeting $250 million a quarter.","Charles Grom","Okay, and then just the last question, just you called out the south central being weak. Can you just add into that a little bit more? Is that the Texas market, Oklahoma?","Kevin Mansell","Yes, Texas and primarily the Houston market. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not any different for most people with significant businesses down there. I spoke with our regional manager down there and I saw obviously some of the weather issues they have had with all the rain they had this summer. It hurt a little bit, but that\u2019s a market that\u2019s been tougher for us this year, that\u2019s for sure.","Charles Grom","Okay, great. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Our next question is from Nancy Boss with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Matt Boss","It\u2019s Matt Boss, not Nancy.","Kevin Mansell","Yes, I was just going to say.","Matt Boss","On the top line composition, what are you guys embedding for traffic in that second half plan and then more so to drive 2% comps are better in the next two years, how should we think about the timing for localization and personalization opportunities?","Wes McDonald","Well, localization for sure is in its infancy. We really haven\u2019t got much benefit from that at all. We really have just been testing. We\u2019ll start to see more benefit from the fall. Of the bold moves that we talked about on the Analyst Day last fall, the biggest benefit we\u2019ve gotten thus far has obviously been from Active. We\u2019ve been talking about it for a number of years now. It continues to be very strong led by Nike. ","Our digital business is very strong as well, and we\u2019re seeing a lot of lift out, out of loyalty obviously. The two things that probably haven\u2019t kicked in as much in the three-year plan yet and we\u2019re not behind or anything, it just takes a little longer to build our personalization and localization. So localization is not only going to provide sales benefit, but should provide our ability to reduce our inventories pretty significantly, because we won\u2019t be buying mark downs just to fill fixture fill on the initial set. So that\u2019s something you know as a CFO I\u2019m very excited about, is trying to get more sales with a lot less inventory.","Kevin Mansell","I mean the expectation on localization honestly Matt is that while localization will impact roughly 40% of the business by the end of this year, the real lift from it is more modest in the third and fourth quarter and much more significant next spring. Wes is 100% right on personalization.","The third piece, which based on our early results we think is a big driver, particularly in the fourth quarter will be the Buy Online, Pick Up In Store strategies and so we essentially haven\u2019t done any marketing on Buy Online, Pick Up In Store, because we are just in the process of launching it across all of the platforms and the sense we have is that once we launched the marketing based on the limited results we\u2019ve seen so far, the combination of the traffic it drives to the stores and the attachment sales it\u2019s been providing are pretty significant.","Wes McDonald","And in terms that you asked about the traffic demand, I think for us around the 2 comp, we pretty much have to get back to flat traffic. We have seen \u2013 I\u2019m sure you guys graph all this, we certainly do, but the last three quarters, although not where we wanted to be; it\u2019s certainly improved over where we were running from a traffic perspective pre-Greatness Agenda.","Matt Boss","Right, and then just one quick follow-up. What are you guys seeing out there in terms of the competitive environments into the back-to-school season?","Kevin Mansell","I mean I don\u2019t think there is anything really new. I think many retailers have in place some versions of the strategies we have around particularly marketing and digital, but we have \u2013 I mean, there hasn\u2019t been any significant shift in terms of let\u2019s say discounting if that\u2019s what your after or anything in particular that would give us any pause for concern as we look at third and fourth quarter results.","Matt Boss","Great. Good luck guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you, good morning.","Kevin Mansell","Good morning.","Lorraine Hutchinson","If we think about the third quarter as a one comp run rate, can you just help us get comfortable with the back half acceleration to drive the low end of your guidance range? What are the specific drivers that you expect to have an outsized impact on the second half comp?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I think we just covered a few of them. I mean we\u2019re not precise enough to tell you that the third quarter is going to be 1 or 1.3 and the fourth quarter is going to be 1.5 or 1.8. I think as we look at the year-to-date performance, which we\u2019re kind of looking at as about a 1 comp, it does need to accelerate to about a 2 comp. ","Wes McDonald","I mean if you lose 50 basis points in the second quarter, you get it in the third, so you\u2019re at a 1.5 there. So we got to pick up another 50.","Kevin Mansell","So I mean I think the big things Lorraine remain to be the strategies we\u2019ve discussed and we just touched on three big ones we think for the fall and holiday and those revolve around the personalization impact of our marketing strategies, in particular as they relate to our loyalty platform, our launch and development of Buy Online, Pick Up In Store, as well as the effectiveness that ships from the store across the entire store platform or give us any impact of things like localization. That layered on top of the existing bold moves we think will accelerate the business. ","We definitely recognize softer demand in the first half of the year; I don\u2019t think there is any question about that. As we looked at the first six months results, I think traffic was softer than expected and I don\u2019t necessarily see that as a Kohl\u2019s unique issue. It seems to be relatively broader than that. ","Some of the things we are learning now that we are three quarters, sort of post the launch of the Greatness Agenda are informing some changes in, I would call it sort of an evolution of the Greatness Agenda moves and those are underway already internally. We\u2019ll probably share those with you sometime later in October, but I think they are going to have a positive impact on both the third quarter, but in particular the fourth quarter.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thanks. And then if you look at the Juniors business getting less negative in the second quarter, as you\u2019ve set the fall line and start to see some back-to-school, have you seen a continued improvement in that business?","Kevin Mansell","It\u2019s more positive than it was for sure. I mean probably the most improved business in the store, even though the total business as you all know was softer in the first half of the year. The most improved business in the store is Women\u2019s Apparel and Juniors is not as good as the rest of women\u2019s apparel, but it improved significantly in the second quarter.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell","Good morning. Wes, just a question going back to gross margins. I mean like you said, you reiterated the goal to be up a little bit here in the second half and for the full year. Can you just kind of give us some of the puts and takes on gross margins, in particular what is providing that uptick, especially given that even adjusting for the early receipt of inventory, your still up a bit, kind of coming into 3Q, coming off of a quarter where you had softer sales. Any color would be helpful.","Wes McDonald","Paul, if you do the math on the $120 million, our units are up about 5%. We are not going to not buy stuff that\u2019s selling. So investment and the things I indicated, Active, Licensing, Beauty are all going to \u2013 we are not looking for an acceleration on what they are selling today. We have pockets of stuff we are going to have to get through. We are starting this \u2013 we\u2019ve seen some great benefit. ","Nike is not only providing great benefit on the sales line, but with their stance on promotional environment we\u2019ve made a significant amount of more gross margin on that, so that\u2019s providing some tail winds from that perspective. But through the spring season we\u2019re up like I said, about 5 basis points. I think we\u2019ll end up between flat and 20. We\u2019ll be up closer to 20 if we can hit the two comps that we mentioned. If we can\u2019t, we\u2019ll be closer to the flat, that\u2019s normally how it works in retail. ","Paul Trussell","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then just in terms of the loyalty program, I would think that one of the concerns going forward is lapping that in the fourth quarter. Can you just remind us how many loyalty members you had in 4Q heading into that holiday period? Can you maybe discuss it all, a little bit of your plans on how to get more spend out of those members I know you mentioned and a big event planned for October and also just any color you can provide about the loyalty spin from those that have been in the program for over a year, perhaps are some of those early stages.","Kevin Mansell","Well, I think I can talk about the fact that we\u2019re going to have double the loyalty members when we go into the fourth quarter. I think we ended last year around $16 million or $17 million at the end of the third quarter and we should have $35 million going into the fourth. ","We\u2019re not going to talk about the plans for the loyalty event given that\u2019s more of a competitive thing and we continue to see strength in the loyalty members. They shop more frequently, which is really the driver of the lift that we\u2019re getting. We\u2019re getting consistent lifts across both bank card, it obviously have the biggest lifts, because their frequency is lower than somebody like an MBC, but we\u2019re getting lifts across all three categories.","I mean the bold moves are delivering pretty much what we thought. They were going to be \u2013 the reason our comps have been a little bit down are in businesses that haven\u2019t hit their plans and haven\u2019t had as much of an effect from the bold moves. Everybody obviously gets the effect from loyalty across the store, but we have a couple of businesses like juniors, like we have talked about for the last couple of quarters that are just weaker than we anticipated.","Paul Trussell","I appreciate the color. Good luck.","Operator","And next we\u2019re going to Dan Binder with Jefferies & Co. Please go ahead.","Dan Binder","Thanks. With regard to inventory, can you just maybe give us a little color around how clearance inventory looks year-over-year?","Kevin Mansell","Well, it\u2019s up year-over-year with the softer sales in the second quarter. We were more aggressive in taking markdowns in the second quarter, so we accelerated some of that into the quarter. Sell-through, I think our expectation for sell-through in the third quarter is it will be about equal to last year. We are not expecting a big acceleration and I\u2019m thinking by the time we get into late August, early September year-over-year inventories and clearance are going to be relatively flat to last year.","Wes McDonald","Yes, I mean if you use the same $120 million math on AP as a percent of inventory, its flat to last year. So we have a lot more receipts that we received in the last 30 days than we did last year.","Dan Binder","And then with regard to the web business, a couple of questions here. First, I forget, did you stop breaking out the gross amount and then the second part of the question is regarding focus. As you had more business shift to either Buy Online, Pick Up In Store or Ship From Store, what is the sort of the deleveraging effects of business not being shipped from the fulfillment centers and just curious with the Ship From Store initiative, what are you seeing on a typical store in terms of orders per day or per week.","Kevin Mansell","Well, I could tell you BOPUS is the best thing that ever happened in e-commerce. So we don\u2019t break out e-commerce sales anymore, but implicit in our three year plan back in October was a online generated order growth of about 20% a year. We\u2019re doing better than that this year. But Buy Online, Pick Up In Store from a profitability is the best thing you can get, because you\u2019re not shipping it, so you save the $5 to $6 per package that it costs to ship it to the house and we\u2019re seeing attachment sales of about 20% to 25% depending on the time of the week.","Like Kevin said, we haven\u2019t really publicized it a lot. It\u2019s about between 2% and 3% of our total online generated orders. We think that can accelerate quite a bit when we start publicizing that as we get more into the fall season.","From a Ship From Store perspective, the key is to try to keep the number of packages per shipment down as much as we can. We have made some software changes to try to do that, but both those things honestly would be a benefit to the profitability of online generated orders and gives us an opportunity to make the store inventory work a little harder and reduce the amount of inventory in the fulfillment centers.","Dan Binder","Are you using existing labor in the stores to do the Ship From Store or have you had to add labor hours.","Wes McDonald","No, I mean we add dedicated labor hours for these functions and as part of our overall payroll plan. I mean I think one thing that we\u2019ve tried to lay out clearly, but I think is still not well understood, Ship From Store just finished rolling out to the entire company this spring season. So from a benefit perspective, the big benefit we see in the fall and holiday is that it takes a tremendous amount of pressure off of our e-fulfillment centers, that\u2019s number one. Number two, it definitely makes our inventory in our stores more effective than it was before and improves the efficiency that we get on store payroll as a result.","Buy Online, Pick Up In Store, while it finished the completion of the launch to all stores this second quarter, we have not marketed it at all and in fact it has not been available in any format other than desktop. So both mobile and tablet will be new in the third quarter and with the launch of mobile and tablet comes a really aggressive marketing campaign. ","So we\u2019ve looked at the results in the small launch period with no marketing and looked at its attachment rates, as well as traffic rates and I think our sense is its going to be a big driver of traffic to stores, but most importantly as Wes said, a driver of more efficient use of our inventory.","Dan Binder","All right, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Neely Tamminga","Great, good morning. I have one quick follow-up on that Kevin and then I\u2019ve got a bigger question on pricing and promotions. In terms of the mobile, I think originally we were thinking you were going to launch the mobile platform for Buy Online, Pick Up In Store in August. Is that still slated for August or will it be on the other side of Labor Day, that\u2019s the first question. ","And then secondly, in terms of looking at the pricing and promotional analysis that you guys have been very strategically making I think within the company. I\u2019m thinking of like the lowest prices of the season sale that you did and when you removed that 20% off coupon. Has anything in the traffic pattern here thus far in back-to-school caused you to want to go back to the old ways of kind of learning promotion on promotion or are you guys committed to kind of providing more of a scalpel to your promotions. Thanks.","Kevin Mansell","Yes, taking them one at a time. I mean the timing on our mobile and tablet implementations is the same as it has always been, so we\u2019re right on target, we\u2019re all set and as I said, we\u2019ve been sort of focused more on really accelerating that as we get into October, November, because that\u2019s when we see the big opportunity being created, so that\u2019s number one. ","Number two, on the pricing thing, there\u2019s absolutely nothing that we\u2019re seeing happening that would change our longer term perspective on how we go about marketing. We definitely know that we have a big opportunity to really tailor our marketing efforts and therefore our pricing to a unique individual customer to get more effective response rates. ","Without kind of queuing you in too much to some of the things we\u2019re going to be talking about, just part of the evolution of the Greatness Agenda, one of the areas that we do feel strongly about is that we have an opportunity through analytics to elevate our leadership on value, new strategies around pricing. And so we\u2019ll talk more about that as we get into the later part of the fall season and you\u2019ll hear more about it as we go forward into 2016, but I do think we see that space as a big opportunity for us.","Wes McDonald","As far as LPS goes, it runs later this month. It\u2019s going to be same as April and it\u2019s going to work well.","Neely Tamminga","Excellent! Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Bernard Sosnick with Gilford Securities. Please go ahead.","Bernard Sosnick","Yes, thank you. Pick up on the store has its benefit of course as you\u2019ve outlined already, but shouldn\u2019t it also reduce shipping cost and have a benefit to gross margins?","Wes McDonald","Yes, I mean that was my favorite part Bernie. That\u2019s the money we save on the $5 or $6 a box.","Bernard Sosnick","Okay, good. I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you very much.","Kevin Mansell","Okay, bye.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Michael Binetti with UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, good morning. I apologize if I missed it, but would you mind giving us for our models the percent of sales made on a Kohl\u2019s card in the quarter.","Kevin Mansell","It was down a little bit. I don\u2019t have the exact number unfortunately in front of me, but I think it was down about \u2013 I want to say it was down about 150 basis points, but I\u2019ll give you a call after. I\u2019m sorry about that.","Michael Binetti","Okay, all right. Would you mind telling us just about the overall \u2013 I mean obviously you\u2019ve got a number of initiatives going on with e-commerce, but the overall trend that you saw in the quarter at a high level. You saw some big retailers and some native e-tailers also through pretty big promotions in the quarter and some of the other brands and retailers have seen some volatility around those events. I\u2019m wondering if you guys saw similar volatility.","Kevin Mansell","No, I mean Mike if you\u2019re alluding to things like Prime Day by Amazon or that, no. I mean I think what happens on those kinds of things is all retailers are sensitive and aware about promotion in the space and you inevitably therefore strategize and target your own elements to offset, to ensure that you don\u2019t get hurt and so I think actually the facts, Wes will probably be able to give you the specifics, but I think actually the facts are we saw a much larger list during that short period of both Prime Day implementation by Amazon and related.","Wes McDonald","Oh yes, we beat our plan, that\u2019s for sure.","Kevin Mansell","So I think it\u2019s just the way it works. It\u2019s just there\u2019s a lot of activity.","Wes McDonald","You get more people to the web than you might find on Amazon and you might find on Wal-Mart. It looks like more of them than we thought bought it on ours. I do have the credit numbers. Sorry about that. I think I have a little too much paper here today.","Charge sales for Q2 were 37.6% down 171 basis points and then year-to-date its 57.8% down about 130 basis points. So it kind of makes sense given the fact that we\u2019re doing better from a non-Kohl\u2019s charge because we put more emphasis from a marketing perspective. So the Kohl\u2019s charge was sort of negative for the quarter, down low single digits, while the non-Kohl\u2019s charge was up mid single digits. ","So we\u2019re continuing to figure out a way to better balance those. The goal obviously would get them to be both positive, but we need new customers and that\u2019s what\u2019s coming with the non-Kohl\u2019s charge comp. They spend a little less obviously, because they are newer and the Kohl\u2019s charge folks spend a little bit more, but we\u2019ll continue to work on better balancing them and hopefully by the time we get to the end of the year they\u2019ll both be running positive.","Michael Binetti","Okay, if I could ask just one last one. Kevin you mentioned that your planning accordingly for Buy Online, Pick Up In Store to be a bigger part of online this holiday. I know you\u2019ve comment on a few times to Q&A, but would you mind giving us just a little bit more color on what you meant with that specific comment please. Thank you.","Kevin Mansell","Well, through the test period \u2013 I mean the test period essentially was really an operational test period. It was to ensure that on the technology side everything worked the way we wanted it to work. The customer service was delivered in the right way and that we were able to achieve the speed we needed to. ","On the storage side, of course it was the start to better understand what stores have to do in order to quickly present the product to the customer and do it in an efficient way. So that\u2019s kind of the process we went through in the second quarter.","I think we did 2.5% to 3% of demand as we sort of experimented with that on the operational side and so it\u2019s sort of a meaningless number. We\u2019re planning a much larger percent of digital sales to come as Buy Online, Pick Up In Store; that\u2019s what\u2019s baked into our planning. We are not planning that it necessary lifts the total digital sales, but we do believe based on the attachment rates we\u2019re seeing right now, it\u2019s got the potential to add sales in store and add some visits, which as you know our two biggest challenges are win new customer. Wes, kind of just touched on that one and secondly, get more visits into our store and that\u2019s why we\u2019re kind of super optimistic about Buy Online, Pick Up In Store.","Michael Binetti","All right, thanks guys.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Mark Altschwage with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark Altschwage","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. A quick follow-up on SG&A. Wes, I believe you said SG&A growth is expected to be at the high end of the 1.5% to 2.5% range. Just what are the primary components to that and then if sales aren't able to hit that 2% expectation for the back half, how much flexibility do you have on the SG&A front?","Wes McDonald","Well, I didn\u2019t mean to alarm people on that. It\u2019s probably going to be somewhere between 2% to 2.5% for the fall. So it will be lower in the third quarter and higher in the fourth quarter. Kevin mentioned Buy Online, Pick Up In Store, that\u2019s going to drive a little bit more store expense. We\u2019re going to put a lot of the investments and we saved a lot of money in marketing this year and we\u2019re going to put a lot of investments in the fourth quarter.","On that we have a tendency to get out shorted, especially on broadcast by some of the larger retailers that are bigger than we are. So that will give us a good opportunity to be more competitive from that perspective.","Reflected down obviously the \u2013 80% of our cost roughly are fixed. I mean you can argue that advertising is variable, but if you are not making your sales you probably are not going to cut your advertising. So the easiest one if we don\u2019t make it would be related to incentive comp would come down. Anything that\u2019s unit related we could save money in the stores from a processing perspective, as well as the EFCs corporate expenses. You can manage your hiring a little differently, leave positions opened, but that\u2019s only about 20% of the expenses, really what I would call truly variable. ","Mark Altschwage","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then Kevin, could you briefly address the Off Aisle concept, to the strategic rational there. Any early takeaways from tests and just how are you are thinking about the potential longer term opportunity. ","Kevin Mansell","Sure. I mean Off Aisle was originally conceived as a way for us to improve the valuation on our returns, and as you know like any retailer we get a significant percentage of returns in our stores and a much more significant percentage of returns to our stores that originated with an online order. ","So returns as a percent of sales for us have been rising consistently over time and it\u2019s just a math as more people bought online, there is a higher return rate, those returns go to the stores, so our total return rate keeps going up modestly. And when we looked at that, the potential profit pool for managing what we get for those returns was pretty significant. That coincided obviously with us trying to be more aggressive and experimenting more with new innovative concepts. And so we created this Off Aisle concept first and foremost to target an improved return on our returns from customers, but secondly also to learn more about the off price business in general. ","So I would expect there are going to be more Off Aisle stores coming again, not to queue too much into what we\u2019ll be talking about later in the third quarter as evolutions to the moves and the Greatness Agenda, but definitely new formats, including more Off Aisle stores will be coming. Results have been really good. They\u2019ve been better than we expected. ","Mark Altschwage","Thank you and best of luck in the third quarter. ","Kevin Mansell","Thanks.","Operator","And we will go to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Stephen Grambling","Hey, good morning thanks for taking the question. Just on the fields of Macy's announcement, on examining ways to monetize real-estate value, what\u2019s your latest philosophy on your own real-estate and then maybe more broadly as a follow-up, has our traffic trends just dramatically different by stores just because you might at some point reconsider the number of stores you are operating across the chain. Thanks so much. ","Kevin Mansell","Wes can probable \u2013 I mean the real-estate answer is honestly pretty simple. I mean real-estate is one of the assets that we have like all of the other assets we have. We are always reviewing what the options are that would maximize shareholder value, and that\u2019s under constant revenue, it\u2019s not necessarily focused on today\u2019s events or the last three months events, it\u2019s just a regular course of good governance and we\u2019ll continue to do that. On the traffic side, I think we are actually pretty optimistic I would say about traffic Wes. ","Wes McDonald","Yes, I mean there is a little bit of variability by region, but not a ton and in terms of the number of stores, we have a list of stores that we always look at negative incremental cash flow stores, we run it once a year. There is a list of probably 10% or 15% stores on that list. We\u2019ve tried to look at market by market versus individual stores, because obviously if you make a decision to close the store, in one market you might pick up some sales and a couple of other stores that might make a negative one term positive. ","Most of the stores that are negative cash flow, we are talking in a couple of $100,000 range per store. So we think that it\u2019s prudent to be a little patient. We believe in the Greatness Agenda, we believe we are going to continue to make progress and hopefully those slightly negative cash flow stores will turn positive. But we closed a couple of stores this year. We are going to close a couple of stores next year. But we are really looking at handfuls versus major closures. ","Kevin Mansell","And just so we are totally transparent about this, traffic variability on sharp turn windows a month, a quarter are highly volatile, they can change a lot. So in a particular market, in a particular region, in an individual territory the traffic trends year-over-year can be really pretty volatile and that\u2019s because weather is a big factor in our demand. The economic conditions in a particular market can be very different depending upon the job environment and it can uniquely be affected as well by completion, as new competition opens up in a trade area or in a market in a big way. ","We kind of look at traffic when we are evaluating real-estate more or less let\u2019s say on a 3 to 5 year trend and we are looking at is there a consent pattern of decelerating traffic and that would cause us to do the evaluating Wes is talking about, which is a what\u2019s the future of this store. ","Stephen Grambling","That\u2019s all very helpful. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll just back in the queue. Best of luck. ","Kevin Mansell","Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Richard Jaffe with Stifel. Please go ahead. ","Richard Jaffe","Thanks very much. Wes, if you could elaborate a little bit on the shift in ad spend from 1Q to 2Q and what bodes for the second half? It seems that there was some marketing powder kept dry last year and some indications that you'd be spending more this year and in differentiated ways. Can you perhaps talk about second-half ad spend and also year-over-year promotional cadence, how you see that changing?","Wes McDonald","Well there will be no powder left dry this year. We are going to spend a $1 billion, that\u2019s going to be lower than last year, but we\u2019ve been talking not what I would call non-product saving. It\u2019s not by cutting the number of events or anything like that, just repositioning. So for the fall season, for the first time we are going to be spending more money in digital than we are in print. That\u2019s were our customers are doing their research, whether or not they purchase online from whatever device they are using, they are definitely using the research to make their purchasing decision. So that\u2019s important. ","In the spring season from a marketing perspective we reduced the amount of credit marketing we have, which we actually charge to their credit profitability and actually increased the amount of non-credit, which is what\u2019s driven the non-credit card comps being positive. So we continue to do that and shift it into more productive marketing. But the fourth quarter will be up significantly to last year in terms of marketing spend. ","Kevin Mansell","I mean at the end of the day Richard we spend less money in marketing in the first half than we originally had planned than last year and we intend to spend more money in the second half that\u2019s high level. ","Wes McDonald","We are going to spend $1 billion. We are certainly not going to spend $999 million. ","Richard Jaffe","And hopefully there's a tight correlation between ad spend and traffic? ","Kevin Mansell","That\u2019s the hope. ","Richard Jaffe","Okay. Thanks very much. ","Operator","Our next question is from Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Matt McGinley","Good morning. My first question is on the loyalty use and the credit card spend in the second quarter. I know it was a tough market for everyone in the second quarter and the tax holiday certainly didn't help you. But did the loyalty users and the credit card users still have positive traffic where I would interpret that as this is just an issue where you need to convert more non-loyalty people and get them on the bus or did the loyalty users and credit users slowdown as well, which may indicate a broader issue with the market or perhaps that the program needs to be readjusted?","Kevin Mansell","I think the way you got to look at the loyalty users, which is the way we having to look at it. We have to look at them as unique loyalties users, because you can\u2019t look at them as pool right, because we have twice as many loyalties members as we did last year. So it\u2019s kind of a meaningless \u2013 I think Wes its sort of meaningless statistic, because naturally they transacted a lot more because there is two times as many of them. So we try to look more at unique loyalty members, how our members who are in the program behaving. ","And we are really focused on a different metric anyway, which is you know \u2013 the metric we are focused on essentially is to say that we\u2019ve had a long period right, 5 years and more where the penetration of our credit business to our total credit business has risen consistently. The problem is our total business hasn\u2019t risen. So it\u2019s on a customer basis. Its more customers transacting on credit, but not more customers in total. ","Loyalties objective is to create and win new customers, so that even if credit as a percent of total transactions is flat, we win because total sales and total traffic is up, and so we look at it a little bit different and the answer to your question directly wouldn\u2019t get you to where you want to be, because we\u2019d tell you all loyalty transactions are way up compared to last year. ","Wes McDonald","We do need to do a better job of using loyalty to feed the credit program. We have been focused more getting people on-boarded into loyalty. I think the next lever to pull after we have done that for a year is to show them that they\u2019ve all experienced the value of loyalty, the value of being a credit card customer is much greater. ","We also have to do a better job of soliciting applications in the stores for credit, we have a taken a step back as we\u2019ve focused a little bit too much on soliciting loyalty applications. So we need to do a better balance of that and I\u2019d been working along with the marketing guys and the store team to do that. ","We\u2019ve seen some dramatic improvement in July on that. We\u2019ve made some changes from an incentive perspective for both the applicant and the associate who is soliciting credit. So I suspected that we\u2019ll do much better on soliciting credit in the fall season.","Matt McGinley","Thank you. And then on the second question I just want to make sure \u2013 you said this a few times. I just want to make sure I got it right on the SG&A growth, it was around 2% in the first half. Do you still think it will be 1.5 to 2.5 points in the back half at probably the higher end of that range? I think you said between 2% and 2.5%? And the primary driver of that which you had previously I think was around 0.75% to 1.75% is Buy Online, Pick Up In Store and ad dollars or was there something else that you were adding else to that that was driving that?","Wes McDonald","No, I mean for two quarters in a row, we\u2019ve beat our guidance on SG&A, so the year hasn\u2019t changed. So it\u2019s just got pushed further. If we save money in marketing, we are not going to spend less than $1 billion. We are $20 million let\u2019s say below our plan for the spring. We are just going to reinvest that in the fall. ","Matt McGinley","Okay, so you're conservative when you rolled it?","Wes McDonald","I would say the SG&A spend, I think you guys assume its somewhere between 2 and 2.5 for the fall season. ","Matt McGinley","Okay, perfect. Thank you. ","Operator","The next question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura. Please go ahead. ","Bob Drbul","Hi, good morning. ","Kevin Mansell","Good morning Bob. ","Bob Drbul","Hi Wes. I guess the first question I have is, I mean Wes can you share with us the Nike comp? Usually you gave it to us I think recently. I just wondered is it remaining a big number for you on that.","Kevin Mansell","It\u2019s up \u2013 we are not at high double digits, it\u2019s got to be like 99%, but it\u2019s up mid to high teens. ","Bob Drbul","Okay and I just had two merchandising questions for you Kevin. The first one, on the Missy category what's changed there? Is it the crinkle Ts, is it the hoodies that are having a big impact, can you just talk a little bit about that? And a question on the denim category, you haven't really talked about the denim category, but are the destructed jeans really driving the business at all there? ","Kevin Mansell","Glad to see your back on your horse on the marketing questions Bob. I don\u2019t even know how to answer you to one of those. I\u2019ll try to answer them seriously for you though Bob. Missy is probably I would say our most improved business trend and that\u2019s after a long period of not being able to say that. And again, as part of sort of our evolution of the greatness agenda which we expect to share with you later, Missy apparel, women\u2019s apparel in total is going to be a real focal point of some changes we are making. I think many of them are taking place internally now and we are getting a little bit of the benefit for that. ","I think Denim is definitely improved. ","Wes McDonald","Yes, Levis had a really good quarter in the second quarter. ","Kevin Mansell","So that\u2019s a really positive thing, because as we talked about Back-to-School definitely started later and that\u2019s typically not good for denim sales, but denim sales have declined significantly over the course of the last by 12 to 24 months. And there\u2019s been a big change in trend in there for sure. So I think that actually is a really positive one as we look at August, September. Thanks Bob. ","Bob Drbul","Thank you very much. ","Operator","And we will go to Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. ","Oliver Chen","Hi, thanks a lot. On the inventory side, you did mention that you were just a little bit over inventoried with respect to where you wanted to be. Which categories was that an issue in and that would be great, thanks.","A - Wes McDonald","I think the pockets where we are still working through some of the junior stuff, probably have a little too much inventory in kids and in Jeweler. Those are the areas that have been soft versus their plan. Obviously you miss a sales plan you got to work through the inventory and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. ","Kevin Mansell","I mean the other factor, and Wes talked about it I think in our earlier scripted comments is, we did make a decision a long time ago, six months or more that were going to accelerate our overseas imports flow, because we were concerned about ensuring that we had them and plenty of time for back-to-school. As you know as it turned out, port strike was settled, flow dramatically improved and so overseas import items I would say, generally private brand kind of merchandise. ","Wes McDonald","Yes, came in early.","Kevin Mansell","Came in early, and it wasn\u2019t really category related. It was across categories, because it\u2019s sort of all the same. ","Wes McDonald","The biggest investment we have in inventory remains our national brands. They are up, units are up double digits. So that\u2019s where the investment alluded to act. Obviously that\u2019s a lot of natural brand merchandise as well. ","Oliver Chen","All right, that\u2019s helpful. And Wes and Kevin, regarding the outlook for the category planning in light of the weather, I was just curious if there is distinctions you're making on a year-over-year basis. How are you thinking about outerwear? The picture for weather could be mixed. ","Kevin Mansell","Yes, outerwear we were really conservative. We all get the same forecast that you guys seem to get. So it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to be an extremely strong outwear season from a weather perspective. So we\u2019ve planned that down accordingly. ","Oliver Chen","Okay, great. And how are you guys feeling about skinny denim and crinkle Ts? I'm not sure if I got that?","Kevin Mansell","I\u2019ll get back to you on that Oliver.","Oliver Chen","Okay, thanks. Best regards. ","Kevin Mansell","Thanks.","Operator","And that will conclude the Q&A session for today\u2019s call. I\u2019ll turn it back to our presenters for any closing comments. ","Kevin Mansell","No, thank you very much.","Wes McDonald","Thanks very much. All right, take care.

Good morning and welcome to Kohl\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. As we closed out 2018, we spoke to you about the momentum we've had over the past two years and our optimism entering 2019. While we continue to remain excited about our strong pipeline of innovation and newness, we acknowledge that the year has started off slower than we'd like and we have adjustments under way to get us back on track.","The first quarter featured a lot of volatility with February being particularly tough. And while March and April trends did improve, they were below our expectation. This is reflected in our Q1 comparable sales decline of 3.4%. While we are disappointed in our sales performance, the team was agile and reacted appropriately by managing expenses, while continuing to invest in future growth. It's a highly competitive market and we've seen more aggressive pricing and promotions in categories like Home.","Looking ahead, we plan to be more aggressive in driving top line sales to regain our momentum and grow market share. As Bruce will discuss in more detail based on the soft start to the year, the adjustments we are making to be more competitive and higher cost due to tariff we are planning the year more conservatively.","We expect softness to continue into Q2 followed by a return to growth in the second half of the year, as we deliver on our strong pipeline of innovation. We are incredibly excited about the nationwide rollout of the Amazon Returns program, which we expect to be a significant traffic driver to our stores. And we also have several important brand launches as well as program expansions. We are confident that the combination of these initiatives will drive incremental sales in the second half of the year.","I'll now turn the call over to Bruce, who will provide details on our financial results. After Bruce's remarks, I will return to add more color on the business and update you on our key initiatives.","Bruce Besanko","Thanks, Michelle. The 3.4% comparable sales decline that Michelle just mentioned was driven by a combination of unfavorable weather, soft home category sales and less productive key promotional events. Weather was challenging during the quarter resulting in suppressed demand for our spring seasonal goods, which were down high single-digits; while in contrast all goods were up high single-digits.","Digital sales remained strong growing high single-digits, which was on top of the mid-teens percentage increase in the prior year. From a line of business perspective, Children's, Men's and Women's outperformed the company, while Home and footwear performed below the company average.","Geographically, the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions were the strongest followed by the Northeast. We attribute the relative strength in the Midwest to competitor store closures. Michelle will provide more color and comments on our sales results in her remarks.","Moving on to gross margin and inventory. Despite the softness in the quarter, gross margin was consistent with our expectation decreasing six basis points. First quarter margin reflects an unfavorable mix shift between spring and fall goods and higher penetration of digital sales resulting in increased cost to shipping.","Our inventory per store decreased 1% and our units decreased 2%. We continue to manage inventory at the omni-channel level and are benefiting from our key initiatives to strategically reduce inventory levels, such as standard to small, localization, choice count reduction and speed.","Given our Q1 results, we now expect a low single-digit percentage decrease in our inventory levels in dollars for 2019. Consistent with our expectations, SG&A increased 1.2% or $16 million to $1.3 billion. Our stores organization once again reacted to the dynamics of the business and did a good job managing their expenses. Marketing expenses were higher, as we continue to make investments to target market share gains over the long-term.","In addition, IT expenses increased due to the investments in the cloud and other technology initiatives to drive future efficiencies and growth. And lastly, as a reminder, we adopted the new lease accounting standard this quarter, which resulted in additional rent expense. Excluding the lease accounting impact, SG&A increased approximately 0.8%.","Depreciation expense of $230 million was $13 million lower than last year. The decrease was primarily due to the adoption of new lease accounting standard as well as the maturity of our store portfolio. Net interest expense was $19 million better for the quarter, due primarily to the benefits of last year's debt reductions and adoption of the new lease accounting standard.","Moving on to taxes, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 6.3% and excluding one-time charges was 14.3%, significantly lower than last year, driven primarily by a favorable state tax settlement.","Operational excellence continues to be a key priority for the organization. As we stated on our last quarter's call, our efforts have been successful in saving over $250 million in the past two years. As part of this continued priority, we incurred $49 million in charges in the first quarter related to the previously announced four stores closed in April.","On a GAAP basis, for the quarter, net income was $62 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.38. Excluding the non-recurring charges that I just mentioned for the quarter, net income was $98 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.61.","Looking at our store portfolio, we ended the quarter with 1,155 Kohl's stores. Gross footage was 99 million square feet and selling footage was 82 million square feet. We closed four stores in the quarter and plan on opening four smaller format stores later in the year.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $543 million of cash and cash equivalents. This was a decline from last year as strong cash flows from operations over the past year were used to repay debt, repurchase shares, and fund our dividend.","Our accounts payable to inventory decreased to 35.2%, primarily driven by a shift in receipts earlier in the quarter. It's important to note that the balance of our inventory remains healthy as our aged inventory continues to show improvement lower by double-digits to last year.","In addition the new lease accounting standard was adopted during the quarter resulted in a recording of $2.5 billion of right-to-use assets and $2.8 billion of lease liabilities for land and other operating leases on the balance sheet.","Moving on to capital management, capital expenditures were $238 million for the first quarter, $105 million higher than last year as a result of the investment in our sixth e-commerce fulfillment center. We continue to expect 2019 capital expenditures of approximately $850 million.","Weighted average diluted shares and shares outstanding at quarter end were 162 million and 163 million respectively. We repurchased 1.8 million shares of our stock during the quarter. And last week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.67 per common share. The dividend is payable on June 26 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 12.","As you saw in the release, we're lowering our annual adjusted earnings guidance to $5.15 to $5.45 per share. Our updated guidance incorporates our first quarter results, adjustments we're making to be more competitive, higher costs due to increased tariffs, and the benefit expected from the nationwide rollout of the Amazon Returns program.","And as a reminder for 2019, we currently expect the new lease accounting standard will increase diluted earnings per share by an estimated $0.05 consisting of an increase in SG&A expense of approximately $25 million or approximately 40 basis points, a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $25 million and a decrease in interest expense by approximately $10 million.","And so for the topline, we currently expect comp sales of flat to slightly down for the year, given the slower start to the year. We expect Q2 comps to remain soft, but show relative improvement to Q1. We're expecting growth to resume in the second half of the year, driven by an incremental lift in sales related to the Amazon returns program, along with program expansions and important brand launches such as Nine West and Scott Living.","As it relates to gross margin rate, we now expect it to be down 20 to 30 basis points for the year, with the second quarter modestly lagging the year. This is lower than our previous view due to two primary factors. First, our initial guidance for 2019 didn't include the tariffs at the 25% level. Our team is working hard to mitigate the impact of the tariffs, while we seek to remain competitive by putting our customers first.","And second, given the competitive environment, we plan to be more aggressive in our pricing and promotions to drive topline sales during the balance of the year. It's important to note that our merchandise margin continues to be at all-time highs. However, given the tariffs and our actions to drive the topline, it's becoming more difficult to offset the cost of shipping headwind.","SG&A expenses are now expected to increase 1.5% to 2.5% for the year, reflecting the incremental store labor and reverse logistic costs to support and process Amazon Returns. Depreciation expense will be $925 million and interest expense is expected to be $200 million. We believe our tax rate excluding one-time charges will now be at the lower end of the 24% to 25% range based on the better-than-expected first quarter tax rate. And lastly our guidance continues to assume share repurchases of $400 million to $500 million.","And now, I'll turn the call back to Michelle. She'll provide additional details on our results and an update on our key initiatives.","Michelle Gass","Thank you, Bruce. As I said in my opening remarks, the year has started off slower than we'd like. Our first quarter sales performance did not meet our expectations. As Bruce mentioned, the sales decline in the first quarter was driven by three things, unseasonable weather, soft business in our Home category and less productive key promotional events, all of which we are actively addressing.","Let me provide some additional perspective on each of these. First, as we indicated on last quarter's call, February sales were challenging. This persisted into March and was clearly visible in the disappointing performance in our spring seasonal goods. As the weather turned however, we did see an improvement in demand. And apparel sales in particular showed strength as the quarter regressed with combined March and April sales flat versus the prior year, validating that our core offering remains healthy.","Second, the sales performance of our Home category was below our expectations, a reversal of last year's Q1 trend when Home led the company. The sales decline was driven by an increasing level of competitive activity as well as a lack of newness compared to our offerings last year which we are addressing with several brand launches this year. These include, the fall Home the core launch of Scott Living at Kohl's; the expansion of Amazon-branded smart home products to over 600 stores; and the launch of a new exclusive line of soft home goods by Koolaburra by UGG.","The third factor that impacted Q1 sales was marketing. We see this as an area of opportunity as some of our key promotional events weren't as productive during the quarter with our customers. We are reexamining both spend level as well as media mix, as we progress through the year. While sales pressure has persisted into May, we are currently taking a number of actions to improve our performance and we are already seeing a benefit. Consistent with our focus on driving traffic, we are being more competitive in pricing and promotion to maintain our relevance with our customers. And as I'll speak to in a little bit, we also have a lot of newness coming in the second half of the year.","Beyond the three overarching factors I just spoke to you about, I'll now give you a little more color on the balance of our Q1 sales including ongoing areas of strength. Active continues to be a key growth driver for the company and during Q1 we achieved positive comp growth. Active apparel was strong growing mid-single digit with positive growth from Nike, Under Armour and Adidas, our three key national brands. Adidas sales in particular grew significantly in Q1.","During the quarter our athletics footwear lagged and we have plans in place to address. We continue to believe Active provides an opportunity for sales growth. In 2019, we will allocate additional space to the category increasing the in-store active expansion strategy to approximately 160 of our highest-performing asset stores.","Now some additional color on other lines of business. Children's led the company with solid growth in key brands including Jumping Beans and Carter's and in toys driven by LEGO. During the combined March and April period, we saw an acceleration in the Children's business to positive comp growth. We see this trend continuing in Q2 given the strong pipeline of licensed entertainment movie releases including; Avengers, Aladdin, Toy Story 4, Spider-Man and Lion King.","Men's outperformed the company as well led by key national brands such as Izod, Lee and Columbia and was also positive in the combined March and April period. Women's saw continued strength in Active and outperformed in key brands such as Apartment 9, Levis and So. This was offset by declines in seasonal goods and our classic business.","In footwear, we saw strength in dress casual across both men's and women's led by Clarks and Madden NYC. However, this was offset by a decline as I mentioned earlier in athletic footwear. Accessories sales were slightly below the company average driven by underperformance in jewelry. Beauty was positive for the quarter.","Next let me touch on our omni-channel strategies. Digital sales remained solid in Q1 growing high single-digit, which was on top of the mid-teens percent increase in the prior year. The solid results reflect the positive impact that our investments are having on customer engagement. Mobile again represented the majority of our traffic growth at over 75% of digital traffic and more than half of digital sales. And we saw higher adoption of both BOPUS and BOSS in the quarter allowing us to further leverage our stores as a key asset and differentiator.","We expect continued momentum in our digital channel as we deliver new innovation and expand our online assortment. As you may have seen yesterday, we announced a long-term partnership with Fanatics\u2019 to significantly broaden our fan gear assortment online beginning this fall. This has been a great business for us and we are looking forward to offering this dramatic expansion to our customers.","I will now transition to how we're going to regain our momentum during the balance of the year. We have always felt very confident in the back half of the year given our deep pipeline of newness and innovation, and that's only been amplified by the addition of the Amazon Returns program.","So, let me start there. The nationwide rollout of the Amazon Returns program is the single biggest initiative of the year. This July, all Kohl's stores around the country will begin accepting Amazon Returns. We and Amazon together, feel this is a highly complementary breakthrough program that will offer all of our customers a great experience.","We are incredibly excited about the potential of this program. It has been rigorously tested for the past 18 months in Chicago and Los Angeles, and more recently in Southeast Wisconsin. We have found the program to be highly successful in achieving our goals in creating a convenient and easy experience for both Kohl's and Amazon customers.","Our testing has shown that we are driving engagement with our existing customers and attracting new and younger customers. This gives us great confidence in rolling it out nationwide in time for our significant back-to-school launch, which begins in July.","There have been a number of questions on how the program is going to work so let me share some details. First of all, it's all about driving traffic. As you know, our top strategic priority is driving traffic, and this transformational program does just that. It drives customers into our stores, and we are expecting millions to benefit from this service.","Second, as you would expect, to support the customer service experience with Return, we will invest into additional staffing and in logistics to support the end-to-end returns process. And third, our expanded relationship with Amazon is structured in a way that both parties will benefit from driving long-term success of the program. As previously disclosed, we issued Amazon warrants as a testament to the strength of our partnership.","Beyond Amazon, as we look forward, we have other important initiatives underway. We plan to continue to drive our key growth levers, which include our active strategy, our speed-to-market initiative, the digital growth agenda, personalized marketing and loyalty, our rightsizing initiative and capitalizing on competitive store closures. And in addition to these, we have an extensive plan to deliver a constant flow of new brands and innovation to drive traffic and bring excitement to both our existing and new customers.","Let me highlight a few of these. First, we are really happy with the launch of EVRI, our new private label plus brand. The plus-size women's category represents a significant long-term opportunity for Kohl's, and we are attacking it from many angles. In addition to EVRI, we recently expanded our plus-size offerings in Nike this spring, further positioning Kohl's as the active and wellness destination for the entire family.","Next, as we've mentioned to you before, we will launch the iconic Nine West brand at Kohl\u2019s this fall with shoes, handbags and an exclusive line of apparel. We are also partnering this holiday with Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, where we will become the exclusive retailer of Elizabeth and James-branded apparel, handbags, and accessories.","And I'm excited to announce today that, this holiday we will be introducing a capsule collection designed by Jason Wu, a leading fashion designer. These are great examples of how we are bringing newness and fashion relevancy to the millions of women, who shop Kohl's. They also support our efforts to attract new customers and particularly millennials.","In the Home category, as I mentioned earlier, we are excited to bring in Scott Living, our partnership with the Property Brothers and soft home line by Koolaburra by UGG an extension of our successful footwear line with them.","And lastly, we continue to be committed to the beauty business, which remains a large opportunity for Kohl's. We have several new brands coming into stores and we're also expanding the pilot of our new beauty concept to 11 additional stores. As you can see, we have a very strong pipeline of initiatives that are firmly aligned to our top priority of driving traffic. In addition, we remain committed to our operational excellence initiative. Bruce spoke to the progress we've already made, and I can assure you this will be a significant focus as we look ahead.","In closing, I'd like to thank our amazing associates around the country that are committed to providing outstanding customer service every day and who are doing an incredible job delivering all of these exciting initiatives to our customers. And I would like to reiterate that despite our soft start, we are confident that the adjustments we are making and the initiatives we are delivering in the second half of the year will return this business to growth. We continue to operate from a position of strength and are delivering industry-leading innovation and newness that we believe will drive strong performance and shareholder value over the long-term.","We are happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first we'll go to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. So maybe just to break down the 440 basis points slowdown in comp relative to the fourth quarter, I guess what was the breakdown between transactions versus ticket in the quarter? Could you elaborate maybe just a little bit more on some of the competitive changes that you've seen in pricing and promotion? And then finally, what's the lift that you're assuming for Amazon in the back half of the year from a comp perspective? ","Bruce Besanko","I'll take the first and third questions Matt. So, on the third portion of the question on Amazon, we're not going into any of the details on the economics. But obviously we expect that there will be a good draw of traffic from the returns. And consequently, it's our expectation that we'll be able to translate that traffic into sales. We also have spoken just a second ago about the SG&A impact for the payroll on reverse logistics, but that's about all we're going to say in terms of the economics. But there is an expectation of obviously a sales draw.","On the first part you had asked about traffic. We had a good \u2013 we've had great momentum for the last two years in sales. Part of that was driven particularly last year by traffic benefits. Obviously, given the level of decline that we saw in the first quarter here you can assume that traffic was a challenge. But that's \u2013 we're not going to go into the breakdown of those components, but it's obviously that this was obviously it\u2019s a soft start to the year and we have a lot of work in front of us.","Michelle Gass","Yes. So and I\u2019ll build on that as well. So specific to Q1, I guess to elaborate a little bit on what we commented on. We really do attribute to three things. Number one was weather; second was Home; and third was our promotional activity. So on the weather front, and I think we've talked about for a long time that we do have a dependence to our seasonal business. And so we benefit when it's strong and sometimes we face the headwinds when it's unfavorable. And unfortunately Q1, I think you can relate to the fact that it was in many parts of the country it was unseasonably cold, and especially in the core areas where Kohl's has strength like in the Midwest and Northeast.","So that definitely had an impact and we saw that especially exaggerated in February. It did improve in March, April. And I think I mentioned in my commentary that actually our apparel business in March, April got to flat. But all together when you just take the quarter in aggregate, our spring goods were down high single-digits. Now in contrast our fall goods were actually up high single-digits. The practical reality there is the team is doing such a great job managing inventory. We came into Q1 really clean. So there wasn't a lot of fall goods to actually sell because we were on the down cycle on that.","So that definitely was a headwind. I view this as kind of a temporary thing. Obviously, as the weather picks up in Q2 and we've seen that already improved. So again, I think pointing to the strengths in our apparel business in March, April really highlights, there isn't a core systemic challenge there.","Moving over to Home and it is somewhat related to the pricing and promotions. But on the Home front as both Bruce and I commented, this was a very tough quarter for Home. Now you may recall Q1 of last year we had a phenomenal Home business. We had a lot of innovation, lot of newness. Things like Instant Pot were really on the upswing. It led the company and actually on a two-year stack basis, it's still one of the leading categories. But what we did see is we do monitor all the competitive activity, the pricing, et cetera and there were points in time during the quarter where we just weren't as competitive. And in hindsight we should have been a little sharper.","So hence as we move forward and as we're guiding, it\u2019s one of the components in the update to the margin, we recognize that we have to be more aggressive and hold our ground and protect and gain market share. This is an important category for us. So that was kind of the second piece and I feel very confident. I mentioned in my remarks that even as we've take action as recently as this past weekend on some of these brands, we did see that uptick in demand.","And then third point somewhat related is on our marketing activity. What I'd say is in the quarter where we had newness and innovation in our marketing activities, we really saw the lift. So as an example, we introduced a new promotion celebrating the anniversary of Kohl's Cash. So we kind of spiced that up a bit, gave our customers more Kohl's Cash. They responded.","Where we ran a very similar play and weather was unfavorable, so I'd point to the end of the quarter our Friends and Family event. We are also comping something really strong from last year. That was a headwind for us. So it's been forcing function for us to reexamine our marketing playbook. We are going to lean in. We'll do that very thoughtfully. But we do see an opportunity to revisit not only our spend, our media mix and just the calendar of promotions, but team has been harder work. I feel really good as we kind of around the bend finish this quarter and as we lean into the fall period.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just a follow-up, Bruce, given the competitive pricing and promotional changes that you're making, it just really seems like an offset to the inventory management initiative which was doing pretty decent job in mitigating the e-commerce pressure. I guess do you still believe in positive gross margin expansion multiyear? Or is it best not to think flat beyond this year as a result of some of these competitive changes?","Bruce Besanko","Yes. I'll refrain from commenting on any sort of long-term trends at this point with respect to margin. I can't tell you that we are absolutely committed to getting back the momentum in the business that we are all laser-focused on at this reset is the result of the disappointing start that we saw in Q1 and as Michelle mentioned, the expectation of some continued softness in Q2. We do expect the back half to be much more robust in part because of the Amazon rollout and because of the new brand launches that Michelle went through.","And in regards to gross margin, we're taking it down. There's -- the two drivers of margin right now are the increase in tariffs that we just didn't have baked into our outlook and the fact that we're going to be more aggressive in our pricing and promotional activity to go capture this market share that we think we deserve. And so best driver behind the 20 to 30 basis point decline.","I would also say, in the second quarter there's another -- there's some permanent markdowns we're going to take in beauty as we roll a new beauty brands. And so that will have an effect on the second quarter which is why it's going to lag a little bit in Q2 relative to this new guidance of down 20 to 30.","Matthew Boss","Great, best of luck.","Michelle Gass","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Bob Drbul","Hi, good morning. I guess Michelle, the first question I have is can you elaborate on the active? I guess you said active apparel was positive, but the footwear piece of it was a drag. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there from a trend perspective? And like you said you're increasing some more space. Is that going to be more apparel space? And I don't know if you could maybe elaborate a little bit more on I think you said these were doing well, but just the puts and the takes because that's been a pretty strong driver for you over the last few quarters and years.","Michelle Gass","Yes, great question Bob. We remain very enthusiastic about the active opportunity. I did mention we start with active apparel across all three brands. We had great strength across the board, Men's, Women's, Kids and Nike, Under Armour, Adidas. So the house continues to be there. And consistent with our strategy actually across the board both with apparel and footwear, we're planning a pretty significant expansion into 160 doors.","So the second part to your question, what's happening with footwear? We see this as a temporary issue, but we were kind of lapping some newness from some of our key brand partners like Nike and Under Armour, so we're a little softer in the first quarter. But there's been lots of plans underway for many months to introduce a lot of newness and freshness with our back-to-school launch.","And that's really where the business is very important as we really kick off this season. So the teams have been really hard at work with our key vendors. And I'm like I said confident as we head into the back half and for athletic in particular as we launch back-to-school because that's always a big key driver for us.","And then I think, I did already address, but yes our plans continue to drive the expansion. It's a significant growth opportunity for us in these 160 doors. We'll be expanding the footprint by about 25%. We tested this very rigorously in 30 of our doors. We saw great results. It was net incremental net positive to the entire store. So, it's clear to me that we have not yet fully satiated the appetite of our customers for active.","And then on the Adidas front, as you asked, that's been -- this has been on fire. I mean it's doing really well, highly committed team, really with all three of our partners and with Adidas as they look to invest and to create even more interesting engaging experiences in our stores. So, as an example, we're going to be growing today. We have about 75 launch pads. So, they're kind of shop-in-shop for Adidas can become launch pad, but like shop-in-shop and we're introducing another 100 of these launch pads across the country because they've been so successful and so productive.","So, the active story continues. Overall, even despite the footwear headwind, active did have a positive comp, really driven off of the success of apparel. And we expect both will be positive as we get to the back half of the year.","Bob Drbul","All right. And I guess my second question is around the lack of productivity in some of your promotional events. Do you think there's been a change in the consumer mindset over the last few months? And you called out some rising costs on the tariff stuff. I'm just curious if you could maybe address both of those and your ability to sort of mitigate some of these rising costs that you're seeing?","Michelle Gass","Yes, it's a great question Bob. I think we like everyone else are staying close to the consumer. All the indications continue to be really strong in terms of unemployment, customer confidence. Perhaps they've -- things like customer confidence have come off a little bit from being exceptional tailwind that we have last couple of years. But that being said, we do see the customer as healthy.","As we look at our soft start, we would point to either macro issues like weather which we are particularly susceptible to or some of the things that we're course correcting ourselves. And it's probably worth mentioning as well even on the marketing front, we are still acquiring new customers. So, that's been a key strategy for us. We saw that occur again into the first quarter.","Our opportunity is to drive even more trips and frequency across the Board and we've got our team here that is highly focused. We're testing some new things. But I think we're going to see an impact. I believe we're going to see an impact right in Q2 and surely for the back half.","Bruce Besanko","And then on your tariff-related question, let me just make a couple of comments Bob. So, we're obviously disappointed to see the increase in tariffs from 10% to 25%. Right now these tariffs primarily affect our China-sourced merchandise in our home and accessories business. Of course apparel and footwear at this point are not impacted. That home and accessory business for us is mainly national brands. China is not our largest source of merchandise, but it is a big one. It's a little over 20% of our goods.","We know though, and this is the important point, we know that our customers are driven by our value equation. And so we want to make sure that our pricing is right for the customers and for Kohl's. And so the actions that we're going to take going forward are to be sure that our customers receive that value and that they come into our stores. We're going to take a prudent approach in terms of modeling these tariffs which is what we've done so we can have maneuverability with respect to our pricing behaviors.","Michelle Gass","I'll just build on what Bruce is saying regarding the tariffs. I mean, it's fair to say, it's still a very fluid situation right now. Our teams are working very closely with our vendors to make sure that collectively we've got a strong plan. So that's been of the highest priority for our merchant leaders and merchant teams. But I think it's important for us wherever this nets out, we're looking at this from a long-term standpoint and we're looking to make sure that we can protect the customer and protect our market share. ","Bob Drbul","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thanks. Good morning. It seems like to offset the incremental SG&A that you guided to you need about 1.5 of comps from the Amazon initiative. How does that compare to the test results? And are you building in any kind of different performance based on the overall geography of the footprint versus the test market? ","Bruce Besanko","So that's a great question. Thanks for that Lorraine. So we're not going to share anything specific in terms of the details of what we've embedded in our assumptions for Amazon. We do expect that it'll be a contributor to the return to growth that we expect in the second half along with the brands and the expansions that Michelle talked about. The SG&A is obviously an increase.","That's the result of the processing and payroll that we expect. Here's the important concept here is we know that we will receive traffic from Amazon customers coming into our stores. We need to take that traffic and convert it into sales. And we've modeled some sales into the back half and we're pressing our teams to be sure that they do that efficiently and that they do it well. And we're going to -- this is our number one priority for the company and we're not going to -- we're going to make sure that we get everything we think we can. ","Michelle Gass","Yes. I'll let me build on that as well because it is as Bruce just said it is very top priority. It's a top priority to clearly maximize the benefit for both organizations right? We both have a lot to gain here in terms of the customer experience both Kohl's customers and Amazon customers. And I also think it's important that we do view this consistent on how we view all these initiatives as a long-term bet for us.","It is about driving traffic and sales in the immediate term. And we've studied this for 18 months so we feel confident about that. But I think what's really key and what our data would suggest is that we're also bringing in new customer and we're bringing in a younger customer. And so as we think about the long-term value that is significant.","So like I said we tested it for a long time. I feel very confident in the execution capabilities of our organization. That's something we're really strong on. And in terms of what the rollout looks like we learned a lot through the test. We've optimized. It's not an easy thing to do to get the whole end-to-end chain fully working and optimized on. But I think again given the sophistication of the team we were able to do this.","And frankly nobody else that we can look to has created this type of experience. But I think the thing to take away is we clearly there is some investment. We do expect immediate benefits as it relates to once we turn this on in July. But that is an important long-term strategic priority for the company to acquire new customers. ","Lorraine Hutchinson","And then you've been working a lot on speed. You have given the confidence in the softness. It sounds like you'll see in the second quarter how much can you adjust for 2Q and for the back half to make sure that the inventory is in good shape?","Michelle Gass","Yeah. It's a great question. Speed has been strategy and initiative for us for some time, and it is providing the benefits, some of which we spoke to earlier around inventory management coming into Q1. So, clean on our goods. We still even ended the quarter despite our soft sales being modestly down in inventory, but we're learning every day. So we're seeing what's working.","So brands like SO, as an example, which is one of our top brands on the Speed platform, actually posted a positive comp growth in the quarter, despite all the headwinds I talked about. Our Apartment 9, women's business did particularly well. And so, it does give us the agility to react and respond. And so, it's a key driver for us.","Overall, our speed brands, which in the quarter represented just north of 40% of our receipts, those brands and products collectively, did outperform the others. So, continues to be a key opportunity and we're driving it to react and respond to our business dynamics one way or the other, both as we chase into goods as we've seen that as well as course cracked where we have opportunities.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Bruce Besanko","Our inventory is clean, and we feel pretty good about it, especially as the weather will turn.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thanks.","Operator","Next we'll go to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Dana Telsey","Good morning.","Michelle Gass","Good morning, Dana.","Dana Telsey","As you think about -- hi, as you think about the promotional environment and the changes going on, are you cutting prices and layering in more promotions across the store? Or is it category-specific, like in the Home area for instance, in terms of what you're doing surgically? And as you think about Men's, the Beans category in the Women's category, what led to the strength in Men's greater than Women's? Thank you.","Michelle Gass","Sure. So, as it relates to your pricing and promotion question, what I would say is, it's definitely taking a surgical approach, and we said it a number of times. I think the Home category is kind of top of the pack on that one. The team learned a lot in Q1 in terms of where we were competitive or not competitive enough, so we are surgically addressing and that's already happening as we speak. So we expect that's going to help us regain our momentum in Q2 and beyond.","As it relates to more the promotional side of it, the benefit that we have through our very deep loyalty program in our private credit card is we have a lot of data. And we are able to understand what customers are responding to. And customers are evolving all the time and the dynamics around us are evolving all the time. So, I think given our -- the data we have, the analytical horsepower that we've built, the team is digging in and really seeing how we can further optimize.","So this is not a massive shift if you will. It's really about refinement and optimization, but we do believe with those refinements and optimizations that will just help us be better as we get through Q2 and then certainly look towards fall and the launch of back-to-school and then holiday.","Just on that too, I know Bruce and I are speaking very confidently on back half. We have a ton of initiatives. Amazon is a piece of it, but it's only amplifying the strength that we have with all the brand launches going into the back half. And two key holiday events in back-to-school and our holiday season, which traditionally are very strong for Kohl's.","So to your second question on Men's and Women's, the Men's business has continued to be a strength for us for a long time and Q1 was no exception. Beyond active, which again was a strength for Men's we saw a lot of strength in our Men's sportswear category. I think the team did a really nice job balancing their transition good balance of what we consider more transitional goods and spring goods and just continues to play on strength in brands that did well a couple, I think I mentioned in the script around the IZOD brand Columbia we were two standouts. Our proprietary brands also in Men's continue to perform.","On the Women's side, I'd say mixed results. We had strength in active. We had strength in our intimates business, one we don't talk a lot about a lot but that is a great business for Kohl's. We have very strong market share. We have great partners like PVH who continues to give us tremendous innovation on that front. So active and intimates performed well. Our modern business continues to be strong. Really, the outlier and we spoke about this in our last call has been our Classics business. There's a lot of focus on that business to get that back to the growth, but we're not there yet.","Dana Telsey","Thank you. Best of luck.","Operator","And next we'll go to Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark Altschwager","Good morning. Thank you. So just bigger picture on the guidance, I think the midpoint of your guidance implies about a high single-digit decline in operating income over the remainder of the year versus the prior outlook that implied the EBIT closer to flat over that period.","So you've made a number of comments on the drivers, but the wondering if you could just help us reconcile kind of order of magnitude why is the biggest changes were versus your prior outlook? How much of this is increased conservatism given the Q1 performance competitive backdrop tariffs or maybe just a guarded view on the contribution from the other traffic and operational excellence initiatives over the balance of the year?","Bruce Besanko","Sure, Mark. So let me first start that, we're absolutely committed to getting back the momentum in the business. We view these results as simply a speed bump and we intend to go past it and regain the momentum as we move forward through the rest of the year. The outlook reset, as I said before is the result of a disappointing start in Q1 with the expectation of some continued softness in Q2 on the top line.","And then, we have more confidence in terms of the second half driven by the brands, the expansions and of course the Amazon Returns. So overall, for the year then we're going to be flat to slightly down and I feel confident that we can deliver on that, and I don't have any worries.","In terms of the margin, we're going to make necessary changes to pricing and promotion. I talked about the tariff impact. We will navigate that. And so the consequence of all of that is down 20 to 30 in our margin rate for the year. Q2 has a little more of an effect given that we're also going to take some permanent markdowns in the beauty area given the new brands that we're rolling in. And so that's the story behind the margin.","And then on SG&A, I would tell you that the principal driver of SG&A right now is the Amazon rollout. We've increased that by about 50 basis points. And I would tell you that, we have a continued laser-like focus on our cost structure. Jill Timm is one of our executives, who's responsible for that and we're going to continue to drive forward on the operational excellence initiatives, and so I remain confident on the SG&A guidance.","And I just want to take a step back and say, the management team here, Michelle and I and the rest of the management team are absolutely committed to profitable growth for our company. And there's two words there. There's growth. You have to absolutely committed to growing and we're committed to growing profitably. We've done a good job over these past two years. We're not letting this speed bump in Q1 affect that and we're going on back and get our fair share of the market as we move forward in the rest of the year.","Mark Altschwager","Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up with respect to Amazon. Thinking through the timing of expenses versus sales, should this be pretty much in sync? Or any reason to think that the SG&A cost would build meaningfully ahead of the expected sales benefit?","Bruce Besanko","They should pretty much be the same. I might say that as we move into Q2, Q2 will be in the annual range in terms of our increase maybe a touch to the high side of that given our expectations on things. But just focus on OE I think is going to -- should play well for us for the rest of the year.","Mark Altschwager","Great. Thanks for all the detail.","Operator","Our next question is from Randy Konik with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Randal Konik","Yeah. Thanks a lot. I think Bruce you said that you had the Midwest was I think one of the best if not the best performing regions. And I think you attributed that to some competitive benefits as competitors closed. Just curious on if you could give us some perspective on how much better the Midwest was versus the balance of geographies? How much of that better outperformance was driven by competitor closures and\/or partially helped by the Amazon testing in Chicago? Just some any clarity around that will be very helpful.","Bruce Besanko","Sure. I'll start and then maybe Michelle can jump in with any added color. With respect to the geographic sales results, we did have a benefit in the Midwest. We believe it's attributable to the competitor store closures. We've seen that since call it the fall of last year.","We believe we're getting more than our fair share of these Bon-Ton closures and we expect that we'll continue to put marketing against those efforts. We did that in the first quarter. That was part of the reason that we had a slight uptick in our marketing expense for the quarter. So we're going to continue to go out and grab more than our fair share of those competitor store closures.","With respect to Amazon and the Amazon test there was -- the pilot was not large enough to have a material impact on the quarter. So I would not include that as an element of the geographic performance that we saw. It's mainly the -- we attribute it to the competitor store closures. And then of course, nationally we had really cold weather and precipitation which obviously was an offset as well.","Randal Konik","And I guess just to be a little bit more clear, is there -- can you just get the level of the outperformance in the region relative to the others? And I guess, while you're not giving guidance on how much of a lift you think Amazon can provide from a traffic perspective, I think what we're all curious on is at least from a historical perspective on the tests in let's say Chicago what times -- maybe give us a couple of examples of something that that you saw were these benefits we saw in Chicago that were different from the balance of the chain that didn't have the Amazon partnerships?","I guess that's what we're thirsting for. Just some perspective on what kinds of benefits we could see, obviously traffic -- but just give us a little bit of order of magnitude of what kind of changes you saw with the test and so forth. That's what we want to try to get some color on. Thanks.","Michelle Gass","Sure Randy. I'll take this one. So, first on the competitive store closures. I'll sort of reiterate that's been kind of an opportunity for us to capture market share. We have a lot of activity that is going after that business. So, marketing, of course, inventory working with our team brand partners. So, we feel good about the sustained benefit.","At any given point in time whether it's regional or a time during the quarter, there's a lot of variance and volatility because you have a lot of other contributing factors. But -- so it's actually difficult to give a specific number. But directionally, we do see -- directionally, we do see a lift. So, we're going to continue to drive that. It's not the biggest piece in the equation for us.","It's a notable piece, but the biggest piece for us is just how we execute against our key strategies. And I think you've heard us talk about the focus we have. I think Bruce alluded to the fact that we did hit a speed bump in Q1. There were some macro factors like weather. There are some of our own business issues and I'm confident in all the actions we're taking to address that.","Then as it relates to Amazon -- as it relates to the two test markets, especially L.A. and Chicago, we tested those for 18 months, so we have a lot of data. It was important for us and Amazon to feel really good about the results and the customer experience. And clearly we do feel really good because we're taking it across our stores.","I'd say the single biggest thing we saw and consistently across those markets and it was consistent and it was consistent across time was a pretty significant lift in traffic. Now, the bet for us is that some of that traffic converts over to sales and we did see that too. Given the proprietary nature of the relationship we don't share that, but one could assume that it was directionally positive on both traffic and sales in Chicago and L.A. hence we're rolling it out.","And it supports the investments that we're making in things like our in-store staffing and our logistics expense. So, the model works. It works for us it works for Amazon. And importantly its part of our long-term strategy to create a great experience once the customer comes in the door to drive loyalty with those either further loyalty with existing customers and importantly create a new relationship with a new customer.","Randal Konik","Understood. Thanks. Thanks guys.","Michelle Gass","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from Alexander Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alexander Walvis","Hey guys. Thanks very much for the question. I had a few questions on tariffs if I may. So, I just wanted to clarify on what's embedded in the guidance in terms of tariff. So, could you clarify that the incremental pressure on gross margin comes from the hike in tariff on existing tariff bulk goods from 10% to 25%?","Is there any details you can share on roughly how much of your assortment is currently affected? And then I wonder if you could share whether you're seeing any material differences in the impact of tariffs and the ability to mitigate tariffs for your private label goods versus third-party sourced products? Thank you.","Bruce Besanko","Yes. I'll hit the first part and then if Michelle wants to add anything that would be great. Obviously, again we're disappointed to see the increase in the tariffs. In the guidance, we've assumed that there would be an impact to the gross margin which is in part why we've reduced the outlook for margin from what we previously had to the down 20 to 30.","There are two components to that. One is this tariff increase and the second is to allow us to have pricing and promotional activity to get back to market share in the second quarter and then the second half of the year. So that's the basis. The tariff is a part of the gross margin rate change in our guidance. We know our customers are driven by value. And so we're going to make the necessary changes to price the promotion and drive that and we're not going to lose out as a consequence of pricing to competitors. We'll be surgical as Michelle said.","Michelle Gass","Yes. And I'll jump in as well. So just to clarify, in terms of what we've reflected is the increase from 10% to 25%, so the increase -- that increase wasn't contemplated when we first put out our guidance. And it's specific to the categories that are currently getting the 25% tariff. And for us that's largely in our Home and housewares category. That's the dominant component of it. And it's largely national brands.","So I think that's really important that it's houseware it's national brands. There are some other ancillary categories, but that's the biggest piece. We're working very diligently with our vendors. This is -- I think as we alluded to, it's a very fluid conversation. There's a lot happening in the marketplace. And so we're working as by the day type of thing.","But ultimately, we will do what's right for our business and importantly for our customers. And that's why we're saying really, really close and why we have built in -- we've built in the extra margin to make sure that we're prepared given where this goes and importantly that we can price and promote appropriately to be competitive. You mentioned just to close it out on the private label side. And again that's not today largely the contributor. This is a housewares and national brand story in our business.","Alexander Walvis","Great. Thanks so much for all the color there. And I guess one final follow-up would be, any update at this stage how you're thinking about potential impact. There is a broadening in the list of goods affected by tariffs and other any mitigation strategies under way there as well?","Michelle Gass","Yes. Obviously, we're all in this business paying close attention. What I will tell you is Kohl's has always had a very diversified supply base and that's been a strategy with been going harder at over the last couple of years. So I think from that standpoint, we're well positioned. But clearly if it's something more dramatic happens to other businesses like apparel, there's an impact to the industry. So we're staying really close to that.","Alexander Walvis","Thanks so much.","Michelle Gass","Great. Thank you.","Michelle Gass","Well, thanks everyone for listening on the call today. And we look forward to regaining our momentum on the business and talking to you in Q2.

Good morning and welcome to Kohl\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. We are pleased to report that our business strengthened as we progressed through the second quarter. Comparable sales were better than the first quarter and improved during the period turning positive during the last six weeks of the second quarter with a 1% growth. This positive trend has continued into August, driven by a successful start to the back-to-school season.","I am happy with how the entire organization operated with a clear sense of urgency in addressing the headwinds of the early part of the year. We managed expenses efficiently, which allowed us to be more competitive and provide increased value to our customers. A few of the key highlights of the quarter included an acceleration in digital sales growth, continued positive momentum in Active, and sequential improvement in our home business.","We are also pleased that apparel sales comped positively for the combined June and July period. We are off to a good start with the back-to-school season and are confident that our upcoming brand launches, program expansions, and increased traffic from the Amazon returns program will incrementally contribute to our performance during the balance of the year and beyond.","Now, I want to address the recent tariff news. We recognize there are uncertainties in the market given the impending tariff on apparel and footwear. We will approach our path forward thoughtfully with a focus on doing what\u2019s right, not only for our business, but also what\u2019s right for our customers over the long-term.","We know that our customers are driven by our value proposition so we will ensure that our customers continue to receive the value they expect from Kohl's. We have been executing against a sourcing diversification strategy for quite some time. And this year, our team has been working closely with our vendors to ensure that we are prepared for any potential tariff escalation.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Bruce who will provide details on our financial results. After Bruce's remarks, I will return to add more color on the business and update you on our key initiatives.","Bruce Besanko","Thanks, Michelle. Good morning, everyone. Comparable sales declined 2.9%, which was negatively impacted by weather. Unseasonably cool and wet weather beginning in May and persisting well into June suppressed demand for our Spring seasonal goods, which are important trip driver for Kohl's customers during this time of the year. As Michelle indicated, comparable sales progressively improved during the quarter, driven by a significant rebound in spring seasonal demand.","Digital sales accelerated to a mid-teens increase in Q2 from high-single-digit growth in Q1, which was on top of a similar mid-teens increase in the prior year. From a line of business perspective, accessories, children's, and men's outperformed the company while footwear, home and women\u2019s performed below the company average. Geographically the Northeast and Midwest regions were the strongest. Michelle will provide some additional comments on our sales results in her remarks.","Now moving on to gross margin and inventory. Second quarter gross margin decreased 72 basis points. Margins contracted more than we expected, driven by a higher penetration of digital sales, resulting in increased cost of shipping, as well as from pricing and promotional adjustments implemented during the period.","Our inventory dollars increased 2%. The increase was due to higher spring seasonal goods, due to the weaker sales and strong back-to-school receipt flow to support the current trend and anticipated growth. We now expect to end the year with approximately flat inventory dollars.","SG&A decreased favorably 0.2% or $3 million to $1.3 billion. Given the headwinds we faced early in the year, we efficiently managed our expenses across the business. Our stores organization did a great job managing payroll driving savings to our operational excellence initiatives, as well as reacting to the dynamics of the business, which more than offset wage rate pressures.","Our credit organization also did a great job managing expenses. Technology expenses declined mostly due to the significant increase in spending in last year's second quarter. We continue to prioritize technology investments and expect spending to be higher during the balance of the year.","Corporate expenses were also down in the quarter. Partially offsetting this favorability were higher marketing expenses as we continue to make investments to target market share gains over the long-term, as well as from additional rent expenses related to the new lease accounting standard.","Depreciation expense of $228 million was $13 million lower than last year. The decrease was due primarily to the maturity of our store portfolio, as well as the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, which essentially offsets the related higher SG&A expense. Net interest expense was $12 million better for the quarter, due primarily to the benefits of last year's debt reductions and adoption of the new lease accounting standard.","Moving on to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.3%, as compared to last year's 24.5%. Operational excellence continues to be a key priority for the organization, and we\u2019ve been successful in saving well over our target of $250 million during the past 2.5 years.","As part of this continued priority, we incurred $7 million in charges in the second quarter related to the closure of four Off\/Aisle locations and a voluntary role reduction program we conducted during the period. We\u2019ll continue to challenge ourselves to seek out efficiencies whenever possible in order to reinvest in the business.","On a GAAP basis for the quarter, net income was $241 million, and diluted earnings per share was $1.51. Excluding the nonrecurring charges that I just mentioned for the quarter, net income was $247 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.55.","Looking at our store portfolio, we ended the quarter with 1,155 Kohl's stores. Gross footage was 98 million square feet, and selling footage was 82 million square feet. We continue to plan on opening four smaller format stores later in the quarter. ","Now, turning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $625 million of cash and cash equivalents. This was a decline from last year, a strong cash flow from operations over the past year were used to repay debt in addition to funding our annual share repurchase program and dividend.","Our accounts payable to inventory decreased to 36.4%, primarily driven by the higher inventory previously mentioned. It\u2019s important to note that the balance of our inventory remains healthy and our aged inventory continues to decline year-on-year. On July 25, we successfully amended and extended our $1 billion revolver for an additional two years.","The amended agreement expires in 2024, which is one year after our next long-term debt maturity. The financial covenants and other terms in the amended agreement are generally consistent with our prior agreement.","Moving on to capital management. Capital expenditures were $439 million year-to-date, $127 million higher than the prior year, primarily as a result of the investment in our sixth e-commerce fulfilment center. We continue to expect 2019 capital expenditures of approximately $850 million. The weighted average diluted shares and shares outstanding at quarter-end were $159 million and $160 million, respectively. We repurchased 2.6 million shares of our stock during the quarter.","Last week our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.67 per common share. The dividend is payable on September 25 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 11. As you saw in the release, we\u2019re affirming our annual adjusted earnings guidance of $5.15 to $5.40 per share.","For the topline, we continue to expect comp sales of flat to slightly down for the year, which implies growth in the second half of the year. We progressively improved in Q2 and feel good about our second half, given the start to the third quarter, our upcoming brand launches, our program extensions, and increased traffic from the Amazon returns program.","As it relates to gross margin rate, we now expect it to be down 35 basis points to 45 basis points for the year, which reflects our first of performance and the estimated impact of the list for tariffs. For SG&A expenses, we now expect an increase of 1.5% to 2.0% for the year, of which approximately 40 basis points is related to the new leased accounting standard. The SG&A expense growth in the second half of the year is expected to be driven by store payroll investments to support anticipated sales growth, higher technology expenses, and the Amazon returns program.","And lastly, our guidance continues to assume share repurchases of $400 million to $500 million. Based on year-to-date share repurchases of $254 million, we now expect to be at the high-end of this range.","And now, I'll turn the call back to Michelle. She'll provide additional details on our results and an update on our key initiatives.","Michelle Gass","Thank you, Bruce. Let me touch on our Q2 performance, and then move into our initiatives planned for the balance of the year. On last quarter's call, we highlighted three factors impacting our Q1 performance; weather, home category sales, and less productive key promotional events. Bruce mentioned earlier that our spring seasonal performance accelerated during the quarter.","In addition, we saw benefits from the actions we took to improve both home category sales and the performance of key promotions. While home still underperformed the company average in Q2 it was much better than Q1. Improving sequentially each month as we implemented pricing and promotional action supported by more aggressive marketing through the quarter.","Kitchen electrics in particular benefited from these actions, returning to growth in Q2 after a very tough Q1. And as it relates to our key promotional events, we saw improved performance during the second quarter as we added new offers, sharpened our pricing, and invested more in media.","I'll now give you a little more color on our Q2 sales. Active continues to be a bright spot in our business, extending its long-running streak of positive comp growth. Active apparel remains solid with mid-single-digit growth driven by Nike, Under Armour, and Adidas are three key national brands. Active footwear improved relative to the first quarter and were encouraged by the trends in our back-to-school season.","Now, some additional details in our lines of business. Accessories led the company, driven by positive growth in beauty and fashion accessories. Children's once again outperformed the company, driven by growth in Active, licensed character Carter's, and in toys driven by LEGO. Men's continues to be a consistent performer and also outperformed the company in Q2 led by growth in Active, Big & Tall and key brands such as Izod, Colombia, Haggar, and our primary private brand Sonoma.","Turning to footwear, it performed slightly below the company average, driven by \u2013 primarily by weakness in our seasonal sandal business. Women's casual footwear performed well driven by Clarks, and we saw strong growth in other key brands, including Vans, Sketchers, and Adidas.","And lastly, our women's business had a tough start Q2, but finished strong as the top performing apparel category in July with positive low-single-digit comps. The tough start to the quarter was driven by underperforming spring seasonal goods, which penetrate higher in the women's business. ","The business strengthened as the quarter progressed, driven by active, swim, key national brands, including Levi's, Lee, Madden for Bali, and strengthen our private brand Sonoma, Apartment 9, and So. Of note, our accessories, children\u2019s, men's and women's businesses each had positive comps during the combined June and July period.","Next, let me touch on our omni-channel strategies. We\u2019re very pleased with the positive momentum we're seeing in our digital channel. Our investments in personalization, Your Price, Smart Cart, BOPUS, BOSS and the Kohl\u2019s mobile app have improved the overall customer experience and continue to drive positive customer engagement.","As Bruce noted in the second quarter, digital demand accelerated to mid-teens growth from high single digits in the second first quarter. Mobile continues to drive the majority of our digital traffic, with particularly strong growth from the Kohl's app. In fact, during the second quarter, our app visits and conversion grew at nearly double the rate of digital overall.","In addition, our efforts to increase our customer's adoption of BOPUS and BOSS are working. Combined BOPUS and BOSS in-store pickup is approaching 20% of all digital units. This is a key part of our overall omnichannel strategy getting customers to engage across stores and digital and to leverage the inventory of our stores.","During the second quarter, 40% of our digital orders were fulfilled by stores. I\u2019ll now transition to our strong pipeline of initiatives that we will deliver during the fall and holiday time period that give us confidence in our outlook for the balance of the year.","I'm going to start with providing an update on the Amazon returns program, which I'm sure everyone is eager to hear about. It is a very significant initiative of ours and a great example of our innovative spirit. Our unique partnership with Amazon leverages our collective strength. Our strong nationwide off-mile store footprint and best-in-class omnichannel capabilities and Amazon\u2019s expensive customer reach and world-class digital capabilities.","Importantly, it perfectly aligns with our top strategy of driving traffic. The overarching goal of this program is to convert the traffic that comes into our stores into loyal Kohl's shoppers over time. We completed the nationwide rollout on July 8. I want to thank all of our associates that supported this smooth rollout.","Our stores organization, in particular, did a great job managing the in-store set-up and training for more than 1,000 stores. While it\u2019s only been in place for six weeks, we\u2019re highly encouraged with the initial results. Traffic coming into our stores is meeting our expectations and skewing towards off peak times.","We are seeing a mixture of existing customers and new younger customers using the service. We began supporting the program in mid-July with a robust marketing plan, including print, digital, and national broadcast TV. We\u2019re focused on optimizing sales and driving conversion to ensure that we fully capitalize on the traffic coming into our stores.","To date, we\u2019re seeing conversion consistent with our pilot stores, and are particularly encouraged with how our customers are engaging with our proprietary brands. So, while it\u2019s early, we\u2019re pleased with the initial results and remain confident in our ability to drive the intended benefit of this program over the long-term. It\u2019s important to note that we expect the Amazon returns program to have a positive contribution to operating income in 2019.","Let me now move to the new exciting product initiatives that we have planned for the remainder of the year. First, we\u2019re off to a good start with the back-to-school season, which is our second largest selling season. We are showcasing our leadership position as a destination for Active and casual apparel and leaning into categories that families are focused on right now, and that Kohl's has a leading market position in, Denim, Active, footwear and backpack.","Earlier this month, we announced an exciting new partnership between country music star Brett Young, Levi\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s. We will also partner with Brett to launch an exclusive apparel collection called Caliville, which is inspired by Brett\u2019s California root.","Second, we are incredibly excited about next month launch of Nine West, an initiative we\u2019ve been talking about for the past year. Nine West is an iconic thought after brand that will be a great addition to our portfolio. It will further raise Kohl\u2019s relevancy as a fashion destination and we expect it to positively impact not only our footwear business, but also our women's apparel business.","The launch of Nine West footwear will be our largest ever in the dress casual category, and will position Kohl\u2019s with the largest ownership and footprint of the Nine West brand in the market. This is a key growth opportunity as we currently under index from a market share perspective in women's dress casual footwear.","We\u2019re also excited about the significant opportunity we have in introducing the Nine West brand into women's apparel. Designed in-house our Nine West collection will include an expanded wear to work offering and feature an elevated aesthetic and a more contemporary look, which we believe will attract new millennial customers into Kohl\u2019s, as well as engage our already loyal shoppers.","Our women's business was positive in June and July combined, and we are confident that Nine West will further strengthen our positioning headed into the fall and holiday time period and beyond.","Third, also supporting the women's business, this holiday we are partnering with Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen, as well as Jason Wu, each of whom are highly decorated fashion designers. In November, Kohl's will become the exclusive retailer of Elizabeth and James branded apparel, handbags and accessories.","Elizabeth and James, is yet another example of us introducing an aspirational brand that will elevate Kohl's positioning as a fashion destination, and we\u2019re excited to introduce this holiday a capital collection designed by Jason Wu featuring amazing dresses at incredible value.","Fourth, we also have important brand launches in our home category. In September, we\u2019ll introduce a new line of soft home goods by Koolaburra by UGG, as well as expand the distribution of Amazon branded smart electronics. And then in October, we\u2019ll introduce Scott Living at Kohl's, our collaboration with the property brothers Jonathan and Drew Scott, featuring an exclusive line of home decor, which fills an important whitespace opportunity and offering modern lifestyle products. We\u2019re highly optimistic that the collective contribution from these launches will further strengthen our home business for the balance of the year and beyond.","Now, I\u2019d like to give you some color on a new innovative platform called Curated by Kohl\u2019s, which will showcase emerging digitally native brand's starting in approximately 50 Kohl's stores and online beginning in October. We will begin by offering six brands and then rotate brands in and out to create a constant flow of newness and sense of discovery for current and new Kohl's customers.","We are in a unique position to support customers\u2019 curiosity for new brands and interesting products by leveraging our formidable store footprint far-reaching digital assets and large and loyal customer base. This platform is also a way for us to find, test, and gain important insight on emerging brands with long-term growth potential.","Facebook will help us bring Curated by Kohl\u2019s to live through social marketing efforts and they will also help identify brands that are creating a following on both their Facebook and Instagram platform.","Now, let me highlight some of our marketing initiatives. From a loyalty perspective, we recently expanded our Kohl's rewards pilot to an additional five market and now have it in a total of 13 markets covering approximately 175 stores. ","As a reminder, we are pursuing a strategy of simplifying our loyalty assets under one umbrella, which rewards anchored to Kohl's cash, a customer favorite and a key differentiator of ours. Our loyalty program has 30 million active members and we believe there is significant opportunity to improve customer acquisition and retention.","During the second phase of the pilot, we are simplifying the marketing around earning more Kohl's cash and deploying more targeted and personalized offers to members. We look forward to updating you on our loyalty progress later this year.","And lastly, I\u2019ll share with you some of our initiatives underway in both our stores and digital channels. From a digital perspective, this fall, we will begin testing a new site redesign to a small subset of our traffic with the objective of improving the overall customer experience in driving even better conversion.","Our new site will feature enhanced imagery, navigation, and filtering. It will also encourage more product discovery and inspiration, while maintaining our value messaging. We\u2019re also continuing to focus on driving BOPUS and BOSS penetration as I mentioned earlier, and we are investing in our sixth e-commerce fulfilment centers to support future digital growth.","Stores remain critical to our success and we continue to invest to elevate the overall experience. A big part of how customers are experiencing a modernized Kohl's is through the introduction of new brands and merchandising concept, and we\u2019ll continue to drive that forward. Active has been a centerpiece of our strategy, an important element of our growth over the past several years, and we expect this to continue.","We are currently in the process of allocating additional phase to the category, increasing the in-store active expansion strategy to approximately 160 of our highest performing Active stores. In addition, given our success with dedicated Adidas shop-in-shops, we are adding 100 Adidas shop-in-shops this fall, expanding the penetration to approximately 175 doors.","We continue to have great conviction that beauty represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for Kohl's as approximately 70% of our customers are female. We have several new beauty brands coming into stores this fall, such as Duncombe Fragrance; and clean beauty brands, such as Evolution 18 by Bobby Brown.","We remain on-track to expand the pilot of our new beauty concept to 12 locations in time for holiday. In addition, we\u2019ll be introducing a new beauty impulse concept where we will showcase 20 beauty products in 200 stores and online. And as it relates to our millennial focus, we are testing our outfit\/merchandising concepts in 50 stores and on Kohls.com. ","We have been pleased with the initial results and are evaluating the opportunity to expand the pilot in 2020. We will leverage insight from each of these tests, which can be applied to a broader set of stores. As it relates to our store optimization strategy, we continue to make progress against our rightsizing initiatives.","As we have discussed in prior earnings call, rightsizing serves two purposes. First, to improve store productivity to more efficient square footage utilization; and second, to drive traffic into our stores through complementary partnership. This year, we expect to right size 10 locations, including several Planet Fitness and Aldi locations.","Separately, our small-format strategy is showing promise, particularly in markets where there is a minimum store overlap. Through both of these strategies, we continue to see an opportunity to improve the productivity of our store footprint. So, as you\u2019ve heard, we have a very strong set of initiatives that we are executing against to position Kohl\u2019s for growth over the long-term.","We are also supporting these through our ongoing commitment to our operational excellence initiatives. Our progress on this front has been significant as Bruce discussed and it will remain a key focus as we look ahead. While the first half of the year did not meet our expectations, our business strengthened progressively during the second quarter and we have momentum in the back-to-school season.","We remain confident in our ability to drive growth during the balance of the year as we deliver a record amount of innovation and newness. We are committed to driving strong financial performance and shareholder value over the long-term.","In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our incredible associates around the country. Collectively, we are fostering a spirit of innovation here at Kohl's that will serve us well for many years to come. ","We\u2019re happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first we\u2019ll go to the line of Alexander Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alexander Walvis","Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the question. I wonder if I can just start by digging a little bit more into the gross margin. So, you had a decline of 70 basis points this quarter, I wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on the breakdown of that, and then perhaps help us with the shape of gross margin as we move through the year? I believe the guidance now down 35 basis points to 45 basis points from down 20 to 30 prior, what\u2019s driving the delta there for the full year? Thanks so much.","Michelle Gass","Yes, good morning. Michelle here. I\u2019ll take the question on margin. So, as we did speak to in our remarks, we did drop a little over 70 basis points in the second quarter. That was largely driven off of the higher penetration of our digital demand as we spoke to that accelerated from the first quarter. That, as well as our increased and pricing and promotional activity to defend our market share were really the key drivers.","As we look ahead, we do expect that our cost of shipping impact will normalize in the second half. While we expect our digital business to continue to perform at that level, we do anticipate that our stores business to improve, and we did see that in the back half of Q2. So, getting that mix more normalized will definitely help us get to the more typical values that we\u2019ve seen on the headwind from shipping.","I would say, in addition, as we referenced earlier, operational excellence is a key focus of the company and shipping in particular is a very big focus of our logistics organization. So, I\u2019m confident that we will be able to deliver against our outlook for the balance of the year based on both of those factors.","Bruce Besanko","And I\u2019d just jump in Alex and point out that the outlook for the back half is now down \u2013 well for the full-year is down 35 basis points to 45 basis points. And that reflects the performance from the first half of the year, which on a year-to-date basis for the first half was down about 41 basis points and the estimated impact from the List 4 tariffs that we\u2019ve talked about.","Alexander Walvis","That's great. And then perhaps just to follow-up on that comment on tariff, so \u2013 a question on tariff, so you gave some color upfront. So, thank you for that. I'm just wondering on the progress of negotiating with vendors, how constructive have those discussions been versus what you would have expected? You also mentioned that you want to continue to provide value to customers, will you still be able to explore price increases or is that unlikely in this environment?","Michelle Gass","Yes. Thanks Alex. So, as it relates to tariffs, first off, as we did say that\u2019s all embedded now in our balance of your outlook. I feel really good about how the organization has been addressing and managing through this. I really feel like we have a handle on it. I mean we\u2019ve had a focus on diversification for some time, and China, in terms of our exposure, has reduced over the last few years really driven off of our speed-to-market initiative, as well as our vendor consolidation issues.","I\u2019d say our partners, our vendors have really stepped up and everybody has been very well prepared to take this on, and I\u2019d say, we\u2019re all aligned to make sure that we can do whatever we can to protect the customer and our market share. While clearly this is still a fluid situation, like I said, I feel really good. First and foremost, we are ensuring that we can be competitive through the balance of the year and beyond. And to your specific question on pricing, I mean, we have lots of tools in place to monitor elasticity and what the competitive environment is. So, we\u2019ll make very sound and surgical decision as these issues come forward.","Bruce Besanko","I\u2019d just add too.","Alexander Walvis","Great, thanks so much.","Bruce Besanko","We did see an impact in the second quarter from the List 3 tariffs though it was small in comparison to the cost of shipping that we mentioned and that was similar in value to the \u2013 what we saw in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Bob Drbul","Hi, good morning. I guess, Michelle, you made a comment that the Active footwear business improved and you\u2019re encouraged by back-to-school. Can you talk a little bit about, you know, the drivers there, and what you're seeing on the active footwear side?","Michelle Gass","Yes. Absolutely. Thanks, Bob. So, we\u2019re \u2013 you know we\u2019re encouraged. As I mentioned earlier, our overall Active business continues to be strong. It\u2019s been positively comping now as you know for many quarters. So, we saw great acceleration in our Active apparel across all three brands, and across all lines of business. As it relates to our active footwear, we did see improvement in \u2013 versus Q1, a couple of notable brands, I\u2019d say, as Adidas absolutely and our Vans business is really, really strong.","The Nike business, which I believe we spoke to you on the last call, while it was challenged in the first quarter, it is improving. It improved in the second quarter, and I'm really optimistic as we look out through the balance of the year. They've got a lot of new innovations and new platforms coming, and they\u2019ve really prioritized our business, our category to make sure that they\u2019re driving the innovation. It's been a big focus for their organization and for ours.","Bob Drbul","Great. And then, just on the women's business, I think you talked a little bit about, you know, July getting better and some of your optimism, and I was just wondering if the outfit bar at Kohl\u2019s, you mentioned that in your comments, but the blush-hour trend, is that something that you think will really carry the business in the women's into the fall?","Michelle Gass","I appreciate that question, Bob. You know, color is definitely on trend right now. As we look out into the fall, whether it is blush, the brown family, animal prints, those are very popular in our outfit bar and you'll see them show up in a lot of our brands, especially contemporary and especially the new Nine West brand.","Bob Drbul","Great. Good luck, thank you very much.","Michelle Gass","Thank you, Bob.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Dana Telsey","Good morning, everyone. As you think about the home category, which is a bit challenging last quarter, how did \u2013 what did you see this quarter? And also, it looks like the accessories business really picked up this quarter as compared to last quarter. And lastly, can you give an update on shipping costs? How you\u2019re seeing that? Is that the main impact on the gross margin side? Or are there other factors we should notice? Thank you.","Michelle Gass","Thanks, Dana, for the question. I'll address your home and accessories question, and then, I'll hand it over to Bruce on the shipping costs side. So, we're very encouraged on home. As we had spoken early in the year, we had a tough start in the first quarter to home and it was pretty significantly behind the company. We\u2019ve closed part of that gap. So, as I mentioned in my remarks, while it was still one of the laggers in terms of their performance, it significantly improved, and I think especially as we look under the covers on the home business areas like kitchen electrics, luggage is another example; bedding did particularly well. And what we\u2019re seeing is the customer is really responding, especially as people do more search out there to more aggressive pricing.","So, we did invest there and we\u2019re seeing the results. You know, as we look forward, I'm encouraged to see this momentum go forward. We have a lot of newness coming. We have newness coming in our core categories even in things like kitchen electrics. We have our Amazon products expanding. And I think importantly, we have big new platforms that are launching, Koolaburra by UGG on the soft home side; the product\u2019s already hitting stores. And then, our partnership with the Property Brothers and Home D\u00e9cor, and I think importantly, these are really distinctive and differentiated to Kohl's.","So, very excited about these launches and I think it will strengthen the business in 2019 and beyond. And then, as it relates to accessories, our beauty business continues to be a growth driver, and we have a lot of new brands coming in the back half. So, I'm encouraged about that momentum continuing. We\u2019re also investing in the experience in beauty. We\u2019re adding more square footage across really all of our stores through in-aisle displays and that type of thing.","And then, we have 12 pilot stores that will be all operational by this fall. So, we\u2019ll get a good read during the holiday season. And then, our fashion accessories business is doing really well. And I\u2019d say of note there, sunglasses are actually doing quite well. We have new elevated products such as Ray-Ban that\u2019s been really resonating with our customers, as well as across the board. And then, just in general, a lot of the more typical fashion accessories wrap, scarves, that type of thing are doing well. So, a lot in newness there. And then, I\u2019ll hand it over to Bruce on shipping.","Bruce Besanko","Yes. And then, on the cost of shipping, Dana, so let me take a step back. So, gross margin declined to 72 basis points versus prior year that we said. There were three drivers to it, though by far the largest driver was the cost of shipping, though we also mentioned the pricing and promotional adjustments, you know, that we've made during the period. And then, there was a third piece, which was within merchandising where we did a really good job in terms of managing our promotional and permanent markdowns, but we also had the List 3 Tariffs that impacted it. But as you point out, by far the largest impact was the cost of shipping. That was driven by two factors.","The first was higher digital penetration based on the lower store performance in Q2. We expect that to normalize over time, driven by OE initiatives. And then, we expect that the store will \u2013 the store performance will improve over the back half driven by both Amazon and all the new brand launches that Michelle has talked about.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thanks. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the profitability of the sales you\u2019re seeing from Amazon returns, any puts and takes on the P&L that we need to be aware of as this rolls out more broadly?","Michelle Gass","So, Lorraine, yes. I\u2019ll start that and if Bruce has anything to add on profitability he can jump in here. So, I'll get to your specific question, but overall, as we did reflect in our remarks, we are really pleased with the overall launch of Amazon today. I also think it\u2019s probably worth mentioning that, you know, we\u2019ve been ramping up over the course of July. So, as we talk about the last six weeks being positive about a plus 1%, that trend started actually before we started ramping up in Amazon. But that being said, we\u2019re encouraged on how it\u2019s actually adding to the improved performance of the business.","So, we began the roll-out roughly early July with all stores online by July 8, and today, the expansion stores are mirroring the pilot stores. So, traffic is meeting our expectations; conversion is consistent with what we saw in the pilot; and we\u2019re seeing both existing customers and new and younger customers taking advantage of this new offering. You know, all-in as we talked about earlier this year, so the net impact of the traffic and sales we\u2019re getting, and then, considering the support that we\u2019re leveraging, so in terms of the support inside of our stores, reverse logistics, all of that is expected to be a positive EBIT contribution for 2019. So, we\u2019re early days, but we\u2019re highly encouraged, and we do see this as a profitable venture for the company.","Bruce Besanko","And in particular, there's two elements to the Amazon program from a cost perspective for us. The first is, increased payroll in the store to manage the returns, and then the second is the reverse logistics costs. In the second quarter, we obviously saw some of those costs incurred, and then, we also had some additional one-time expenses for training the store associates and so on. So, we do have our costs embedded for Amazon in the back half and that\u2019s included in our SG&A outlook.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. And then, I wanted to follow up on the comment that inventory would be flat by year-end, different from what you've been saying for a while about pulling back on inventory bias. Can you just expand a little bit on the change in strategy here?","Bruce Besanko","Yes. So, as I pointed out, inventory was up about 2% at cost; units were up about 1%, and all of that was driven by the higher spring seasonal goods due to the weaker sales, and then, the stronger back-to-school receipt flow that we saw as we moved into late July and early August. I actually feel quite good about the inventory, it remains healthy. Despite the late start, we did see that better sell-through.","I would say that there is nothing unusual about Q3 or Q4 in regards to the inventory, but I would just tell you, I feel good that we\u2019re not at the end of the road yet, there's still more room to go here and that's reflected, I think, in the outlook right now, which says essentially flat.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen","Hi, as we think ahead to holidays, the consumer has been changing a lot with shopping patterns and technology. What are your thoughts on how you\u2019ll approach holiday given also this \u2013 the calendar and the risk from the weather forecast that we\u2019re seeing? And our second question is just broader about your millennial and Gen Z approach to growth. Where do you see the most opportunities? Or how would you prioritize what you're doing in terms of ensuring that you\u2019re on track for captivating the younger customer? Thank you.","Michelle Gass","Right. Great questions, Oliver, thank you. So, first let me talk about how we\u2019re thinking about the back half of the year and holiday to your question. As we sit here today, I feel really confident going into the back half of the year, which does take us through the holiday time period. You know, why do I feel confident? Well, first of all, our recent trends; we\u2019re back in positive territory, so that's really encouraging. Our strategies are working that we put in place earlier this year in terms of adding fresh promotions, being more aggressive from a pricing standpoint, and back-to-school off to a great start. But I think importantly, as we look to the back half of the year, we have a ton of newness, record level of newness coming in.","So, a strategy that\u2019s been working for us for many years, our Active business. We have a lot of newness coming in from the brands, and we\u2019re expanding to 160 stores giving those stores upwards of plus 25% in square footage, which creates a lot of productivity, and importantly, brings an assortment that our customers are seeking. Secondly is the Nine West launch. We\u2019ve talked a lot about that, but that really does address whitespace for us in both the footwear side of things, as well as on the apparel for our female customers, which is 70% of our business.","We\u2019re excited about our home launches I mentioned earlier, Scott Living and Koolaburra and all the newness we have there. We have other fashion brands coming in such as Elizabeth and James and Jason Wu. And then, I think importantly, especially as we get to that holiday time period, it\u2019s a big entertainment year. So, there\u2019s a lot of new properties coming out. We have Frozen 2 coming out as an example. We did really well in the license out of the business, so I think that\u2019s going to really resonate. Next, I would say is, you know, we\u2019re ramping the Amazon Returns programs, so as we think about entering the holiday season, that should be driving new traffic and new customers into our Kohl's stores, and I think especially, you know, this is a key selling period for us and Kohl's shows up really well during the holidays, so I\u2019m excited to introduce a lot of new customers that are leveraging the Amazon Returns service and they are being introduced to Kohl's in some cases for the first time.","And then, the next, lastly, I\u2019d say, our digital growth momentum. You know, the investments that we\u2019re making are working, so investments in personalization, which has really ramped up; your price, which creates a greater price transparency and competitiveness; smartcard, which encourages, gives the Kohl's cash incentive to have our customers use buy online, pick up in store and get some inside the store and the Kohl's app is doing phenomenally well. So, I think all of those things will continue to drive digital engagement. And then, we also have expanded assortment happening online as well.","So, as an example, our Fanatics partnership, we\u2019re going to be expanding that tremendously this fall. And I also mentioned earlier in my remarks, we\u2019re going to start testing a new site redesign. So, you know, there's a lot here, and so, I think that just sets us up to continue the momentum right as we move into holiday. Then to your specific question, you know, holiday calendars shifting as it does every year, and I know there\u2019s been a lot of talk about the shorter time period between Black Friday and the holidays, but, you know, we\u2019re seeing these days as it\u2019s no longer just waiting for Black Friday that really begins early November, and we\u2019ve seen that in our business the last couple years. We've added events to kick-up our holiday right around that November 1 time period.","So, I think we\u2019re going to be really well set-up. The team has obviously have been planning for this for some time, and, you know, I believe we\u2019re set-up for good holiday. To your second question on the millennial audience and younger, obviously a very big focus for us. We have a lot of initiatives. I\u2019ve mentioned a few of them, things like the outfit bar. We are seeing encouraging early results both in-store and online. I\u2019d say online, we\u2019re particularly encouraged by the level of basket adding we\u2019re seeing as customers are engaging in their \u2013 finding the whole outfit, so they\u2019re adding to their basket, which is exciting. Beauty is a very big focus of ours and that also resonates with that younger audience.","So, as we continue to focus more there, we feel like it will address our core customer, but also go younger. How we\u2019re approaching media? So, a lot of our marketing activity these days, as you know, is digital and social media is a very big part of that and we\u2019re seeing greater and greater engagement. And then, lastly, I\u2019d just mentioned one of our newer announcements that is Curated by Kohl\u2019s platform, which is identifying these digitally native brands, working with Facebook and Instagram, and we all know that that's where the younger customer is engaging.","Oliver Chen","Thank you, Michelle. And just a follow-up regarding Curated by Kohl\u2019s, what will you look for in those brands, like what will be your filter and, you know, how will Facebook help inform, you know, what optimizes this for what your new and existing customers may prefer? And which part of the store will this be in, and what might you take away to put this footprint into the stores?","Michelle Gass ","Yes. So, it's a great question. You know, our team has been working on this for the last several months, and it's really been a process of, you know, evaluating these new concepts, how unique and distinctive they are to Kohl's and to the marketplace, and there\u2019s going to be a lot of testing and iterating. You know we\u2019re starting with these first six brands, we\u2019re going to learn a lot, but the team does have a scorecard on evaluating, first of all, what brands are going to come in, and they range everything from apparel products to beauty products to greeting cards, the list goes on, but really going to the filter, really what\u2019s innovative distinctive, what potentially can drive traffic both online into our stores and create that newness and innovation that we\u2019re looking for to create a halo for the brand in the company. ","And so, there\u2019s an initial scorecard in terms of what we initially launch with, and then, the team will evaluate the kind of sell-through and engagement we\u2019re getting with our customers and decide what if any of these brands do go to more stores and maybe have a permanent place. In terms of how it will be supported in the store, we've created distinctive fixturing that will live inside the store and we have a range of things we\u2019re going be testing to a shop-and-shop type concept where they\u2019re all collectively together to also testing where those products are more lined up and akin to their core merchandising areas. So, we\u2019re really excited about this. This is a whole new avenue for Kohl's and I think it\u2019s going to yield some great learnings and some great business for us.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards.","Michelle Gass","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark Altschwager","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Michelle Gass","Good morning. ","Mark Altschwager","First, with respect to the comps when you indicated that the positive trend continued into August, can you confirm if the comps in August are better than the 1% growth rate you cited for the end of Q2, and also just any commentary on whether the traffic has turned positive?","Michelle Gass","So, Mark, thanks for the question. You know, we\u2019re not going to comment necessarily on precisely what we\u2019re seeing here in August, but suffice it to say, we\u2019re seeing the positive momentum continue and that's largely driven off of the things that really helped us in the back half of the quarter. So, our seasonal business improving, the Amazon Returns ramping up, and really importantly, our back-to-school business accelerating, which is a key selling period for the company and we\u2019re encouraged by platforms like our denim business, and of course, our active business and even categories like backpacks. So \u2013 yes, so we\u2019re really encouraged.","Bruce Besanko","I\u2019d just add it. We were neither better nor worse than what we saw in the last six weeks as we moved into August, Mark.","Mark Altschwager","Okay, okay. Thank you. And then a quick follow-up on tariffs, I mean it sounds like there are a number of pieces on the gross margin for the back half, can you isolate the gross margin impact from tariffs specifically? And then, just giving the timing of tariffs, should we be expecting more pressure on gross margin in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter?","Bruce Besanko","On the second part of that question, Mark, are you asking about say The List 4B Tariffs that are happening in December, is that what you mean by that last part of the question?","Mark Altschwager","I just mean given that the tariffs are starting to hit in September and then in December, I\u2019m wondering if those are going to be cumulatively a greater pressure on the fourth quarter gross margin versus the third quarter gross margin.","Bruce Besanko","Yes, got you. Okay. So, we do have embedded in the outlook what we believe is both the impact from the List 4 Tariffs that are occurring in September, as well as in December and both on the national brands and on our private and proprietary brands. We saw the effects in both Q1 and Q2, we\u2019ll see these impacts in Q3 and Q4. But we do have it embedded in our guidance right now, and I don't really want to go into the details of, you know, the precise numbers, but we do feel like we've got a pretty good handle on what the impacts will be in the back half.","Mark Altschwager","Okay, thanks. And then, just finally, the Curated by Kohl\u2019s, really sounds like an exciting initiative. I was hoping you could talk about the strategy to build awareness around that, just given your vast customer data and the partnership with Facebook it would seem you could do some innovative things on that front, so just curious if you could talk about that and maybe discuss how this brand launch or how this launch is going to differ from others that you\u2019ve done in the past?","Michelle Gass","Thanks, Mark. Well, I think you\u2019ve hit on it. This is a really unique partnership in particular with Facebook and Instagram, their properties, and so, first and foremost, the marketing will be largely driven digitally, and then, in particular through social and that's where a lot of these brands are both birthed and marketed. So, we\u2019ll of course leverage our own assets. So, we have, you know, 35 plus million people that we engage with on things like e-mail. We have personalization capabilities, so we\u2019ll take advantage to that, and we\u2019ll leverage all of our channels, but this is an exciting \u2013 as you said, an exciting experiment and launch for us, so we\u2019re really looking forward to see how the customer responds, but I'm pretty confident it's going to work and you\u2019ll see this as a new platform for the company.","Mark Altschwager","Thank you. Best of luck.","Michelle Gass","Great, thanks, Mark.","Operator","Our last question will come from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.","Chuck Grom","Hi, thanks and good morning, guys. Sorry, I just hopped on, just wonder if you guys could just talk about the improvement in the business from the front half of the quarter to the back half if you can sort of extrapolate or unpack how much of it was the weather breaking versus Amazon starting to contribute?","Michelle Gass","Great. Thanks, Chuck, for the question. So, to your point, we did see the business trend significantly change and accelerate in the last six weeks of the quarter. I\u2019d say the first thing that took place was the acceleration of our seasonal goods. So, yes, weather had a lot to do with that just like it was a headwind in the first part of the quarter. So, we saw that take place even before we started the Amazon Return. And what I would say is, given the pent-up demand, the team really rallied to lean into those categories, so we added and layered on fresh promotions to take advantage of the tailwind. So, that was the biggest thing that shifted that trend. And then, in early July, we began to ramp our Amazon Returns program. ","So, we\u2019re excited about the potential of that. We\u2019re seeing the results consistent with the pilot in terms of the level of traffic we\u2019re getting and the level of conversion, and we believe that it\u2019s going to be a real advantage for us going into the back half of the year. And then the last piece I would add is, you know, at the end of Q2, we were benefiting from a strong launch of our back-to-school season, so categories like denim and active in particular and footwear, which Kohl's is truly a destination for those businesses, really began to accelerate as our back-to-school promotion kicked in.","Chuck Grom ","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, just on the home category, I know it improved throughout the quarter. There\u2019s been a lot of retailers that have called it out being strong, and then, there\u2019s been a number who have called it out being softer. So, you know, your business in home definitely gets bigger in the fourth quarter, so just curious like what you\u2019re thinking about in the home business? What you have going for you, and what potential could be a headwind?","Michelle Gass","Great. So, I would say two things. One, first, we have to maintain our competitive position in home, especially in categories like kitchen electrics, which is highly competitive and we saw that intensify in the first half of the year. So, we\u2019re keeping our foot on the gas on that as we head into the back half of the year. But I think importantly, we\u2019ve got to be a destination for unique and distinctive categories and items that people can only find at Kohl\u2019s, and that\u2019s been a focus for us for sometime and the teams have been working on launches now for many months on a couple, in particular Koolaburra by UGG, which really plays to a strength of ours in the soft home category. That\u2019s a very big launch for us kicking off as we speak.","And then our Home D\u00e9cor line exclusive with Kohl's between us and the Property Brothers, again, it is a very large line and an area arguably I\u2019d say we\u2019re under penetrated in and the product is fantastic. So, I think both of those two, as well as the innovation driving in the core business and kitchen electrics expanded Amazon Smart Home really gives us a full suite of newness as we head into the back half of the year and especially for holiday.","Chuck Grom","That\u2019s very helpful. And the last question, your inventory levels were up a little bit relative to the recent trend of being down, just a few point, if you could speak to the currency, how you guys are feeling about it, and when you look ahead to the third quarter do you think about brining in more to get ahead of potential increases in tariffs? Thanks.","Bruce Besanko","Yes, thanks Chuck. We feel good about \u2013 I feel personally good about the inventory level. It remains healthy despite the late start to the season as we talked about. We saw a better sell-through in the last six weeks. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re are at the end of the road on the inventory. We continue to have optimism on the four primary drivers that have delivered on inventory reductions over the past many quarters, which include our standard to small initiative. The choice count reduction, our speed initiative and localization. So, I think those things will continue to operate well. The teams do a great job managing marked down activity and so all of that I think will \u2013 gives me confidence that the inventory levels will be flat for the year and I think we\u2019ll have more room on next year.","Chuck Grom","Great. Thanks, and good luck.","Operator","Ms. Gass, I\u2019ll turn it back to you for any closing comments.","Michelle Gass","Well, just thank you to everyone listening on the call today, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in November.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I now like to turn the conference call over our host, Mr. Bruce Besanko, Chief Financial Officer of Kohl\u2019s Department Stores. Please go ahead.","Bruce Besanko","Thank you, Tony. Good morning. With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President. I\u2019ll start today\u2019s call by walking through our third quarter performance. Kevin will provide more details on our results and operational priorities. We\u2019ll then open up the call to your questions.","So starting with sales, comp sales were positive for the quarter, up 0.1% as we continue to build on the sales momentum we saw in the second quarter. The comp improvement was again generated by improved traffic trends. Though still negative for the quarter, were encouraged by the sequential improvement in traffic we saw throughout the quarter. Average transaction value increased for the quarter, driven by a strong increase in average unit retail, which was partially offset by a decrease in units per transaction.","Like most retailers, our third quarter comps were negatively impacted by the hurricanes, which resulted in the temporary closure of more than 100 of our stores. We estimated we lost approximately $15 million in sales and approximately 35 basis points to our comp sales, while the stores were closed.","From a line of business perspective, our footwear home, men\u2019s and children\u2019s businesses, reported positive comps. Footwear was especially strong, driven by athletic and kids use. Our accessories and women\u2019s businesses were challenging. We also saw strength across most of the country with the South Central, Southeast, Midwest and West, all reporting positive comps. The mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions underperformed the Company average. Kevin will provide more details on our sales result in a few minutes.","Our gross margin rate decreased 30 basis points for the quarter. The positive impacts of less clearance markdown levels were more than offset by higher shipping cost due to growth in our online business and higher reserves, such as loyalty rewards and sales return adjustments, which primarily resulted from the strong sales in late October. SG&A increased by $15 million for the quarter to $1.1 billion. Approximately $8 million of the increase was attributable to hurricanes Harvey and Irma.","While the hurricanes during the quarter created a temporary impact on our business operations as it did for most retailers, we made the deliberate decision to absorb some financial impact as we took several additional steps to support our associates, our customers and our communities in the aftermath of the storms. We believe this was the right way for our business to respond to these significant natural disasters. And we believe decisions like this will help ensure we maintain our strong corporate reputations in the communities we serve.","As a percent of sales, SG&A deleveraged 33 basis points. Our stores teams did a fantastic job managing store expenses, especially payroll in line with the sales trends. Marketing expenses also leveraged. We saw pressure in IT expenses as we migrate to the cloud and invest in digital and holiday capacity. Logistics cost deleveraged as a result of opening our fifth e-commerce facility in the third quarter. Credit deleveraged as we waive fees for customers impacted by the hurricanes.","Depreciation expense was $243 million for the quarter, up $11 million over last year\u2019s third quarter. The increase was driven by higher IT depreciation. Interest expense decreased $2 million for the quarter. Most of the decrease was due to lower interest on capitalized leases as the store portfolio matures. Higher earnings on our investments also contributed to the increase. Our income tax rate was 36.1% for the quarter, an increase of approximately 110 basis points over the last year.","The increase was primarily due to favorable audit settlements that we had in 2016, but did not have in 2017. And so for the quarter, net income was $117 million. Diluted earnings per share were $0.70.","Transitioning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $736 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $139 million. The increase is the result of lower share repurchases and lower AP payments. Inventory per store decreased 2% and units per store decreased 4%, consistent with our expectations for a low to mid single-digit decrease for the year. Our AP to inventory ratio increased 120 basis points to 45.6%, reflecting the positive impact of our continued emphasis on inventory management.","On November 3rd, we successfully amended and extended our $1 billion revolver for an additional two years. The amended agreement expires in 2022, which is one year after our next long-term debt maturity. The fees, financial covenants and other terms of the amended agreement are generally consistent with our prior agreement.","Moving on to capital management. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $547 million, $44 million lower than last year. The decrease reflects the net impact of lower new store and higher IT spending. We repurchased 1 million shares of our stock during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 7.3 million shares. Weighted average diluted shares for the quarter were 166 million. As of quarter-end, we had 168 million shares outstanding.","On Wednesday, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share. The dividend is payable on December 20th to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 6th.","Based on our year-to-date results, as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter, we\u2019re narrowing our range on earnings per share by increasing the lower end of our prior guidance. Our new adjusted EBITDA EPS guidance range is now $3.60 to $3.80. In addition, we're expecting the benefit from a tax settlement in the fourth quarter. The tax benefit is result of a state tax settlement dating back several years. We expect to receive a pre-tax benefit of $30 million, which will run through our tax rate, and results in a $0.12 EPS benefit. Including this tax benefit, we expect earnings per share to be $3.72 to $3.92 for the year.","And now, I'll turn the call back to Kevin who will provide additional details on our results for the quarter and update on our key initiatives. Kevin?","Kevin Mansell","Thanks, Bruce. Let me start with a few comments on the overall results for the quarter, and then I'll provide more color and the progress we're making around each of our key pillars and the Greatness Agenda. Most importantly, we returned to a positive comp increase in the third quarter and we continued the steady improvement in sales results we've seen all year.","As you know, driving traffic is one of the two key priorities for our company. And as Bruce shared, there was sequential improvement again in our store traffic metrics and this increase in traffic was the driver of our improved sales performance. From a timing perspective in the quarter, we had a strong back-to-school selling season with sales from the beginning of August through Labor Day, up low single-digit. This was driven by particularly strong performance in kids and footwear, and continued strength in Activewear.","The rest of the September sales period was weak, affected substantially by the impact of hurricanes in some of our regions and unseasonably warm weather throughout almost all of our regions. Sales turned positive again in October, driven by particular strength in the back half of the month.","Regular price sales for the quarter were up 1%, while clearance sales were down 7%. This was driven by lower levels of clearance inventory. On an overall basis, a portion of our improvement in our sales trend is attributable to our targeted efforts to capture share from competitive store closures in some of our trade areas. And we expect this will continue, if not accelerate, through the holiday seasons.","From a category standpoint, the positive comp performance was broad-based with nearly all categories improving their sales trends. Men\u2019s, footwear, kids in home, all reported positive comp increases in the quarter. Our core women\u2019s business was negative, but we did see continuing improvement in the trend, particularly in our private brands. The accessories category continued to lag the company was down mid single-digit.","Looking at our progress on our individual key pillars, on the product front, our active business increased almost 20% for the quarter, an acceleration of the year-to-date trend. Both apparel and footwear categories in Active were strong and this was driven by large increases in both Nike and Adidas, as well as continued strong performance from Under Armour. We continue to gain market share in Active and we expect the very strong holiday performance in both Active apparel and footwear categories.","Our national brand penetration rose to 56% for the quarter, up 300 basis points. This was driven primarily by the Active growth, but we also had growth in several other important national brands, including Levi\u2019s, Carter's, Van Heusen, Tag Heuer, Columbia and Fitbit. We also launched the Clarks footwear brand to further expand our footwear offering.","Our private brand performance saw significant improvement and substantially all brands reported improve trends. This was driven by the growing impact of our speed to market efforts and improved performance of our Jumping Beans children\u2019s brand at back-to-school and the re-launch of our Apartment 9 brand. Our exclusive brand performance continued to lag the total, but that\u2019s primarily result the paring down of brands and categories in that area of the business.","Two of our most important exclusive brands, Vera Wang and Lauren Conrad, grew by double-digits for both the quarter and year-to-date. In our efforts to provide a seamless and easy experience, we continue to make great progress in delivering the best in class omnichannel experience. Online generated demand sales grew 15% for the quarter and we continued to grow the percentage of those online orders that are fulfilled by stores. Stores fulfilled 30% of the total units for the quarter with both Opus and ship from store growing significantly compared to last year.","Productivity metrics improved again, resulting in lower cost of shipping and fulfillment as a percent of total digital sales, which aided profitability. We also opened our 5th DFC, which we expect to contribute significantly to our ability to grow our business and improve efficiency, beginning next year. Improved experiences in our mobile applications increased digital conversion at a low double-digit rate and mobile accounted for 67% of our traffic in the quarter.","In the area of personalization and savings, we continue to enhance our capability in using data and analytics to drive our marketing, digital and personalization efforts. In the quarter, we increased our level of personalization and key marketing events, as well as leveraged our new insight based pricing tools to deliver new promotional events that are resonating with our customers. We completed the rollout of Your Price during the third quarter. Your Price shows the personalized price of individual items based on the customer specific offers and provides immediate visibility to the value of those customers receive at Kohl's.","Our personalized search initiative makes it easier for customers to find what they\u2019re looking for based on shopping preferences from previous online and in-store purchases. And finally, our smartcard application continues to provide customers an opportunity to save more by choosing to pick-up in-store versus ship-to-home on their online orders.","During our second quarter earnings call, I mentioned that we would pilot a further evolution of our loyalty program next year. Our royalty program includes the Kohl's Charge, Yes2You Rewards and Kohl's Cash Elements. The objective of the pilot is to simplify the program, broaden the reach and provide even more rewards to users in a program that already is best-in-class. With over 30 million unique customers utilizing at least one of the elements of our loyalty program, we believe this next evolution has great opportunity to drive a step change in traffic and sales. The timing of the pilot has now been set for the second quarter of next year and approximately 100 stores will participate. We would then include the learning from this pilot in an expected companywide roll out intended for fiscal 2019.","Finally, in the area of store optimization. We continue to make progress in amplifying the role and the relevancy of our physical stores across a number of fronts. Success many of these efforts has built further conviction and the importance of our physical stores and our long-term success. First, we opened four new 35,000 square foot stores in dense trade areas in the third quarter, and the openings were extremely successful. We now have 12 of these stores across the country in both secondary and major markets. Beyond the potential for growth these stores provide us, they importantly provide us insights into how we can operate our other stores more effectively in the future.","Second, our standard to small store strategy continues to drive lower inventory levels and is resulting in improved profitability in over 300 of our stores. As Bruce indicated, inventory per store at the end of the third quarter was down low single-digits and is expected to be down mid single-digits at the end of the year. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of lower inventory per store. And on two years stack basis, our inventories are down in the low teens. More importantly, we still believe we have the ability for future multi-year contraction in our average inventory per store. Obviously, there\u2019s significant positive implication for improving our work getting capital and our cash flow metrics.","Third, in the last quarter, we continued to refine the opportunity on rightsizing some of our lower volume full size stores with new tenants base being developed as a result. You should expect to hear further developments on this effort in the fourth quarter call as we expand this. We also continue to test and iterate our future store experience through our Your Store initiative, and we\u2019ll share more details on this initiative on the fourth quarter call as well.","Finally, there have been a number of questions regarding the test of Amazon smart home experiences in 10 of our stores, and Amazon returns at goals in maybe two of our stores. I\u2019m pleased to say that both test launched successfully in mid-October in select stores in the Chicago and the Los Angeles markets. At this time, we won\u2019t share any other details in the test, beyond the store location. And while this contained previously on our press release in the subject. But the objective from our perspective is very simple and very straight forward. We believe both of these tests have the potential to drive incremental traffic to our stores, which as you know, is our number one priority.","In summary, the third quarter showed continued improvement in our financial results. We are on track to achieve the goals we established with investors at the beginning of the year. Just as importantly, the results further reinforce to us that are two key priorities of the right ones. On the number one priority of driving traffic, we feel we\u2019re very well positioned for the fourth quarter with lien and well balanced inventories, compelling products, more fully developed personalization tactics in place and a strong digital business trend going into a period when online demand is at the highest penetration of the year.","On our other priory of operational excellence, we have made additional investments to support our long-term omnichannel strategy. These include moves like building out our fulfillment infrastructure, moving much of our technology to the cloud and launching new applications to make the customer experience easier. At the same time, we\u2019re innovating with new smaller store concepts, rightsizing some of our stores with other retailers and piloting concepts like our initiative with Amazon. In spite of these investments, we remain on track to reach or exceed our goal of $250 million in expense savings over the next three years. Managing operations has always been strength for us and we believe we can continue to build further on that.","And with that, Bruce and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark Altschwager","I wanted to dig into the gross margin a bit. First on the quarter, one of your competitors was aggressively clearing to apparel inventory. Just wondering to what extent the competitive environment wait more in your merchandizing margin than anticipated, and did any quantification on other factors like the inbound freight, outbound shipping AUC. And then looking into the fourth quarter, comparison is a bit tougher here, clearly the environment remains promotional. Maybe just walk through some of the benefits you\u2019re baking in, whether its e-commerce efficiencies, speed initiatives that give you some line of sight into that gross margin line? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell","As it relates to the competitive activity, now competitive activity had no impact at all on our margin. From s margin perspective, as Bruce indicated in the call, gross margin obviously decreased and that was a function of certainly higher shipping cost due to the growth that we had online, that's not new. But also various reserves required simply because of when the timing of sales came, we had a lot of sales late in October that I think were probably driven by pent up demand during the weak September sales period.","Merchandize margin actually improved in the quarter and that was not a surprise to us. We had expected that. So in terms of just managing our business, managing the mix of our business, managing our inventory levels that's really, for the most part, all good news from our perspective.","Looking into the fourth quarter, I think you can probably tell from how we\u2019re describing our business trends that we\u2019re very confident about what's in front of us. Our inventories are very lien. They were really well positioned. We had an very strong trend in the third quarter. We had a great trend coming out of the third quarter. Our home business, which as you know, penetrates more highly in the fourth quarter than the rest of the year, is extremely strong. I think it was up mid single-digits low to mid single-digits again in the third quarter as it has been for the year.","And very importantly, from our standpoint, our digital business grew double-digits again and as you know that this is for entering the most important quarter for digital. So I think we're super confident as we go into the fourth quarter.","Bruce Besanko","Just to build on what you said too, Kevin. In Kevin's prepared remarks, he indicated that the regular price sales for the quarter were up 1% while clearance down 7%. So I think that's indicative of that and how we perform in the quarter.","Mark Altschwager","Is plus to 10 to 15 basis points for the year is still the goal overall for gross margin?","Kevin Mansell","I think the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year, the only thing we've really done in this quarter is to raise the low end of the earnings guidance up in recognition of the strong performance we've had all year. And the components of the guidance, I don\u2019t think really have much changed. I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add there.","Bruce Besanko","Yes, I would just say, we\u2019ve incorporated the results of the first three quarters into our outlook. We still have quite a bit of business with some very significant weeks here in front of us. But we felt like based on the performance of the first three quarters and what we anticipate in the fourth quarter, we were able to narrow the range slightly ex the tax settlement that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. So we've updated the EPS guidance in that way, but we've not -- and we're not going to update any of the particular line items.","Mark Altschwager","And one more quick one, I think you mentioned 30% of online demand fulfilled from stores. How would you expect that to trend in Q4? And you've talked a bit about this save more pick up in store. Where are you with the rollout there and what\u2019s the communication strategy on that with the customer?","Kevin Mansell","The impact of ship from store and by online pick-up in store during in the fourth quarter is, as you can imagine, very high. And in particular, the impact of buy online pick-up in the store as we get closer to the holiday season accelerates really dramatically. So said another way, I guess, the changes that we've made and initiative we have put in place to drive customers to consider picking up in store, I think will pay us big dividends in the fourth quarter.","We tested smart card and then roll smart card to our desktop platform in the third quarter. And the results of that are very encouraging. It is definitely driving increased decision making of customers to choose pick up in store, because we give them a benefit to do that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question that will come from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Robert Drbul","I guess one question I have is on the SG&A as you look to the fourth quarter around the marketing plans. In terms of the investments, is there an opportunity to leverage marketing again in the fourth quarter? How are you approaching that line item as you think about the competitiveness next 90 days?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean overall for-- and jump in here Bruce if I get this not exactly right. But the overall for the fourth quarter we\u2019ve increased our marketing. That was planned to increase our marketing. We think we have a big business opportunity. Clearly, leveraging marketing this year has been successful. I think for the year, we\u2019ve done a really good job in terms of leveraging marketing. So I\u2019m hopeful that platform we have in place for the fourth quarter from marketing spend will continue to drive that. Some of the initiatives that we launch new in the third quarter for instance the tactics and strategy around taking advantage of competitors\u2019 closures look to have paid dividends and those stores definitely outpace the company and we got a lift in those stores. So I don\u2019t know if that answers everything for you. Bruce, I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add.","Bruce Besanko","I\u2019d just say, from a marketing perspective as we look at year-to-date figures, we leverage in the third quarter. We\u2019ve been leveraging year-to-date. So we\u2019ll see how it performs here in the fourth quarter.","Robert Drbul","And Kevin, when you talk about the women\u2019s business being challenging, you highlighted I think the Simply Vera Vera Wang line. From the perspective of the 10 year anniversary having varying the store, is that -- can that turn the rest of the women\u2019s business with that line, or around like the Vera Wang dark collection when you look around within the women\u2019s business. Can you just talk about the outlook there a little bit?","Kevin Mansell","Vera Wang business is great. It\u2019s been running super-strong all year long. I suspect the effort that we\u2019re putting around celebrating the anniversary of our partnership with her is going to probably accelerate that, Bob. And Vera is the largest and most important exclusive brand we have. So I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s going to help lift our exclusive brand sales. You\u2019ll probably remember from the call, the biggest improvement we had in our overall brand portfolio was in our private brands where speed to market some resurgence in our Jumping Beans business and the re-launch of Apartment 9 drove that.","Overall exclusive brands have definitely trailed the company but the brands that we\u2019re betting on, brands like Vera or brands Lauren Conrad, those are growing dramatically. It\u2019s more a case of us editing and pairing down and eliminating categories or other brands that aren\u2019t performing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question that will come from Lorraine Hutchinson with BLA. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson","This is Heather Balsky on for Lorraine. I was hoping to just talk a little bit about your credit business in the health of the portfolio, and where do you see opportunities, if any, to continue to grow that business?","Bruce Besanko","Yes, so let me make a couple of comments about the credit portfolio, which we consider to be a competitive advantage. We have about, call 30 million household. We have Kohl's Charge card. Our penetration remains very high. In the third quarter, it was in the 60% range. It's typically in the high 50s and low 60s. So we were right there in the third quarter.","Credit revenue was up for the third quarter. And the overall health of the portfolio remains very strong. As Kevin indicated, we\u2019re in the process of looking at our loyalty programs. And the credit portfolio will be part of that look. And so we're hopeful we can continue to have a really healthy portfolio that provides great benefits to our really great customers.","Operator","The next question in queue will come from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Paul Lejuez","You mentioned a strong back-to-school and a strong end to October. Any further qualification you could share there? I think you said low single-digits. But you technically were up low single-digits, I guess, for the quarter. So just wondering if you can give a little bit more detail of those periods? And also talk about the promotional cadence during those stronger periods. Where you\u2019re running promotions above the prior year? And then separate, just on the $8 million of additional expenses for the hurricane. Just wondering what that was Bruce? And did that include the credit deleverage PCs you spoke of some leaving fees. Also, should we expect any of those expenses, those higher expenses to carry over into the fourth quarter?","Kevin Mansell","I can probably answer the first part and then Bruce can answer the other part, Paul. Back-to-school, which we characterize from 1st of August through the Labor Day date, the 1st week of September. We were up about 3%. And there was consistent performance the whole quarter and consistent performance across the most important categories, things like footwear, Activewear and children's. September was very weak from that point on. So second week of September through 1st week or so of October, we were down low single-digits.","But frankly, I attribute that completely and totally to certainly the hurricane. Bruce, I think quantified that to the best extent we can and we've got pretty good handle on that part. But also unseasonably warm weather. We had warm weather in all of our regions. So that part of the quarter really suffered as a result of both of those things happening. And then the end of October, we were up again. So for October, we were up, let's say, closer to 1% with the end of October being stronger than that to drive that 1% number.","And there wasn\u2019t anything unusual. Though, we did, I think as you know Paul in these kinds of seasonal businesses when you have periods of low demand due to weather and hurricanes then you\u2019re going to get pent up demand and it's going to come back stronger towards the end. And to some extent, you can almost see that even in our gross margin performance because one of the reasons why our gross margin was down certainly shipping cost impacted gross margin, merchandize margin up, gross margin down, shipping cost was a factor than a factor all year of course.","But the other big factor would just these end of quarter reserves and accruals we had to put in place because the sales came really, really late and that\u2019s just sometime how it happens. And in this case, that\u2019s how it happens. So there wasn\u2019t anything unusual from a promotional perspective that we did to drive that. I think Bruce\u2026","Bruce Besanko","On the hurricane, so let me give you a more fulsome response on the hurricane. So we had three hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Nate during the third quarter. And as I said, they had 35 basis points unfavorable impact on our sales, that\u2019s obviously an estimate, but it seems about right and that was about $15 million in sales. The three hurricanes affected about a little over $100 of our stores in which the stores remained close for between two and seven days. We also have an $8 million impact to SG&A in order to take care of our associates, our communities and our customers. There is a few buckets or few categories of that, one was donations to the Red Cross and some donations to -- for our associates.","A second category was when these storms hit, we made sure that we continue to pay some of our -- pay our associates despite the fact that those stores were closed. We had some insurance deductions as a consequence of the hurricanes. And then yes, the credit impact is contained in that $8 million number. So we froze some account for our customers during that difficult period. So the net effect was about an $8 million SG&A. When you combine it with sales impact, we feel like an estimated net income impact of roughly between $8 million and $8.5 million, which is an EPS impact of about $0.05.","Paul Lejuez","And anything going forward, Bruce or are we done with those expenses?","Bruce Besanko","I think those are complete.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question that will come from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Cheng","Kevin, regarding traffic and the journey of the positive traffic. How would you prioritize the key factors that will drive that just overall in terms of focusing on what will be important to you and where you see the most material drivers for that? And on women\u2019s and accessories, do you have thoughts on timing and catalyst and what we should expect in terms of what\u2019s achievable as you look to improve those parts of the business? Thank you.","Kevin Mansell","On the first part in terms of the traffic drivers, like everything, Oliver, it\u2019s a multiple of factors that are going to lift our traffic continuing going forward. Some of it is of course very straight forward, which is all these efforts that we have in place around personalization and particularly in our digital marketing, which is now our largest marketing spend where we\u2019re delivering more specific offers based on customers past preferences and reaching them more directly. So I think that\u2019s a big, big role.","Product of course where retailers of product plays a massive role and as we think about driving traffic, having more relevant product in our stores, is a big part of, I think, the resurgence in traffic. People are finding what they want more regularly. I would say the third piece is, as you know, we\u2019ve made very large investments to be best in class from an omnichannel standpoint. And therefore, what we present to customers digitally online giving them access to everything we offer is a big component of this.","And then giving them the opportunity to make the decision where they are going to buy it whether we ship it them whether from our stores at EFC, or they visit one of our stores to pick-up in store, I think that's probably the third big factor. In terms of the two businesses that have been lagging, I wouldn\u2019t want to get ahead of myself too far. But I think I would say that we're more optimistic on our women's apparel business turning positive. You just see it in the trends. It's consistently improved.","The private brand penetration in women's apparel is extremely high. And therefore, when we start seeing improvement in our private brand performance, we can anticipate more improved performance in the overall women's apparel business. I would be less optimistic on accessories. I think that's a tougher business for us right now. You can see it in the numbers. We talked about that in this call. But women's is an important component. And if we can get the women's business to move positively that is going to pay big dividends for our overall business.","Oliver Cheng","And our last question is on the loyalty evolution. This is a really nice catalyst and opportunity as you simplify and embrace, and I'm sure you can leverage it to drive enhanced personalization, even more than you\u2019re doing. So how -- what are some of the parameters around the test and the evolution? Because it looks like you will have to integrate a lot of pieces. I'm just curious about the opportunities and risk, and what you think will happen when you step change and embrace that? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, as we look at it, there is no risk. We have -- we're building from a massively successful program to begin with. And what that\u2019s allowed us to get is great insights and great information to build it better. Fundamentally, in the easiest way possible, we talk about it by saying, hey, we got to simplify it, there is multiple components and so making it easier for customers to understand would help engage more people. We have to broaden it, meaning we have to reach more people outside of our charge base, because a large percentage of our loyalty program realizing that charge base. And then without question at all, we want to engage more over the course of time.","So I think our sense is that this is going to be a positive for the business. Beyond that, the details of it, I think I would want to wait till the February call and we\u2019ll give you a lot more specificity around what the program looks like. I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add there, Bruce.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question that will come from Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.","Charles Grom","Just a couple of questions. First, can you remind us on ecommerce, how much the penetration increases in the fourth quarter relative to the rest of the year? And I guess the ducktail off of that, in the third quarter, was the drag from ecommerce, the typical 20 to 30 basis points?","Kevin Mansell","On the second part of the question, I can definitely give you a quick answer, which is the drag due to shipping fulfillment was very typical of what we see each and every quarter. So there is no change there. There is no change in trend. And it is pretty much as expected. In the fourth quarter you\u2019re right, the penetration is much higher, I think Bruce has got the number roughly.","Bruce Besanko","Yes, roughly speaking, it\u2019s about 25% is I think what we're looking at.","Kevin Mansell","And of course that's all built into our forecast and our thinking in terms of how we give you the guidance.","Charles Grom","And that 25% compares to what year-to-date. Do you have that Bruce?","Bruce Besanko","I'm calculating it, give me a second. About, call it mid teens.","Charles Grom","So if we think about your gross margin guidance for the year, which is up, it basically implies an up fourth quarter in gross margin. So I\u2019m wondering what the offsets are going to be to that increasing penetration and the drag associated from the shipping and fulfillment costs?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean fundamentally at the end of the day, what we believe is that we\u2019re going to get an increase in our merchandize margin. We\u2019ve had an increase in our merchandize margin. We expect to continue to have an increase in our merchandize margin. And the reason though we do is, are the components of the merchandize margins are working in our favor. Inventories are better managed, inventories are leaner, inventories are more relevant because receipts see are coming closer to sales. And as a result of all of that, we have improved merchandize margin. And then of course, working against this is the headwind of shipping and fulfillment. But we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of anticipating that impact, and it\u2019s been very consistent. So I would expect it to be consistent in the fourth quarter as well.","Charles Grom","And then, obviously, I think everybody on this call knows that warmer weather in September and October is not good for you, and you\u2019ve done a pretty good job quantifying the hurricane. And we think about it, sounds like the commentary on the end of October and so far in November. It sounds like the business has bounced back. Do you -- can you look at certain categories and say you think the weather had ex-impact on the third quarter? And therefore the opportunity for pent up demand is why?","Kevin Mansell","I mean, generally, I don\u2019t want to get over my skis on this. But generally, the warm weather in those four weeks in September negatively impacted sales in total for the quarter. And you see it because the seasonal categories, which are significant percentage of our total business, ran down, let\u2019s say, mid single-digits. And in spite of that, we had a positive overall comp. So that\u2019s the main indicator that you have that it has an impact that puts the hurricane to the side that\u2019s just looks at the seasonal categories. And then we\u2019ve continued to see strength. So you combine those two things together and you got to say that is a good signal.","Charles Grom","And just one quick one, just any color on the trends within your non-credit customer?","Kevin Mansell","Well, non-credit is definitely running better. It\u2019s leading. You can see that from a share perspective Kohl\u2019s Charges as a percentage of our total business. That is not by accident or by chance. As you know, Chuck, we\u2019ve had a strong initiative in place to broaden the reach of Kohl\u2019s to more customers. And by default, that means make some of our value more appealing. So a lot of these technology implementations do that and make it easier for more casual customer to consider Kohl\u2019s and get the kinds of value that typically might have only been seen clearly by our charge customers. So usually growth in non-Kohl\u2019s Charge business is a very good signal for us that we\u2019re on the right track to improve performance, looking forward.","Bruce Besanko","And the non-Kohl\u2019s customer data is favorable, the nice change for us as we saw in the third quarter.","Kevin Mansell","And the other piece that I think is important that varied in there Chuck is that for the first time in quite a long time, we have begun to see new customer acquisitions grow. And that has not been the case for us for quite a long time. And so that\u2019s another indicator that the offering, both product and marketing that we\u2019re delivering, is more appealing to people who haven't traditionally shopped at Kohl's.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question that will come from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","So larger picture, Kevin, with all the lines blurring across for retail I'm curious what you define as your competitive set? And more so, how you\u2019re positioning Kohl's today, going forward, and what you see differentiating the company from the department store space overtime?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, we've staked out our space, Matt. I think, we've looked at our business and recognized that our long-term success hinges on our ability to deliver best-in-class omnichannel experience. So that means recognizing that on the digital side of the business, we have to compete with virtual retailers, like Amazon, as well as general merchandize retailers, let's say, in our private brands, like Target and Walmart, as well as general merchandize department stores who offer similar categories that we do.","But the biggest asset we think we have is our stores. And the fact that we\u2019re non-mall based, 95% of our stores are in strip or freestanding locations, gives us a huge advantage to be an omnichannel retailer in the future. And so everything we're working on is to fundamentally make that happen. And our sense and we're probably sounding very optimistic, because we are, is that this is working and it's delivering. And you\u2019re seeing it in the results. And traffic is improving sequentially all year sales are improving sequentially all year. Bruce just updated our guidance by raising the low end, which tells you that we're very confident going into the fourth quarter. So I think our focus is how do we continue on this path to be the best we can from an omnichannel standpoint and so many of our investments are targeted there.","Matthew Boss","And then just a follow-up. So with the encouraging trends when the weather was in your favor, I guess, how are you thinking overall about the opportunity in the fourth quarter and holiday more so, just versus what you did and what you saw a year-ago? And just anything specifically that you\u2019re doing to capture that share from all the lateral store closures that we're seeing out there?","Kevin Mansell","I mean the store competitive closure strategy or the tactics that will continue in the fourth quarter. And we're probably more optimistic on that just because we now have the third quarter results behind us, so we can see we actually got a lift. From initiative perspective, I think we covered a lot of the things we're doing in the fourth quarter. But the trend of the business coming out of the third quarter and now into the fourth quarter, just indicates to us that the things ","we\u2019re doing are working.","Bruce Besanko","I'll just add on the competitors store closures that we\u2019re working hard to take advantage of those store closings, as Kevin said in his prepared remarks. We believe a portion of the improvement in the third quarter was from a sales perspective attributable to the efforts that we've put forth against those stores to capture share. And we expect it will continue in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question that will come from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell","Just a few very quick questions from us, and I apologize if I missed it earlier. But you did mention national brands continue to gain traction. Just speak to the actual brand mix -- the mix between the two and the sales performance of those two groups. And then second, the Activewear business has obviously been successful. You outlined I think 20% growth. Could you just remind us, at this point, what\u2019s the penetration of that category across the whole store? Has that reached a mid-teens type of penetration level, or any type of direction you could give us on that front? And then lastly from me, I know you don\u2019t want to get into more details of the Amazon partnership. But is there any color you could provide around just the overarching thought process, a decision to do the deal. How we came about would just be interested in any of that color. Thank you.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, I can probably provide some of your answer and Bruce can give you any specifics he wants to add. We did talk about national brand mix in call it grew 300 basis points as a percentage of the total, which means that it grew in the mid single-digits as an increase, which by default means that our proprietary brands were modestly down as a result of that. But it was functionally all because of the edits and pairing down of the brands and categories we offer in the exclusive brand portfolio. So our actual private brands performed pretty well. It was a nice increase step up in trend.","On an active business, yes, I\u2019d say mid-teens is a good number to use. We have aspiration of it going higher as customers continue to move into that lifestyle. So I think we\u2019re well positioned to take advantage of that, for sure. But third quarter continued the same trend. On a sales basis, it accelerated but as a percentage of the total, yes, I\u2019d use a mid-teens number. On Amazon, there is really not anymore color other than to reinforce what I said in the call. We have a really very simple straight forward objective here. And that is driving traffic is a number one priority we have as a company. And initiatives that might help us drive traffic and allow customers to consider Kohl\u2019s as a stop instead of somewhere else, we\u2019re going to consider. And we think these are two companies that share a lot of common trades in terms of their pursuit of excellence. And so, it just made a ton of sense for us given the objective we have.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question that will come from Brian Tunick with RBC. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] for Brian. Just wanted to ask about online strength. Does the online business generally mere stores in terms of category trends, and then maybe national brand versus private label penetration? Is that also similar to what your report companywide for online business? Any color you can provide on that, what\u2019s driving the online strength would be very helpful?","Bruce Besanko","There is a little different mix on online. There tends to be a little more mix toward home, so that\u2019s I think the main...","Kevin Mansell","I mean, the two big things are home over penetrates always has, you can imagine there were obvious reasons that that happens. And the second piece of course a little bit connected to the first is national brands over penetrate, as well. But those two things are tied together right, because home is more highly penetrated than national brands, as well. So national brands more important online and home definitely important online. Again, we\u2019re back to this discussion with the fourth quarter one of the reasons we\u2019re relatively bullish on the fourth quarter beyond the trend of the business coming into the quarter is just that online business has been very strong all year, home business has been very strong all year, national brands have been strong all year.","Bruce Besanko","We have a much wider assortment to online that penetrates toward that national brand as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Dana Telsey with Telsey. Please go ahead.","Dana Telsey","Can you talk a little bit at speed to market and any updates on the speed to market initiative? And the SG&A reduction program around $250 million or so, how is the progress there and what you\u2019re seeing? Thank you.","Kevin Mansell","I can do the first part. Bruce will answer you on the SG&A. And the speed the market initiative, we continue to make really good progress there. Without going into all of the details about the individual brands percentage of products receives, which is on speed to market versus not on speed to market, the way I would characterize it. And I think you can watch the performance of two metrics as indicators as to whether or not we're making progress. Number one if speed to market is working then inventory should go down, while sales should outpace inventory.","So I think third quarter is a great example of that. They came into the quarter with less inventory than last year we came out of the quarter with less inventory than last year. And yes, we had a positive sales increase. So what that says to me is we\u2019re delivering more relevant merchandize more closely to need and overall very-very positive. And the obvious metric watches our merchandize margins improve. Though, particularly in our private brands, do we start to get improved performance and I think all three quarters this year we've stepped up performance with our private brands and a lot of it is due to the speed to market initiative. On the SG&A stuff, I think, Bruce would have that.","Bruce Besanko","So as we've said on previous calls, I think Kevin in the first quarter and second quarter calls talked about this SG&A project. The Company has kicked-off this process. It\u2019s been going on now for many months to identify long-term and key is sustainable expense reductions to permanently lower our annualized SG&A rate. We're confident that we\u2019ll achieve our three year target of $250 million in annualized SG&A savings over that time. This effort is being led by Jill Timm, one of our executives, many of you know Joe.","We are probably through much of the initial Phase. We're now in the process of baking some of those opportunities into our budget process here as we move through the rest of this year, so that we can achieve that goal. So we couldn\u2019t be happier to be part of a program that's been so I think so well run.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question that will come from Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.","Patrick McKeever","Jus on going back to the competitive store closures and the lifts that you\u2019re seeing in some of your stores, I don\u2019t suppose you might be willing to quantify the impact and at least how those stores are performing, quantify the impact of those stores -- how those stores are performing versus stores that are not in that same trade area. And then also just I mean in those markets where you\u2019re seeing competitors close stores. Are you also seeing a lift with your digital sales? And also seeing a lift with your digital sales, I know you said when you close the store it has a negative impact on digital sales in that particular trade area. So I\u2019m wondering if there is positive impact when competitors close stores to your digital business?","Kevin Mansell","Patrick on the competitive store closures, the way -- the only way I would characterize it is that obviously we have a relatively sophisticated tracking system for this looking at the sales of the stores and trend in and the sales of the stores in the trend out. And there is no question that in the markets in which we\u2019ve targeted competitive store closures, we have lifted sales. I wouldn\u2019t want to quantify it for you and I wouldn\u2019t want to at all try to project that until like some future performance, because I think that\u2019s dangerous to do. But there is absolutely no question that sales have lifted in those markets.","For sure, when we have opened stores in markets, omni sales are positively affected and when we closed stores in markets omni sales are negatively impacted. I can\u2019t tell you and I don\u2019t think we have the numbers on these specifics stores. So I wouldn\u2019t want to go there with you right now. But there probably be a point in time down the road where we could give you more information on that. But there is absolutely no question that omni sales are positively or negatively impacted based on the scale of the physical environments you have. And so that\u2019s why -- again, we\u2019re back to this why we feel so strongly about our store base.","Patrick McKeever","And then just on the localization, I mean I know that\u2019s an initiative as well. Just wondering if you could give us a quick update on where you think stand with that program?","Kevin Mansell","Continue to make progress, again without going into all the detail in the various areas inside the business, some are making more than others. As you can imagine some regions or country are more positively impacted by localization than others. But I always -- the two metrics that I look at is if localization is working what we\u2019re seeing we\u2019re doing is effective then you should see inventories become more productive. I think we would say they have been and you should see merchandize margins improve.","And I think actually that has happened as well. So those are the two primary impacts. Of course, it should have a positive impact on sales, as well. And I think as you look at this year, we were down close to 3% the first quarter. We were down still modestly in the second quarter and we were up in the third quarter. So it\u2019s definitely having an impact on sales.","Operator","Thank you.

Please go ahead.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning. With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President. I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results. Kevin then will provide some more details on our Greatness Agenda initiatives, and then we'll open up the call to your questions.","As we announced earlier this month, comp sales increased 40 basis points for the quarter. Though we were pleased to report our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comps, sales were volatile during the quarter and were below our expectations. Holiday sales, which include the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas, increased 4% and store traffic was 400 basis points better than industry average. This strength, however, was substantially offset by softness in early November and in January when demand for cold weather goods was especially low.","For the year, comp sales increased 70 basis points. Looking at the metrics of the comp, the components of the comp for the 40 basis point increase in the fourth quarter were as follows. Transactions per store increased 20 basis points for the quarter. Average transaction value also increased 20 basis points comprised of an average unit retail increase of 30 basis points, with a drop in units per transaction of 10 basis points.","The components of the 70 basis comp increase for fiscal 2015 were as follows. Transactions per store decreased 20 basis points for the year. Average transaction value increased 90 basis points comprised of an average unit retail increase of 130 basis points, with a drop in units per transaction of 40 basis points.","From a line of business perspective, Footwear and Home were the strongest categories for both the quarter and the year. Accessories was the weakest category in both periods. On a regional basis, the West region was the strongest for both the quarter and the year, while the Mid-Atlantic and South Central were the most difficult regions.","Gross margin was challenging for the quarter, down approximately 80 basis points. The decrease was driven by higher promotional markdowns during the holiday season as well as an increase in shipping cost versus last year, driven by a 30% increase in digital orders. The effect of the increased penetration of the national brand was as expected as penetration grew to 58% for the quarter and 52% in the year. The growth in penetration was similar for both the quarter and the year.","Gross margin was flat for the first three quarters of the year. However, gross margin for the year decreased 27 basis points to 36.1% of sales due to the fourth quarter performance, which was lower than our guidance for the year of flat to up 20 basis points.","SG&A dollars increased $60 million to $1.3 billion for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, SG&A deleveraged 80 basis points. As expected, marketing expenses deleveraged as we invested heavily to drive sales. Many of those expenditures will not be repeated in 2016.","Store payroll also deleveraged due to ongoing wage pressure and omnichannel support and ship-from-store and buy online, pick up in store. During the fourth quarter, almost 30% of our digital sales units were either shipped from or picked up in our stores, more than two times last year's penetration rate. EFCs and IT also deleveraged. Store expenses, distribution centers for our brick-and-mortar stores, corporate and credit, all leveraged.","For the year, SG&A expenses were $4.5 billion, an increase of 2.3% over 2014, which was consistent with our guidance of a 1.5% to 2.5% increase. As a percentage of sales, SG&A deleveraged 30 basis points. Store payroll, corporate, e-commerce fulfillment centers and IT deleveraged for the year, while marketing, credit and distribution centers for our brick-and-mortar stores all leveraged.","Depreciation expense was $239 million for the quarter. For the year, depreciation was $934 million, generally in line with our guidance of $940 million. Depreciation increased in both periods, primarily due to higher IT amortization.","Interest expense decreased $5 million to $79 million for the quarter and decreased $13 million to $327 million for the year. As a reminder, our original guidance was $335 million. The decreases are due to favorable interest rates achieved during our $1.1 billion debt refinancing earlier in the year.","Our income tax rate was 35.9% for the quarter and 36.3% for the year. The tax rate increased 60 basis points during both periods as the prior-year periods included some favorable tax audit settlements. This was versus our guidance of 37% for the fiscal year.","For the quarter, net income was $296 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.58. Excluding $169 million of debt extinguishment losses that were recorded earlier in the year, net income was $781 million for the year and diluted EPS was $4.01.","We recently closed two stores, one in Texas and the other in California. We currently operate 1,164 stores. Gross square footage is 100.4 million square feet, and selling square footage is 83.8 million square feet.","Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $707 million of cash and cash equivalents, approximately half of last year's balance. Higher inventory, lower payables and payment of the debt premium in cash contributed to the decrease.","Inventory dollars per store were 5.7% higher than year-end 2014. Units per store were up 5%, higher than the end of last year. The increases are primarily within national brands, which are up more than 10% over last year. We expect inventory to be down low single digits at the end of the first quarter and down mid single digits for the remainder of the year.","AP as a percent of inventory decreased 865 basis points to 31%. Almost half of the decrease is due to the anniversary of last year's port strike. Lower year-over-year January receipts and higher inventory levels also contributed to the decrease.","Our capital expenditures were $690 million for the year, approximately $100 million lower than our original expectations. IT spending was approximately $300 million, which was $50 million lower than expectations as we are buying our registers closer to installing our new point-of-sale system.","Store experience and refresh spending, which includes beauty, remodels, new stores and general store upkeep, was $250 million, about $50 million lower than our original plans as we reduced the number of stores we are remodeling and revised our in-store merchandising plans.","Base capital spending of approximately $150 million was generally consistent with our original plans. We expect capital expenditures of $825 million in 2016, approximately $135 million higher than 2015. About $60 million of the increase was related to a timing shift in IT mainly due to our register purchase for that new point-of-sale system this year. In addition, we are accelerating the construction of a fifth e-commerce fulfillment center with construction beginning in 2016 with the goal to open in time for fall 2017.","CapEx is expected to include $375 million for IT spending, $250 million for store strategies, including new stores, remodels, beauty and easy experience initiatives and new brand rollouts, and $200 million in base capital, including investment in the e-fulfillment center.","Weighted average diluted shares were 187 million for the quarter and 195 million for the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of our stock, bringing our total for the year to 17.4 million shares repurchased. We ended the year with 187 million shares of stock outstanding. On Wednesday, our board approved an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend. The $0.50 dividend is payable on March 23 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 9.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin who will provide additional insights on our results.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Wes. I want to take a minute and make a few comments regarding 2015 (10:57). This past 2015 (11:02) results came on top of very strong holiday (11:04) and were our fifth consecutive quarter of positive sales increases since the launch of the Greatness Agenda. During the most competitive period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we achieved a 4% sales increase, with customers definitely choosing Kohl's.","It's clear to us that the strategic framework of the Greatness Agenda is working, and we're making progress towards our goal of being the most engaging retailer in America. We've seen great success in many of the major initiatives engineered under our plan and are focused on product initiatives. We've successfully grown the depth and breadth of our national brand portfolio and have seen double-digit increases in sales of most national brands. We've put our stake in the ground to be the destination for Active and Wellness and have dramatically increased our share of this growing category, positioning us for success in the future.","We made five big investments for holiday: Active and Wellness, Premium Electronics, Beauty, Licensed Entertainment and Team Apparel. And in total, we achieved our plan for the fourth quarter for these investments and achieved a double-digit sales increase combined.","And finally, our localization efforts are proving out, and 2016 will be the year that all of our planning efforts for unique assortments by store will come to life in 90% of our store portfolio. This means we'll be both improving the in-store experience for the customer and very importantly, better managing our inventory across the company.","In our focus around omnichannel initiatives, we're seeing the results on our multi-year, multi-billion-dollar investment in digital technology, with online demand driving sales. Online-generated demand was up 25% for the year and 30% for the fourth quarter. Just as importantly, much of that demand was fulfilled with best-in-class ship-from-store enablement and buy online, pick up in store capability. Both of these capabilities will create more opportunity for future growth, provide a greater customer experience, and leverage our store portfolio in a meaningful way.","Our Kohl's app was used by more than 11 million customers and growing. And new mobile in-store capabilities, including mobile pay, were successful as well. Our digital and mobile-centric Yes2You Rewards Program has quickly become an industry-leading loyalty program, and we now have the opportunity to cultivate that membership base and increase our share of wallet from them by giving them more relevant and more personal experiences to draw them into the brand and back into the store.","Moving on to looking forward. I want to provide an update on the Greatness Agenda, organization, and stores. While I'm happy with the progress we've made on many of our key initiatives, we were very clear on the expected outcomes of the Greatness Agenda. By 2017, we had targeted three outcomes: 90th percentile on associate engagement, best-in-class customer engagement, and $21 billion in sales.","I'm extremely proud of the progress that we've made on the first two outcomes, and we are right where we need to be to achieving those two goals. But for many reasons, including a difficult macroeconomic and retail environment, it's unlikely we'll achieve our sales goal on the timeline we had originally set, though I do believe we'll achieve that goal within a short time after.","It's clear, though, that we need to move at greater speed and agility, accelerate plan changes in our business model more quickly, and focus our resources on the most productive assets and projects while moving away from those that are not delivering results. We need to embrace the evolving behaviors of our customers and take actions to support the long-term health and success of our business.","We began those efforts recently by realigning our organization and leadership in buying and planning, store environment and design, and digital and infrastructure technology. We changed the scope of some of our leaders and teams, reorganized some functions, and brought key teams under shared leaders. The purpose of those changes was to enable efficiency and decision-making, leverage our biggest asset, our inventory, more effectively, and deploy capital resources more clearly around investments that drive both sales and profitability. Most importantly, they were targeted to increase our ability to respond with more speed to our customer.","As you likely read in our press release this morning, we're announcing several updates to our store portfolio and omnichannel strategy. We will be piloting seven, new small format stores, approximately 35,000 square foot in size, that will open this year, which will help both inform future store size and rationalization and identify omnichannel opportunities as well. We'll also continue our Off-Aisle pilot with two new stores and open 12 Fila stores to gauge the possibilities in the outlet space.","In addition, we'll close 18 underperforming stores which represent less than 1% of our total sales. We expect to announce the specific store locations by the end of March. The closures are expected to generate annual SG&A savings of approximately $45 million and annual depreciation savings of approximately $10 million. As a result of both the store closures and the organizational realignment, we expect to incur approximately $150 million to $170 million in charges that will be recognized in the first quarter and second quarter of 2016.","I'm very happy to say that every affected Kohl's store associate will be offered the opportunity to work in a nearby Kohl's store location, or if they prefer, a competitive severance package.","These organizational and store changes are a good example of how we intend to capture more expense savings, an effort which will be an important part of how we reach our sales goals and increase profitability at the same time. While I believe most investors give us high marks for expense management, we know we need to do better. Traditionally, our goal has been to leverage our expenses assuming we achieve a 2% sales increase. And despite the fact that we're experiencing significant wage pressure in our stores and intend to continue to invest in our omnichannel initiatives, we're moving to lower our leverage point to a 1.5% comparable sales increase.","The blueprint for that effort will be a plan to reimagine all of our decision-making processes and better utilize our previous investment in technology to do so. I've challenged all of our teams to explore ways that we'll find more efficiency in our work and focus on speed in reaching our goals. Although we've made progress in both our marketing spend and speed, we believe there are opportunities in that area of our cost structure as part of this effort as well.","Our associates have wholeheartedly embraced the Greatness Agenda and we've seen an evolution in the way we work together. By empowering our teams against the goal of greater speed and giving them the space they need to work in in a more streamlined way, I believe we'll continue to develop ways to do more with less, something Kohl's has always been known for.","The other area of opportunity I want to discuss is the work being done around lowering the level of our inventory. This is especially critical in allowing our stores to be more efficient, lower our costs, and deliver better customer experience at the same time. Since 2011, our average inventory per store has grown approximately 15%. While some of this was funded to add inventory for the digital portion of our business and to aid in our national brand initiatives, we're committed to manage it more intelligently.","Key areas of focus will be around effective implementation of our localization initiative, leveraging technology to increase the percentage of inventory shipped from stores to fulfill online demand or online demand, picked up in store, and gaining efficiency in buying and planning through our recent reorganization. I expect that we can reduce our inventory per store by 10% by 2017. In the more near term, we expect to enter this fall season with inventory per store down mid single digits.","Finally, I also want to ensure you that while we're committed to investing in the long-term health of our business, we'll also continue to be good stewards of our capital. As you saw in our press release, our board has approved an 11% increase in our dividend and we intend to continue our share buyback plan.","I'll now turn it back to Wes to give you our guidance for fiscal 2016.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Kevin. We would expect earnings per diluted share of $4.05 to $4.25 for fiscal 2016. The guidance is based upon the following assumptions: Comp sales of flat to up 1%; total sales down 50 basis points to up 50 basis points. This includes the effect of the lost sales from the closed stores in 2016. However, we would expect to retain some of these sales in nearby stores and through the digital channel.","Gross margin rate performance of flat to up 20 basis points. We would expect to have significant pressure in the first quarter of approximately 150 basis points drop versus last year as we continue to aggressively clear excess merchandise. We would expect to see improvement in each of the remaining quarters as our inventory levels drop below last year and become sequentially better throughout the year, with the biggest improvement in the fourth quarter of 2016.","SG&A dollar increase of 1% to 2%. Our expectations for first quarter SG&A dollar growth would be 3% to 4%, as we've shifted the timing of our advertising expenses and it's more weighted to the first quarter this year.","Depreciation expense of $940 million. The SG&A and depreciation guidance includes the partial year savings from the store closures in 2016. Interest expense of $310 million, tax rate of 37%.","This guidance also assumes share repurchases of $600 million at an average price of $50 per share. We would expect lease costs and PP&E write-offs related to store closures and severance associated with the store closures and corporate reorganization to be approximately $150 million to $170 million, with $55 million to $65 million of this charge included in Q1. The earnings guidance I just gave excludes any of this impact, as these are just estimates at this time.","And with that, we'll open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Introducing Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping to get an update on some of the various facets of your sales growth program. So cosmetics, any type of update on performance in the stores that that's in, and also loyalty program metrics and how that impacted the fourth quarter?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","On the Beauty, it's still continuing to see about a 200 basis point lift total store in the stores that we're rolling it out into. We'll complete that in the spring. We'll have all the stores done by the end of the second quarter, a little earlier than we did this year. So we feel very good about that.","We're also saving money on a lot of the investment in the stores. We've cut the investment about in half because we saw the same lift in the modified, little bit less expensive version as we did in the earlier version.","From a loyalty perspective, we really anniversaried that in October. We didn't expect to see any lift when we built the goal we shared with you guys on October of 2014. We didn't really count on any lift from that. They continue to spend a lot more money than non-loyalty members. Obviously, that's self-selecting, but even in like-for-like, we're still seeing a lift. So we feel very good about the loyalty program.","The focus really in 2016 is to move them along the value chain, so try to get them to spend more money at Kohl's as loyalty members. And then we're working behind the scenes as we roll out our new point-of-sale system in the fall to do a better job of being able to prescreen those folks behind the scenes to pre-approve them for a Kohl's credit card and explain the great additional value they get with that. So that'll be more of the focus as we move into 2016 and 2017, not so much trying to sign up more loyalty members, although that's certainly a goal, but trying to move them into being more loyal customers either through spending more on loyalty or eventually moving them to a Kohl's credit card customer.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. So two questions. The first is, I guess as we think about the delta between your holiday comps which you said were up 4% and then the reversal that we saw in January, which I think you said was more weather-related, I guess, what comp are you embedding for the first quarter, and have you seen any change post all of this January fray?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think from a sales perspective, I would expect that the first quarter sales are pretty similar to the guidance we gave for the year. I don't really see any big change there. Probably the more noticeable difference that Wes touched on in the guidance review in the first quarter is we'll continue to have pretty significant merchandise margin pressure as we liquidate our heavier inventories coming out of the holiday season. That's really the big, big difference.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, I wouldn't see a lot of volatility in sales across the quarters as we move throughout the year. Let me be clear, the big issue in the fourth quarter was the first three weeks of November. January was a very minor issue. The drop in January was really related all to Winter Storm Jonas. It was about a $20 million hit, and that's basically what we finished down. So the first three weeks of November, as everybody probably mentioned either in their sales updates or in their earnings call, was very difficult to sell any cold weather apparel, and that's where the big drop versus our plan was.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just a follow-up. So higher level, in the first chunk of store closings announced today, how do you view the chain today? Do you see additional closings over time? And then, is there anything structurally that you guys think you can execute differently or make changed if you were a private company versus a public company?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","On the store closures, as you know, Matt, this is probably the first experience we've had closing more multiple number of stores, and it does involve multiple markets as well. And the process that we went through to determine that certainly involved looking at the total sales in the store and the momentum in the sales in the store because that's pretty critical. Is the store treading water or headed down?","Second, most importantly probably, the market view. So, we took a really critical look at every single one of our markets and tried to make a determination of where we had significant store overlap in a trade area that we were not generating incremental sales in, and stores that perhaps were being impacted more by our omnichannel initiatives. And obviously, also involved in it is cost review. And so stores that we really didn't see the future potential to generate profitability in because of, let's say, very high rent expense came under review as well.","I think that we're going to learn a lot. I mean, I think fundamentally, the answer to the question you had about additional store closures is we really don't know. I think we'll watch what happens with this process through the fall and the holiday season and we'll make another assessment as we come out of this year to make a better determination of what the right portfolio really looks like.","Hopefully that answers everything on the store piece. We're disclosing everything we can on that and...","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, we're going to \u2013 yeah, we don't \u2013 we've closed like five or six stores in the time I've been here. So we need to understand what happens to retain sales in the stores that surround those stores and if there's any effect on e-com as well.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","On the question on \u2013 I think I guess essentially your question is really public versus private. I think that companies are successful in both ways, for sure. And we've been very successful as a public company, but we also, as a public company, have an obligation to continually review all of the options we have to ensure we're maximizing shareholder value.","That's not something new, Matt. We've taken that obligation on for many, many years. I've been on the board for more than 15 years, and it's a constant review with advisors to look at do we have the right store portfolio, are we making the right investments, is the capital allocation decision-making that we are employing sound? And are there alternatives to that that we could consider? And so, nothing new is happening there. That's been that way for as long as I've been involved at Kohl's, and I suspect will continue to be that way.","So I don't think there's a \u2013 it would be better for us to be public, it would be better for us to be private, it's really just a focus on shareholder value as we would make the same determination about share buyback or dividend yield or capital expenditures.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Good morning.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Bob.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Kevin, can you talk a little bit more around the marketing expenditures in terms of, you know, you said several things won't be repeated. Like, how much did you spend last year? What's the opportunity for savings versus reinvestments, and what really did you guys learn as you went through the fourth quarter around the marketing plan (31:53)?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, for the year, Bob, we spent less in marketing than we did in the prior year. So that's a good thing. To be totally honest with you, we had set a goal at the beginning of last year to have a larger reduction in ad expenditures than we ended up spending. And fundamentally, what happened there is as we got into the fourth quarter and we saw the weak, really, strength or lack of strength in our business and weakness across the board, we made the determination we need to be really aggressive in terms of ensuring that we were maximizing our traffic levels in the store.","And so, on the positive side, marketing leveraged and we actually reduced our marketing spend, which is something long term, we intend to continue to do. On the negative side, I think our expectations at the beginning of the year were more optimistic than we ended up. Marketing is definitely a component part of the areas that we're looking to reduce expenses in over the course of the future years, and frankly, the key unlock there we really believe is personalization. I mean, that is going to be the driver, whether it's the application of our Yes2You Reward Loyalty Program to improve, as Wes covered, both total sales with those customers, but also a conversion over time to consider a credit card as a reasonable alternative as well, or it's just making the spend that we have around personalization more effective, regardless of whether that's print or direct mail, or the utilization of our app. So we've set goals for ourselves, and we definitely think that it's an important part. After store payroll, marketing is our single biggest expense, so we know if we're really going to reduce expenses over time, we've got to do a better job of marketing.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","And as we look to 2016, on the e-commerce side, where do you see opportunities to become more efficient and improve profitability there? I mean, I think you mentioned shipping costs. But can you just talk a little bit about how you're approaching that as it continues to grow and somewhat pressure the business?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I think two things. First and foremost, one of the big changes that we made this year, we alluded to it in the call, was the decision to reorganize our buying and planning structure and essentially bring together our e-com buying and planning teams with our brick-and-mortar buying and planning teams. And while at the time that we built a separate e-com team, it made sense for us because it was a small, but growing business, today it's a very big business. But most importantly, from a customer's perspective, she sees this through one lens. So we know that we need one view of the customer, and the way to achieve that is through one organization long term.","What that means, we think, is that we'll do a better job of inventory management, as a result. So I think one way we're looking at this is inventory management more effectively, and that will include using the inventories we have in our stores to fulfill online orders. That was very successful all year last year, and it peaked in a dramatic way in the fourth quarter. And we suspect that will continue to be a big tool to both improve inventory leverage, but also make us more efficient.","The other piece that we know we have to find a better long-term solution to is around fulfillment costs. And that's critical for us. And so we are investing, Wes called out some of the big things, everything from the beginning of a building of a new e-fulfillment center to the implementation of tools inside our stores to make order fulfillment more efficient and less expensive and improve speed. So those are the two lines that we're focused on. Michelle is kind of overseeing the buying and planning review, and Sona is very much involved in ensuring that we're leveraging on the fulfillment side. I don't know, Wes, if you want to add anything?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah. I mean we learned a lot with the increased volume. I think either Kevin or I mentioned it was 30% of our digital volume in the fourth quarter. We're getting our logistics team involved in working with the stores and spending additional capital to better configure the backroom to make it more efficient to ship. So we're looking for a 50% improvement in UPH in the ship-from-store shipping channel next year. And we're also spending a lot more time and money. The key for us with our low AURs and our relatively low average order value online is to keep the package together. And so we're spending a lot of time and technology in making our systems better to do that. So, those will be key for us to be more efficient.","From a rate perspective, our rates with UPS and FedEx and the Postal Service are as competitive out there. We're going to do probably $3 billion of digitally generated business in 2016. So, I don't think we're at a disadvantage from a rate perspective. We do have to do a better job of keeping the order together.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Right. Thank you very much.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Wes and Kevin.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Wes, I believe you said the national brands in 4Q were about 58% of sales, up from 52%. Could you maybe just touch on some of the initiatives you have on both the private label and the national brand side in 2016, and maybe how you might expect that to impact the mix going forward? And then just as a follow-up to that, could you touch on maybe some of the category color, a little bit more detail on how you're feeling about the juniors category, women's apparel, athletic and small electrics? Thanks.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Okay. I can take the category real quick. You mentioned all of our good categories, so thank you for that. Juniors had a positive comp for both the quarter and for the season. So that business has really turned it around. And they've done it the way I'd like to see all of our merchants do it. They've cut their inventory and grew their comps. So it is possible to do both. Active continues to do very, very well led by Nike, but there's other guys participating in that success as well. I would say premium electronics did much better than kitchen electrics. Kitchen electrics was a little tough in the fourth quarter, but we're growing that premium electronics area. And I would include things like active and wellness initiatives. So things like Fitbit would be included in that category as well. And then I'll let Kev talk about some of the \u2013 we have a lot of new initiatives from a private brand perspective that we're very excited about.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think generally, I would expect that both our national and private brand portfolios have the opportunity to perform more relatively equally beginning this year. Last year was definitely a year in which we dramatically made investments in some of our national brands. As you know, one that you called out was our Active and Wellness category which was extremely successful. And I continue to see growth there, and we are still expecting to grow the business. But we also know that we need to have a good balance. And so what we've been working on, Paul, is to really reimagine and change the way we go about delivering our private and exclusive brands with an eye towards increased speed and shortened delivery times because we know that that's the only way we're going to get really long-term improvement there. We're also targeting each of our \u2013 particularly large private brands for relaunches. And we're starting naturally with the biggest single private brand we have which is Sonoma. And Sonoma will be relaunched as a brand this year, and we do expect that that's going to rejuvenate that business in a meaningful way.","So I think we're happy with the balance. We're not backing away at all on our intensity around national brands. We still believe that that's really critical for us to continue to both support the ones we have, whether they're big brands like Levi in denim or Nike in active, but also add new brands. So we're definitely focused on both the omnichannel and stores' considerations of where we could improve our brand portfolio.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah. I think there's a big opportunity from a digital channel perspective to better emphasize private and exclusive brands. We may have gotten a little ahead of our skis on emphasizing national brands because it's a good way for us to try out new national brand. It's low risk for both parties. And that's a much bigger share of the business online than it is in store. So, I think there's opportunities. And one of the advantages I think that Kevin mentioned of putting the merchants together is there can be a better balance of looking at the total picture versus just driving one particular channel.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's very helpful color. Thank you. A very quick follow-up on store closures. I think I believe you said that you will announce the actual locations by the end of March. Can you just clarify, and apologize if I missed it, when the actual store closings are likely to occur?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Probably in June, sometime in June.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. All right. Helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. And thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a bit more about how the various revenue components of your growth agenda have been evolving. Obviously, the revenue is running below your targeted rate and new store concepts have become a bigger part of the conversation. So just trying to get a better sense of where you see the greatest opportunity for product and marketing initiatives to move the needle in 2016?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think generally honestly, Mark, our focus is around our existing store portfolio. That's where the improvement has to come from. And as we both have alluded to, utilizing the growth in online demand, the embracing that customers have done around our digital platform more effectively by leveraging our store base and our store inventory, is really the critical component that we need to improve on. And that has a lot of elements to it that we're focused on, everything from leveraging the inventory to improving the effectiveness in which we fulfill the orders, and as Wes pointed out, making technology drive better decisions in terms of where orders are fulfilled across the platform.","So, our focus is definitely on our existing store platform. But having said that, we don't want to back down from looking at new ideas that might enhance the future for Kohl's. So, I still believe that the 35,000 square foot pilot stores that we're launching could be, long term, really important for us because they're a nod to the fact that more and more of our business is being online, and while it's fulfilled in store either through ship from store or pick up in store, that customer is starting out online. And if we can find a way to have smaller stores that are effective and still provide that platform, it just gives us a great opportunity as we look down the road in a few years.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, I mean, if you're just talking about comp metrics, our ability to outperform the flat to 1% is going to be predicated on our ability to improve traffic from the roughly flat that it was this year. So, I continue to believe our average unit retail will be up. It was up for the year. It was somewhat muted in the fourth quarter just due to the extreme promotional nature of the business, especially in our cold-weather merchandise as we had to liquidate merchandise. But for us to exceed the guidance that we gave, we're going to have to get traffic moving into a slightly positive direction.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Hi. Thank you. Kevin, on the reorganization regarding speed, what's the lower hanging fruit there? And can you brief us on lead times now versus where you may want to go, and how this may impact the merch margins? It sounds like integrated inventory is a nice opportunity.","And Wes, on the 30% regarding utilizing your store network and the integration of bricks and clicks, do you think that that number will continue to rise? And was there a breakout between the mix of ship from store versus picked up? And I think if you could highlight the frontier in terms of mobile and mobile traffic, because we think that will continue to be a huge, important piece of interactivity from the customers. Thank you.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I'll take the first, but you got a lot of questions...","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Way more than one question. Good thing you didn't breathe a lot, so...","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Nice job, Oliver. On the reorganization, there's component parts to it, right? The first and most important part is we recognize that while the structure we had was right for the time we had it, we need a different view looking forward that reflects the way the customer looks at our business. And the customer looks at our business through one lens. It's seamless, it's omnichannel, and therefore, that's how we have to make our decisions.","And so, the buying and planning decisions that we'll make will be predicated on one view, and that's the customers' view. So that's got opportunity for us I because I think it will make us more sensitive to assortment sizes, it'll make us more sensitive to leveraging the inventory that we have in our existing brick-and-mortar organization.","The second, though, really important component, which you hit on, is really speed. And we probably would say that the biggest opportunity we have on speed is naturally inside our private and exclusive brand organization. It's half of our business. We work on longer lead times generally, and we've had success in some areas. Juniors is a great example of really driving down that cycle time and getting better top-line results and more effective inventory turnover. And so employing some of those ideas into our other business is what we're focused on now.","And I wouldn't want to go through with you each and every brand and what the lead time is today and what our goals are. And to be frank with you, in each and every brand, we probably don't have a completely clear vision on that. But we definitely want to bring it way, way down. So I think on the speed initiative, it's probably more about the private and exclusive brands.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, and then your questions on digital, I think the breakout was more like 25% ship from store, 5% buy online, pick up in store. I would expect over the next few years, the buy online pick up in store to at least double to 10%. It's possible it could get to 15%. That's sort of been a relatively common target for other retailers in our business.","We've learned that you can't market it all the time. It was critical we got good adoption, obviously, the last few days before Christmas Eve. It's a good thing to do around Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day for last-minute kind of things as people pick up gifts for that. So I think we'll learn more throughout the year now that the capability is well understood and well launched for us. And then all the traffic really came from mobile, the increases this year. You're right to think that's where it's going to come from.","I think I'm most proud of the fact that our overall conversion rate for the year approached 4% for all devices, but our conversion rate on the phone, which is a lot lower than desktop and tablet, improved 59%. So, our investments in improving the app especially was definitely well received by the customer. I think Kevin mentioned there is 11 million downloads of our app and growing, so that's a big portion of our IT investment going forward as well.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Okay. Thank you. That's super helpful. And Kevin, just lastly, personalization. I feel like this has been a topic that's come up in different ways in the past, but now seems like the right time for this being material. Can you articulate why you have conviction that personalization will really be a frontier which can drive results now?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the reason we're more and more convicted on this is that we've now had enough time under our belt in testing the impact of personalization across a wide variety of media platforms, everything from the utilization and conversion, opening and conversion of our emails, to the delivery of our direct mail vehicles, to the utilization that customers have around our app, which is of course highly personalized. So I think what's driving probably the stronger language about the critical nature of personalization to improving sales productivity on our advertising expense is we now have a pretty long track record of the testing and the piloting. We have to convert that now. We have to scale it and we have to apply it to every single platform we have because that to us is going to be the long-term success.","It's not that unlike the localization initiatives importance to our inventory management. While we know we've got to drive down inventory per store and utilize our store inventory to help fulfill this growing online demand, we also know the most important thing we have to do is provide more localized assortments that are more attractive to the customers in the trade areas in which the stores sit.. So personalization is the most important thing that we have as a tool to drive advertising expense down over time. And given it's our second biggest expense center that's a pretty important initiative.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Okay. That's perfect. Thanks for that, and great job on all that innovation. Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Hey, thanks, guys. It's Tracy filling in for Paul. I had a question about credit. I was wondering if you've seen any change in the quality of your portfolio or like a rise in delinquencies? And what are you expecting for credit income in 2016? And then just a quick follow up on that small store format, I'm just wondering what the key areas are that you expect you'll be reducing in size in that store? Thanks.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","We haven't seen any deterioration. Our loss rate for the year was exactly the same as last year at 3.7%. I would expect our credit income to rise modestly predicated on how successful we are at adding people to the credit file. This past year we focused a lot on loyalty and not as much on credit, and our applications were a little bit down to last year. But I would expect as we've anniversaried loyalty and we saw this in the fourth quarter, our approved applications were actually up. So that gives me confidence that we'll grow our credit file in 2016. And then the small store question?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think categories that will be downsized or maintained. I mean, I think generally \u2013 we haven't disclosed, Tracy, the specifics around the small stores either in terms of their locations or the category assortments that'll be inside the store. I would say generally though the way you should think about it is the broad-based categories that are contained inside of a Kohl's store will be represented in the new stores as well, but categories that have exhibited a very high level of digital demand will probably have further reductions in their space and assortment than other categories because our sense is that we can fulfill much of that in a digital way inside the store.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Kayla R. Wesser - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Good morning. This is Kayla Wesser on for Neely this morning. Just two quick questions. One about loyalty. I know you mentioned that they spent a lot more in the quarter. I'm just curious if you could give any more color on the bounce-backs, maybe in post-holiday especially if you saw the visits \u2013 return visits or the spend that you were expecting maybe outside of the winter impacted areas? And then also just, buy online pick up in store, where are the attachment rates trending, and they're kind of where you guys expected them? Thanks.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, on the buy online pick up in store, that's an easy one. On average, it's been about 25%, it was actually more during holiday. On loyalty, we obviously had a lot more dollars since we had a lot more customers bounce-back in January, we did see a slight deterioration in the response rate. One thing I probably made a mistake on is when you double the size of your file, not everybody loves Kohl's equally, and as you add the later adopters to loyalty, they're not going to respond as quickly. So that's some learning, we'll do a better job of planning in 2016 because of that.","Kayla R. Wesser - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti of UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to \u2013 Wes, a couple of questions for the CFO, off this year maybe. I want to make sure I understand the D&A with the step change higher, and CapEx, and then I know some of the investments have been in IT, which I would've thought would've had a faster amortization cycle to them. I think you guys talked about that. And I know you mentioned maybe some of the store closures have a D&A component. But maybe you could just help me think about the push and pull on the D&A going down next year a little bit closer?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Well, most of it's because $7 million comes out because of the store closures.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","And the others aren't enough to override that I guess, huh?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Well, we spent \u2013 last year, we spent $934 million, what'd I say, $940 million for this year. So it's a little bit of a rise. And we've been spending a boatload of money on IT for a number of years, so we're starting to cycle through that. The average life of an IT project ranges from three years to five years, but I would say more and more we're using three years just because the innovation is so \u2013 the cycle is so short.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then I understand the comments, thanks for the comments on looking at the leverage point for the future, Kevin. I wanted to make sure I understand the components of the SG&A guidance for 2016. And I know you just said you're planning credit up as an offset, but in the past, you said 2% SG&A growth, and this year, a touch below that. If I had to think about the buckets, you'll have healthcare and wages going up in the stores. Can you just help us understand the remainder of \u2013 where the remainder of the cost control to come in below that 2% target you had before? If it's between corporate overhead, ad spend and the credit you mentioned versus the store level costs?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Well, from my perspective, again, the store closures help them. We said it was $44 million or $45 million. So you can take a portion of that for the year depending on when we close the store in June. And that's embedded in the guidance. Store payroll is going to grow. We're seeing the wage pressure. We're not immune to it. Other people have reported, said it's a pressure. In this quarter, it's going to be a pressure. This year, it's more than a third of our overall SG&A, so that's going up. I think we can be more efficient, like I mentioned in ship-from-store and BOPUS. That will help mitigate that.","We actually experienced healthcare deflation this year. We had a tremendous year in terms of that, knock on wood. We were lucky we didn't have a ton of large claims which can really swing it one way or the other. But we've made a lot of plan changes and wellness initiatives. We have a relatively young population that helps as well. But we're going to cut advertising. I think Bob asked, we spent $1.11 billion this year. We wanted to spend $1 billion. The goal is to spend $1 billion this year. So maybe we'll spend even a little bit less than that.","We can get more efficient in the e-commerce fulfillment centers, and we're going to get more efficient in corporate with the reorganization that we had. We have to be smarter about when positions open up, not filling them and just increasing speed across the organization. I think that will be a big help. But those are the buckets we're going to try to do to offset. IT expense is also going to go up. I mean, we're spending a bunch of money in IT, so IT in stores are going up. Everything else pretty much has to go down somehow.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean the 35% to 40% of our expense that is essentially store payroll, that's going up. So we're planning it to go up, that's just a fact. Things like the reorganization, things across the company in the other 65% we've been working on. This is not something we're starting last week. We've been working on reducing those forward-looking expenses. And one of the things that's going to be a big component part of that that we sort of alluded to, but I think honestly has a big impact, is lower inventory level. Lower inventory level is less material handling, it's less distribution expense, it's significantly less workload in the store, and that has a big impact in a positive way on store payroll. So our average hourly wage is going up. But if we're putting a lot less inventory in the store, there's a lot less work to do on the store's part to handle it.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Just because it's critical \u2013 sorry, just because the fourth quarter is so important, and I know you guys were rethinking advertising as you went through fourth quarter last year, is advertising planned up in the fourth quarter this year?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We haven't gotten that far to that quarter.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, we planned the fall season, but I mean there's not a Star Wars movie to my knowledge, so we won't have to spend money on that.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, honestly, I wouldn't think of \u2013 I think Wes just said we spent $1.11 billion or $1.12 billion in marketing this past year. I wouldn't think about \u2013 I wouldn't take away from this discussion, hey, they're going to dramatically lower the amount of marketing they spend. We're talking about on the edges. We're talking about reducing it by $10 million on a $1 billion base. The more important thing for us that we just touched on with a caller or two ago is we've got to make that $1 billion work harder through personalization. That's really the win and then the other things become savings.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No problem.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","As you think about your ongoing clearance and what seems to be something that's going on across the space, can you provide any color on how much of these margin pressures are driven by cyclical or seasonal issues versus something structural such as increasing price transparency particularly with the growth in mobile?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is all about liquidating.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","This is all about cold weather merchandise.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. This is all about liquidating and getting out of our holiday cold weather inventories through the early part of the first quarter and repositioning our inventories at a lower level going forward.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Fair enough. And then as a follow-up to I believe Matt's question earlier on store closings, how does the performance of the remaining base of stores look? Specifically, is there a wide range or is it fairly tight?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, it's always been relatively fairly tight. What happens is regionally each quarter, I hate to use the word weather, but the facts are weather can positively influence a quarter's results in a region and negatively influence another quarter's results. So the West Coast got better results because they had better weather. And the Midwest or Mid-Atlantic got lower results. But the spectrum across from a store comp perspective, I mean, it's not like there's a dramatic difference in sales.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah. The sales \u2013 the comp sales really aren't driving the closure decisions. It's really about the fixed cost and our ability to manage the other lines of expenses to make them more positive. And then the biggest thing that changed honestly in the first quarter is our digital orders grew 30% on a very large base.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In the fourth quarter.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","In the fourth quarter, sorry. And that was something that was unexpected. We far exceeded our plan on digital for the fourth quarter, so that was really sort of the ah-ha moment if you want to say that about how to take a look at the store base with a more critical eye.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And one last one if I may. It's just on the smaller format stores. Are some of these, I know you're not announcing explicitly where they're going to be, but are some of these going to be in the markets where you are closing? And is that part of the thought process that you could potentially downsize some of the existing base?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","They're not in the markets in which we are closing.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","But that's a good thought.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And frankly we did that intentionally because we didn't want to make the results of these stores driven by anything else that was happening in that market. But having said that, I still think the biggest opportunity for the small store pilot will be as we review our overall store portfolio, as leases become up over time, if we're able to prove successful in this much smaller store and leverage the digital growth in our business, I think that could be a major change for us in terms of our expense structure and our fixed costs, as Wes just alluded to.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","And it doesn't have to be 35,000 square foot stores. We have plenty of 64,000 square foot stores and 55,000 square foot stores, so it's more about having the toolbox to better right size the store base as we move forward.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks again. Best of luck this year.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","All right. Thank you.

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Wes McDonald, Chief Financial Officer of Kohl's Department Stores. Please go ahead.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thank you. With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President. I'll walk us through some of our results for the quarter, then Kevin will give you guys some more color on merchandising and marketing initiatives.","From a sales perspective, comp sales decreased 1.8% for the quarter. Transactions per store were down 2.6% while average transaction value was up 0.8%. Within the average transaction value, average unit retail was up 2.6% while units per transaction were down 1.8%. Total sales for the quarter were $4.4 billion, a decrease of 1.6% from the third quarter last year. And year-to-date, comp sales decreased 2.2% and total sales decreased 1.9% to $12.7 billion. Kevin will share some more details on our sales in a couple of minutes.","Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 37.2%, 28 basis points lower than the third quarter of last year. National brand sales penetration increased 230 basis points during the quarter. As expected, this reduced gross margin by approximately 12 basis points.","The remaining decrease was due to lower margin rates across our brands. Year-to-date, margin was consistent with last year. SG&A dollars increased 2% or $24 million over last year and deleveraged 90 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the third quarter of last year. Most of the increase in SG&A dollars versus last year was related to a change in our incentive compensation accrual. Last year, we lowered our expected payout during the third quarter, resulting in favorability and bonus expense.","Our credit card business reported a $7 million increase in revenues this quarter. In our stores both store payroll and store controllable costs decreased versus last year. Our retail distribution centers reported lower costs, but our E-Commerce fulfillment centers reported higher costs with the revenue growth.","Advertising costs were also higher as we launched our loyalty program nationwide in the third quarter. And we continue to invest in technology. Year-to-date, SG&A was relatively flat to last year and deleveraged 50 basis points as a percent of sales.","Depreciation and interest expenses were consistent with last year. Our income tax rate was 35.3% for the quarter. This is almost 200 basis points better than last year as we had favorable state tax audit settlements during the quarter.","Diluted earnings per share decreased 14% to $0.70 for the quarter. Year-to-date earnings per share decreased 3% to $2.43. Net income was $142 million for the quarter and $498 million year-to-date.","We ended the quarter with 1,163 stores, gross foot -- square footage of 100,494,000 square feet and selling square footage of 83,000,833. During the third quarter, we opened stores in 3 new locations and reopened 1 store, which had closed in the first quarter for a complete rebuild.","We completed our final 2 remodels for the year early in this quarter. This is in addition to the 16 remodels completed during the second quarter and the 15 remodels that were completed in the first quarter. The total remodels for the year were 33 versus 30 last year.","Year-to-date capital expenditures were $561 million, which is 900 -- $96 million higher than the first 9 months of 2013. The increase reflects our continued investment in the company and is attributable to higher spending in substantially all categories: remodels, IT, call center operations and our corporate campus.","We ended the quarter with $631 million of cash and cash equivalents, and generated almost $300 million of free cash flow year-to-date. Free cash flow was negatively impacted by the higher capital expenditures, as well as higher tax payments during the quarter.","Despite the lower-than-expected sales, inventory per store is flat to last year. Units per store are 3% lower than 2013 levels.","AP as a percent of inventory increased from 45.6% at quarter end 2013 to 47.9% this year. Weighted average diluted shares for the quarter and shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were both 203 million. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our stock. Yesterday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.39 per share, which is payable December 24 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 10.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide additional insights on our results.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks, Wes. As Wes mentioned, our third quarter comps decreased 1.8%. This is about 40 basis points lower than the guidance that we provided before last month's investor conference.","Our guidance at that time assumed we would hit our internal plans for the final week of the month. Unfortunately, week 4 store sales remained challenging, and we did not achieve those plans.","Geographically, results were generally consistent across all regions for the quarter. The Midwest was the strongest region. The strong back-to-school season offset a very weak October. The South Central was the most difficult region for the second consecutive quarter.","By line of business, children's continues to outperform other businesses and reported a low single-digit comp increase for the quarter. Online sales were especially strong. Accessories, footwear and men's were slightly negative, but outperformed the company average. Accessories was again led by our beauty business, and handbags were also positive. In footwear, athletic shoes and men's dress and casual shoes were the strongest categories. And in men's, young men's and active sales increased. Home and women's underperformed the company. National brand comps were higher than private and exclusive comps for the fifth consecutive quarter, and were actually positive for the second consecutive quarter.","As most of you know, on October 29, we held our first investor conference in 7 years. And during that conference, we introduced our leadership team and provided considerable detail about our 3-year plan, what we call the Greatness Agenda. I'm not going to reiterate the comments made in that conference, so I encourage you to review the presentations, the transcripts and the webcast, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website, if you haven't done so already.","This 3-year plan, however, is focused on improving our top line performance. And the initial impact of many of these initiatives resulting from this plan will be in our stores this holiday season. First, buy online, pick-up-in-store is being tested in 100 of our stores with the full rollout expected during next spring. It's available in the Chicago, Milwaukee and San Diego markets. We haven't put our full marketing force behind it yet, but we're very pleased with the attachment sales, which are running in the mid-teens.","Second, going into holiday we'll be shipping from 800 of our stores. This allows us to ship from locations that are closer to our customers than our traditional fulfillment centers. More importantly, it provides much-needed distribution capacity as we enter the peak holiday season.","Third, our new beauty department was introduced into another 178 stores in August and September. This is in addition to the 47 stores that were completed in July. Stores with the new beauty department continue to outperform other stores, both in the beauty department itself and across the whole store. We continue to see total store lifts versus our control groups of approximately 2% in the higher-volume stores.","Fourth, we are now scaling our personalization platform, and over 90 million customer connections will be personalized this holiday season. We've seen significant lifts in our testing earlier this year, and believe it will provide great benefits this holiday.","And last and definitely the most impactful is loyalty. Loyalty was launched in all stores on October 6. Prior to the Nationwide launch, the program was tested in various formats in Texas, California, along with the Pittsburgh, Milwaukee and Seattle markets. During the year and a half that we tested the program, we enrolled approximately 10 million customers in the loyalty rewards program. Since the launch in October alone, we enrolled over 6 million additional customers. And as of today, we now have 17.3 million customers enrolled in loyalty.","We continue to be extremely excited about the program. Our tests have shown that the program is working. Loyalty customers make 2 extra trips and spent an incremental $80 per year. Even more exciting is the fact that almost 60% of enrollees are non-Kohl's charge customers. And enrollment in the program provides us with customer-specific data that we will further enhance through personalization.","Looking forward, we believe we will run a positive comp between 2% and 3% in the fourth quarter. We arrived at that by taking our year-to-date underlying performance in our stores, adding our expected omni-channel performance in the fourth quarter and the impact of the extra shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas along with, and importantly, the impact of the initiatives I've discovered.","And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first we'll go to Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","The details regarding loyalty -- I had a question regarding that. Are you most encouraged for the opportunity for traffic or check as a loyalty program plays out throughout the year? And then I also had a product question in terms of outerwear. How was it relative to your plan in terms of how you planned that category and the inventory composition now?","Kevin Mansell","I can -- Oliver, it's Kevin. I can answer the first part. Maybe Wes knows the answer to the second one, specifically. I think loyalty is all about traffic. And in particular, it's all about really embracing and engaging new customers. So the thing that makes us very excited about loyalty is that in the test, customers are taking 2 extra trips to Kohl's, and 60% approximately of the loyalty enrollees are non-Kohl's charge customers. So that's the really big positive for loyalty. On outerwear, Wes, you know the...","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, women's outerwear is off to a pretty good start this quarter. It's a small percentage of the business, as well as men's is off to a little bit of a slow start. For the season, we planned outerwear down pretty significantly, given last year's extremely cold winter.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up on the details on the challenging week 4, do you expect the volatility to kind of continue as you look forward into the holiday season? Or how might that extrapolate given that you do have a fair degree of confidence on the -- looking for the 2% to 3%?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, we've -- what we try to do is give you a lot of insight into how we arrive at our expected performance. And it -- fundamentally, we didn't want to make any assumptions on an improved underlying trend. So the underlying trend that we've utilized is basically, the trend that we've had in our stores on a year-to-date basis. We're not assuming that's going to improve. It would be great if it did, if loyalty has the kind of impact that we think it will. It may, but we didn't want to make that assumption. There is definitely volatility in the business. I think fourth week of October was, by far, the worst week of the month. It was definitely worse than we even expected. And just as noticeably, once the weather cooled, going into this month, the first 2 weeks of this month have spiked dramatically. So I think volatility is just something that we come to expect.","Operator","And we'll go to Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions. One was related to the earnings guidance that you had provided previously. Is that -- is there upside to that guidance if you hit the 2% to 3% comp guidance that you provided today? I know you provided the guidance to different points in times, so I just wanted to be clear on that.","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I think we updated the guidance before Analyst Day. No, the 2% to 3% would get us to the low end of the range. I would expect continued margin to be pressured somewhat. I would hope that we would get better than last year, but we've heard from some of our competitors already, it seems like it's going to be a very promotional holiday season. So within those plans, I think margin is planned slightly down. SG&A is going to grow faster than it has throughout the first 9 months, partly because of some of the initiatives we talked about. The incremental beauty stores and loyalty are incremental to the fourth quarter. They provide great sales opportunities, but they also have expenses associated with them.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, said another way, I think, Dan, what we're saying is, we feel pretty confident about the sales side, but we also expect and have assumed that our margin -- our merchandise margin is going to be pressured. I think on the expense side, Wes recapped it well, which is, we have, we think pretty good visibility and we've exhibited a pretty strong ability to manage expenses. So I think on that line, we feel good.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then -- do you expect inventory per store by the end of Q4 to be down low single or less?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I think we'll be down 3% to 4% assuming we hit the sales plan. So we brought in a lot more -- a lot fewer receipts, excuse me, for the fall season. So that was planned and we'll continue to plan that throughout next year as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So you rolled out the loyalty program in early October, and October obviously wasn't a great month. How do you expect the sales cadence to begin to come into the majority of your stores now that loyalty is rolled out?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, what we're -- I would say that particularly given the softness in traffic in October, the fact that we were able to get so many people engaged in the loyalty program anyway is a really positive sign for their -- our ability to continue to enroll this month as traffic has improved a lot. The way the loyalty program works, as you know, Lorraine, it's all about earning rewards and then redeeming rewards. And so the impact of enrolling and engaging a whole bunch of new customers is always felt afterwards. So those 6 million customers we enrolled are activating and engaging now. And the customers that we enrolled this month are going to be activating and engaging next month. So it's definitely a forward look.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then what do you think caused the traffic to spike in early November?","Wesley S. McDonald","Weather. I mean, the weather was poor. In October, you heard a lot of our competitors, along with ourselves, talk about that. The weather has gotten much better in the first 2 weeks of November and that helps when you sell apparel.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So the -- as you continue to roll out the national brands, PUMA, et cetera, coming next year. Wes, what's your expectation for the penetration? I know you mentioned 230 basis points this quarter. How do you imagine that over the next 12 months? And also, could you just help us with an average of the spread between the AURs of your national brands and private label?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I mean, I think the penetration will continue to increase. I hope the private brand performance improves as well so the -- I don't expect it to increase 200 basis points each quarter. I think the private brands were somewhat hurt by the bad weather, a lot of the private brands that we have are more key item driven. So things that are more in need-based versus collections, the collections usually fall in our exclusive brands, but I suspect next year, national brands will continue to improve, maybe a couple of hundred basis points, but I would think a little bit less. One of the things I pointed out in the script, hopefully, you guys caught it, was the effect on our margin rate has been pretty consistent to what we told you guys, the 4 to 7 basis points for every 100 basis points of deterioration. But I, obviously, hope the private brands gets a little bit better. PUMA is starting out in the spring in a small number of categories. I think it's more the accumulation of the national brands that we introduced over the next couple of years that will drive the incremental growth. Any one brand in itself is not going to drive that much.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And as we think about the apparel business, I mean, obviously, you guys weren't the only ones to have a difficult time in 3Q, particularly given the weather. As you put together the forecast for the fourth quarter and the long-term plan that you provided us at the Analyst Day, what are you baking in from a market standpoint in terms of industry growth within women's apparel, within ready-to-wear, within children's? Just curious to the extent you expect your 2% to 3% comps to be more market share gains versus an overall expectation for pickup in these categories.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, we're pretty much assuming that we have to drive market share and drive traffic. We're not assuming that there's any either inflation or increase in apparel overall sales that would drive our total sales up. So it's got to be about our own initiatives, take share, not about a rising tide lifting everybody. It's been a flat business and I think we're assuming it's going to continue that way.","Wesley S. McDonald","And to you earlier point, national brands are going to carry a little bit higher AUR, so I'm fairly confident that our average transaction value will continue to rise. What we have to do and what we've talked about, not only a few weeks ago but consistently, we have to stabilize traffic, and that's the key for us. To drive that 2% to 3% comp, we have to have traffic be flat to slightly negative. The basket should provide the lift to get to the 2% to 3% comp.","Operator","Our next question is from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Wes, on that point, you've seen a -- what, a 2.6% decline in the number of transactions in Q3. Could you break out for us kind of what traffic versus conversion means? And then, I guess, where we're going with this is for Q3, the big trend, are you actually comping positive traffic thus far in Q -- quarter-to-date with the weather?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, on the transactions per store, we don't really -- I mean, we have traffic counters in about 150 of our stores, but not enough to give a true sample. So the transactions per store is really what we call traffic. So when you're coming to our store, we're not usually in a mall, so it's usually a destination so our conversion rates are probably higher than most mall-based retailers, but we're really looking at transactions per store. Other than just saying that the business has improved quite a bit in the first 2 weeks, I don't really want to get into the color of transactions per store. Cold weather, obviously, drives people to the store. And when they come, they buy apparel.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then just 1 other question then, if I may. In terms of ship-from-store versus ship-from-DC, could you remind us again the cost savings or just the overall cost differential of that and how much do you factor that into your Q4 implied guidance in terms of maybe basis points of impact to the P&L?","Wesley S. McDonald","It's not really cost savings, to be honest: the labor is a little cheaper, the cost to ship is a little higher. It's really about speed and capacity. So it cuts off, on average, a day to get it from the store to the customer, and then we just need the extra capacity. Because we have a tremendous spike that starts in a couple of weeks, the week of the Black Friday and then really lasts for 2 to 3 weeks before it starts to come down a little bit. So we need those 800 stores for the excess capacity, first and foremost. And then speed is certainly an added benefit to that. So the effect on the P&L is more about, with all of the plans that we've made for adding capacity and above that, some productivity improvements, we feel like we won't have to expedite as near as many shipments as we had to last year, that's where the savings is going to be in gross margin.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Paul Swinand with Morningstar.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wanted to drill down on the traffic drivers again a little bit. You talked about beauty and some of the other initiatives. Are you finding that that's connecting with new customers that weren't Kohl's shoppers? Or is it merely the attachment rate and the higher spend per visit?","Wesley S. McDonald","On beauty it's really both. The basket, for sure, is getting bigger with the addition of beauty, but where we're getting the lift in the higher-volume stores is on the repeat business. It's really about driving a replenishment purchase. We don't sell a lot of groceries or things that people run out of. Beauty is probably the closest thing to a commodity that we have. So the key, where we've been getting the total store lift, it's bringing them back in more often.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then I know you've talked a little bit about, you're trying to drive share and that's an important part and that you've been having more competition from the off-price channel. Have you done any analysis of where off-price is still opening stores and can you see the impact? And do you see that sort of finishing at some point since the network of off-price is maybe already built out?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes. The off-price stores, when they open, hit our stores if they're close to them by maybe a couple hundred thousand dollars a store, on average. So it's not a significant hit in the first year, and then we kind of go back to where we were comping prior to that. But it definitely is a hit and certainly, given their outsized growth over the last year -- last few years has hurt our comps, especially as some of the competitors, like Ross, expand more into the Midwest areas where they haven't really concentrated before.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, but do you think that will abate as the store growth slows or...","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, if they don't open as many stores, yes, we won't get hit as much, but I'm not privy to their store opening plan. So they tend to grow faster than the rest of us do in the industry. So -- and I still expect it to be somewhat of a headwind, but if you're saying that they're going to open fewer stores, that certainly would help us.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple on E-Commerce. Can you just talk about the acceleration that you had seen in the beginning of the year? And just how much of that is coming from new versus existing customers? And are there any differences in the trends online by category or region that you can call out relative to the store?","Wesley S. McDonald","In terms of traffic, I think over the last 4 months, we've talked about it in the past. The increase in traffic was really a result of the decrease in traffic last year during our re-platform, so we've kind of gone through that. In terms of categories, we still see home over-penetrating online. We continue to have opportunities in apparel. I think kids has been a category that -- we mentioned that in the call. It's been a way for us to sell other categories associated with children's, like baby year and strollers and things like that, that we don't carry in the store. But since the customer knows us for kids apparel and believe we provide good value, that's been a big growth area for us. Where we have to do better online is really in apparel and specifically, in women's apparel. I think that's a big opportunity for us. In terms of by region, you don't really see any big differences. Where we're more productive in terms of sales per store: Midwest, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic. They tend to have higher E-Com sales as well -- share of store. There is a little bit of increase on the West Coast, but it's really driven by where we do well in the stores.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Next one, just a quick follow-up, you did mention there was -- the re-platforming last year. Can you just remind us what the impact was and maybe even help quantify some of that in the fourth quarter?","Wesley S. McDonald","On the fourth -- I mean, our -- the first -- the fourth quarter, I think, our E-Com business will be up 20% to 25% is kind of what we're planning.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But I guess in terms of the margin or SG&A hits from some of the re-platforming and the disruption that was seen even from a distribution standpoint, I was just hoping to get a better sense of what that impact was.","Kevin Mansell","Yes. I mean, Stephen, I think Wes sort of covered looking back why the third quarter was particularly strong, which was a comparative to last year and our re-platform. As we look at the fourth quarter, you may remember that we had to navigate through a number of customer service issues online and many of the initiatives that we just spoke about relative to ship-from-store, buy online, pick-up-in-store and preparedness for holiday on E-Com are focused on dealing with that. So I think our sense is that the third quarter sales increase of roughly 30% will probably not be replicated in the fourth quarter, but the fourth quarter continues to be a pretty big opportunity for us online because we were not able to service the way we would have liked to last year.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo.","And we will move on to Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Robert Scott Drbul - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Kevin, just following up on the last answer that you gave. Within the sort of the logistical challenges that you had on the E-Commerce business last year in the fourth quarter, how does that really play into the gross margin guidance for this year and what you're seeing in the fourth quarter?","Kevin Mansell","I mean, basically, Bob, it does -- overcoming and preparing for this holiday, overcoming last year's issues doesn't have much to do with how we're looking at merchandise margin for the fourth quarter. The impact of online in the fourth quarter really has to do with mix, right? Online, we think is going to run up well over 20%. And as you know, our merchandise margins online are lower, primarily due to mix. So that's all implied in our expectations for our earnings.","Wesley S. McDonald","Also, our strongest business is kids, and that's a business that has a little bit lower margin. Our toy business is off to an extremely good start this year. Again, that's also a lower-margin business. So we're trying to be cognizant of the fact that the mix might not go our way in the fourth quarter. So all things being equal, if we had the same mix as last year and you added in the fact that we had all those expedited costs, we certainly would have margin improvement, but it's not looking -- so far, after a couple of weeks, that's the way it's playing out.","Robert Scott Drbul - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And Kevin, just a couple of product questions for you. Can you talk a little bit about the Juicy business in terms of the velvet crush collection, in terms of the jackets or the bottoms, like what have you learned, so far, on that launch?","Kevin Mansell","Bob, you ask some really detailed questions that I often struggle with answering. I can tell you this about Juicy: Juicy had a great launch. Juicy performed exceptionally well in certain parts of the country and as expected, not quite as well in other parts. From a classification perspective, it outperformed in some categories, for instance footwear or handbag, in particular. And the rest of the businesses we're learning. And we -- the path forward on that, I think, will play out but we still feel really strong about the overall Juicy business. I can't comment on the crushed velvet, though.","Wesley S. McDonald","I'll dabble on the merchant side of it, in terms of anything that's easily identifiable as Juicy has been selling very well. The stuff that's more -- less logo-ed or less identifiable, that's where it struggles a little bit.","Robert Scott Drbul - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Got it. And Kev, can you talk a little bit about the J. Lo business, like the gilded glamour collection. There's a lot of like glitter going on there as well as floral. I just wondered sort of how has that been trending for you.","Kevin Mansell","Bob, are you interested in a job in merchandising? Because it sounds like you might have the affinity for it. So product development and merchandising, next time I see you, I'm going to talk to you about future career opportunities. Jennifer Lopez also is doing very well. Again, your level of detail. You got me, Bob.","Robert Scott Drbul - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And speaking of merchandising, is -- do you have any update for us?","Kevin Mansell","No, no, no update on our search. We're still focused on it. Obviously, it's a key focus of mine, but no update since a couple of weeks ago at the investor conference.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Ken -- Wes, one thing on the Click & Collect, you guys have -- gave us good update on the attachment rate or the cross-shopping rate you're seeing on those test markets. But can you help us think about the actual magnitude of how big that program is as a percent of sales in the areas where you're testing it, so we can get some kind of an idea of the overall dollars of this program?","Wesley S. McDonald","No, not really yet, to be honest with you. We just started in October. It's in 3 markets and we really haven't had a chance to market it. We're really focusing more on operational right now and trying to determine what the effect of promise window is. Right now we're at 4 hours, we'd like to bring that down to 2, and that's really what we're focused on. So we'll definitely update you with more details on that once we roll it out next spring. The goal is to roll it out in the second quarter sometime. We're shooting for May 1. That's sort of the internal goal. We'll, hopefully, be able to hit that. But once we put the marketing behind it like some of our competitors have in terms of tab an even in broadcast, in some cases, I think we'll be able to better understand the demand. Right now the demand is pretty low given that we're really not marketing it.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just a couple of questions to help with model here for the -- going forward. You said things have spiked with weather here, but you also commented that you're planning outerwear down after a long cold weather season last year. Can you talk about any flexibility you may have to chase or even just to pull-forward deliveries to national brands?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, yes, outerwear is one of the easiest categories to chase because a lot of the product that we buy is from folks that have warehouses here in the U.S. So that's something that we can easily chase, so I'm not too concerned about that.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then if I just look at your guidance for the comps in the fourth quarter, it seems like you'd need the transaction count to go positive. It would be first time we'd see that in a while to get to that number. You are lapping a pretty easy comparison on the transaction count you gave us in the fourth quarter. But maybe just a little bit of thinking along the 3 components that you give us every quarter for comps on how you get to your fourth quarter number?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, I think the traffic is going to have to be pretty much flat and the rest is going to come from ticket. The AUR we've talked about has been consistently up a couple percent. We hope to improve on clearance, which should help drive that AUR, and hopefully, people are feeling a little bit better economically and they'll put another unit in the basket. So -- but yes, the traffic is definitely going to have to improve. No question about that.","Operator","And our next question is from Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just curious, what's driving AUR higher? Is -- just if you look at national brands versus national brands last year and private versus private, are you seeing increases there? I'm just wondering how much of it is the mix one versus the other versus like-for-like?","Wesley S. McDonald","I mean, it's -- like-for-like is not up. That's pretty easy to answer. So it's all coming from mix, and I'd say a majority of it is coming from national brands. There is some benefit from clearance, but most of it is coming from national brands.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then just on IZOD and Juicy, obviously, October seemed to have fallen short of your expectations, but just wondering if those 2 met your expectations in terms of the percentage of the box that they represented post-launch? And an even bigger picture, when you guys have a brand launch such as those, how do you plan it in terms of what percent it should represent of the total box?","Wesley S. McDonald","I mean, I think from what -- what I would say, they both got off to a good start. I think IZOD did probably did a little bit better in October than Juicy. And how we really plan it is it should be incremental to what it replaced. Our rule of thumb is the cleanest thing that we've used, is what happened when we brought in Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony. We got a little less than 100 basis points lift from that, so that's kind of how we planned the business. I'd say that's how we've done going forward, and we don't really have enough data yet to make the call on whether we'll hit it. That's what we put into the plans to hit. So IZOD is a little bit different because we want to make sure that it doesn't cannibalize other brands in the store and we've built that into some of our thinking. So that might not provide as big an incremental lift as Juicy, which in some cases is replacing either -- some underperforming brands.","Operator","Next we'll go to Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on guidance. The company does have the various comp drivers of loyalty, beauty, marketing and the new products. At the Analyst Day, you laid out the potential contribution on a 3-year basis. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit more about the order of magnitude each of these should present in Q4 and early '15. Just the plan calling for 400 basis points plus of sequential improvement: trying to get a better sense of the buildup to that number.","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I mean, it's pretty simple. We're planning the basis down 4%, which is what we're running. And then we're planning digital up between 20% an 25%, which is kind of what I mentioned. The additional day is worth about $90 million to $100 million. Personalization is worth about $50 million. Beauty's not worth a lot because it's only in small number of incremental stores, so maybe $10 million. Loyalty is worth about $60 million. So if you do the math on that, you get to a 2.5 comp. '15, we'll talk about more lately, but if you're looking out now we'd use 150-basis-point lift for 71% -- or roughly 70% of our stores. And beauty, we'll have to give you more granular guidance in February, because I don't have the exact rollout plan for the 400 stores we expect to add next year.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's really helpful. And then if I'm looking at Q4, if the comp is trending below that 2% to 3% expectation, do you have any levers on the cost side that you can pull in order to still get close to the low end of the guidance range?","Wesley S. McDonald","I mean, we try to manage it as best as we can. That's kind of what we get paid to do, so -- and we're not going to cut advertising. That's pretty much done. We'll have to flex store payroll if we can and there's other levers. If there's not unit demand out there, and the miss is coming from E-Com, which I highly doubt, but we could pull levers on that. So we always try to do the best we can. We focus on trying to deliver the earnings number and we have a lot of different levers to pull. In the fourth quarter, your advertising is big. There's nothing you can do there. That's about the only thing I would say is fixed. Store payroll, we can flex a little bit.","Operator","And next we'll go to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm wondering, Wes, in the fourth quarter, with your guidance of 2% comp at the low end, would you be expecting SG&A to deleverage at that level? I know you said that you expect it to grow faster in Q4, but would -- are you planning SG&A dollars to deleverage at the low end of your comp range?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes. I mean, as I mentioned in the earlier questions, we have incremental things like more beauty stores and the loyalty program, which add incremental cost to last year. I still would expect to be at the low end of the 1.5% to 2.5% guidance that we gave for SG&A dollar growth at the beginning of the year, for the year.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Kevin, loyalty benefits, can you just help us understand the difference in the benefits in the loyalty program to consumers who are not Kohl's credit card shoppers? And I think you said at the Analyst Day that if you are a Kohl's credit card holder, you can also sign up for the loyalty program. I would assume those benefits will be a little bit different, but just help us understand those 2 different types of benefits, if you could. And Wes, where do the costs associated with the loyalty program show up in your P&L?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, the loyalty program is pretty easy to explain, it's tender agnostic. So whether you're a credit card customer or a non-credit card customer, you get the same benefits. There's more aspects of the program in terms of sharing and surprise, but the basic premise of the program is for every 100 points you get, you get a $5 reward that we give to you each month and you have 30 days to spend it. So the benefits are the same. If you're a credit card customer, obviously there are credit events each month and other benefits you get for being a credit card customer, but they're not associated with the loyalty program. The benefits are exactly the same, no matter who you are, for loyalty. In terms of cost, the actual reward shows up as a markdown, so that would affect gross margin, and the various costs associated with marketing the program, graphics in the stores, things like that which show up in SG&A.","Operator","Our next question is from Stacie Rabinowitz with Consumer Edge Research.","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I was just wondering what kind of synergies you're seeing among the different initiatives that you're counting on for growth right now? So are you seeing loyalty members buying more national brand versus private band? Are you seeing loyalty members buying more beauty? Are you seeing any beauty-national brand overlap?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, up until recently, we've kept loyalty and beauty relatively separate. So I don't have a good answer for you on that. I'd tell you the non-credit card customers, in general, and newer credit card customers -- or new -- or newer customers tend to have more of an affinity towards national brands, because that's what they know and like. Once they start shopping Kohl's more frequently, they understand the value of our private and exclusive brands. But to get them in the door, it's really with the national brands.","Operator","And we'll go to Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","You didn't mention the West Coast ports, port slowdown whatever issues that are going on out there. Did that have any impact? Or has that had any impact on the business. Just from a product flow standpoint, is that something to think about?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I think looking backwards, yes, there are categories and classifications within the business that were negatively impacted by slowdowns in deliveries. Obviously, to a great degree, we anticipated what happened, and so we did pull up a lot of receipts into the third quarter to accommodate it, but there were still further delays that impacted it. I would say, overall, I don't think it made a difference in traffic for the third quarter. And that's really what drove the slowdown in sales in October, is fewer customers coming into the stores. As we look at the fourth quarter, it's really more about an item issue. So there are going to be probably items that we will have planned to have had on hand and they will not be delivered on the time we thought. But on a broad basis, I don't believe it's going to have any big impact.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes. And also, I mean, just the way that our distribution centers are located across the country, we basically have a 50-50 split between East and West Coast predicated by where our distribution centers are, and that hasn't changed. That's something that we just do as a matter of course of business. So some of the stuff we bring in isn't really affected.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the -- just on the comp variants in the third quarter versus the guidance that you gave right before the investor event, the 40 basis point slip, so to speak. You said much of that was in the final week, which you didn't -- which didn't go as you were planning it. How about just the EPS number of $0.70, how did that compare to your internal plan, if you care to talk about that?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, we don't give quarterly guidance anymore. So I'm not really interested in talking about that because that was -- we're sticking with our annual guidance. And the miss was really just, as you mentioned, in the fourth week. We obviously had a number that we went with when we had the Analyst Day and we missed our plan in the rest of the week.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Did -- I guess, does it have an impact on the guidance -- the EPS guidance that you gave at that time for the low end of that 405 to 440 -- 445 range?","Wesley S. McDonald","No. I mean, we -- no.","Operator","Our next question is from Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","As we get towards post-holiday and the importance of post-holiday with gift cards, how are you planning post-holiday? Is there anything different we should be watching for this year as compared to last year?","Kevin Mansell","We haven't really planned this, but I think there's an opportunity for us that will be created in post-holiday around loyalty in particular, because those customers who have enrolled will have earned significant amounts of benefits that they're going to be able to use post the holiday. So we haven't really made any assumptions of the impact on traffic or sales for January as a result of that, Dana. But I think I'm pretty optimistic that, that could be a positive for us. I think that's right, Wes?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I agree.","Operator","And next we'll go to David Glick with Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Kevin, I'm just wondering how your experience with your most recent brand launches, Juicy and IZOD, how those impact your point of view going forward in terms of the types of brands that you're going to pursue next and how they fit into the sort of lifestyle continuum of contemporary versus more traditional brands?","Kevin Mansell","I think it's going to be a mix for sure. I would say for certain, we're happy with both. Not surprisingly, we spend more time looking at brands that are closer to what we already have to assess the impact on existing businesses. So I would say IZOD is a good example of that type of brand, where it's a new space for us, it's a new brand for us. We had high expectations and we pretty much exceeded those, but we're very focused on the incremental piece because we do know it's going to probably impact the existing business more. I think Wes rightfully called out Juicy as a brand that, since it's in a new space, we didn't expect it to have the type of impact elsewhere, and I don't think it did. Not surprisingly, during September when business was better, those 2 brands both performed better. And then in October, when traffic slowed, relatively, those 2 brands didn't perform as well as they did during September. So generally, David, I would say we think about the brands and their impact as we think about the open space. So if the space is wide open, probably a bigger positive-overall impact and if the space is going to affect some other things around it, probably a little bit less positive impact.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Do you think there's some white space in the men's contemporary area? I mean, you had Chaps, you added IZOD, it seems like you have traditional pretty well covered. Is that an area of opportunity that you're focused on?","Kevin Mansell","Yes, for sure.","Operator","And to the presenters, we have no further questions in queue.","Wesley S. McDonald","All right.

Sir, you may begin your conference.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thank you. With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President. I'm going to go over our financial results, and Kevin will talk about some more specifics regarding merchandising, marketing, stores. And then I'll follow-up with our guidance.","Kohl's sales for the quarter increased 2.6% to $4.5 billion. Comp store sales increased 1.1%. The comp increase reflects a 0.6% increase in average unit retail, a 1% increase in units per transaction, resulting in a 1.6% increase in average transaction value and a 0.5% decrease in number of transactions per store.","Year-to-date sales increased 1.2% to $12.9 billion, and comparable store sales decreased 0.5%. The year-to-date comp decrease reflects a 3.9% increase in average unit retail, offset partially by a 2.2% decrease in units per transaction, which resulted in average transaction value of a positive 1.7%. Transactions per store for the year are down 2.2%.","E-Commerce sales increased 50% over the third quarter 2011 to $295 million. Year-to-date, E-Commerce sales have been $782 million, 41% higher than the first 9 months of 2011. The effect on our comp was 230 basis points for the quarter and 190 basis points year-to-date.","Kohl's charge sales penetration increased 70 basis points to 58% of total sales for the quarter, and our year-to-date credit share is 57%, an increase of 165 basis points over the first 9 months of the year. Kevin will provide more color on our sales in a few minutes.","Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 38 1 -- 38.1%, 44 basis points lower than the third quarter of last year, but considerably better than our expectations of a 60 to 80 basis points decline.","SG&A dollars increased 0.6% for the quarter, consistent with our expectations of down 1% to up 1%. SG&A as a percent of sales leveraged approximately 50 basis points for the quarter and 40 basis points year-to-date. Kevin will provide some more color on expense management as well in a few minutes.","Depreciation expense was $210 million in third quarter this year and $202 million in the third quarter of last year. The increase is primarily due to IT projects. As a percentage of sales, depreciation was 4.7% for the quarter, 5 basis points higher than last year. Year-to-date, depreciation increased 6%, primarily due to new and remodeled stores and IT projects.","Net interest expense was $80 million this quarter and $243 million year-to-date. The $5 million increase over the third quarter of 2011 and a $20 million increase over the first 9 months of 2011 are primarily due to the $650 million of long-term debt issued in October of last year.","Our income tax rate was 37.8% for the quarter, slightly below our expectations of 38%.","Diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $0.91 for the quarter. Net income was $215 million for the current-year quarter and $609 million year-to-date. Year-to-date, diluted earnings per share was $2.54 this year and $2.56 last year.","Moving on to square footage. We currently have 1,146 stores with gross square footage of 99.58 million square feet and selling footage of 83.09. Square footage is approximately 1% higher than last year at this time.","We ended the quarter with $550 million in cash and cash equivalents. Capital expenditures were $641 million for the first 9 months of 2012, $114 million lower than the first 9 months of last year. The change reflects multiple changes in our capital expenditures, including fewer remodels and fall new stores, partially offset by higher IT spending. As a reminder, we opened 12 new stores this fall compared to 31 last fall. And capital expenditures are projected to be $800 million for 2012, $25 million less than our previous guidance.","Our October inventory balance was $4.8 billion, a 17% increase over October of last year, and AP as a percent of inventory was generally consistent with last year at 50.5%.","Weighted average diluted shares were 235 million for the quarter and 240 million year-to-date. Earlier this week, our board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. The dividend is payable December 26 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who'll provide additional insights in our results.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks, Wes. Let me start by adding some color to our sales results. As Wes mentioned, comparable store sales increased 1.1% for the quarter.","Footwear was the strongest category of the strength in athletic shoes. Men also outperformed the company average for the quarter with notable performance including casual sportswear, pants, basics and active. Children's reported a low single-digit increase on notable strength in toys. Home is positive, but below the company average. Better performance included bedding, electrics and bath. Women's was essentially flat for the quarter. Active was the strongest category with a double-digit increase. Updated and contemporary sportswear, classic sportswear and intimates also outperformed the company. As we expected, the juniors business continued to be challenging. Sterling silver jewelry was the strongest category in accessories. Handbags and small leather accessories and bath and beauty also outperformed the company.","From a regional perspective, the South Central was the strongest region. All regions ran from slightly positive, slightly negative.","From a brand perspective, 53% of our third quarter sales were private and exclusive Only-at-Kohl's Brands, an increase of approximately 150 basis points over the third quarter of 2011. This increase was the result of our new exclusive brands, Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Rock and Republic and Princess Vera Wang, as well as strong sales in Chaps, LC Lauren Conrad and FILA SPORT.","On Wednesday of this week, we launched the first of our DesigNation collections. This limited edition collection was designed by Narciso Rodriguez and was inspired by his recent travels to Istanbul.","On the gross margin front, as Wes indicated, our gross margin rate for the quarter was approximately 40 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2011.","We enter the holiday season with an improved understanding of how our customer responds to our pricing, fresh inventory and normalized inventory levels. Total inventory units per brick-and-mortar store are up approximately 14% over October 2011 and 3% over October 2010, meeting one of our goals in getting inventory units in the stores back to those levels. The vast majority of these increases are due to our gift and great value programs, as well as in the areas that are performing well. Our expectation by the end of the year is that unit and cost increases per store will continue to converge as we gain benefit from the lower-cost fall receipts. We will be bringing in significant amounts of transitional goods in December and early January to be better prepared for spring selling. Our expectations would be that inventory per store on a dollar and a unit basis would be up low double digits per store at the end of the fourth quarter.","On the SG&A line, we performed as expected. Our store organization continues to drive payroll efficiencies. Our fixed costs generally were flat as a percent of sales. We also reported significant leverage in our corporate operations, primarily due to lower incentive costs.","Marketing costs did leverage in the third quarter, despite spending to support brand launches, including this quarter's Princess Vera Wang launch and to reemphasize the many great ways to save at Kohl's. We would expect marketing to leverage in the fourth quarter as well.","Our credit operations slightly deleveraged to last year. Our performance will be predicated on the future on our portfolio growth and managing the customer servicing and marketing functions more efficiently. I would expect our profitability to grow in the fourth quarter versus last year, but perhaps not as fast as sales. Distribution centers also did not leverage as we continue to develop the infrastructure for our growing E-Commerce business.","We opened 12 new stores this quarter, bringing our current store count to 1,146. All but one of these 12 new stores are small stores with less than 64,000 square feet of retail space. We expect to open 12 stores in 2013, 9 in the spring and 3 in the fall. Consistent with this year's new stores, we expect all but one of the 2013 stores to be less than 64,000 square feet.","Year-to-date, we remodeled 50 stores. We expect to remodel 30 stores next year. Most of these remodels will occur in the fall season. As you know, we've temporarily reduced our remodel program until we have final results from tests we are doing in our home, accessory and beauty areas. We will make changes to our remodels based on the results of these tests and expect to accelerate our remodel program back to a more normalized run rate of approximately 100 stores per year beginning in 2014.","Last week, we announced our integrated marketing campaign emphasizing gifts to dream of at unprecedented values this holiday season. Our fourth quarter marketing will emphasize the unbeatable savings opportunities that Kohl's offers. This year, shoppers will have extra days to both earn and redeem Kohl's Cash. In addition, every day between Black Friday and Christmas Eve, Kohl's will pick up the tab for one randomly selected shopper in every store and Kohls.com as part of our Dream Receipt promotion. We will also, once again, open nationwide at 12 a.m. on Friday, November 23. Stores will be open for 24 straight hours from 12 a.m. until midnight on that day. From a media mix perspective, we intend to significantly increase our digital marketing and broadcast spending in the fourth quarter.","In closing, our improved third quarter sales results are, hopefully, a harbinger of good things to come. As we enter the critical holiday season, we believe we're in a great position. On the merchandising front, we have several brands which are new to the holiday season: Princess Vera Wang, Rock and Republic and Narciso Rodriguez. And we've reenergized several of our existing brands, Chaps, LC Lauren Conrad and FILA SPORT. As I just mentioned, our marketing program focuses on the gift opportunities and great values that are available at Kohl's. We've made a significant investment in inventory in order to improve our in-stock position. And we've invested in the Kohl's store experience, and as a result, our customer service remains best in class. We know that the economy is going to be tough, but we believe that the focus on value and gifting will win over the consumer in what we expect to be, as always, a very competitive holiday season.","Earlier this week, our Board of Directors reaffirmed our commitment to return value to our shareholders by increasing our share repurchase authorization. Our existing share repurchase program was increased by $3.2 billion, up to a $3.5 billion level. Our expectation at this time would be to repurchase the shares over the course of the next 3 years.","With that, I'll turn it back to Wes to provide our fourth quarter earnings guidance.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thanks, Kevin. Our fourth quarter earnings guidance is as follows: total sales increase of 7% to 8%. This includes the 53rd week; comparable sales increase of 3% to 4%. We expect November to be below that, December to be at the high end of the range and January to be at the low end of the range; a gross margin rate decline of 80 to 110 basis points; SG&A expenses, including the 53rd week, will increase 3.5% to 4.5%. Excluding the 53rd week, we expect SG&A to increase 1% to 2%; depreciation expense is forecasted to be $212 million; interest expense $86 million; and a tax rate of 37.8%.","Our guidance also assumes 230 million diluted shares for the fourth quarter and 237 million shares for the year. This assumes $300 million in share repurchases in the fourth quarter at an average price of $55 per share. Including these estimated share repurchases, we expect our earnings per diluted share to be $2 to $2.08 dollars for the fourth quarter. Reflecting our current results and our fourth quarter projection, our fiscal 2012 guidance has been updated to -- excuse me, $4.52 to $4.60 per diluted share from our previous guidance of $4.50 to $4.65 per diluted share. And included in these results are the following estimated impacts of the 53rd week in fiscal 2012: sales of $180 million; SG&A, $30 million; net income, $20 million; and diluted earnings per share, $0.08 per diluted share. We will give you those exact amounts at year end in order to adjust your go-forward earnings models.","And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Nathan Rich","This is Nathan Rich filling in for Deb today. I first wanted to ask about E-Commerce. It looks like you guys had the strongest E-Commerce growth that you've had in almost 2 years. Can you talk about what's driving that?","Wesley S. McDonald","I mean, I think from our perspective, it's just continuing to gain market share with the customer. I think we've invested a lot of money in digital marketing this year to drive traffic to the site. Our conversion rate is also improved over the course of the first 3 quarters. We just installed guided navigation recently, and we expect that to be a benefit for the holiday season. And we've also increased the number of SKUs we have available online. So I think it's just -- are starting to mature as a business there. And we've been behind in terms of some of our competitions, but we're catching up very rapidly.","Nathan Rich","Great. And then if I could ask one question on holiday. You guys provided a lot of color around what you're doing from an inventory and marketing standpoint. I wanted to ask how you're using technology differently this holiday season.","Wesley S. McDonald","I mean, I think from a technology perspective, we're testing a few things mostly related to E-Commerce. We're fulfilling not only from our E-Commerce fulfillment centers, but we're sending ship-alone SKUs from our 7 retail DCs. We're also testing order online, ship from store. That's just a very small test if -- and we'll get a lot of learnings in that -- from that, and that'll be very beneficial for next holiday. We have electronic signs up in almost all of our stores now, so that should save us a lot of money in terms of our ad set quantities. But those are probably the main things.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My first question is on the fourth quarter guidance. It looks like you tweaked it down a little bit from your former implied guidance that you guys gave out back in August. Just wondering if you could kind of walk us through what changed from your perspective.","Kevin Mansell","Sure. I mean, I think, fundamentally, it's about sales. We pulled sales down a little bit from what we might have been thinking about for the fourth quarter, and there isn't anything really specific in there. And we definitely have been impacted in November by the hurricane on the east coast. That's certainly an impact. I think our expectation -- our hope is that we'll get at least some of those sales back, but it's definitely part of the process. And I think the other one is just overall, I'm trying to make sure we're taking a kind of conservatively rational view of the opportunity. We had a good third quarter, but it was essentially in the middle of what our expectation was. And so mainly, the difference in the fourth quarter is about sales.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes. I would say, Chuck, we basically -- the reason we guided November below the end of the range, we're just assuming we make our plan the rest of the way. So obviously, we didn't make our plan the first week because of the hurricane. If we get some of those sales back, that would be upside to what we just guided to.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up to that. How are trends sort of outside the Northeast? Has there been any CNN effect or election effects for you guys?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, there's the seasonality in the business when you get down to that element of business by day or pre-election, postelection. We kind of looked back historically at past election years to sort of plan the days, so that's sort of built into our plan. I mean, typically, there is some impact pre-election and...","Wesley S. McDonald","A little postelection.","Kevin Mansell","A little postelection, and the business kind of accelerates. But that's sort of built into our planning process.","Wesley S. McDonald","You can never plan Halloween or Election Day too well.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Fair enough. And then just the obvious concern continues to be kind of the inventory level. Can you maybe walk us through a little bit more detail in terms of the content by category? Where are you placing the biggest bets?","Kevin Mansell","Sure. I mean, from an inventory perspective, I would say I'd kind of break it into 3 things as we go into holiday and then one additional thing as we transition from holiday out. On the 3 things going into holiday, first and foremost, was we've been working hard at managing inventory levels and service levels, are the percentage of times we're in stock for the customer, up, year-over-year. Because we know we disappointed a lot of customers last year in our ability to do that. So there's a general focus on ensuring that we're in stock by size and color across the portfolio of the store with particular emphasis around areas that are trending, categories that are doing particularly well. Second, we know last year that we were not well positioned for gifts, and we lost share to others when it came to the gift-giving categories. And so there's been a very big focus on creating a gift headquarter strategy for November and December for the customer for holiday. And you should be able to see that in our stores in both our in-aisle and in-department outposts and presentations. It's built around this marketing handle of dream for Christmas, and that's been a focus area as well. And then the third area, probably just as important as the gift, has been our great value program. And the great value program generally is about opening price point items throughout the store in every single category that are -- probably lean more towards basic, I would say. They're not all basic items, but they have a tendency to lean that way. So those are kind of the 3 things where we've focused inventory going into the holiday. And then the last thing, which is really important, is last year, with the results that we had, we did a very poor job of transitioning into new spring selling. And so in many parts of the country, as we moved into December, we didn't have new fresh receipts coming in to be prepared to service the customer in January and February and March, and that's been a major course correction for us. So those are kind of the 4 elements.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then my follow-up question is just -- in the past few months, there's been some positive developments in your business with traffic getting better and some better trends in the non-credit customer. When you looked ahead, how confident are you guys that those trends are going to continue?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, all the elements are in place. I mean, I think we've spent a lot of time studying what went wrong in the fourth quarter last year and continued into the spring, as you know. And a lot of it was about servicing the customer properly, being competitive and being a gift headquarters for holiday and -- with particular emphasis on these kind of narrow and deep really important items, we call them the great value items, they're really key items, and a constant flow of receipts. So I mean, I guess to the extent that you can be confident coming out of a quarter that had improved sales results, October was a really good month for us. We saw it building, so all very, very positive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to get a little bit more color on the remodeling program. I thought that you were going to expand that program pretty dramatically in 2014. Can you talk a little bit about how those remodels have trended recently?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I think, actually, we've taken a step back when we've been testing some of these things in home and beauty. We remodeled 100 stores as recently as last year so -- or maybe 2 years ago, 2010. But that's the run rate we need to achieve -- basically, to achieve our goal of remodeling a store on average every 10 years. So the remodels continue to trend up low single digits. The reason we've cut back the remodels and tried to test some different things in terms of in store and home accessories and beauty is to try to raise that to a mid-single-digit comp, which is kind of the comp we would like to have in order to achieve a return as good as a new store, for example. So that's why we're testing the 2014 acceleration to 100, assume that we can make some progress in achieving that goal. Quite honestly, if we can only get to a low-single-digit remodel, we still will continue to remodel that 100 a year because we feel like that's something we have to do, from a strategic perspective, to continue to invest in our fleet and make our stores look better than the competition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Maschmeyer with Baird.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you -- I guess just a follow-up on Lorraine's question, talk a little bit about some of the early learnings and kind of how you're feeling about the tests that you're doing in home and beauty.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, the short answer is no. We're planning to talk about that for sure. It's part of our plan to talk about it at our year-end call. Some of the categories that we're focused on, as you know, in those efforts are very intensive fourth quarter kinds of categories. So holiday, home, home accessories, beauty. And so to be fair, I think, to give us a complete and full read, we're planning on dealing with it in February. I mean, we feel good about some things and, as you can imagine, not good about other things. But we'll talk about it more in-depth on that call, Erika.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That is fair enough. And then on that gross margin side, is kind of why shouldn't gross margin sequentially improve a little bit in Q4 versus Q3? I guess could you walk through the puts and takes for those margin -- merchandise margins? And how do you expect AUC to play out for you over the next few quarters?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, from a margin rate perspective, what's driving our margin rate is really kind of 2 big factors. Obviously, one is this very focus that we have on being value right. That's a critical element, and we want to be very competitive for the holiday season. The second thing is that some of the categories that we're looking to intensify in the holiday season are lower margin. And so categories like home, which is an integral part of our gift strategy; toys, which is an integral part of our gift strategy, are both lower margin in the overall store. And as you can imagine, our online business, which also carries a lower merchandise margin as well is growing, it had its biggest growth in the third quarter with a 50% increase, is growing a lot. And from a mix standpoint, that also impacts it. So I'd say the way I'd think about it is it's sort of mix, and that's mainly online. It's classifications that we're driving, which are categories like home and toys that are big parts of our gift strategy, and then it's an intense focus on making sure we have great value as witnessed by the great value item program.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Jaffe with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a follow up on the E-Commerce rapid growth. Historically, that's been not as robust a gross margin business as your regular businesses because of its emphasis on home. And are you seeing a rebalancing in your E-Commerce business and, as a result, some higher margins coming out of that business?","Kevin Mansell","No. I mean, I still think that overall, the factors that drive the margin lower than the brick-and-mortar margin are still in place. I mean, we're still -- those categories are growing rapidly, and they're a headwind from strictly a margin perspective now. I think you know, Richard, that while merchandise margin is really important for us to manage, we're also really focused on our returns. And our return on investment in our online business is really, really healthy, and we see a bright future in that. So you don't want to get too focused on just the absolute merchandise margin rate. But I think, Wes, the factors are all still on in play.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes. I mean, shipping costs, obviously, are a big part of merchandise margins in E-Commerce. And that's something that continues to be very competitive in the fourth quarter, especially most people that have shipping with thresholds drop them to $50. We do the same for competitive reasons. So with E-Comm, actually, overachieving their plans. That's put a little pressure from a mix perspective on the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Wes, I'm wondering if you can talk about the inventory management. And is -- the 3% increase in inventory units relative to 2010, is that comp store inventory? Does that exclude E-Commerce? And how does that compare to your store volumes today versus 2010?","Wesley S. McDonald","That's store only. So E-Comm, obviously, the growth over 2010 is a lot higher than that. And our store volumes since 2010 -- obviously, last year, we ran basically a flat comp. We're down 0.5% today, so pretty similar. I guess you can count new stores would be, well, not as much. From our perspective, this is the right thing to do for us. Last year, we only got -- cut units significantly. We're investing, as Kevin mentioned, in the 3 categories: gifts, great value and areas that are trending. So our exclusive brands, for example, year-to-date, are up 11%. That is mainly concentrated in our update in the contemporary businesses. So their inventory units relative to 2010 are up double digits in both men's and women's. Other areas, such as home decor, which aren't trending this year, are actually down double digits to 2010. So we've tried to invest in the areas that make sense. And it's not inconsistent, to be honest, what we've been telling everybody since February. This is the results of our strategy, and we hope our sales continue to improve. And if we're able to run the kind of comp that we've guided to, we'll have a good fourth quarter. We'll continue to invest in inventory as we move into the spring as well, because obviously, it's been well documented and we've talked about it quite a bit. We missed a lot of business this spring as we continued to chase inventory to catch up with our price reductions.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So as you will get like a normalized level of inventory, do you think that you do need to have higher inventories relative to your sales per store, sales per square foot going forward? Or do you think this is just sort of temporary? I'm just looking at the store sales being flat to down 0.5%. And since inventory's up 3%, it just -- there seems to be a little bit of mismatch.","Wesley S. McDonald","I would tell you this is our strategy. I would expect dollars and units to grow faster than sales until we get to the fall of next year. And then we'll be normalized, and we'll start to focus on bringing our inventories growth less than sales. I'd -- we missed gross margin in the fourth quarter -- I actually mean the first quarter this year. Prior to that, we've grown gross margin or made our gross margins most of the time in the almost 10 years I've been here. In second quarter and this quarter, we also made our margin. So we're managing the business how we think it should be managed, but we need to get the stores in a better in-stock position.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Liz Dunn with Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","My question is on the juniors business. Can we just have an update on -- obviously, that's been an area where there's been a bit more of a content problem instead of a quantity problem. How are you feeling about that business? And when do you think we might see -- start to see some better merchandise?","Kevin Mansell","I mean, I think our expectations for the fourth quarter in juniors are to continue to trend similarly to the way we've trended in the third quarter. So that's not good. It's far below the rest of women's, but it's kind of baked into our sales assumptions that we've given you for the fourth. So we're really kind of focused on transitioning into the first quarter of next year in a better place in juniors. But our assumption is, Liz, that the fourth quarter in juniors, while it might be modestly better, is not going to be a whole lot different than it's been. And that's a little bit less from a performance standpoint than the rest of women's. Women's has outperformed juniors consistently over the course of the year.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","And it's mostly a tops problem, is that right?","Kevin Mansell","Yes. It's definitely driven by tops. No question about it. I mean, in the third quarter, we made a big commitment, for instance, to colored bottoms. And colored bottoms were very successful and drove our overall bottom business to a better performance. But yes, it's definitely driven by our top business.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just one more, if I may. In terms of the buyback, should we think about that $3.5 billion as being somewhat linear over the next 3 years? And how should we think about that in terms of your preference for dividends versus buyback?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I think from my perspective, that would be the best way to model it if you're looking out 3 years. How we actually do it will obviously depend on the stock price. In terms of dividends, assuming that you buy back that number of shares over the next 3 years, that would pretty much build in a double-digit dividend increase every year, holding the actual payout in dollars to be about $300 million. So that's how we're kind of modeling over the next 3 years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I had 2 questions. First, around the gross margin guidance. I think last year, [indiscernible] guidance you were kind of positioning yourself to be able to respond to competition, as needed, and it turned out a little bit better. I was just kind of curious, when you think about the promotional environment going into fourth quarter, what you're assuming and how much leeway you've given yourself as you drive the gross margins today.","Kevin Mansell","Right. I mean, I think what you're just asking is without the rationale that, I think, behind the gross margin guidance, which really is about -- primarily about mix, and it's this dramatic increase in our expectation for our online sales. We just finished the third quarter when we were -- in which we were up 50%, which is the best performance we've had in a long time, and it does operate on lower merchandise margins. And then secondarily, the categories in which we're focused in both our gift and our great value programs have lower merchandise margins in them. So categories like home, which is a really big part of our gift strategy, and toys, which is a really big part of our gift strategy, have lower margins than the overall store. I think those are the 2 big things, Wes.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, I'd just try to make it simple. If you assume we were to run 44 basis points down in the fourth quarter versus last year, the difference between that and our guidance, about 1\/3 of it's gifts and about 2\/3 of it's E-Comm.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right, okay. But from a promotional standpoint, what are you guys sort of planning for or what are you expecting out of the industry this coming fourth quarter?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I don't know if it's more promotional. I think it's really, just as Kevin mentioned, the mix. I mean toys, fragrances and small electrics carry lower margins than our average, and we're investing a lot more inventory in those to drive traffic and, hopefully, other sales in the store.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","My second question was just around inventory levels. You've given us a lot of detail already. I'm just curious, at these levels, what would you assume? Sort of is markdowns sort of the normal course of markdowns in the business after the season get back to levels that we saw in 2010? Or do they end up being higher? And then if you could give us an update on sort of the inflation-deflation situation that we're looking at.","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, we're coming -- we're planning to come out of the fourth quarter, I think, in a low double-digit range. So from a flow standpoint, that's being driven by a focus on transitioning into the spring season much more aggressively than last year. Because last year, we made a big tactical error in not doing that. So just strictly thinking about what's assumed in terms of how to move through inventories in the fourth quarter, we're kind of assuming it's going to be very promotional Christmas, similarly to last year, maybe not any more so, but probably certainly not any less. And the margin rates are slightly lower because of the mix of our business driven by our online, and our gifts and great value programs are driving that a little bit lower. So that the overall markdown mix, as it relates to our level inventory, is kind of the same. There's really no difference than last year.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes. I mean it's pretty simple, Dan. If we run a 3 to 4 comp, we're going to make the earnings we said. If we run a flat comp, we'll have margin issues like any other fourth quarter. It's not really related to the investment in the inventory. If in the fourth quarter, you don't run the comp you think, you've got to get rid of the units.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, okay. I guess what I was getting at was really just the level of markdowns that you would typically see in the business. So I'm assuming last year, it was very low. This year, it goes up a little bit, back to sort of normal. But maybe if we could just move on to the inflation -- or excuse me, sorry, the deflation.","Wesley S. McDonald","I mean, I think the short answer really is we're focusing on the out-the-door retails on like items being lower than last year. So that's going to really involve more promotional markdowns than clearance markdowns. If our strategy works, we should have similar clearance markdowns in terms of percentage of inventory leftover in January as we had last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Schoen with Barclays.","Jessica Schoen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the investments in technology. And what kind of impact you've seen -- in addition to the strong performance in the E-Commerce business, what impacts have you seen that you feel are a direct result of those investments?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I mean, I think the biggest impact this year has been the rollout of electronic signs in our stores. That's allowed us to reduce our ad set payroll by about 90% in the stores that have them. I think we're down to about maybe 100 stores left that we'll do in January. That's probably the biggest thing that I can talk to you about from an SG&A perspective. We made an awful lot of investments in E-Commerce in terms of giving the ability for people to develop gifts, the guided navigation I talked about earlier, product reviews online, all that's really contributed to our growth in E-Commerce being so robust. We continue to work on longer-term projects involving the merchants in the stores. We have a pilot on our system we call merchandise locator system, which allows us to find product more easily in the back room, which would cut down on replenishing the floor. That's working out very well in the pilot stores so far, and we'll continue to roll that out. And we're working on various systems to allow our merchants to be more effective in terms of planning their assortments regionally.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I know you've answered a lot of questions on the gross margin. But I was wondering if you could tell us about how the mix between private exclusive and national brands impacted the beat in the quarter and your expectations for the fourth quarter.","Kevin Mansell","I think the mix on private exclusive is about 53%. It's pretty much what we kind of expected. So that really didn't have a meaningful impact on how we came out in the third quarter. And it's sort of thought -- the way we're thinking about the fourth quarter is that, that mix will probably hold very similarly to what it's been trending at, which is a little bit higher than last year. Not a lot higher, but a little bit higher than last year.","Wesley S. McDonald","I mean, the biggest improvement in terms of comps was actually with national brands. They were still negative, but negative low single digits versus negative mid-single digits. So that helped us as well. Private and exclusive, as Kevin said, were pretty much the same.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Hessler with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So my question is just a follow-up on the buyback piece. How should we be thinking about that in light of your commitment to the high BBB credit rating and kind of your leverage target? Is that something where you could increase the pace by funding with incremental debt?","Kevin Mansell","Are you asking about the pace of the buyback?","Wesley S. McDonald","I think -- you were cutting in and out, but I think I got the gist of it. We're going to continue to manage our buyback with a debt-to-EBITDA target of 2 to 2.25. It's been communicated to the rating agencies. They're comfortable with that. That would allow us to take modest leverage on every year of roughly $300 million, whether we do that or not is really up to the interest rate environment. In terms of the pace of the buyback, as I mentioned earlier, the best way to model is probably equally. But if stock seems cheap, we'll buy more quicker. If it's expensive, we'll buy less like all you guys out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So you've spoken about 5-phase SG&A deep dive longer term. As we look out, how should we think about the fixed cost leverage points and efficiency opportunities going forward in the model on the SG&A side?","Wesley S. McDonald","Matt, I think the goal for us has always been, from a long-term perspective, to leverage at a 2% comp. We're obviously going to do better than that this year for 3 main reasons. Stores have done a phenomenal job in terms of managing the payroll. We've also gotten the benefit of the electronic signs I mentioned earlier. Incentive comp, obviously, is a lot less than last year, given our performance thus far. And we continue -- although the benefits in credit weren't great in the third quarter, we did get strong performance in the spring season. Those are something we expect to continue to achieve going forward. The 5-phase thing that we're working on right now is really to drive incremental cost out. The goal is to allow us to drive enough savings to maintain that 2% comp leverage point going forward.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the gross margin front, I think you did a really good job of breaking out the different buckets for 4Q. As we think to next year and beyond, do you -- is there opportunity on the gross margin front? Or is this is a line that we should be modeling flattish going forward? Or just kind of any color around longer-term gross margin.","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I think there's opportunity going forward. I would plan it modestly up 10 or 20 basis points a year. We've -- that's really with the assumption that costs continue to decline. We've seen that obviously in the fall. We've mentioned that. All-in, our cost decline is probably around mid-single digit depending on the category. We're seeing cost reductions so far on some of the spring receipts we've placed for next year. Assuming that continues, I think we can have modest gross margin improvement. If we can out-comp 2% comp, obviously that could provide more opportunity than the 10 to 20 basis points I talked about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Could you talk about the impact of weather on your business in last year's fourth quarter, just given the fact that it was so warm across much of your geographic footprint? And just what kind of weather outlook do you have baked into or assumed with your 3% to 4% same-store sales guidance for the fourth quarter of this year?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, our -- we have a couple weather services we use, and they're basically saying, starting next week, through the balance of the quarter, it should be colder than last year. So that's certainly built into our thinking. Obviously, the weather affected the results early on in November with the hurricane and now you guys, I guess, East Coast are getting a snowstorm today or yesterday. So we think that's going to be good for business. But outerwear as a category has declined in importance the last few years as more people have been layering. But colder, for our business, is always better this time of the year.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","And then just on -- maybe you could give us a little bit more color around the impact of the hurricane, how many stores you had closed, that sort of thing.","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I mean, with the peak, the first day, we had about 200 stores closed and then it went down to 60, down to 30s for balance of the week. And then by the following Monday, we had every store opened. For the most part, we had some generators and a lot of stores that ran out of fuel, but you're talking about double digits by the weekend. We do have one store that's going to be closed for a significant amount of time in Caesar's Bay in Brooklyn. That will be closed through at least the fourth quarter.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, the hurricane impact really hit a significant number of stores, as it did, I think, for most national retailers across both the Mid-Atlantic and, of course, particularly the Northeast. And that hangover lasted more than just a day or 2. So it dramatically impacted the first week of November for sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","I was wondering if you'd comment -- as you think about the fourth quarter and promotions and clearance and the balance between the 2, is there a difference between the margin on clearance and the margin on promotion and how that trends during the year?","Kevin Mansell","Sure. I mean, our merchandise margins, because of the type of selling proposition we have, which is highly promotional, we were very event-driven. Our merchandise margin results are primarily driven by our promotional markdowns. And of course, the fourth quarter, of all the quarters, the impact of transitioning out of holiday goods into spring is proportionally a little bit higher than it is in any other particular quarter. But I would say -- and Wes should jump in here, but I think, for sure, the promotional markdown rate is what drives our merchandise margins up or down.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes.","Kevin Mansell","And then the mix of our business, as we've talked about, is a really important factor on that as well. So I don't want to make it sound like clearance and how we clear goods is not impactful to our performance of margin. It is. But it's not the most important factor.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes. I mean, most quarters throughout a number of years, we've ended the quarters with clearance less than last year. So as Kevin said, it's really about the promotional markdowns.","Operator","And we do have time for one final question, which comes from the line of David Glick with Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just a couple quick questions. Wes, could you just clarify your November guidance? I think you said below 3% to 4%. But I was just wondering, are you expecting a positive...","Wesley S. McDonald","Positive, but below 3% to 4%.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And then more importantly, in terms of the non-credit sales and traffic, obviously, that helped you improve your trend in Q3. I'm just wondering how you'd strategize the fourth quarter on that front and how you've geared your marketing spend. You mentioned digital and broadcast as being increased. How much are you increasing your overall spend? And how disproportionate is that increase in digital and broadcast? And obviously, I think it's geared towards driving the non-credit customer and traffic overall. But if you could just give us some color on that, I'd appreciate it.","Kevin Mansell","Sure. I mean, I think Wes -- this is Kevin, David. I think Wes guided to a 7% to 8% total sales increase for the fourth quarter with the impact of the additional week on our accounting calendar. In the context of a 7% to 8% sales increase, we do expect marketing to leverage. So it's less than an increase of 7%. But that's a significant amount of dollars because the marketing dollars in the fourth quarter are very, very significant. The areas of digital, particularly, are dramatically higher than that. I don't even actually have a specific number, but it's double, probably, the rate of our overall marketing increase. So if sales are up 7% to 8% and marketing is up, but not up 7% to 8%, let's just say 5% or so, then digital, particularly, is well more than double that rate of increase. Broadcast is also higher, but not as increased as digital. So hopefully, that helps you.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Thank you for your participation.

Average unit retail increased 5.5%, while units per transaction decreased 3.7%, resulting in a 1.8% increase in average transaction value.","Kohl's Charge sales penetration increased 160 basis points to approximately 57% of total sales for the quarter. Year-to-date, credit share is 56%, an increase of approximately 215 basis points over the first half of 2011. Kevin will provide more color on our sales in a few minutes.","Moving on to gross margin. Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 39%, approximately 160 basis points lower than the second quarter of last year but significantly better than our expectations of a 200 to 250 basis point decrease.","SG&A decreased 1.6% for the quarter, well below our expectations of flat to up 1.5%. SG&A as a percent of sales leveraged approximately 15 basis points for the quarter and 30 basis points year-to-date. Kevin will provide more color on expense management as well.","Depreciation expense was $210 million in the second quarter this year and $190 million in the second quarter of last year. The increase is primarily due to new stores, remodels and IT investments. As a percentage of sales, depreciation was 5%, approximately 50 basis points higher than last year for the quarter and 30 basis points higher year-to-date.","Net interest expense was $80 million this quarter and $162 million year-to-date. The $8 million increase over Q2 2011 and the $14 million increase over the first 6 months of 2011 were primarily due to the $650 million of long-term debt issued October 2011.","Our income tax rate was 36.3% for the quarter, significantly lower than our original expectation of 38%. The decrease was primarily due to favorable settlement of state tax audits, which contributed $0.02 to our diluted earnings per share.","Net income was $240 million for the current year quarter and $299 million for the second quarter of 2011. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter this year was $1, and year-to-date diluted earnings per share for the year-to-date period was $1.63.","Moving on to some metrics for your models. Square footage, 90,848 this year versus 96,380 last year, up about 2.6%. Selling square footage, 82,522 versus last year's 85,097, up 2.4%. We ended the quarter with $600 million of cash and cash equivalents.","Moving on to CapEx. CapEx expenditures for the first 6 months of the year are $429 million, $50 million lower than the first half of last year. The change reflects multiple changes in our capital expenditures, including fewer remodels and fall new stores, partially offset by higher IT spending. As a reminder, we are planning to open 12 new stores this fall compared to 31 last fall, and spending on our E-Commerce facilities was relatively flat year-over-year.","Moving on to inventory. Our inventory balance at the end of July was 3.5 billion, a 13% increase over July 2011; our inventory dollars per store on a cost basis is up 9%; and our units per store are up 6%. AP as a percent of inventory was 43.8%, slightly higher than last year's 43.5%.","From a capital structure perspective, we repurchased 6 million shares of our common stock during the quarter and 12 million shares thus far this year. We have repurchased approximately 77 million shares since reactivating the buyback program in the fourth quarter of 2010. All of these purchases were made pursuant to 10b5-1 plans. Weighted average diluted shares were 239 million for the quarter and 242 million for the year-to-date period. Earlier this week, our board approved the quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. The dividend is payable September 26 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 5.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin to provide additional insights on our results.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks, Wes. Let me start by adding some color to our sales results. As Wes mentioned, comparable store sales decreased 2.7% in the quarter.","From the line of business perspective, Men's was slightly positive for the quarter on strength in casual sportswear and pants and tailored and dress clothing. Footwear and Accessories outperformed the company average. Within those categories, athletic shoes reported a positive comp as we've anniversary-ed prior year declines in the toning category. Women's shoes also outperformed the company average.","In Accessories, both sterling silver jewelry and bath and beauty reported comps of approximately 10%. Handbags and small other Accessories were also positive for the quarter, continuing their recent favorable trend.","Women's, Home and Children's each reported mid-single-digit declines. In Women's, updated sportswear was the strongest category with a low double-digit increase. Intimate and sleepwear also outperformed the company. And as we expected, the Junior business continued to be challenging. Better performance in Home included bedding and sheets, bath and towels and other domestics. Children's apparel improved throughout the quarter, as back-to-school inventory arrived in the stores and inventory levels normalized.","Active and fitness apparel, which span multiple lines of business, consistently outperformed other areas of the company with a low single-digit comp for the quarter. Key contributors were NIKE and adidas, as well as our own proprietary FILA SPORT and Tech Gear brands.","From a regional perspective, all regions were negative with no significant variation between the regions. E-Commerce sales increased 39% over the second quarter of 2011 to $237 million. Year-to-date, E-Commerce sales were $488 million. The effect on the comp for the quarter and year was approximately 170 basis points. From a brand perspective, 55% of our second quarter sales were private and exclusive only at Kohl's brands, an increase of approximately 200 basis points over the second quarter last year. Substantially all the penetration increase was the result of our new exclusive brands: Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and Rock and Republic.","We saw notable sales improvements in many of our entry level price point brands in July, as inventory levels normalized. Our private brands reported a combined comp increase of 3% in July, more similar to our first quarter results in these brands, after reporting declines earlier in the quarter. Our exclusive brands comped up low double digits for the quarter. Strong performers included Lauren Conrad, FILA SPORT, Food Network and Simply Vera Vera Wang. During the quarter, we launched the Princess Vera Wang line. This new Junior line was designed with Vera Wang and features apparel, jewelry, handbags and shoes that range in price from $16 to $98.","And finally, in June, we announced a partnership with Narciso Rodriguez, who will be the first designer for our new limited edition collection concept called DesigNation. This collection will feature fashions based on international inspiration from different premier designers across the world. The collection will feature Missy apparel, including outerwear, dresses, skirts, pants and shirts. The retail prices will range from $30 to $150 and be available beginning in early November.","On the gross margin front, as Wes mentioned, our gross margin rate for the quarter was approximately 160 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2011. Though we're certainly never happy with gross margin declines, we're pleased that the decline was lower than both our second quarter guidance and the first quarter decline. We entered the fall season with an improved understanding of how our customer responds to our pricing, fresh inventory and normalized inventory levels. We are also seeing mid-single-digit apparel cost decreases for the fall season. Our expectation by the end of the year is that unit and cost increases per store will be similar, as we gain benefit from the lower cost fall receipts.","On the SG&A line, our teams once again outperformed our expectations. Our credit operations contributed the most significant SG&A leverage. Portfolio growth and improved performance are now the key drivers, however, as we annualized our new relationship with Capital One in April.","Our stores organization continues to drive payroll efficiencies, and reductions in the number of remodels also generated cost savings. We also reported leverage in our corporate operations.","As expected, marketing costs did not leverage as we spent incremental dollars to support brand launches, including this quarter's Princess Vera Wang launch and to reemphasize the many great ways to save at Kohl's. Distribution centers also did not leverage as we continue to develop the infrastructure for our growing E-Commerce business.","In February, we laid out 4 priorities for fiscal 2012. We've had 6 months to focus on these priorities and would like to take this opportunity to update you on our status. Our first and most important priority was to reposition our business to allow us to improve our sales trend as we transitioned into the fall and in the holiday period. In order to do so, we identified the need to act on several fronts: stronger pricing, improved inventory levels in in-stock and an improvement in the style and the quality of our merchandise content.","We have made progress in all 3 opportunities. On the pricing front, we lowered our merchandise margin plans to allow our merchants to take a more leadership position and price points in all of our key businesses. This is especially important for us in order to expand the appeal of Kohl's value to a broader customer base. Our customers have responded favorably to the lower prices, particularly in opening price points.","On the inventory front, our inventories are now where we believe they need to be in most categories. And as that happened, in the last 4 to 6 weeks, our business has improved. As Wes mentioned a few minutes ago, inventory units per store are approximately 6% higher than last year and generally consistent with the second quarter 2010 levels.","The style and timeliness of our merchandise content has also improved. We've made significant changes to our merchandise organization and continue to do so to support that effort. We do believe we are now well positioned both in terms of units and fashion content with significant depth in key items, especially in key back-to-school areas.","Though we're encouraged by recent sales results, we acknowledge the challenges that are still in front of us as we enter the back-to-school season and prepare for the critical holiday season. We recognize the gaining sales momentum as a gradual process and remain very determined and focused on meeting this goal.","Our second priority going into fiscal 2012 was to drive leverage around SG&A. As I mentioned just a moment ago, our teams again delivered solid expense results in the second quarter. Our operational process changes and technology-driven productivity changes are generating sustainable expense savings. But we will not become complacent. We will actively pursue opportunities to generate additional savings in the future to allow us to operate most efficiently and pass the greatest value onto our customer.","Increasing our online success was our third priority. Year-to-date, E-Commerce sales have increased 41%, in line with the 40% goal that we laid out at the beginning of the year. We\u2019ve continued to invest around all the aspects of this business, including technology improvements, more efficient fulfillment capabilities and a larger and more experienced organization.","And our final priority was to reallocate our capital expense spending within our overall capital allocation plans. We have significantly reduced our new store openings and remodel program, but we have significantly increased our technology investments. These technology investments support not only our online business but also provide ongoing operational efficiencies in our stores and our corporate location. And beyond these capital expense plans, our remaining capital allocation strategies remain intact around our share buyback and dividend strategy.","I'm generally pleased with our progress to date and the disciplined focus of our Kohl's associates. Clearly, we have additional work to do. And as confident as I am that we'll remain focused and obtain each of our goals, we also know it's important to remain realistic in our expectations for the fall season.","With that, I'll turn it back to Wes to provide our third quarter earnings guidance.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thanks, Kevin. Our third quarter earnings guidance is as follows: total sales increase of 1% to 3%; comparable sales increase of flat to 2%; we expect August and October to be at the high end of the range and September to be at the low end of the range; we're forecasting a gross margin rate decline of 60 to 80 basis points; we would expect our SG&A expenses to fall in a range of up 1% to down 1%; depreciation expense of $216 million; interest expense of $82 million; tax rate of 38%; share count average for the quarter of 234 million diluted shares; and then 236 million shares for the year. This assumes $300 million in share repurchases in the third quarter at an average price of $50 per share.","Including these estimated share repurchases, we expect earnings per diluted share of $0.83 to $0.89 for the third quarter. Reflecting our current results in our third quarter projections, our fiscal 2012 guidance has been updated to $4.50 to $4.65 per diluted share from our original guidance of $4.75 per diluted share.","And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It sounds like you have the units in place to drive possibly some upside to the comp in the back half. So I was just curious as to how you're planning for the full fall and holiday season and then what you're expecting in terms of pricing and costing.","Kevin Mansell","Well, I think, generally, we're thinking that the fourth quarter will be stronger than the third quarter. That's kind of built into our assumptions. And the baseline for that is our comps last year, historically, were pretty strong in the third quarter and pretty weak in the fourth quarter. That's probably the main driver. In addition, we think we have strategies in place to particularly drive the fourth quarter business. We have been experiencing pretty consistent cost decreases on product, and that's also built into our assumptions from a pricing perspective and from a merchandise margin perspective, and that's a pretty big change from the trend in the spring season. And as you said, from a unit perspective, for the first time, we have units that are more similar per store to our 2-year-ago level of unit inventory. So I think all those things are the reason we feel like we're positioned to start to get a little better business trend.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, our goal going into the fall was to get our inventory unit levels back to where we were in the fall of 2010. Last year, as it's been well-documented and we've said many times, we cut units back too far. And so, I think looking at it, as we were back in 2010 is a better indicator of how we're positioning our inventory. And I would expect our cost to be either at or lower than our unit growth by the end of the season.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then what was the reason for the better-than-expected gross margin performance in the second quarter?","Wesley S. McDonald","Just got improvement in the July sales. Our revised guidance after June sales was predicated on a flat comp for July. We did a little bit better than that, and the merchants were able to deliver a little better than they thought, and that's, hopefully, a good pattern that we can continue to see throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Maschmeyer with Robert Baird.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On the Juniors side, I've noticed you've got some more colored skinny denim in there. Could you talk about the impact that the new GMM has had so far, kind of the changes that she has been making, and then just update us on your merchant search overall?","Kevin Mansell","Sure. Colored denim certainly has been a focus. The new merchant leadership in Juniors, identified that early on as something that we wanted to take a strong position in. And I think in both Juniors and in Big Girls, we're experiencing really positive results. And in both cases, we have pretty significantly strong inventories. We've also changed the merchandise presentation in our stores in both those cases to try to emphasize that to a greater degree. Other changes in the merchandise organization continue to occur. We're not finished, as I mentioned on the call. We're looking to continue to strengthen it, continue to add quality and talent. We've made a lot of progress already, and we filled a significant number of new positions in the company that helped to drive the change in our content, but we're not completely done, Erika. I would say we probably won't be completely done until later in the fall season.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I know you don't have a crystal ball, but based on what you've seen so far, could you talk about your expectations for the holiday environment, the consumer competition, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of inventory plans for your competition?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I think, from our perspective, we feel like we're a little bit unique since our fourth quarter last year, we struggled a lot, especially in November. I think, as I read your guys' questions that you're sending me via e-mail, I think one of the things we're being more conservative on for the back half than we originally thought in February is our gross margin expectations. I think -- we think it's going to be -- every Christmas is competitive, and this will be no different. But our expectation, I think, going into fourth quarter, given we were down in margin last year, we might have more opportunity to make that up this year, and we've taken a more conservative position in our early plans for the fourth quarter on gross margin. So that's kind of my best shot at the crystal ball.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital.","Jessica Schoen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is Jessica Schoen on for Bob. I was wondering if you could update us on the sales productivity test. You had mentioned an expanded Home selection, and I see specific markets.","Wesley S. McDonald","I think it's still early. We have kind of talked to you guys about really talking about it in January. Main reason is Home is a big part of the business in the fourth quarter, so our expectation would be that's when we're going to get our biggest lift. I think we made a lot of progress. We've learned some things about what's working and what's not. If we choose to roll it out, I think one of the things we're going to do differently -- just for ease of use, we went after space and kids and shoes because they were the areas adjacent to Home, made it quick and easy, and my favorite thing, it was cheap to do. But if we do it going forward as part of our remodel program, we'll end up taking a little bit of space from everybody, and that wouldn\u2019t provide as big a drop in sales in some of the areas that we're seeing. But too early to really share a lot of specifics. We'll talk about it in February at the end of the fourth quarter.","Jessica Schoen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on understanding the gross margin differential from your guidance. It sounds like more leverage. Is there -- has there been any difference in merchandise margin, though? And as you think to the back half and the reversal of the input costs, how your -- what your expectations are there?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, our gross margins are merchandise margins. We don't have buying occupancy in there. So I mean, to be totally honest, I gave myself a lot of room. We were surprised in the first quarter from our margin. We don't usually miss our margin guidance, and we kind of pride ourselves in being accurate on that, so I wanted to make sure we had plenty of room to make it if sales didn\u2019t come out the way we thought. It came out of a little bit better, and so we did a little bit better. We're still looking for relative improvement going into the third quarter. We were down 160 basis points in the second. We're saying we're going to be down 60 to 80 in the third. So that's improving, and that's really a function of getting that lower cost in there. We are providing ourselves a little room in terms of reacting to competition, should the fourth quarter be more competitive than we anticipated.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you talk about how your credit card penetration came in for the quarter and how your non-credit card customers are shopping you versus your credit card customers?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I think our credit card customer has been the one that's been most consistent with us, as we've struggled to get our units back to where we want to be. I guess, though, the thing I'm excited about is our non-credit card customer in July improved quite a bit. We've talked about the formula for us to run at 2 to 4 comp as the credit card customer kind of mid to high single-digit positive, and the non-credit card customer negative low single-digits to flat. That's pretty much how July worked out. We're hoping we can continue that trend going into the fall. From a marketing perspective, we put a lot more emphasis on broader-reaching vehicles for fall, specifically in digital, as well as broadcast in terms of penetration of rating points. Last year, we added a lot of TV late in the game and paid a premium for it. This year, we plan to invest a lot more in broadcast, so we got more rating points for basically the same dollars. And those few things we think will continue help our non-credit card penetration. But obviously, the key for fall, we have to improve our transactions per store. We feel like we've got the units in the right place now, and now we have to drive the traffic in, especially on the non-credit side to drive the kind of comps we believe we can achieve.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then on the SG&A in the second quarter -- in your guidance was [indiscernible] flat, up 1.5%. You obviously significantly did better than that. What would you say were the key drivers there?","Wesley S. McDonald","I'd say, the -- we'd mention credit on an absolute basis, that's certainly the case. That's the case every quarter. On a relative basis versus last year, that really helped us a little bit, an $8 million benefit. We did a great job with store payroll. We actually got just as much leverage out of store payroll on a significantly lower comp than expected, so the team did a great job there. Also, we got some favorability in terms of controllable expenses with fewer remodels. We didn't have as much write-offs and then also managed things like electricity and repair and maintenance fairly well. And then on corporate expenses, we're accruing to a lower level bonus at this point, and that provided some leverage as well.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, how are remodeled stores performing?","Wesley S. McDonald","I'm sorry, Debbie. I didn't get the question.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","How are remodeled stores performing?","Wesley S. McDonald","Similar to how they have been. Continue to experience low single-digit lifts, and it\u2019s one big reason we're running the sales for a productivity test with an increased presence in Home. We're not displeased with the remodels, but it\u2019s basically acted the same as it has for the last 4 or 5 years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's Dan Binder. I've got a couple of questions. First, outside of the Juniors area, where would you say the biggest content change is for the back half? Then secondly, you cited traffic, the challenges there, and now that you\u2019ve got the units, do you plan on increasing your marketing spend year-over-year for the back half?","Kevin Mansell","On the content side, I think the biggest probably change from the last 3 quarters is not unique to one particular area, Dan. It's the improvements in the depth and the level of our private brand ownership, and that's been a significant headwind for us. It was particularly noticeable in the second quarter. And so I think that's not around one unique area. It's sort of across the store. Disproportionately, I would say areas like Women's apparel, Men's casual sportswear and, of course, Kids see that because the penetration of those private brands in those areas is so high and such a large part of the business. So it's probably not unique to one area, but it is really important change. From a marketing perspective, we've -- Wes kind of mentioned that we've assumed that we're going to have to continue to spend and invest in marketing. One thing which was a real headwind for us last year was that much of the marketing investment we made later in the fall and holiday was reactive, and it was chasing business because our sales didn't materialize. So as we went into this fall and holiday, we've been in a better position to preplan those expenditures. Wes mentioned one particular area, which has gotten significantly increased marketing investment, and that's the digital area. And that's across a wide spectrum, but it's really important, and it's definitely getting us really good results. So I think the biggest change in the marketing side is really a plan that we feel more confident about based on the experience we've had in the last 2 or 3 quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Kevin, just wanted to understand, as you outlined the 4 priorities for the year, it sounds like you're making progress on all fronts. I just wanted to be clear: The lower guidance for the year is a function of what? I mean, what has changed in those 4 priorities to prompt you to lower guidance?","Wesley S. McDonald","I think the biggest change from our expectation in February is our gross margin expectations for the back half. I think we've always planned, from a sales perspective, fourth quarter to be better than third quarter. Ideally, if we would have had a little bit of better second quarter, we\u2019d probably have been a little more aggressive in terms of our comp expectations for third quarter, but flat 2% is a big improvement of down 2.7%. So we're thinking it's going to improve. It's going to take a while to get the traffic back, as people realize we're much better in stock, and we'll continue to focus a little bit more intently on the non-credit card customer. But margin is the biggest change from where we were thinking in February.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, this is Kevin, Adrianne. Wes is definitely right on the numbers. I think as we looked at what happened in our business, we recognized that particularly around our opening price point, but also throughout the store, one of the biggest challenges we have is to appeal and make Kohl's value be more apparent to a much larger customer base. And we've been so successful with our loyal customer base and bringing in a certain number of less loyal customers to that really high user base or credit card base. But we have to appeal to more. And I think one of the ways we know that we have to do that is just to offer a better value equation, and that means, in some cases, lower pricing. And as we've increased the amount of our private brand inventory to prep ourselves to get better sales, that has implications as well. So the change is definitely on the margin line, but I think underneath that, it's really about strategically saying how do we reach more customers and be appealing to more customers.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful, Kevin. And is that a function of changes that you're seeing on the competitive front? Is it just getting that much more aggressive out there? Or is it a function of what you saw in the first half to your point that the customer\u2019s just looking for greater value than perhaps you've offered or like -- the messaging hasn't been as clear to the customer? Or is it more a response to the competition?","Kevin Mansell","No, it's not a response to the competition. I think it's more a function of what we've seen happen in our business over the last 3 to 4 quarters and just recognizing that where we've provided more clarity around our value, and some areas are more important than others, we're talking a lot about opening price point, but that's a good example, we get much better response. And we know if we get better response, we're clearly going to be more appealing to more customers, and that's really probably the key part of our improved top line sales. So it's really not about a competitive issue. It's really more about looking at our own metrics and our own customer reaction.","Wesley S. McDonald","Some of it is a little bit mix related. I mean, Kids, obviously, suffered last year a lot, given our drops in units. We think that they're going to be well positioned to have a good fall season and, certainly, a good fourth quarter. And that slightly lower margin business for us.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Kevin, you've talked about newness, freshness and maybe give us an update on brand introductions, what you're seeing, perhaps not so much in the back half, but 2013. And then how does that split with -- again, as you've historically looked to kind of move into perhaps better and best, given the customer seems a lot more focused on the opening price point, is that where you're looking to add to the assortment? How should we be thinking about new brand introductions? And where should they be coming?","Kevin Mansell","Well, new brand introductions are continuing to be important in our thinking. We have a lot that's new this year, obviously. We have yet to annualize either Jennifer Lopez or Marc Anthony. We introduced Rock and Republic. We just introduced the Junior brand, Princess Vera Wang, and we're introducing the first of what we hope to be very many DesigNation designers with Narciso Rodriguez. So newness is very important. I think you're making a good point, which is that while we've focused a lot of our newness around better and best and maybe even particularly best because we were under-penetrated there, we do recognize the fact that the customer is pressured. And so it's very, very important to be powerful in good, which is mostly our private brands, and better, which is a combination of some of our private brands and some of our national brands. So without talking about it specifically, we definitely recognize that fact. So as we look forward to next year and beyond, there's a lot more focus around those kinds of price points as an important element to drive our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sales in national brands have lagged, obviously, the impressive numbers in exclusive and better numbers in private. I'm just wondering why you think the national categories lagged so much. And what steps are you taking to improve the category? And to Adrianne's question, are there any new brands that you may be targeting on a national brand front?","Kevin Mansell","Well, national brands definitely lagged the total company. To be honest about it, national brands and our opening price point brands ran pretty close to the same negative comp. And it was just the double-digit increase in exclusive brands that lifted the comps. So they didn't -- I wouldn't say national brands performed uniquely differently than our opening price point private brands. Clearly, there are some really important national brands that are critical to our success. And we had some great success, even in the second quarter, with some of those. We called out active sportswear as a key one. Both NIKE and adidas were very strong, and I guess that makes us, I think, a little optimistic about back-to-school opportunity with both of those brands as well. Denim business is really important, so while we've introduced a lot of proprietary brands in denim, contemporary brands like Rock and Republic and new denim offerings with other existing proprietary brands, the Levi's business is really critical, and so we've put a lot of effort behind that brand as well. We're continuing to focus on brands. So I wouldn't want to give you any impression that all of our attention is around our own exclusive brands as we move into 2013 and 2014. It's really important for us to have a strong position with these national brands, and we\u2019re continuing to look for new opportunities as well.","Wesley S. McDonald","I think one of the things that you guys sometimes get too caught up in is a lot of the space we created when we introduced new exclusive brands come from what I would call tertiary national brands that really have lost their relevance with the customers. So if you look at our top 50 brands, they tend to comp much better than the brands that I would classify in the other bucket because a lot of those brands have lost space or actually don't even exist in our store any longer.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then, I know it's just a couple of weeks in, but we did have pass-through this past week and this morning. Given the expectations for August to be at the high-end, how the past couple of weeks have been?","Kevin Mansell","Well, first of all, it's like way too early to be talking about August sales. We -- of course, you know we don't talk about sales in the month anyway. My sense is that based on all the research we've seen, Chuck, both the secondary research but also our own proprietary research, that back-to-school will continue to be very late, and it'll come late in the season, and it has been more and more bridging August and September. When we give these indicators on how we think the business is going to come, that's kind of all they are. I would say we're not very good at that. We're primarily giving you those based on our last year sales, so we look at it and say, we had a very cold September and sales in September were particularly good, so that probably is going to be the weakest month...","Wesley S. McDonald","Then we launched J. Lo and Marc Anthony with $20 million behind it.","Kevin Mansell","Yes. And by default, that makes August and October a little weaker. So there's no great science behind that to be totally honest with you. I mean, we're optimistic. We're sounding optimistic probably because our later June sales and our July sales were better than the sales we had all year. And our inventory levels are up, and they're not out of line because they're basically at the same level that we were at 2 years ago, so there's really no big difference. But we're better in stock, and that's particularly selling these back-to-school areas. So we're optimistic, but I also think we're fundamentally recognized. Weather is an important factor and the lateness of back-to-school is an important factor, and you're not going really know how that all works out till you get to August and September combined.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. That's fair enough. And then for Wes, just on the leverage front. How willing are you to leverage up the balance here? Your adjusted EBITDA looks like it'll be on target for a little bit under 2 at the end of the year. I'm just wondering what your thresholds are.","Wesley S. McDonald","I mean, I think it's something we're going to take a look at. It's certainly a favorable market. If we were to do anything, it would be in this quarter. We wouldn't want to do anything in the fourth quarter. I'm not looking to lever up dramatically, but I think there is some room to do some modest leverage on a consistent basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Swinand with Morningstar.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to keep on the SG&A and gross margin and talk about the sustainability there. I'm thinking about -- on the SG&A line, is some of the leverage in the store coming from the technology investments you've made there? And is the cycle of that -- where are you in the cycle of this, the investment versus reaping the benefits? And I guess, in the same scenario, you\u2019re talking about technology spend for online, and where are you in the cycle versus reaping the benefits?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I think on the store side of things, we're about halfway through our eSign rollout, which has been a pretty big benefit in terms of reducing the payroll required for setting our ads. We expect to be through the balance of chains by the end of the fourth quarter. So I would say we get some benefit next year, and then we'll have anniversary-ed it all really when we get into 2014. Regarding...","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Is there an additional driver because you mentioned in-store payroll is driving the SG&A? Is that the 90% of it or is it half?","Wesley S. McDonald","We don't try to get to that kind of level of detail. I would say it's a part of it certainly in the stores that have it. We've done a much better job of operating our stores in the mild and hot markets to improve sales productivity as we've right-sized the inventory levels in those stores, and we're not actually having to take as many markdowns. We're seeing a lot less drop in the gross margin in, for example, in California than the rest of the chains as we've gotten inventory levels appropriately sized. It's really just the guys are doing a great job managing the business.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, the other thing is, Paul, that some technology investment, while it isn't specifically targeted to the store environment, it indirectly impacts the store expense structure a lot. And the most -- the best example I can give you on that is we have not done a great job from a balances inventory perspective across the store portfolio. As Wes just mentioned, mild and hot stores have not generated the same level of merchandise margin because we carry too high an inventory for the sales they do, and our sizing optimization program has not worked as efficiently as we'd like to see. Our assortment planning strategies, which are a lot about tailoring merchandise assortments more effectively, have not been as successful as we'd like to see. Those things all impact the most important thing, which is inventory level, and that's a key component of what stores spend payroll on, which is handling and dealing with merchandise inventory. The other thing that's not technology-related and only indirectly is, as we've gone through our remodel process, we've quickly come to the realization that the move of customer service to the front of the store is a really efficient move from a payroll productivity standpoint. So it's not all about technology, and it's not all about technology that you would naturally automatically think about as in the store.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Some interesting stuff there. And then real quick on the gross margin. I know you guys have been particularly good at offering special discounts, Friends and Family, Kohl's Cash, various rolling or multi discounts. Has that been increasing penetration? And is that in fact impacting the gross margin? And if so, do you still see that as a positive? Or is it something you need to start to dial back at some point?","Kevin Mansell","Well, the -- what you would term special promotions, which we would call our monthly credit, most loyal customer promotion and our pick-a-day promotions which run at various times through the course of the rest of the year, the number of those, the frequency of those, I think, is static year-over-year. I don't think there's basically any change. We tweak the percentage savings that we offer those customers across the country along the store lines based on regional needs that we see or across the year based on particular months of the year. I don't really have the answer on that percent as it changed, but it's not a meaningful part of why our margin has eroded. Our margin plans were lowered because we made a very strong commitment to better pricing. That's really why our margin plans are down.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And pricing, you mean initial pricing to start with?","Kevin Mansell","Across the board. I mean, initial pricing in the spring season is very different than initial pricing in the fall season because the cost acquisition that we have is very, very different. We've gone from an environment where in spring 2012, we were paying much higher prices than spring 2011, to an environment in fall, deliveries in June and July for fall selling, where we were paying much lower prices than fall 2011. So I'm talking about net merchandise margin.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Understood, understood. So by the end of 4Q, do you feel like the units and the dollar inventories will start to be even?","Wesley S. McDonald","That's what we said. Paul, I'm cutting you off because we've got to get to some other guys in the queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Liz Dunn with Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I have a question on E-Commerce. We spoke about it a little bit during the quarter, but just in terms of the profitability, do you think that longer-term, you could achieve the sort of profitability in your E-Commerce business that you achieve in the stores? And also, as a related question, how much of a drag on the stores business are E-Commerce returns?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, the last question is probably the easier one to answer. We think, obviously, 95% of the E-Commerce returns happen at the store. There's also a lot of activity with buying something when they return something because, usually, it's an issue with size or fit or something like that, so we don't think that penalizes the store at all. That's our point of view on that. In terms of longer-term, I think E-Commerce operating margin will probably remain slightly below the store. We have a lot of investment planned over the next 3 years for E-Commerce. We're going to re-platform in the spring of next year. That requires a lot of capital. Home is always going to be, I think, a little bit bigger part of the online business. But from a return on investment perspective, my expectations will be in a couple of years to be significantly better than brick-and-mortar stores, even with the lower operating margin, given the fact that our investment will start to tail off. We\u2019re -- we built 4 EFCs. I don't have any plans to add another EFC in the next 3 years, so that's a lot of growth we can accomplish with very little fixed cost investment.","Kevin Mansell","I think also, this is Kevin, we -- Wes probably has a better handle and is more confident on the comment on return to invested capital because we have a pretty good understanding of that as it relates to our online business. On the operating income line, to be honest, we've doubled the size of our E-Commerce business in 2 years, literally doubled it. So I think, to some extent, we're using our best thinking, and it may be conservative and it may not be. We just don't know. I think Wes is giving you his best look into the future, which is it'll probably continue to run a little lower on the operating margin line but be better on the return on investment line.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","But -- so Kevin, are you saying that, that could be -- that could prove conservative?","Kevin Mansell","No, I have no idea. I mean, the truth is, literally, the growth in that business has been so staggering and so fast that we're just learning.","Wesley S. McDonald","And it's changed. I mean, who knows what's going to happen with free shipping 3 years out?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the strategies behind improvement -- improving the Women's business, the Home business and the Kids business. Wes, I think you said that Kids had really suffered because of a lack of units in that business. Sounds like it's improving now that you've got a better in-stock position. Is there anything else in Kids that you think is required there to accelerate that business? And just the strategies in the other categories?","Kevin Mansell","Sure. I mean, I think one -- certainly, the key thing in Kids we're focused on is making sure that, that area has sufficient depth of inventory to support its very high level of opening price point penetration, and I think we feel like we are there on that front. In some areas, like Girls, we've made a lot of merchandise changes as well. The merchandise leadership that runs our Junior business also runs our Girls business now. That's new. And some -- so some of the influences from Juniors drift down into Girls, and we think that's going to be a good thing. On the Home side, to be honest with you, the results in Home over the course of a period of years, and Wes can correct me on this if I'm wrong, but I think it's been actually pretty good, and Home has outperformed the company consistently. The weakness in Home has been very recent. And so we're focused on that, improving that. One area that we're really targeting is our Home d\u00e9cor business because that's been a drag. And then in the Women's business, there have been a lot of changes from an organizational perspective and a lot of changes from a content perspective. If you think about the last, essentially, 9 months, 2 of the biggest brands that we've had in Women's have been introduced: Jennifer Lopez and Rock and Republic, both on -- one on each side of the floor. And so there's been a tremendous amount of change there as well. We just have to -- we know we have to continue to work on content in Women\u2019s.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I think there's been a lot of questions on the details in the quarter. Maybe just a longer-term question. As you guys think longer term about some of the structural changes going on in the industry, you guys always done a good job with customers like -- groups like moms, in particular, and some of your competitors have talked about focusing on psychology of younger customers and the next generation. Seems like younger moms are bigger online shoppers, those kinds of things. How are you guys looking ahead at the next-generation shoppers and how you may need to change your go-to-market strategy?","Kevin Mansell","Well, we can -- I mean, I think we obviously know we can always do better on that issue. We have, frankly, I think, probably a younger demographic. Young moms generally are a larger part of our business than many of our competitors\u2019, and that's -- you can see in our sales the penetration of our business that is Children's and penetration of our business that is Juniors is significantly higher than all of our department store competition. So I think that clearly says to you, they have a lot of young moms in the store. It's a really important part of the business model, and we're not going to give that up at all. So we're focused a lot on improving that. You can tell, just from the merchandise organization changes we're making that certain pieces of those business are getting a lot more attention. Juniors is a really good example of that. From a customer preference, do I want to go to the store versus do I want to go online, more people across the age spectrum are going online. Certainly younger families are more apt to be higher online shoppers at Kohl's. But I think we're doing a pretty good job of that. As I said, we've doubled our business online in the last 2 years, so I think that's pretty significant. We're still behind, so we know we've got a lot longer pathway ahead of us. But I think we're making the right decisions in terms of where the investments go so that they follow what the customer preference has shown to be.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Let me ask you one last longer-term question on the topic. So it sounds like -- it seems like if we roll off these cyclical input cost structures that were largely caused by spikes in things like cotton last year, we're probably less in a scenario where the decade-long benefits of deflation for manufacturing in Asia are over with. You guys made a big business out of delivering better value every year for your customer. And as these long-term inflationary trends in sourcing seem like they're poised to change, will that change the way you guys approach your value strategy with the consumer at all?","Kevin Mansell","No. I mean, our values are really an important part of why customers choose Kohl's. And all you got to do is look at the last 6 to 9 months to recognize that when our value got a little out of whack, our sales got a little lot of whack at the same time. So values are really, really an important element. And as prices have moved back to more historical levels, I think that's in our favor, but it's more important about just making sure that we have the right mix of goods across our price spectrum, enough opening price points to appeal to a customer that is value-conscious and delivering that message to a broader audience, and that's why we\u2019re spending a lot of time talking about how we communicate in our marketing to a broader audience rather than a more narrow credit card audience.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michelle Gass, Chief Executive Officer of Kohl's Department Stores. Please go ahead.","Michelle Gass ","Thanks Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me is Bruce Besanko, our Chief Financial Officer. And before I turn the call over to him for a review of our first quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to say how pleased and honored I'm to represent Kohl's in my new role as CEO. I've now been with Kohl's for five years and during that time I have had the great opportunity to work along side Kevin and the leadership team as we architected our overarching strategic framework and the greatness agenda in our key priorities of driving traffic and operational excellence. ","I am stepping into this role and what I believe is an incredible time for the company. Our strategies are gaining traction and we have momentum. I look forward to working with the team as we continue to focus on delivering solid execution, innovating for the future and continuing to enhance our culture of speed and agility in this dynamic retail environment. ","We had a strong start to 2018, and I am very pleased with how the team has sustained our momentum coming into the year. We achieved our third consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth and our ninth consecutive quarter of inventory reductions. Our ongoing focus on the key pillars of our greatness agenda and our two key priorities continue to deliver results this quarter. ","I'll now turn the call over to Bruce for a review of our first quarter financial results. And then I'll return to add more color on the business and update you on our key initiative.","Bruce Besanko","Thanks Michelle. Comp sales for the quarter increased 3.6% on a fiscal basis, our third consecutive quarter of positive comp growth as Michelle just mentioned. And less noted our comp comments are on a fiscal basis. We achieve comp sales increased in both stores and in our digital channel. Digital was especially strong with an increase of 19%. The comp sales increase was driven by an increase in average transaction value resulting from a strong increase in average unit retail. Transactions were relatively flat for the quarter. ","From a line of business perspective, home, footwear and men's were our strongest performers while the children's business was the most challenging. From a regional perspective, the West, Midwest and South Central outperformed the company. The northeast and mid-Atlantic which were negatively impacted by weather, as well as the southeast underperformed the company. Our first quarter comp benefited from the calendar shift due in part to the timing of the friends-and-family event leading into Mother's Day.","We estimate this impact to be approximately 320 basis points. The shift will also positively impact our second quarter comp but will be a headwind in the third and the fourth quarters. We're pleased to report such strong comps in the first quarter despite unfavorable weather from snowstorms, which we estimate reduced our first quarter comps by approximately a 100 basis points. Michelle will provide additional comments on our sales results in her remarks.","During the quarter, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard. It has an immaterial impact on accounting for returns and rewards programs such as Kohl's cash and our loyalty program. The most significant change is to revenues from our credit card operations. These were previously recorded as a reduction of SG&A expenses but they're now included in other revenue which is a new line on the face of our income statement.","As a result of adding this new revenue line we will no longer report gross margin on the face of our income statement. Our gross margin rate is calculated using net sales and not total revenues. We'll still discuss our gross margin rate on these calls and in the MD&A section of our 10-K and 10-Qs using net sales as the denominator. For additional details regarding the impact of the new standard on our financials, please refer to the information that was posted to the Investor Relations section of our corporate website earlier this morning.","Moving to gross margin. Our clean inventory position and our localization inventory management and speed initiatives resulted in strong margin performance for the quarter."," The operational agility created by these initiatives allowed our merchants to react more opportunistically to consumer demand throughout the quarter. As a result, we were able to drive better full price and clearance sell-throughs resulting in less permanent and promotional markdowns.","In addition, shipping costs were better than expected benefiting from higher Buy Online Pickup In Store demand or BOPIS demand and shipping efficiencies driven by our technology investments. As a result, our gross margin increased 50 basis points which exceeded our most recent guidance. Consistent with our expectations SG&A increased 3.7% or $45 million to $1.3 billion for the quarter. As a percentage of total revenues, SG&A de-leverage six basis points. Our stores organization did a great job managing payroll, driving savings through our operational excellence initiatives which more than offset wage rate pressures.","Marketing also leveraged as we continue to optimize our marketing spend across channels. Credit which now includes only expenses as the revenue is reported in other revenue also leveraged. Technology expenses were again higher as we continue to make investments in programs like cloud migration and omni-channel growth to support our operational excellence initiatives and long-term success. Corporate expenses also increased primarily due to the recent leadership changes.","Turning to depreciation. Depreciation expense was $243 million for the quarter, up $5 million over last year's first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by IT investments in our fifth E-Commerce fulfillment center. Net interest expense decreased $5 million for the quarter. The decreases reflects lower interest expense and are capitalized leases as the store portfolio matures, as well as increased interest income due to higher yields and investment balances.","In April, we completed a tender offer for $500 million of our outstanding debt. This resulted in an eight basis point reduction in our weighted average interest rate and extended the remaining maturity of the portfolio in additional six months. The debt tender will reduce interest expense by approximately $25 million on an annual basis. This savings was not included in our original guidance. In conjunction with the $500 million tender we incurred a $42 million debt extinguishment charge in the first quarter.","Now moving on to taxes. Our tax rate was 22.8% for the quarter, significantly lower than last year due to tax reform, favorable audit settlements and the share based compensation rules that went into effect last year. As a reminder, under the new rules income taxes related to share based awards are recognized as income tax expense rather than as equity. Given our stock price the new rules resulted in lower tax expense this year and higher expense last year.","On a GAAP basis, net income for the quarter was $75 million and diluted earnings per share $0.45. Excluding the loss on extinguishment of debt, diluted EPS increased 65% to $0.64. Looking at our store portfolio, we ended the quarter with 1,158 Kohl's stores which are unchanged from last quarter. Gross footage was 99.1 million square feet and selling footage was 82.8 million square feet. We were also pleased to reopen two stores during the quarter that were temporarily closed due to damage from natural disasters in 2017.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $822 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $197 million despite repaying $500 million of debt during the quarter. Our inventory initiatives resulted in inventory per store decreasing 7% and our AP to inventory ratio increasing 195 basis points to 39%. ","Moving on to capital management. Capital expenditures were $133 million for the quarter; $83 million lower than last year. The largest driver of the decrease was prior year spending on our fifth E-Commerce fulfillment center. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $700 million. Weighted average diluted shares and shares outstanding at quarter end were both at $167 million. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of our stock during the quarter and continue to expect repurchase $300 million to $400 million for the year.","Last Wednesday, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.61 per share. The dividend is payable on June 27th to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 13th. As you saw in our release we're updating our annual adjusted earnings guidance to $5.05 to $5.50 per share. This excludes the one-time debt extinguishment charge of $42 million or $0.19 per share taken in the first quarter.","Based on our better than expected first quarter results, we now expect gross margin to increase to 15 to 20 basis points for the year. The debt tender transaction decreases our interest expense expectation to $260 million for the year. We continue to expect SG&A to increase 1% to 2% for the year on a post revenue recognition basis, with the second quarter increasing mid-single digit percentage.","And now I'll turn the call to Michelle who provides additional details on our results and an update on our key initiatives.","Michelle Gass","Thank you, Bruce. We've had a great start to the year and I'm very pleased with how well the team executed during the quarter. To provide additional color in our strong comp sales, home significantly outperformed followed by footwear and men. On a regional basis, the West, South Central and the Midwest outperformed the company. Active continued to be a key contributor of sales growth delivering 10% comp growth for the quarter. Given the weather headwinds Bruce spoke to earlier, the organization proactively leaned into less seasonally dependent categories such as home, active footwear and apparel, denim and wear now in key item basics.","This strategy along with our digitally forward agile approach to marketing allowed us to deliver strong sales results for the quarter, and is a true testament to the team's innovative thinking and cross-functional collaboration. In addition to our continuing positive comp sales trend, we drove a 50 basis point increase in gross margin over the prior period. This improvement was largely driven by our ongoing focus on inventory management, as well as our speed localization and standard to small initiatives.","And now I'd like to turn to a discussion of the progress we are making on each of our key pillars. I'll start with an update on our product initiative. We continue to see great success with our national brands which are up 6% during the quarter and which now represent 60 % of total sales. As I mentioned, active continues to outperform the company increasing 10% in Q1 driven by our top three active brands, Nike, Under Armour and Adidas. ","We have distinct strategies to drive the sustained growth of each of these important brands. Nike which is one of our largest national brands continues to post strong growth on both the core assortment across all lines of business, as well as new additions such as Nike golf. We are pleased to share that Under Armour is experiencing strong growth in its second year through expanded assortment and new categories such as Under Armour golf, men's basics, swim and outerwear. With respect to Adidas, we're seeing tremendous growth from our focus on greater breadth of product, elevated assortment and enhanced base in some of our stores.","As part of our efforts to invest in our active and wellness initiative in a bigger and bolder way, we will launch an active expansion test in 30 stores in August. Our teams have been collaborating with all of our active brand partners for some time to create a much more dramatic elevation of product in the customer experience in those stores. This will result in an increase in square footage for the active business by approximately 40% and will provide customers with almost 50% more choices.","Now moving to our proprietary brands. We experience flat comps for the quarter across our private and exclusive brand portfolio. As you know, we continue to invest in our speed platform. The brands that are on this platform including brands such as LC Lauren Conrad, simply Vera Vera Wang, Apartment nine and urban pipeline significantly outperforms the balance of the portfolio. Further, we continue to edit out some of our underperforming proprietary offerings, making room to further invest into higher performing brands and categories.","Footwear continues to be one of our strongest performing categories and is an excellent example of the success we've had implementing new product strategies. We have continued to enhance our portfolio with the introduction of relevant new brands including Madden NYC, Clarke's Coolibar, [fi-ugh] and most recently Circus by Sam Edelman and Timberland Pro. In addition, we continue to maximize the athletic opportunity with Nike, Under Armour and Adidas as well as lifestyle offerings with Vans and Converse.","Further, I am encouraged with how the teens are utilizing digital data and insights to inform not only our omni-channel business strategies, but also our in-store merchandising. I also want to provide you with an update on our women's business as this are a key priority for us. We are pleased that for the first quarter, our core women's business was in line with the overall company sales performance. This was primarily driven by continued improvement in the women's updated and contemporary business, the intimate and active categories and was driven by speed as well as clarity of brand assortment and value.","In addition, we are also very excited about several new brand launches. First, we announced yesterday that we are partnering with POPSUGAR, a leading digital media company to launch POPSUGAR at Kohl's this September. This new innovative apparel brand will be targeted toward millennial women and will tap into POPSUGAR audience of more than a 100 million readers and 31 million social followers to both inform the assortment and drive unique joint marketing approach. ","We are also excited to announce the launch of two new brands that will increase our relevancy in the toy space. Lego and FAO Schwarz. We will launch both of these brands in September in time for the holiday season. And I'm confident they will resonate strongly with our customers.","Before I move off from our product initiatives I want to take a moment to welcome Doug Howe to Kohl's as our new Chief Merchandizing Officer. Doug brings over 30 years of retail experience most recently as global chief merchandising officer at the Qurate Retail Group, leading QVC's and HSN's overall merchandising strategies. We look forward to the value and contributions that I know Doug will bring to our already very strong merchant organization.","Next let me talk about our strategic pillar of easy experience. Our digital business continues to grow and become a greater part of total company sales. In fact, first quarter digital sales increased almost 20%. Mobile was a key driver of that digital growth representing over 70% of digital traffic and almost half of digital sales. Recent enhancements include the your price feature which shows customers the net price after promotions and the smart card feature which incentivizes customers with Kohl's cash to pick up their items in-store. Both are continuing to positively impact sales.","We are excited to see the acceleration of our BOPIS penetration which is not only lowering our overall shipping cost, but also driving incremental attachment sales. During the quarter, our stores fulfilled approximately 30% of digital units compared to about 25% in the first quarter of last year. We are supporting our digital growth by investing in both our store fulfillment capabilities, as well as our state-of-the-art ecommerce fulfillment centers. ","Our omni-channel fulfillment strategy is helping us improve the speed, quality and cost within our fulfillment network. To further support our digital growth there are three key initiatives I'd like to highlight for you. First, we will be launching by online shipped to store otherwise known as BOSS this summer. This will significantly broaden the assortment available to our customers to pick up in store and add to our existing buy online pick up in store platform which has seen very robust growth in the past few years. This is another great way that we see we can bring traffic into our stores.","Second, we will begin the multi-year build-out of our six e-commerce fulfillment center. It will be highly automated similar to our fifth ESC that came online in 2017 which is 3x as productive as our first generation ESC. Third, we're making further investments in our analytics driven inventory deployment model to enhance both speed to customer and cost efficiencies across a fulfillment network.","Next I'm excited to share with you the progress we're making in our pillar of incredible savings. Just this week we launched the next generation of our loyalty program in a pilot across a 100 stores in eight markets. Phoenix, Raleigh, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Austin San Antonio, Buffalo and Rochester. We will read the results of this pilot through the holiday adjust if necessary and anticipate a full program roll out sometime in 2019. ","There are several exciting changes in core tenets of the next generation Kohl's rewards program that I want to highlight. This program is designed to drive traffic and sales through further engaging existing customers and acquiring new customers. First, it simplifies the program into a single rewards currency based on the power of Kohl's cash. Second, it will broaden access to some of our key sales events which historically have been limited to Kohl's charge card holders. And third, we will offer our customers the opportunity to earn Kohl's cash everyday with 5% for members and 10% for Kohl's charge card holders.","Lastly, through the loyalty program we will be personalizing offers and experimenting with additional benefits including free shipping for elite members. And finally, I'd like to update you on our store optimization strategy. We continue to make significant progress on our standard to small initiatives. As a reminder, this initiative aligns our merchandise assortment and presentation to the sales volume of the store and creates a better customer experience. In 2017, we aligned space to sales potential in approximately 300 of our lower volume prototype stores by editing the floor pads to tailor to local brand and category preferences and removing more than 100 fixtures per store.","This change reduced inventory, improved gross margin, significantly improve customer service scores and maintain sales. In 2018, we plan to convert an additional 200 stores. The conversions began last week and will continue through the third week of July. We expect to see similar results in these stores. As we discussed on last quarters call, we will be right sizing several of our stores by reducing the footprint of select locations. And to be clear, the new space that will be occupied by a complimentary business will be a separate store with its own entrance.","Our key priority with this initiative is to drive additional traffic to our Kohl's stores and we remain on track to pilot our first few locations with all the grocery stores as we announced earlier this year. Before we wrap things up, I just want to give a quick update on our pilot with Amazon. As you know, this pilot has been running for a little over six months and it has continued to be a positive experience for both our customers as well as Amazon customers. We are continuing to gather with Amazon to assess the pilot.","So in closing, we are very pleased with our strong start to the year. As we continue to build on our recent momentum and execute against our two key priorities of driving traffic and operational excellence. I'm encouraged with the traction we are getting with our many initiatives to drive traffic including our product strategies, the piloting of our new loyalty program and our technology enhancements to improve both the digital and in-store customer experience.","I also want to reiterate that we have a keen focus on operational excellence. We have made great progress in our efforts to remove more than $250 million from our ongoing expense base, which affords us the opportunity to continue to make investments in customer experience, technology and our people. As I begin my tenure as CEO I do so with great confidence in our team and our path forward.","We're happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Haimovitch","Thank you, good morning. Bruce could you provide a little bit more details around the shift that you discussed? Was that inclusive of both the friends and family event shift in the calendar and then how are you planning second quarter comps as you see the other side of this shift?","Bruce Besanko","Yes, good question, Lorraine. So as Michelle and I said in our prepared remarks, our comp increased 3.6% on a fiscal basis. We estimate this result benefited from the retail calendar shift by 320 basis points. So to answer your specific question and included both the shift out at the beginning of the year, the 53rd week in 2017 and then this shift in friends and family. So it's the entire retail shift as part of that 320 basis. What's the main driver was the fact though that we shifted out the relatively lower sales volume week in the last year that's the 53rd week and replace it with the stronger friends and family event which increased in breadth over time from even just a few years ago. So that was the essence of the shift.","Michelle Gass ","And, Lorraine, Michelle here. I would also build on Bruce's point. We did see an acceleration of our business and friends and family in particular. So we're very pleased with that acceleration hence why we posted an overall very strong fiscal comp.","Lorraine Haimovitch","And then do you expect to give that back in 2Q that 320 basis points?","Bruce Besanko","No. What we would expect to happen is in the second quarter we'd see the same phenomenon as the first quarter that is to say the shift would be a positive impact because we're bringing in a back-to-school week versus a non back-to-school week, they'll be shifted --that shifted out, so and then in the back half of the year as I said in the third in the fourth quarters we'll have the opposite effect.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. So Bruce as we think to the back half of the year and holiday I guess how would you rank the multiple top-line initiatives that you guys have in process? And then what are you embedding for 4Q versus the flat to up guide for the year just against that strongest performance that you had last year?","Bruce Besanko","Let me start with the guidance piece Matt and then maybe Michelle and I'll both tag-team on the various initiatives because we have a whole host of initiatives that have been unfolding. And those were a lot of --a lot of the reasons why we're seeing the momentum in our company but in regards to the guidance question, obviously, we've increased the guidance. The sales number though we increase the guidance in large part because of the gross margin out performance in the first quarter though we're still early in the year, but the comp sales for the annual basis is still the one --sorry flat to 2% higher for the year. And as I just said the retail calendar shift favorably impacting the first half and negatively impacting the second half. And then just one more comment on this guidance, obviously, the gross margin beat was pretty good in the first quarter. So we've taken effect of that obviously updated the guidance from a margin perspective 15 to 20 basis points. The SG&A we've kept at 1% to2% on a post revenue recognition basis though we've also added that the second quarter increase should be a mid single-digit percentage increase just as it was in the first quarter. And then as I said in the prepared remarks the debt tender offer will reduce and the interest expense and so we're expecting that to be closer to an estimate of about $260 million. And then on the initiatives Michelle do you want to comment on those?","Michelle Gass","Sure. I'll comment on those, Matt. I feel very confident as we look to the balance of the year including the second half and holiday. I think we have a great breadth of initiative. They're really balanced. First off, the national brand portfolio that continues to get stronger and stronger. And I don't see that letting up that we'll continue to be strong. Secondly, I'm very excited with what's happening with our proprietary brands, and the speed platform and I think as we comp that business which is a little softer last year. I think we have a great opportunity. Third, we see great momentum in our active business that is not letting up. And we had great sales in active last holiday. And I think that's going to be the case as well. Fourth is digital as we spoke earlier, we're making a lot of investments both in the customer facing initiatives for digital, as well as the backend. I think that will continue to serve as well. And then lastly, I'll make mention that we have an opportunity to gain market share. Like we took advantage last year with store closures. We have that same opportunity as we look to the balance of the year.","Matthew Boss","Great and then just to follow up on the standard to small strategy. What's the sales and margin impact that you see on the legacy Kohl's business after its retrofit? And on the partnership front if the convenience pilots were successful what kind of timeline what do you think we're looking at for a material rollout of any of these concepts?","Bruce Besanko","On the first part the standard to small what we've seen is no impact of sales. We've seen a slight increase in gross margin. We've seen increased customer engagement scores and obviously the inventory was taken down by lows double-digit percentage. So that's sort of a standard to small model that we've seen over the first 300 stores. And then Matt the second part of the question was --","Matthew Boss","On the convenient pilot so yes the Aldi were successful what type of timelines for any type of material rollout you think?","Michelle Gass ","Yes. Matt, we're in the very early days of this. We haven't even actually built one yet. So I think as we approach everything we along with them will open a few, will get a sense of how they're working and then together we'll make a decision on our way forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi, thanks. This Shawn, Bruce. A question was about traffic and the traffic trends that you're seeing and what you're most excited about in terms of driving traffic for the next few quarters? Also in the context of the products assortment what are your thoughts about children in terms of what kind of changes you can make there and opportunities you have? And if you could just help us understand the magnitude of active as a percentage of sales that would be helpful as well? Thank you.","Bruce Besanko","I might hit on the traffic first and then you can jump in Michelle on any added comments there and then the second half. So on traffic as I said in the prepared remarks it was approximately flat. We think it may have been impacted by the inclement weather that we cited particularly in the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast where there were snow storms that had about a 100 basis point impact. So I think that may have had an impact on our overall transactions and traffic. We're excited about the various initiatives that Michelle is outlined just a second ago that we think will continue to help us from a traffic perspective.","Michelle Gass","Yes. I'll build on that from a traffic standpoint I feel like across the organization we have a lot of great ammunition to continue to drive traffic both with our existing customers and with our new customers. On the product front, I mentioned we've got across all of our categories great initiatives including active that we've been speaking about, but our women's business is gaining traction. Our proprietary brands business is gaining traction. So I think that's really exciting and then on the marketing front I've been really pleased to see how that team has been really planful on how we're thinking about attracting new customers. We continue to see new customer rates improve versus prior year. So that's very encouraging and I also think from a agility standpoint as we go about a quarter and the team is doing great work to be responsive to sort of day-to-day needs of the business. So I think we're very well positioned on that front. You asked a question around kids and while kids did have a tougher Q1, we can actually point a lot of that. I'd have to say to weather because it is one of our more weather sensitive categories. And as we saw that shift the kids business bounced right back. So I think there we have a great portfolio of brands, obviously, Jumping Beans, our private brand that business has been accelerating over the last couple years Carter's phenomenal brand doing really well with our business and then active in kids as we brought all the brands across into the active portfolio for kids has done quite well. And then your last question on active as a percent of sales that continues to be a bigger and bigger part of our business. And so we're very pleased about that.","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay. Just a quick follow-up on loyalty. This change seems quite productive in terms of simplify to amplify what you're doing here. How have you managed risk in terms of the change and are you more excited about acquisition or retention in terms of how you're thinking about customer lifetime value with this program and what it may do and different risk and opportunity factors around the timing of this?","Michelle Gass","Yes, great, great question. I'll reiterate how excited I am about the program. I think over time it's easy to layer in additional programs and it can get a little complicated for our customers. So the team did a great job taking a step back and simplifying the overall program aligning it all under the umbrella of Kohl's cash, which I think is really powerful. In terms of the transition where --we're in the midst of that as we speak. We actually started just rolling it out yesterday across these markets. And they have a very thoughtful plan to connect with our customers really in every form of media to tell them about the change, to move their points into Kohl's cash et cetera. So I feel really good about the robustness of the plan. That being said, it's a pilot and it's a pilot deliberately so that we'll learn what's most resonating with customers and what's not. And we'll course-correct as we go forward. And I think the program really equally addresses our existing customer and our new customer. I think new customers will see the simplicity. They'll be excited about the everyday Kohl's cash about 5%. I think with our most loyal customers especially those that have our charge card, we're adding the benefit of earning 10% Kohl's cash every day, which is a lot of value add. So overall we're going to learn a lot but I think we're walking and feeling very, very good about what this will mean to our customers.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line Randy Konik from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Randy Konik","Yes, thanks a lot. I guess the first question is for Bruce. I look at the model and it looks like you are tracking over the next few years to get to prior peak EBITDA near $3 billion and the CapEx requirements of the business start to continue to moderate. I guess my question is how do you think about the medium-term CapEx needs of the business? And you nicely paid down debt so just trying to think about how you think about the different utilization of cash flow around dividends share repo and then further debt pay down? Thanks.","Bruce Besanko","Thanks for the question, Randy. So as we guided to approximately $700 million of CapEx for this year. As we looked --we are not providing any guidance going forward but what I can tell you is that we're going to continue to provide whatever monies the business needs to sustain the kind of growth that we think we can achieve. And so we're going to continue to invest in our store base. We're going to continue to invest in our omni channel experience. We just finished out EFC5 and we're obviously in consideration of another EFC coming up. And so we will adopt --we will adapt our capital needs to whatever the business needs in order to grow. And then secondly beyond that we'll obviously have had a nice run with our dividend. We expect to continue to obviously provide that return back to our shareholders. We've had great dividend growth over the past several years. And we're hopeful we can continue that and then to the extent that there's additional cash flow then we would use that to buy back shares. So that's sort of the set of priorities that we have but the first and foremost is we want to provide whatever capital is necessary to continue the growth we've we think we can achieve.","Randy Konik","Yes, right, good. And the cash flow looks like it's going to continue massively accelerate so just switching gears I guess Michelle when I look at the commentary AUR, it seems like that's been a nice inflection in the business. You kind of give us some perspective on where you're seeing the most lifting AUR in the business and how much continued rooms do you see in that kind of metric going forward because it seems a like an ability to help drive continued comp improvement over time.","Michelle Gass","Yes, Randy, thanks for the question. Well first I want to reiterate our top priority is driving traffic. And so we've got the whole organizations focused on that. We appreciate the fact that our AUR is increasing. A lot of that has been driven and it's been happening for some time now. So this is not a new trend around the shift in mix to national brands. So in particular as we've introduced higher end product in our active brands. This quarter we had a particularly stellar quarter for the home business that helps drive our AUR. So there's a lot of good there, but to me that's more of just a byproduct of the products that our customers are responding to and I'll again I'll say again our number one focus is to drive traffic.","Bruce Besanko","And I just add on what Michelle said just to further add on that the ATB has been up for the last five years and as she said mainly driven by the AUR which is the result of national brands and leaning into home and so on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.","Chuck Grom","Hey, thanks, good morning. Just on the 3.6% comp just curious how that fared relative to your original plan of 0% to 2% in terms of internal expectations. I am curious if you could give some color on the month of May and then Bruce with the second quarter given the multiple moving parts the 320 basis point shift and then obviously you're going to have a benefit coming in at the end of the quarter. I wondered if you could just give us some color and how you think we should be modeling the second quarter.","Bruce Besanko","Yes. Well, I'll start. There are multiple pieces to that, Chuck, so if we miss a piece obviously jump in but I think the first part of the question was we comp at 3.6 fiscal and how did that compare to plan. I say we were generally pleased with that performance. We obviously had the weather impact that I mentioned from snowstorms. There were actually two weather impacts. One was the snowstorms in the Northeast and mid Atlantic that's the one that we quantified up about a 100 basis points. And then obviously there was more seasonably cooler weather during our spring transition. And so Michelle had alluded to that when she was talking about our children's business. We've not quantified that piece but both of those did affect it but nonetheless I think we are pleased with the sales number that we racked up at the 3.6% on a fiscal basis. You want to comment on that.","Michelle Gass","Yes, no, I'll just I'll build on that I think we're very pleased with that result. As I mentioned in my comments I think even going into typically this time of year can be a little bit more volatile. So proactively the team's really leaned in from a product standpoint into home, footwear and active. And all those did really, really well and then another kind of key items categories whether its basics or denim or intimates those also did very well. So I'm very, very pleased with the result, and we're seeing that momentum continue. So I think we're set up really well for Q2 and see what happens, but I think we're all feeling pretty good.","Chuck Grom","No doubt about all the drivers but just given the calendar shift and I know you don't want to give specific quarterly guidance going forward, but it might be beneficial everybody if you could shed to how you're thinking about the second quarter and the third quarter in light of the NRF stuff?","Michelle Gass","Yes. The only thing I will add one comment to that and Bruce mentioned it earlier which is we do have a back-to-school week coming into the second quarter. So if I look at the second quarter we have a whole quarter to go here, but we're entering it with momentum and it will have the benefit from like I said that last week with an important back-to-school week coming into the retail calendar.","Bruce Besanko","Yes. I just to reiterate I think the first half of this fiscal year will benefit from the shift, and the back half from a comp perspective the shift will have an unfavorable impact. We said that in the very beginning of the year and that's held in the first quarter, we expect it to hold in the second quarter and then on into the third and fourth.","Michelle Gass","Yes and I'd say overall to add to what Bruce is saying and as he said earlier, our guidance for the year is zero to two comp, and we feel good about that.","Chuck Grom","Okay, great. And then just on the fourth-quarter call you talked about a mid-teens lift in new customers just wondering how you cultivate those customers here in the first quarter? What you're doing the retainer shoppers going forward because obviously that was a nice dynamic for you guys at the end of last year?","Michelle Gass","Yes, a great question. The team through their personalization effort in the marketing team is really doing a great job with new strategies, new tactics to connect with these customers. The fact that we are today investing so much in digital we know more about our customers. It actually --it affords us an opportunity to connect and retain customers at a rate that we just haven't had those tools in the past. So I'm optimistic that we are going to see overtime higher retention rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark Altschwager","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on gross margin really exceptional results against the tough comparison. How should we be thinking about that in the context of the now 15 to 20 basis point annual guide and easier comparisons in the coming quarters. Any specific tailwind in Q1 that you would expect to subside over the next couple or any further detail there would be great.","Michelle Gass","Yes. I'll jump in on that one Mark. Thanks for the question. We had a great quarter and gross margin was up 50 basis points which was better than what we had anticipated. Our inventory reductions which were down favorably at 7% at cost in Q1 together with localization speed initiatives drove that improvement. We had less permanent and promotional markdowns all of that played a role, shipping costs were --which are typically 20 to 30 basis headwind were better than expected. And so the guidance that we've provided for the year that is upgrading it to 10 to 20 basis point improvements for the year was based on this improvement that we saw in the first quarter. And we expect a more normalized improvement for the rest of the year.","Mark Altschwager","Got it and then just separately on the marketing front. Just any update on the personalization strategy and how that's unfolding this year? Any way to quantify the effect those initiatives are having on traffic or the comp? Thanks.","Michelle Gass ","Yes. Thanks Mark. Personalization as we've been talking to all of you about is a very big focus for ours. We're investing a lot as it relates to technology and data and certainly the teams. We have a lot of activity there. A lot of testing going on and we do think it's going to be a big contributor. As we sit here today we have our own internal benchmarks and metrics we will see it unfold. We're not in a position to a fully quantify because we're still in the testing and incubating, but we're all pretty confident this is going to provide an uptick in sales and traffic as we look forward. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell","Hi, good morning. Just you reiterated the 1% to 2% of SG&A growth for the year. Can you just talk maybe a little bit more big picture about where you stand now on your long-term cost saving initiatives?","Bruce Besanko","Yes. I'll jump in and then Michelle can add. So this is what you're referring to Paul is our operational excellence initiatives, which have begun bearing fruit late last year and now here in the first quarter. In fact, we achieved I think exactly what we had hoped for in terms of our operational excellence achievements here in the first quarter. So we're starting to see that benefit roll into the P&L. The process has unfolded very well. The teams have been tasked and budgeted with these operational excellence initiatives. They're baked into their budget. They're executing against them. And so and as I said in the first quarter, we saw the benefits of those things. So we're on track to hit $250 million plus over the three year time period. And we're pleased with what we've seen so far.","Paul Trussell","Got it and then you mentioned that the national brands now stand at 60% penetration I believe which I think is the highest penetration in 10 years or so. Just how do you expect that balance between national and private to look over the coming quarters and years and just bigger picture what do you expect Doug to kind of bring to the table from a merchandise standpoint that you guys have not done yet?","Michelle Gass","Yes, great question, Paul. As I think about it for Kohl's I think when we're at our best we have great balance across our national brands and our proprietary brands. We start with the customer and kind of follow the customer around what they want. Clearly, over the last year or so our increase in penetration of national brands has largely been driven by our active business. And of course with the addition of Under Armour last year that had a major impact. But we also are highly focused as I mentioned earlier on improving the health of our proprietary brands. So where that goes to me ultimately will be a result of where the customer takes us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bonetti from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Bonetti","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our question here. I'm just on the modeling I know you guys are hyper focused on traffic and I think you noted that transactions were flat in the quarter. And I know it's hard to make assumptions about how things like weather impact the traffic and you tried to help on the total comp, but as you plan for the rest of the year is your assumption that look the underlying momentum here if we put aside weather that the transaction number you guys give us every quarter can return to positive territory?","Bruce Besanko ","But we didn't -- that's a great question, Michael. This is Bruce. We haven't commented on or provided any guidance on any of the components of the underlying comp. So we're not providing guidance on traffic or average transaction value et cetera. In fact, we'd like to move away from that because those things tend to be as more difficult frankly to forecast. But what you are right that we were essentially flat in the first quarter from a traffic perspective. ATV was obviously up and look we have a whole set of initiatives behind our number one priority of driving traffic. Michelle has talked about those in her prepared remarks in here; in the Q&A. Kevin has previous to that is talked about that. This is our absolutely number-one priority. The team is highly focused on it and the initiatives are designed to bring that to fruition.","Michelle Gass","Yes. I just build on that I do think we had some unusual circumstances it affected certain regions but I think we all feel really good. We're leaning in with traffic enhancing initiatives both in our digital space and of course with our stores, feel very good about that even for the first quarter we do track our traffic in brick and mortar against the overall industry. We did outperform the overall industry as it relates to brick and mortar traffic. So I think that's another data point. We watch that very carefully but that is the focus and like I said across both digital in our stores. And we have a very deep pipeline of both our existing brands of new brands and a comprehensive marketing strategy to make sure that we're resonating with both our existing customers and of course with new customers.","Michael Bonetti","Okay and then if I could just follow that up a little bit more on product. Can you talk a little bit about athletic? I think how big is the athletic business as you define it today that part the comp up 10 and more importantly can you speak a little bit more to the comment about the athletics test stores? What's the goal there? And what are some of the big opportunities that you're focused on that you think could be a bigger idea for the company?","Michelle Gass","So a great question something that we all have a lot of passion for in the world of active and wellness. Now to think about our overall strategy and really where Kohl's can set itself apart is we think about it both as active and wellness. We tend to go to sort of the active footwear and apparel but we also have a host of wellness initiatives across the company whether it's fitness trackers or even in the fleet category. And especially we feel like we're uniquely positioned because it's for the whole family. So we're seeing active growth across the board, men's, women's, home, footwear and kids. So we believe that gives us a real advantage. I think on top of that we've got a very unique portfolio. We have great strengths in our national brands I spoke to those but also in our proprietary brands. So I'll go back to --we'll go as far as the customer wants us to go. People aren't using these products just to work out anymore. They're living in them. So that gives us a broad permission to really expand the category. So the test I alluded to I spoke to is really a test to help us understand how high is high. We're making a significant investment in extra space and fixturing giving great room for brands to come in and expand their offerings. We'll begin that pilot this summer and we'll learn from that in terms of how far this will roll out and scale, but I know we'll get a lot of learnings that will impact our overall strategy with active. We don't see this trend I think we'd like to say it's not a trend anymore but we don't see this letting up. And I'll just reiterate we will be on this journey with the customer and deliver the kind of products and initiatives that they want from us.","Operator","And at this time there are no further questions.","Michelle Gass","Okay.

Please go ahead, sir.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thank you. Good morning. With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President. I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results. Kevin will then provide some more details on our results and our thoughts on the upcoming holiday season. We will then open up the call to your questions.","Comp sales decreased 1.7% for the quarter, slightly better than the second quarter. Transactions per store were down 5.7% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 400 basis points, comprised of a 210 basis point increase in units per transaction and 190 basis point increase in average unit retail.","From a line of business perspective, Men's was the strongest category for the third consecutive quarter. Footwear also outperformed the company average. Children's and accessories were the weakest. On a regional basis, the West was the strongest region with a low single-digit increase in comp store sales. The South Central outperformed the company this quarter as well. The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast were the most challenging. Kevin will provide additional details on sales in his prepared remarks.","Gross margin was up 2 basis points to last year. Merchandise margin increased 30 basis points but was offset primarily by shipping cost. SG&A decreased $19 million to $1.1 billion for the quarter and deleveraged by about 12 basis points. About half the favorability to SG&A is related to timing of expenses and will hit the fourth quarter. Though our teams did a fantastic job of managing their expenses against our internal plans, most were unable to leverage on the lower sales. Our credit distribution center and IT teams were able to leverage but our store fixed payroll \u2013 and payroll expenses, corporate and e-commerce fulfillment center expenses, did not leverage during the quarter.","Headwinds in the fourth quarter continue to be as expected around store payroll due to wage inflation and continued use of store associates to fill digital demand as well as a timing difference in incentive compensation versus last year. We continue to believe that our fall season SG&A will be up 50 basis points to 200 basis points higher than last year.","Depreciation expense decreased $4 million to $232 million. Most of the decrease is due to last quarter's stores closures. Interest expense decreased $5 million to $76 million for the quarter. The decrease is primarily due to lower interest on cap leases as the portfolio matures as well as the store closures.","Our income tax rate was 35%, approximately 150 basis points lower than last year. Most of the decrease is due to changes in nontaxable trust income.","Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $146 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.83. During the quarter, we reversed $6 million of store closing and restructuring costs that were reported (5:18) earlier in the year. This reversal includes severance for corporate associates that have found reemployment elsewhere as well as lease liabilities for a Milwaukee area store that will be used for corporate purposes.","Excluding the positive effects of store closure and restructuring items this year and $38 million of debt refinance costs last year, net income was $142 million, comparable to the $144 million reported last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.80 per share.","We currently operate 1,155 Kohl's stores with gross footage of 99.2 million square feet and selling footage of 82.8 million square feet. During the quarter, we opened six Kohl's stores and closed one store. All of our new stores are in our new small store format. We also operate 12 FILA Outlets and three Off\/Aisle centers.","We ended the quarter with $597 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $96 million over last year, reflecting improved working capital especially on the inventory side. Year-to-date we, generated $599 million in free cash flow, an $825 million (6:31) improvement over the first nine months of last year.","We've made incredible progress on our inventory reduction initiatives during the quarter, reducing inventory per store by more than 9%. As a result, our AP to inventory ratio increased almost 370 basis points to 44.4%.","Capital expenditures were $591 million, $40 million higher than last year. Most of the increase is due to spending for our fifth e-commerce fulfillment center, which is scheduled to open next year.","Weighted average diluted shares were 177 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 177 million shares of stock outstanding. On Wednesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on December 21 to shareholders of record on December 7. Our board also increased the outstanding share repurchase authorization under our existing program to $2 billion.","Based on our year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share guidance of $3.12 to $3.32 per share. Excluding impairments, store closing and other costs, we continue to expect diluted earnings per share of $3.80 to $4.00.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin who will provide some additional insights on our results.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Wes. We're pleased to see continued though modest improvement in our year-to-date comp sales trends for the third quarter in total. The period included a strong back-to-school selling season, with sales up 5% in key back-to-school categories, but that was followed by a very weak month of September selling period.","I'm happy to say we ended the quarter strongly in October and saw progressive sequential improvement throughout the month as we moved some of our key marketing to better coincide with colder weather. The month of October ended basically flat to last year, which is encouraging as we enter the holiday season.","Looking at our sales by business, Men's was the strongest business with strength in active and tailored dress clothing. Footwear outperformed the company with strength in athletic. Home was consistent with the company. However, Home reported the most significant improvement of any business over the spring trend, which is a great sign, as Home becomes much more important in penetration to our overall sales in the upcoming holiday season.","Women's was slightly below the company, but had continued strength in juniors, driven by our speed initiative, as well as strength in SONOMA and other key proprietary brands. Children's continues to be challenging. Strength in Carter's was offset by declines in Jumping Beans; and Accessories underperformed the company. Double-digit increases in bath and beauty and fine jewelry were more than offset by declines in other categories. Overall, our Women's business is beginning to get traction from our speed initiative in several of our key proprietary brands. I would expect this to grow in impact as we move through the holiday and into the spring season.","The active and wellness category also remains very strong. We've expanded assortments and introduced newness with key suppliers such as Nike, New Balance and Fitbit, and that's continuing to drive sales.","Unseasonable weather, as we experienced in September, will always be a challenge for us. It's a reason why localization is increasingly important to our success, and we're seeing growing traction in our localization initiatives. We continue to see slightly better sales results, 50 basis points to 100 basis points, in localized categories, on less inventory versus nonlocalized categories.","I'm extremely pleased with the freshness and the levels of our inventory. This is year one of a three-year initiative in inventory reduction, and we're managing it well across all areas of our business. While sales were down 2% for the quarter, we ended the period with 9% less inventory and, as a result, had significantly improved sell-throughs.","Localization is helping, as it's flowing receipts closer to need. This has in turn freed up open to buy, which has allowed us to invest in stronger trending areas of the business. It's also provided flexibility to address seasonal differences across the chain. And as a result, about one third of our fourth quarter receipts will be spring transitional merchandise, which should help our business in our mild and hot stores, and keep our assortments fresh.","I'm also very excited about the exciting new brands that we're introducing. You already know about next spring's Under Armour launch, which will be the largest launch in Kohl's history. This holiday, though, we're also excited to offer the American Girl Doll of the Year, Koolaburra by UGG, and our most recent announcement, the Apple Watch. These highly recognized brands are sure to drive traffic to our stores and online.","From a marketing perspective, we see our positioning on loyalty as the most important differentiator for us in the marketplace. With the ability to use new technology enablers to personalize our offers and therefore grow usage and adoption over time, we believe loyalty has the potential to be a driver of visits and transaction size in a significant way over a long period of time. On a more near-term basis for holiday, we'll be driving hard on all of our loyalty programs, including our credit card program, Kohl's Cash, and Yes2You rewards program, by making changes in execution to heighten and strengthen the effectiveness of the programs and improve our value proposition.","In conclusion, we feel we're very well positioned for the upcoming holiday season. We have momentum coming out of October. We have considerable newness in our stores and online assortments. Given our much lower inventory position, we've created a more appealing selling environment in our stores, and we can deliver a substantial amount of new transitional product across the company as we move through the holiday season. Whether she shops in one of our stores or online, whether she chooses to have her merchandise delivered or pick it up herself, we're committed to providing our customer with a convenient and value-driven experience.","And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. One moment, please, for the first question. And introducing Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And first off, Wes, congratulations on your impending retirement. You're going to be missed.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks a lot.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I wanted to start off and ask about gross margin. The rate of improvement pulled back a bit from what we saw in Q2. Just hoping to get a better sense of some of the puts and takes there. And then, as we look into Q4 and even Q1, comparison's obviously quite a bit easier from a merch margin perspective, and inventory's down 10%. So I guess the bull case on gross margin could be quite strong, but what other factors should we be taking into consideration as we model that for the next couple of quarters, and any notable pressures we should be thinking about, beyond e-commerce?","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, we certainly think that we'll have opportunity to improve more in the fourth quarter and, as you mentioned, especially in the first quarter next year. I think for this particular quarter, we obviously didn't plan to run down 3% roughly in the spring. So we did have to take some additional perm markdowns in the third quarter more than we planned to get rid of the spring merchandise. So that was part of the merchandise margins only being up 33 basis points.","Shipping costs continue to be in that sort of 20 basis points to 30 basis points range on a per quarter basis, due to mix of business and then the actual shipping costs themselves. As we get into fourth quarter, how well we do on gross margin is really going to be dependent on the mix of business between digital and brick and mortar. If our digital business continues to accelerate in the fourth quarter as it did last year, that will put some pressure on shipping cost and we might not be able to achieve the gross margin that you guys might expect off of an 80 basis point drop last year. But I still think we'll be able to be in that range of 20 basis points to 40 basis points for the season.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Hey. And, Mark, the other thing is looking forward, the biggest single thing \u2013 and I think Wes would agree with this \u2013 on our margin opportunity will be our ability to change the process on how we manage receipts. And that includes both the massive new speed initiative that Michelle is driving, as well as localization as a key enabler, because both of those things allow us to bring receipts closer to need, and they also allow us to bring receipts that are more localized to the individual stores. So if you look at it on a long-term basis, I think those are really the big drivers. They're more permanent, I would say...","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Than sort of the temporary things that you're focused on, which is, hey, you had poor gross margin last year in quarter four, quarter one last year, therefore, you should have got big opportunity. Yeah, we agree, but it's these longer term things that I think you want to focus on.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful. Thank you. And maybe more of a macro question, if I may. Just a lot of noise out there regarding whether the consumer was holding back ahead of the election and encouragingly, your sales improved in October versus September, which may suggest otherwise. So just hoping get your broad views on where the consumer is as we approach the holiday season and whether there's anything you're seeing in your own sales data that would suggest demand has been held back and could potentially accelerate now that we're past the election. Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I mean, I don't think either Wes or I have a good sense of that. The cyclical nature of our sales in the third quarter, which was really basically really strong back-to-school, really poor September, and then very solid October were probably mostly driven by demand based on weather. And yeah, I think it's positive that it improved, but overall, I think our experience over a long period of time is things that are distracting like the election, once there's an outcome, certainty is a good thing. So from a positive perspective, having certainty on that is probably a good thing looking into the holiday.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, I mean, also, the fact that weather wasn't very favorable not only affects the selling of cold weather merchandise, but we lose the trip to the store as well.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Best of luck this holiday season.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. For our next question, introducing Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks, guys. First time in a while that you've managed inventory levels down as much as you are. I'm just curious, what has the exercise taught you thus far? Are you happy what it's done for the business? I'm curious if there are any places, categories in your assortment where pulling back on inventory maybe constrained your sales to some degree. Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","This is Kevin, Paul, and I can probably take the first part and I think Wes actually has a perspective on it as well. But I think the main thing we're focused on is not making inventory management a point in time exercise. So it's not about pulling our inventories down, we did 9% at a point in time, it's about a permanent change to the way we approach delivering receipts over a long period of time.","So the speed initiative is a key enabler of that because it affects our proprietary brands, which is 50% of our business. Localization's a key enabler because it gets the assortments that need to be in the right store in the right store, and those are the more permanent things. I think everything we're seeing, which is there are plenty of examples in the company where receipts and inventory were pulled way back and sales are actually up, gives us sort of the sample size in the examples to point other areas to say to them, hey, this works, as long as it's a permanent process change. Wes?","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, I mean, I think we're pulling down private and exclusive more than national because that's where the sales are going. We're also giving up space in private to make room for some of our new brands. We did have a pretty decent quarter last quarter, Paul, but \u2013 you're going to win your steak dinner, I know, but that's okay. But no, like Kevin said, it's a multiyear plan. I expect us to be down 5% next year and then 5% in 2018, too. So it's a combination of absolutely reducing the receipts and then how we flow the merchandise, as Kevin mentioned, that speed initiative is going to be a big factor and we're going to look to turn our inventory a lot faster than we have in the last few years.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good luck. And best to you, Wes.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And for our next question, introducing Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Go ahead, please.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research","Thank you. Good morning. Just wondering how much of your assortment is currently on the speed pipeline at this point? And where will we see that go over time?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, it's basically affecting, I would say, the Women's part of our proprietary brands. So Women's penetrates, in proprietary brands, much higher than the 50% for the company. And there are \u2013 without getting into a lot of detail, Lorraine, I think the way you think about it is it's been launched aggressively in certain areas, juniors, for example, and then it's scaling up in other areas, Women's sportswear, for example. And we would expect that 2017 is kind of the year, would have a major impact on the 50% of our business that's proprietary brands. I don't know if you've got anything to add on that, Wes.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","No, I think, in general, Women's, I think, by the end of the fourth quarter, we'll have 50% of the business on speed. And we're seeing a big comp difference between what's on the speed brand and what's not. Some of the successes, I'd say we've got a much better comp on the speed brands. We've been up sort of mid single-digits with inventory being down 8%. So that's a CFO's dream. So we continue to do that. That's going to enable us to do what we addressed in Paul's question.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research","Great. And then as you think about the athletic business and prepare for Under Armour, are you thinking about this as just growing your overall active business? Or do you think it will potentially cannibalize from other brands as you add Under Armour into the assortment?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, we're definitely thinking that this is going to grow our overall active business, and that's how we managed it from both an inventory allocation standpoint, a space allocation and a floor standpoint, a fixture allocation, a marketing allocation, we just see active and wellness, and not just in a traditional sense of active, but also the wellness aspects of the business that include technology, things like Apple Watch or Fitbit, but they also include sleep health and eat healthy initiatives. It's a permanent lifestyle change and we don't see it slowing down.","More specifically to Under Armour, I think our expectations are that the active business, footwear and athletic, is going to grow substantially and it's not going to pull back the rest of our other active brands substantially. It's going to be incremental.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, I expect to get extra trips. That's the whole key to this thing, is to get more people to come to our store for more things, and they buy Under Armour and they buy our other things as well.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. For our next question, introducing Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Good morning.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted ask about the transaction number per store in the third quarter, which slowed versus the second quarter. But I was wondering if you attributed that most to weather, whether you saw sort of regional differences in that trend, and if the overall trend kind of mirrored the progression of comps across the quarter.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","I mean, the short answer is yes, I think weather did affect it. It was different by region. I think I mentioned that the West region had a positive single-digit comp, and we definitely had better transactions as we entered October.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And on the price per unit, the nice sequential improvement there, was curious if there were any specific drivers. You mentioned you had to take some permanent markdowns given the unplanned weakness in the second quarter. So just was hoping to get a little more detail on that.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Well, the AUR was up about 2%, so the perm certainly didn't help it, it would have been higher without that. But I think it's continued strength with our national brands and the content's getting better. I went back and looked through the board meeting, (24:58) it's the first time since 2004 that we've had both AUR and UPT up in the same quarter more than 1%. So we're getting the customer to pay more for it, and they're liking what they pay. We just got to get more people into the store. That's the key.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, on the merchandise initiatives you talked about, specifically for holiday, where the big focus is for traffic?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, both the merchandising initiatives but also the marketing initiatives, and we sort of alluded to that, that we're really leaning on loyalty in the long term for driving our business. We're moving more and more of our efforts to our loyalty platforms, whether they're the credit card or Kohl's Cash or Yes2You rewards. But I think some of the reasons why our October moved more positively was that we better effectively landed loyalty offers, including the credit card offer, including some Yes2You reward offers, into timing where customers are more naturally shopping. And I think that was a big positive for us. And I think Michelle has those planned pretty aggressively to do the same thing in the fourth quarter.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, I also think the fact that we talked about Men's being better than the company for three straight quarters and Home showing the biggest improvement, both those businesses over-indexed in the fourth quarter. So that gives us some confidence that the sales will continue to improve.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks so much.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And for our next question, introducing Dan Binder with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Hi. It's Dan Binder. You mentioned that there was a retiming of SG&A into Q4. I'm assuming that was the marketing that you mentioned. I was just wondering if you can quantify it and tell us a little bit about what type of marketing. You're obviously very promotional already, and in the fourth quarter, just kind of curious where you plan to spend that money.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Well, I said about half of our favorability, or about $8 million or $9 million, is going to shift into the fourth quarter. It wasn't just in marketing, it was in other areas, too. Don't really want to tip our hand on what we're doing from a marketing perspective, but we're definitely, as Kevin mentioned, focusing on loyalty and focusing on Kohl's Cash, those are things that differentiate us versus our competition.","Our Thanksgiving Black Friday event is the only time of the year we do $15 off $50 Kohl's Cash, and that's a really big driver to get people into our store versus other stores, and so we'll definitely play that up as we move through the month.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","And then I was wondering if you could comment \u2013 I may have missed it. If I did, I can go back \u2013 just the national brand performance versus private label and exclusive.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","National brands continue to be positive low single-digits, and private and exclusive combined were down about mid single-digit. Private is doing better as things like SONOMA get more back on track.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","The SONOMA relaunch generally, I think, was well received. Is that comping positive yet or no?","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, on the Women's side, which is the biggest part of the business. It's up mid-single digits in the third quarter.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","And then the last question...","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","On 19% less inventory.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Got you. Last question was on the comparisons. You had a choppy fourth quarter last year as I recall. Started off really soft, then got strong in the core of the holiday season. Just curious from a promotional standpoint, as you go up against those tougher compares in the heart of the season, should we expect promotions to be heavier or more or less in line with what we saw last year?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, again, I think, Dan, first of all, as Wes said, I don't think we want to get into the specific activities we have planned in marketing. But just in general, I think when you think about Kohl's from a marketing perspective, it's natural, based on our history, that you think a lot about big events, about pricing efforts, about couponing. And more and more, you're going to see more dependence on product being important to the overall effort, and loyalty, which includes our credit card and our Kohl's Cash efforts and our Yes2You rewards effort, to be more and more important. And so that does allow us to time and, as I said, personalize many of those efforts more effectively.","So, it's going to be an intense holiday season. I don't think there's anything new about that, and there's nothing special about that from a year-over-year standpoint. But I suspect, when you look back at the end, you'll see a noticeable effort to better time our marketing, particularly around how we pull all of our loyalty components together.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And for our next question, introducing Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Go ahead, please.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. When you do look at your month-to-month regarding September, was there anything that could've taken place, in terms of trying to reduce that volatility? And as you do look forward to a lot of these structural positive changes you're making, is your expectation that we could see less volatility, hopefully, in month-to-month as it relates to weather?","And another topic we were curious about, inventory has been a great theme for you. Previously, which inventories were elevated? It sounded like you had too much and it was harder for the consumer to shop. So I'm just trying to understand what edit was critical, in terms of doing better with less stuff. Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I'll take the first part of it. It's Kevin, Oliver. I mean, from a volatility perspective, looking backwards to the weak September, there's always things, when you look in hindsight, that you can say, had we done this differently from a marketing standpoint, we might have done better overall. And certainly there were a couple things, particularly around the Labor Day holiday, that we look back at and say, we probably would have done them differently had we known. But they were informed based on testing and piloting we had done, so I don't second guess it. And I think, over time, we'll continue to make improvements on that.","We're always going to be affected by the seasonality of weather at a point in time. We just are. I mean, we're heavily penetrated in apparel. We have a customer who shops on a wear-now basis for that clothing and accessories. And so we're more vulnerable than some of our competition, both negatively but also positively, when it's good.","I do think Michelle's made, with her merchandising team, some big changes to lessen the dependence on cold weather as a driver. And, as I said, both the localization initiative and the speed initiative are key components of that, because they put us in a position to better depend upon other classifications within the apparel business to drive our overall business over time. But we're still going to always be vulnerable, as I said, both on the negative side and on the positive side, on weather. I do think, though, it's going to lessen, and we see it lessening, actually.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah. I think we did make a good calendar shift with our Lowest Prices of the Season event. We moved from August to September, where the weather was a little cooler, and drove a nice double-digit comp during that event, so that was a smart move.","And then the other thing I think is, we \u2013 and you can ask anybody in the company this now, I think they know the number \u2013 in 2011-2015, we grew sales 2% and we grew inventory 29%. That's not sustainable, and we're making progress on doing that, and it's a multi-year effort because we want to do it smartly.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And you may not have an answer for this, but as we think about Trump, there's still a lot of unknowns in the marketplace. Is this something that you think will still kind of be in the minds of your consumer? I'm just curious about your thoughts from a senior level as we dissect how this may impact shopping and sentiment, and how consumers think about what they may want to spend in such a time of change?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I mean, overall, I think, Oliver, you can only \u2013 as business people, we can only manage what we can manage. So, there are plenty of things, though, that we can manage better. Inventory is a big aspect, but that's driven by receipt flow. And I think we're managing it much more effectively than we did in the past, and it's giving us a lot more flexibility. So if, for instance, you feel there's uncertainty due to continued fallover from the election, I think more flexibility in a business plan is a good thing.","From a marketing standpoint, we're trying to do the thing that gives us the maximum flexibility as well, and that's to be less dependent on the big event and be more dependent on tying all of our strong loyalty components together over time. So, I feel like we're doing things with an eye to the long term and that it's benefiting us, and it'll continue to benefit us, regardless of whether or not you think the consumer's in a buying mood for holiday or is still not so much. I don't know if you've got anything to add, Wes, on that?","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, I'm not touching that one.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for answering that. I appreciate it. And congrats on all the initiatives. Best regards.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And for our next question, introducing Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Congrats, Wes. My first question is, what will you be doing this time next year? And then I have a follow-up.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Think I'll be on a pontoon \u2013 well not this \u2013 yeah, yeah, I can still be on a pontoon boat next year, so we'll see. If the weather never changes in October, I could be on one, so we'll see.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sounds good. Sounds good. Congrats on that.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just from a digital standpoint, has e-commerce continued to have the strong gains that you've been posting for the last few years? Just wondering if there's anything different from recent trends or your set of expectations? And then also, on the door fleet. I know it's a bit early to comment on this, but just wanted to inquire on what you've maybe learned in these very few short months since you've done the store closings as well as open the FILA doors.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","On the digital side, I mean I think that trends are similar to what they've been. People continue to shop and explore and search more online increasingly, obviously, more with their smartphone than anything else. And we see that in all of our metrics and all of our trends. I would say we are seeing, increasingly, a trend towards customers using that information to transact in our stores, which I think would \u2013 if that were to continue over a long period of time and grow, that would be a really good thing for us, because as you know, one of our key initiatives is to amplify the importance of our store base, and we have a substantial store base. So that would be a great trend if it continued. But I think overall, people continue to use the digital devices that they have to do all the things that make their shopping easier for them.","From a door fleet perspective, I think there's two things that happened in the third quarter. One I think you're alluding to, which was the small number of stores we closed. It's way too early I think for us to draw any conclusions on that. But I do think by the time we get to February, we definitely will owe you and give you some indication of what we're seeing from a holding (37:38) the trade area sales in other stores, and whether or not it was a positive thing or not from a market share perspective. So too early. I wouldn't want to share it, but I promise you that when we get to February, we'll give some indication of the impact of that.","The other thing that happened in the third quarter was that we opened up six new small 35,000 square-foot stores. And the more of those that we open, the more confident we're getting that those are long-term pluses for us, both to get us into trade areas where we can't make the economics of a larger store work but also just, in the long term, looking at larger stores that we have that have been more impacted by digital sales and are doing a little less volume than they used to do, there's the opportunity for us to scale down the size of the store, because we do think that that's, long term, a big positive for us.","You know we've said \u2013 and I think Wes agrees \u2013 having stores is a critical component of our success. So I think the small store initiative \u2013 and it's early \u2013 could be very good for us, and certainly the early indications are positive.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","And you asked about FILA, I would say we've had a lot of learnings from that since we opened those in May, and we've made some changes for the holiday season. And we'll be in a better place to tell you more details after holiday.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I appreciate the color, guys.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. In for next question, introducing Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Good morning. Hey. So question here on Home for you, Kevin, if you can. It sounds like Home had this nice improvement. As you alluded, Q4, it over-indexes, but Home is comprised of a lot of different types of trends and categories, so can you give us a sense of what started to work in Q3 and whether or not that has legs for holiday, or some other insights you can give us for holiday (39:53)?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Wes can (39:54)","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","I actually know this one, Neely. Kevin's surprised. But no, I think bed and bath have been the strongest categories all year, and they accelerated in the third quarter. We also saw some nice improvement in the premium electronics area as we got some of the new versions of things like Fitbit out there. What continues to be a little softer is the hard home areas in home decor, tabletop and cookware.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Thanks, Wes. And you probably won't be on a pontoon if it's up here in the (40:32)","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","I'm optimistic.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co.","All right. Best wishes to you. Cheers.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. For our next question, introducing Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Good morning.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Curious about two things. I guess one, on Under Armour, I guess you guys said being the largest launch in the company's history. So just curious about the overall brand portfolio, are you guys thinking about other national brands? Or are there specific categories in which you think you're still missing a big national brand or really could be impactful to your customer? So just curious about that in the same vein of Under Armour.","And then I guess, Wes, when you think about potentially rebuilding, I don't know, to a 37% gross margin over time, can you maybe talk about those positives and negatives, including the Buy Online, Pick Up In Store, the digital, things like that, offsetting potentially the merchandise margin recapture?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I can take the first part. I think Wes can take the other. On the brand aspect of our strategy, I think Michelle would tell you that she is continuing to push hard and explore new additions. She's had some great success. We alluded to a couple of the recent really important ones, which include the partnership with Apple and the launch of the Apple Watch uniquely as a component of our overall active and wellness initiative, which I think is something that will be very positive.","I would say any brands in which we can provide additional help in distribution against the core categories that we think are so important to our business. So naturally, the apparel business is our biggest business, and we're looking hard for expansions in apparel. And then categories that we really believe in, active and wellness is obviously the most obvious one right now, are ones in which we're exploring more aggressively.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","I think we have opportunities in Footwear and Accessories, but the Accessories ones are a little more difficult, I'd say. From a gross margin perspective, very simply, we're trying to get back 50 basis points a year of merchandise margin improvement through inventory initiatives. And I'm especially excited about the speed initiative because that should be incremental to the 50 basis points which should just be able to occur from getting our inventories to the right level.","But that's going to be offset by about 30 basis points of pressure from e-commerce, assuming that it continues to grow at the kind of the rate that we think it is in that mid-teens kind of a range. So from a modeling perspective, if you're looking at a multiyear model or thinking about how we're going to do 20 basis points a year improvement is probably the best, I think, that we'll be able to accomplish, absent improvement in comps from where we're running today. If we can improve in comps, then that could provide us some margin upside over and above that.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Super. Thanks for the color. Good luck.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And for our next question, introducing Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. And Wes, congratulations.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thank you.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I got a couple of questions. In the store, did you give Buy Online, Pick Up In Store penetration in the trends that you're seeing this quarter?","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Buy Online, Pick Up In Store?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","The (44:27) business (44:28)","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","I mean, last quarter it was about 5% or 6% of the digital demand. We would expect it to go up during holiday. We're making it more prominent in the stores. We're making it easier. There'll be a line that you can go in to pick up your order versus waiting in a general customer service line. I think we've put a lot more efficient tools in the stores to help our associates pick it in a smaller amount of time. We're doing a little from a marketing perspective to make people realize, especially when they're on the website, that it's available. I expect that we'll get up to that sort of high single-digit range as we get into the fourth quarter.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. And on the capital structure, I think the new buyback program, can you just update us how to think about the trends in buybacks over the next couple of years, and sort of share repurchase versus dividend, updated thoughts?","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Well, we'll go through a really detailed discussion with the board in February on that. We had a preliminary discussion yesterday, but obviously, with the increase in the authorization, we think we can accomplish that over a three-year period, roughly. So that'd be about $600 million or so a year for share repurchase.","And I would intend to increase the dividend at what level. I'm not sure we've targeted 10%. I think it would be dependent on what net income payout ratio that we're comfortable with. But I actually think the better metric to look at is the percentage of cash flow. We've done a really good job this year and I expect us to be able to generate about $1 billion in free cash flow after CapEx expenditures. So I think we could be able to continue to do a 10%, but whether or not that's the right use for the excess cash, we'll have that discussion with the board in February.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. And you talked about some strength continuing in active. Has the NIKE business continued to comp? Can you give us some updates on how NIKE's performing for you?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I think NIKE was up mid double-digit for the third quarter.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yes.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last question. You talked about Women's, you talked about Men's doing well. And in the Women's business, Kevin, the cold-shoulder style offerings in blouses and tops, there's some offerings on the floor and online, and I just wondered if you think that's a trend that can help turn and improve the Women's business.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Tell you what, Bob, I'll answer that question if you can describe for everybody what a cold-shoulder top is?","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So it has the \u2013 the shoulders are cut out and you have some various smock ones that are there. You have some J.Lo offerings. You've got Apt. 9, so I don't know if that's part of the speed initiative, but there's definitely some good trends and styles in those stores, Kevin.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, you sort of stumbled through that answer but you did a decent job, I would say. So yeah. No, it's good, Bob. Thanks for the color for everybody.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. And then for our next question, introducing Richard Jaffe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much. And first my congratulations to Wes as well. Wish you well and keep in touch. You can be an all these calls. We'd love to have you.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Let me tell you, no, he won't be on these calls.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Wes, inventory decline, obviously, is very impressive this quarter and there's more runway ahead. Do you think this rate of change in your inventory could continue for the next four quarters? For the next 12 quarters? (48:15)","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, absolutely. I think one of the big initiatives that we're going to in the fall is some of our lower volume 88,000 square feet stores, we're going to fixture like they're a 64,000 square foot store. So that will eliminate the need to just buy product to fill fixtures.","We've done it in over 100 stores already and it's proven to be \u2013 not affect any of the sales results and driven pretty nice gross margin improvement to the tune of, depending on the vintage, it was 25 basis points to about 100 basis points of improvement. So we have another chunk of about 100 stores that we're going to have in place for back-to-school, and I think that will allow us to continue to reduce inventory without hurting sales very easily.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And if you could just comment on the smaller stores. I think early in the presentation, you talked about smaller mall stores. Are you finding that the attached mall opportunity is attractive to you, that that's working, with a smaller box?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, I mean some of the stores that we just opened in the third quarter, actually, are what you're describing. I definitely don't want to get ahead of myself in the 35,000 square-foot stores. We've been open for now, I guess, six weeks or seven weeks. But you know that the strategy there had two prongs to it. One was pretty straightforward, which is, it gives us new points of distribution in smaller markets where we can't make the economics of a larger store work, and makes our ability to reach customers more effective. You know that we've put a stake in the ground, that brick and mortar is really important as an omnichannel retailer, both to have a place in the customer's mind, but also as a point of distribution. So that's one.","And then the second one is just this, probably longer term aspect which is, if you believe that digital sales are going to continue to grow as a percentage of the total, then we ought to be able to operate stores in existing areas where we have stores that are simply smaller because they're more efficient. And it's all positive right now, Richard. I just \u2013 I think we just need a little more time to give you quality.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, no, that makes sense. And just a final thought on marketing and more traditional advertising in the fourth quarter. Sounds like that accelerated towards the end of the third quarter and had some positive results. Could you talk about, year-over-year, what advertising will look like in 4Q?","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Year-over-year, it's going to be up slightly, $4 million or $5 million, not materially. And it's going to be more shifted into paid search. As Kevin mentioned earlier, two or three years ago, when you did search, it drove a lot of traffic to the site. With the increased use of mobile devices and the ease of use that our app and our wallet has proven to be effective with our customers, they're using it more to pre-shop. So we're having to spend more money on paid search to drive people both into the store as well as the website, because we're finding that effective use of the marketing dollars, but so is everybody else, so the cost to do that is getting more expensive.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Understood. Thank you very much.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And for our next question, introducing Bernard Sosnick with Madison Global. Please go ahead.","Bernard Sosnick - Madison Global Partners","Good morning.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Good morning.","Bernard Sosnick - Madison Global Partners","With regard to Children's wear, a price-sensitive category, you've had some difficulty, and particularly with Jumping Beans. What are the reasons there, and what does it say about the level of competition that you're facing?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, I mean, I think you know, Bernie, that Children's wear is a particularly and acutely competitive category, because price is such an important aspect of the buying decision. It's also uniquely different for us in terms of the competitive set, where the share sits. So unlike, let's say, Women's apparel, in Children's wear, we compete much more aggressively against retailers like Walmart and like Target. So I mean, I think our judgment is that it always comes back to product. Our prices are great in Children's wear; in particular, they're great in Jumping Beans. And you're right, Jumping Beans as a brand has been far short of our expectation.","Everything always comes back to product, and I think Michelle would tell you that that's where we need to put our effort, is to give customers better choices in product, to time them from a speed perspective more effectively, so they flow more evenly into the store, and more localized, so they're more appropriate based on where the store is. I think those are the three big things.","Bernard Sosnick - Madison Global Partners","The other part that was lagging is Accessories where, if I remember correctly, you made a significant effort to improve your offering. What's happening there?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Similar. I mean I think on the call, in the prepared remarks, we alluded to the fact that there were a couple categories actually that performed exceptionally well. One of them is really encouraging, which is fine jewelry. And as you know, the fourth quarter, fine jewelry's a more important category. We haven't had a lot of success in fine jewelry. The other one's been a more consistent performer for us, which is bath and beauty. That did well, and I would expect that to continue.","Our categories that are dragging on sales in Accessories are categories like handbags, where we haven't had success. And very similarly to Children's wear and the conversation we just had, often these things come back to product. And we just have to make better buying decisions, and we have to give customers better choices. So it goes without saying, of course, that that's a high priority for us right now.","Bernard Sosnick - Madison Global Partners","Well thank you. I focused on a couple of the weaknesses, but I don't want to leave without saying, you're doing an impressive job overall, especially with inventories. So thank you.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Bernie.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Bernie.","Operator","Thank you. And for our next question, introducing David Glick with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, and Wes, best wishes and good luck.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thank you very much.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just want to follow up on Buy Online, Pick Up In Store, as you alluded to earlier, it was not as efficient at holiday last year. You were just rolling it out. I'm just curious, how big of an opportunity you see that from a sales-driving perspective? And then secondly, given that it's your most profitable sale, how are you strategizing to build that business? Are you considering giving customers an incentive \u2013 a cash incentive, a Kohl's Cash incentive, for example, to come in and execute an order that way? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, I think right now, to be honest with you, we're actually pretty pleased with Buy Online, Pick Up In Store. To be totally honest, if you just did the calculation for the third quarter, Buy Online, Pick Up In Store as a percent of our total digital demand was not as high as we had hoped for. So we're not trying to dodge that. That's a fact. But we've been focused all year on the fourth quarter, because we know that's actually when the big opportunity presents itself.","And the way we're looking at it first is really to have provided sort of best-in-class experience, and that starts with the enablers on customers' devices, in particular their mobile phone device, to make the experience of buying and picking up in store really, really easy. And Wes alluded to some of that. There's all kinds of operational changes that we've made. I think our sense is that will actually drive the percentage to where we need it to be. I don't think we need to get at this point at all into more specific incentives for customers to consider to drive them to use Buy Online, Pick Up In Store. I think if we make the experience phenomenal, I think it's going to be really, really good.","And we seem to be overlooking, in some of the questions, the positive impact I think also of ship from store because, again, we've put a stake in the ground to say our store portfolio is really important, and we believe in it, and we're going to amplify it. And the way we're going to amplify it is use our stores for all aspects of customer experience, which include not just Buy Online, Pick Up In Store but also our ability to ship from store.","And so I think both of those for the fourth quarter are going to be phenomenal. I think we'll be talking this February about really good indices on both of those strategies.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, I think the key is going to be we have to execute after shipping cutoff because that's the key to get that last trip for the shopper to come in our store. Because with the 28% I think this quarter attachment rate, that helps drive additional sales. We got to just get them into the store.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Good luck in the fourth quarter.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And for our final question, introducing Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory. Please go ahead.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, everyone, and congratulations, Wes.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thank you.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","I know this isn't the end. We'll be seeing more of you on these calls or at least hearing from you from time to time.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thank you.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","As you think about the online and omnichannel efforts, what are you seeing in terms of expenses, ability to reach profitability, anything with shipping that we should be mindful of as we're going into 2017 and managing it? Thank you.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, (58:35) we continue to improve on digital profitability. So my comments on shipping costs is just it's a fact, it's not increasing. It's just as the percentage of the business goes forward, our costs per package are actually doing a little bit better. The key for us to continue to improve profitability is to reduce the amount of split shipments. That's the key for probably most retailers. It's especially for important for us, given our relatively low average transaction value online, which is around $75.","So we have a lot of IT initiatives to do that. Kevin mentioned ship from store. That's helped from a speed and capacity perspective, but we have to continue to help give the associates the tools to find all the items in that order so we don't end up having to send a partial order to another store. That's critical. So if we can continue to make progress there, I think you'll see the profitability improve.","Our overall inventories were down about 9% per store. In e-comm they were flat, so that continues to \u2013 and obviously, their sales are much better than brick and mortar. So we continue to get a turn (59:47) improvement from that perspective, so I think we'll be able to grow our merchandise margins on the e-comm side as well. And the SG&A expenses continue to come down. The EFC-5 that we're opening next year is going to be three times as productive as our existing EFCs. So we've got a lot of things in the hopper that are going to help us improve that profitability.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Dana.","Wesley S.

Please go ahead.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thank you. Good morning. With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President.","Comp store sales decreased 1.6% for the quarter and down 90 basis points year-to-date. Our average transaction value was down 80 basis points for the quarter and up 40 basis points year-to-date. Units per transaction increased in both periods, 1.1% for the quarter and 2.7% year-to-date. Our average unit retail was 1.9% lower for the quarter and 2.3% lower year-to-date. Transactions per store were down 80 basis points for the quarter and 1.3% for the year.","For comparative purposes, to those retailers who report shifted comp sales instead of fiscal comp sales, our shifted comp for the quarter was basically flat, down 20 basis points, and year-to-date is down 1.2%.","Total sales decreased 1% to $4.4 billion for the quarter and year-to-date were flat to last year at $12.9 billion. Kevin will give more color about our sales in a little bit.","Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 37.5%, which was 60 basis points lower than the third quarter of last year and consistent with the low end of our expectations of down 40 to 60 basis points.","SG&A expenses decreased $4 million or 40 basis points from the third quarter of last year but deleveraged 15 basis points.","Higher late fees drove a $12 million increase in net revenues from our credit operation.","Corporate expenses, which include IT expenses, decreased $11 million and leveraged for the quarter. Decrease was primarily due to lower incentive cost. Both store expenses and distribution costs increased $8 million for the quarter. Despite strong expense control and operational efficiencies, these businesses did not leverage for the quarter.","Our marketing costs were $3 million higher than the third quarter of 2012. We continue to focus our marketing efforts away from print and into the more effective direct mail and broadcast media.","Depreciation expense increased 9% over the third quarter of 2012 to $228 million. The increases are primarily due to technology investments and other non-store capital projects.","Net interest expense was $84 million this quarter, $4 million higher than the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due to debt issued in the September 2013 -- 2012 debt issuances.","Our income tax rate was 37% for the quarter, 50 basis points lower than our guidance, primarily due to tax credits, which were identified during the quarter.","Our diluted earnings per share were $0.81 for the quarter and $2.51 year-to-date. Net income was $177 million for the quarter and $555 million year-to-date.","We ended the quarter with 1,158 stores, gross square footage of 100,275,000 square feet and selling square footage of 83,671,000.","Year-to-date, we have generated $480 million more in free cash than we did in a comparable prior year period and ended the quarter with $598 million of cash and cash equivalents.","Our capital expenditures were $465 million for the first 9 months of 2013, $176 million lower than the first 9 months of 2012. The decrease reflects fewer remodels and lower E-Commerce fulfillment center spending, partially offset by higher IT spending. We currently expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 of approximately $725 million.","Our October inventory balance was $5 billion, a 2% total increase over October 2012 but a 1% decrease on a per-store basis, including E-Commerce. On a shifted basis, the best way to evaluate our inventory, given our heavy November 1 week receipts that now in this year are in October week 4, our dollars per store are down 5%, excluding E-Commerce. Kevin will talk more about our content of inventory in a few minutes.","AP as a percent of inventory decreased from 50.1% at quarter-end 2012 to 45.6% this year. The decrease is primarily due to reducing our third quarter receipts to manage our inventory levels, as well as slower inventory turn.","Weighted average diluted shares were 218 million for the quarter. And we repurchased 5.3 million shares of our stock during the quarter and 10 million shares year-to-date.","On November 13, 2013, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share, which is payable December 24, 2013, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 11, 2013.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide additional insights on our results.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks, Wes. Let me start with sales. Comparable store sales decreased 1.6% for the quarter. E-Commerce sales increased 15% and contributed approximately 120 basis points to our comp. That increase is lower than our historical growth rate but is generally consistent with our expectations, given our re-platform this quarter. We fully expect E-Commerce sales to reaccelerate in the fourth quarter now that the re-platform has been completed.","The West Coast region again reported the strongest comp for the quarter. We're especially encouraged with our results in California, which has the highest comp of any state for the year. We expect the loyalty program, which rolled out to California in September, to further enhance performance. The Northeast also outperformed the store average. All other regions reported low to mid-single-digit comp declines.","Looking at our results by line of business. Accessories was the strongest business. Strong results in our beauty categories reflected positive impacts of our beauty remodel program and the new brand launches. Sterling silver jewelry was also strong.","Notable performance in our home business included bedding, luggage, electrics and other soft home categories, such as rugs and pillows.","Men's and women's both outperformed the company on strength in the active apparel category. Men's also saw relative strength in both the basics and the tailored and dress categories. In women's, contemporary sportswear was a strength.","We are also very encouraged by our juniors business, which reported a very solid comp in October and, for the first time in many quarters, was consistent with the company's performance.","Children's and footwear were below the company. Within children's, infant and toddlers was the strongest category and outperformed the company. Athletic shoes reported a positive comp, making them the strongest footwear category. Fashion boots are also off to a good start for the fall season.","We're very pleased by the early results of our renewed emphasis on national brands. For the first time in recent memory, our portfolio of national brands reported higher comps in our private and exclusive brand portfolio. National brand penetration increased slightly for the quarter to 47% of our sales. Strong performance included Nike, Adidas, Carter's, Van Heusen, Gloria Vanderbilt and our intimate apparel brands.","Despite the focus on national brands, our customer continues to drive higher sales in our key private brands. Croft & Barrow, Apt. 9, SO, Jumping Beans all reported higher comps for the month. In our exclusive portfolio, Jennifer Lopez, FILA SPORT, Rock & Republic, Lauren Conrad and Candie's also reported higher sales.","In the area of store experience, we opened 3 new stores this quarter, bringing our current store count to 1,158. For the year, we opened 12 new stores. We expect to open approximately 10 stores in 2014. We remodeled 30 stores this year. We're in the process of finalizing our 2014 remodel plans and expect to remodel between 35 and 50 stores. The wider range is to allow us flexibility in our rollout of beauty, as well as give us the opportunity to test additional store refresh concepts throughout the year.","Approximately 280 of our stores now have a renovated beauty department. There are 3 different versions of the department: an expanded footprint with new fixtures; new fixtures in the current beauty area; and existing fixtures retrofitted with new acrylic overlays. Our new brands in beauty are performing very well and are exceeding our expectations. And although it's very early, we have seen significant beauty sales increase in the renovated stores.","On the inventory front, as Wes said, we've made progress each quarter on rightsizing our inventory levels. In spite of our lower-than-planned sales in the third quarter, we achieved our ending inventory goal in terms of both level and, more importantly, composition.","Our fall receipts are down double digits to last year, while both our replenishment and spring transitional receipts are planned up high single digits in the fourth quarter. We believe these levels will put us in a better position exiting the holiday season.","On the loyalty front, we expanded our loyalty program to California and the Pittsburgh market during the quarter. Including Texas in the original test markets, the program is now available to customers in almost 30% of our stores. Initial results are showing a low single-digit sales lift in loyalty markets versus the control market. And our current plans are to expand the pilot to additional stores beginning in spring.","On the brand front, we have 3 exciting new national brand announcements to share today. These new brands will increase our relevance, create excitement in store and online.","In spring 2014, we will launch an exclusive children's clothing collection, which combines the quality and value of our Jumping Beans brand and the magic of Disney. Made for infants and young children, the collection will feature beloved Disney characters. A new collection will launch each season at Kohl's stores nationwide and Kohls.com.","Also beginning in fall of 2014, we will offer IZOD branded menswear in Kohl's stores nationwide and on Kohls.com. The IZOD assortment will feature sportswear and dress apparel, including golf separates, woven sport shirts, sweaters, knit shirts, shorts, suit separates, dress shirts and dress pants.","And in addition, beginning also in fall of 2014, we will launch the Juicy Couture brand. We have licensed the Juicy Couture brand, partnering with the Authentic Brands Group, where we will be developing a broad range of merchandise targeting our Missy contemporary customer and exclusive to Kohl's. The Juicy Couture assortment will include women's and girls apparel, footwear and bags and fashion jewelry, as well as bedding and home accessories.","On the marketing side, consumers continue to be very focused on value, finding what they need at the best quality for the best price. We're delivering added savings opportunities in many different ways this holiday season. Shoppers will have more ways to save this year with additional Kohl's cash earn and redeem days, added savings opportunities for Kohl's Charge Card customers and additional sales offerings through Kohl's social channels. We're offering compelling free shipping offers every day throughout the holiday season. We're reaching our customers in the channels they use most through the lens of the new media landscape, leading to increased spending on our part in both digital and broadcast. We're also finding new, exciting and more disruptive ways to reach her in the channels that she is using the most, including premier TV program integrations and brand spots on highly watched event TV.","This month, just prior to Thanksgiving, Kohl's is presenting the New Artist of the Year for the American Music Awards. We will also be airing spots during upcoming NFL Thanksgiving Day games for the first time.","Our customers think of Kohl's as a Black Friday destination. If there are places to shop that are open, we need to be there to serve our customer. We want to be shoppers' first stop for everything they need on Black Friday and throughout the season. Even before Black Friday, we're showcasing how we have what she needs throughout the season, including entertaining and toys, early on. We're proud to share great product and value and are planning exciting events and campaigns, connect with customers and remind them even more why they love Kohl's.","In closing, as I said just a minute ago, our customers continue to be very focused on value. But value is more than just the best quality for the best price, value also includes how shoppers connect and engage with us. And they have more resources and information at their fingertips to do this than ever before.","We're excited about the direction we're going with our omni-channel experience. It aligns with the way our socially connected customer interacts with their favorite brands across all of our channels. Throughout our omni-channel efforts, we're building connections and improving the customer experience wherever and however she interacts with us. It's an incredibly fast-growing area for us, and we've made and we'll continue to make big investments to increase our capabilities and provide an innovative, seamless customer experience.","We expect a competitive holiday, given the shorter calendar this season, and are prepared from a merchandising and marketing perspective to go aggressively after market share.","On an extremely positive note, the month of October ended the third quarter very strongly, and we significantly exceeded our plan. That strength, further fueled by seasonal weather, has continued into November. Achieving our sales goal continues to be our #1 priority for the holiday.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Wes to provide our fourth quarter guidance.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thanks, Kevin. For the fourth quarter, our guidance is as follows: comparable sales, flat to down 2% on a fiscal basis; the calendar shift will affect the reported fiscal comp by approximately 160 basis points; total sales, down 2% to 4% -- as a reminder, last year's fourth quarter included an extra week -- gross margin improvement of 70 to 90 basis points; SG&A expenses are expected to increase 75 basis points to 1.25%; depreciation expense of about $227 million; interest expense of $85 million; a tax rate of 37%; share repurchases of 325 million; and estimated average diluted shares for the quarter of 213 million. Average diluted shares for the year are an estimated 219 million. This results in earnings per diluted share of $1.59 to $1.74 for the fourth quarter. EPS for the year is now expected to be $4.08 to $4.23 versus our previous guidance of $4.15 to $4.35. And as we stated in our earnings release, we will provide only annual guidance beginning in fiscal 2014.","We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to follow up a little bit on the gross margin line. Can you just give us some clarity on how the quarter went and what caused you to be at the lower end of your gross margin guidance and then where you see the opportunities for the fourth quarter?","Kevin Mansell","Sure. I mean, generally, I think our experience has been there was a slide in the range on margin, depending upon how sales develop. And as you can see, sales didn't develop in the third quarter the way we would have liked, so it didn't surprise us at all that margins were more near the lower end. The quarter flowed very inconsistently. As we mentioned at the end of the call, October actually was a very strong month, particularly the last few weeks of October, and we actually exceeded our plan by quite a bit. And of course, the mix of sales during the quarter, like the third quarter, has a lot to do with what margin rates we achieve.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then outlook for the fourth quarter?","Kevin Mansell","On the margin front?","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. Where -- what are the puts and takes that we should expect? Obviously, there's a lot of opportunity because of the excess inventory from last year.","Wesley S. McDonald","We had a lot of opportunity from last year given the dramatic markdowns we had to take, so we're assuming we don't have to take those. Having said that, we're also leaving ourselves a lot of room given what we feel is going to be a pretty competitive Christmas.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, the biggest, biggest, biggest positive by far for us is that our inventories going into the fourth quarter, even considering lower-than-expected sales, are exactly where we planned them to be, and we still have the same exact expectations coming out of the fourth quarter. So as you know, we really were hurt in merchandise margin last year in the fourth quarter by very high inventory levels, and those inventory levels have been really well managed going into holiday.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne Agee.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","When you dissected the comp miss versus plan in the third quarter, I'm just wondering what factors led to the miss?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, there's always multiple factors. But I think it's primarily all about traffic, didn't drive good traffic consistently throughout the quarter. We had a relatively good start. We had a phenomenally good ending, but the middle was weak. It was all about traffic. So many of the other metrics that we try to manage around average unit retail, around average transaction value, all were pretty much in line with what we expected. And the difference was all about driving traffic. Overall, our overall performance was also, as you know, negatively impacted by the re-platform of our E-Commerce site. That was -- we knew that was coming, and that was assumed to have a negative impact. But when you compare the relative performance of the company in the third quarter to the trend that we had, our outlook for the fourth, that was a pretty big factor. We had been running up about 30% or so in our E-commerce business. And then in the third quarter, we only ran up 15%, and it was all about the re-platform -- of the changes that were made. We're implying in our fourth quarter that there's an expectation that we'll return to our former run rates, and we're pretty confident about that. I'd say those are the big things: traffic, number one, by far, particularly in the middle part of the whole quarter; and second, E-Commerce, as expected, really slowed down through the re-platform, and it wasn't until the end of the quarter that it started to accelerate back up again.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just with the pickup here in the past, sounds like 4 or 5 weeks, is there certain geographic regions, certain product categories that have inflected positively to help you guys up?","Kevin Mansell","It's been pretty widespread. Seasonal categories have been positive. I would say they probably led the business over the course of the last few weeks, including into November. But generally, it's just been about much improved traffic trends. That's really been the big difference.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then as you do this loyalty card test in Pittsburgh and Texas and California, can you talk about the performance in the non-credit customer? And has that led to the low single-digit improvement that you spoke to?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, I think we're seeing lifts across all categories. We look at 3 different buckets, our MBCs, which are best credit cardholders or Burgundies, and then bank cardholders or cash and debit. We're obviously seeing bigger lifts from the non-credit card customers. They're shopping more frequently. And it's a much lower base, but we're seeing lifts in our credit card customers as well. So that's given us a lot of confidence that the loyalty program will eventually be rolled out to more markets in the spring. We're trying to tweak a few things and then have a very well thought-out program, so when we launch it to the balance of the chain, we don't have to make a lot of changes.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, the positive on loyalty is even in the markets that were in the original pilot. They -- it continues to grow. So that, to us, is a sign that it's engaging new customers. And as Wes said, that some numbers kind of backed that up, Chuck.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just the last question I have is with the addition of Juicy and IZOD. And I know that the game plan is to add a few more national brands over the next few years. And if you kind of look back, the mix of your exclusives in nationals used to be, 10 years ago, 80% national, 20% branded, and the gross is more closer to 33%. Today, the mix is closer to 50-50, and the grosses are 400 bps higher. When you think about the next 5 to 10 years for Kohl's, what's the right mix for the company? And how should we think about the implications for merchandise margins along the way as you gravitate towards a different mix?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I think on the mix question, I mean, the honest answer on that is we don't know. We're going to have to find our way on what the right mix of high-quality, identifiable, credible national brands is for us to improve the traffic trend. I think the -- I mean, honestly, I think the customer will tell us that, that she'll dictate that. There's no question that the brand penetration of national brand is going up. It's going to go up, for sure. I think Wes would tell you that the math is that for each percent increase in penetration of national brands, there's a corresponding adjustment in the mix as a result of margin of 5 to 10 basis points is not a big deal. It's a very different business that we run today, Chuck, as you know, than it was 15 years ago, when we were 80% national brand.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, it's probably closer to the 5, Chuck. Most of the -- we're private brands -- we're always going to have private brands. They're always going to be a significant part of the business. That's the biggest margin differential. I would suspect if national brands grow, penetration it will come out of exclusive brands, which have a much closer margin to the national brands.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could you help us on some of the diagnostics on the comps in the quarter? Could you help us think about how -- what the magnitude of October was versus the rest of the quarter and then maybe what October's comp would be, excluding the calendar shift, just so we have an idea of where those metrics came out?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I think we will probably -- we'll probably going to try to stay away from talking about specific relative numbers to one another because we do look at the quarter in total. And of course, we're responsible for the quarter in total. But the shift was dramatic from our September trend to our October trend. I mean, that's the way I would characterize it, Wes. And it was all -- as I said, it was all driven by traffic, really didn't have anything to do with average transaction and really didn't have anything to do with average unit retail. But traffic trends just markedly improved. And as I said, they've continued to be very strong. And they've been fueled, I think, to some extent, by some seasonal weather. That's been positive for us as well.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","We've seen some -- I guess, some industry data saying that overall mall traffic or retail traffic is very hard, particularly in the beginning of November, deeply negative. Have you guys seen at least positive trends in traffic in early November?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes. I mean, as we've mentioned, the strength we saw in October has continued into November thus far.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Do you think -- so all these initiatives -- we step back for a minute. All the initiatives that we're talking about, the national brands and loyalty, do you think these initiatives cause an inflection point in traffic for Kohl's specifically at some point in time? I don't think you'd be as excited to invest in all these things if they meant you were going to continue to be at the whim of what we all know are sluggish industry-wide traffic trends. I'm just trying to think through, as we look at the path forward here, when do you think that Kohl's traffic trends can break apart and say, we really -- we see the consumer embracing more national brands, the loyalty program hits critical scale, those kind of things?","Kevin Mansell","Yes, I mean, many of the things that we -- first of all, let's be clear, we're disappointed in the third quarter results. They were less than we expected on the top line. Having said that, to be honest, I think the team did an incredibly good job managing all of the other metrics, gross margin, [indiscernible], expense control. As we look at all the initiatives that we've been talking about with investors, they are definitely all forward-looking, long-term kinds of initiatives, that our sense is there will be a gaining traction sort of forward move. Loyalty is working. It's only x percent in the stores, and it's only been in place x percent of the time. The national brand refocus has literally just begun, and that's going to take some time to get hold. The new national brands we just spoke about, don't even hit our assortment till next year. Our E-Commerce, particularly omni-channel, efforts took a hit in the third quarter, which we knew was the right thing to do because it now allows us to accelerate the growth way into the future. And we didn't have the capability to that given the platform we were on before. We talk about beauty in 280 stores sounds like a lot, but the 280 stores happened essentially in the third and fourth week of October. It literally just took place, so it hasn't had any impact yet. The West Coast, particularly California, that has been a pattern that's consistently grown over the course of the year. And I'm really optimistic about that because, as you know, we operate more stores in California than any other state in the country. And then many of the concepts, both in the marketing and the engagement side, that our new marketing and customer service focus has involved and is being led by Michelle Gass. They're just starting to happen. So I think you're going to get a little glimpses, Michael, into it. I've referred to in the call [ph] , for instance, some of the new creative and new thinking on placement that we're going to be launching just prior to Thanksgiving. I think that we're going to engage customers in a lot of different ways that -- as a result of that. But that's a long-term strategy. That's not going to change the trend of our business in a week. And then finally, we've been talking a lot to investors about our organizational changes. And that, for sure, is something that I see gaining traction right now. And so I think that's probably the thing that I'm looking most far, is that those changes are finally starting to take hold. So I guess that's a long way of saying to you we feel pretty confident in our forward results for the rest of this year. But almost everything we're talking to you about is really for the future, and it's really for the next years. And it's not a 1-year effort, it's going to be building 1 year on top of another.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","If I could ask just 2 questions here. Kevin, for you first, on the re-platforming. It seems like you guys, obviously, started to see some business disrupt and then also start to improve. Are you guys already tracking back up to your historical run rate post the re-platforming? And then what specifically, from a strategic perspective, are you looking to do most out of that re-platform for 2014? Is it about the mobile side of your business? And then I have a follow-up.","Kevin Mansell","Well, the re-platform dramatically impacted the business in the quarter in total, and it most impacted the business, I think, Wes, in August and September.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes.","Kevin Mansell","By far. And as we've finished the re-platform, and then all the changes that were necessary to tweak it, to get it to operate most effectively began to take hold, the improvement in the business, primarily as driven by both traffic and conversion improvement started to occur. I think the re-platform really is another one of these initiatives, as I just talked about with Michael. It has to do with the future. If we had not re-platformed, we were not going to be able to reach our full potential online. And the re-platform gives us that potential to now drive forward. So it's not a fourth quarter initiative, it's a next-3-year initiative that just went through. And as I said, I mean, it wasn't a surprise. We're doing the re-platform and we knew it's going to hurt our online business, but our expectation is, as we go into the fourth quarter, the sales trends that we had pre-re-platform will reemerge.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then if you could -- if you guys could talk a little bit about the loyalty. I don't if you indicated your plans for rollout for 2014, but it seems like it's going well, you're pleased with it. I mean, could we see balance of chain rollout for Q1 next year?","Kevin Mansell","No, it definitely wouldn't roll -- I mean, we don't have the plans finalized. In total transparency here, the thinking is we'll add more stores in the first quarter. Michelle has been onboard for about 3 to 4 months, and she thinks we have a great platform to work from with loyalty. I think she's excited about the fact that loyalty is in place. But she also thinks it needs to be changed and adjusted and become much more engaging with the customer. And she has some very specific ideas about that, and that's going to take some time. So I think you're going to see just further rollouts next year. I'm not willing to commit that we'll have it in the whole company by the end of the year. I'm not saying we won't, we may, but it's definitely going to be a different loyalty program than we currently have today.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And last, just real quick on the inventory, so if I heard you correct, your inventory in dollars per square foot at store level on an adjusted basis were down 5%.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So I was just trying to dig a little bit more into the quality of the content of the inventory. I mean, obviously, your seasonal carryover is down, from a fall perspective. So just wondering if you could give us some other metrics around whether or not -- the businesses that are doing well, like juniors inflecting here positive for the first time and women's active doing very well. Have you fed the businesses that are doing well and starved the ones that aren't? And can I even ask, are you going to have enough inventory to drive the top line for Q4? Maybe you can give some perspective.","Wesley S. McDonald","No, yes, I mean, we had a huge excess of inventory last year, so having enough inventory to drive a comp in the fourth quarter won't be an issue. Yes, I mean, that's what you do. You feed the businesses that are working well, and you cut back on the ones that aren't. We cut a tremendous amount of receipts out for fall, as we mentioned on the call, down double digits, and it was very significant, while feeding the replenishment businesses in the businesses that are working. And our plans are to have a much stronger spring transition, especially in model hot markets, as we exit holiday and move into January and February for next year. So I feel like our inventories are going to be in a good place, and we'll continue to make progress. I would expect our inventories to be down sort of low to mid single digits at the end of the quarter, depending on where we end up on the comp. And then generally, the quality of it should be a lot of better in terms of a lot more spring transitional receipts.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, we had the worst case scenario. Going into last year, we had exceptionally high inventories on a historical basis. We had aggressive assumptions on sales increases in the fourth quarter, and they didn't materialize, which led to massive markdowns late in the fourth quarter, which impacted merchandise margin a lot. I think what Wes is saying, we're going into this fourth quarter with lower inventory levels than last year but, more importantly, significantly lower on fall and holiday. And receipts as planned for the fourth quarter are actually up on spring receipts [ph]. So I just think -- our feeling is it's not only about the lower level and the quantity being more right, but it's also about the mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have an inventory question, and I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the category performance. You listed a number of things that actually performed well in the quarter, including accessories, beauty and then some items within home. With the negative comp, I'm wondering, what were the categories where you fell short of your expectations? And then for Wes, on the inventory, it sounds like your accounts payable to inventory balances are down, and that would suggest some aging inventory. I'm wondering if you can just update us on the aging of the inventory and if you feel like you've got enough new fresh, interesting receipts here to drive business this holiday.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I guess, I can take the inventory question, and maybe Kevin could take -- as I've mentioned a number of times, we've cut billions of dollars of receipts out of -- in terms of out of retail. So hundreds of millions of dollars of receipts at cost in the third quarter because we bought way too much on the apparel side and accessories side last year. So we rightsized our quantities from that perspective. And the other thing that works on accounts payable, when you have struggles on margin, you get better allowances from vendors, and those are actually up over last year. So combination of those 2 things is why our AP is less at the percent of inventory. As far as sales go...","Kevin Mansell","In the product, I mean, first of all, don't forget that we had a negative comp, so all of the relative performance is off of that negative comp. So when we tell you that the business is better or worse, it's off of that number. The categories that did not perform to the company and underperformed to the company included children's. Children's was way well under, I think, the company average. And footwear, in total, was well under the company average. The athletic footwear business, actually, I think, was better than the company. In fact, it had a positive comp. But the non-athletic to casual footwear category was very, very weak. So I would probably call out children's and footwear as by far the weakest performing business relative to the company having a slightly negative comp. In terms of strength, we talked about a couple of the categories that you mentioned. One that we also mentioned, which only ran with the company, so it did not perform but is definitely improving a lot, is junior. Juniors ran with the company, which is not that exciting on the surface, but given the fact that we've had historically really underperformance in juniors, that's a positive thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","It's Dan Binder. Just I wanted to have a point of clarification. On the re-platforming, I think you said earlier that, that contributed to the comp miss, but you also said that it decelerated as expected. So I just wanted to understand it, while you expected it to decelerate, did it decelerate more than you expected, contributing to the comp miss? Or it just seems like you had a bit of a contradiction there.","Kevin Mansell","Yes, no, I can clarify. We assumed in the guidance we gave for the third quarter that there would be a lower increase in E-Commerce sales, and that the lower increase did materialize about to the level we expected. If you look at the quarter in total, though, and just think about the performance of the company in the previous quarters, E-Commerce was a big positive contributor to our comp. And naturally, with a much lower increase this quarter, it wasn't anywhere near as important to our comp. So we pretty much made our E-Commerce plan for the quarter. It just was a much, much lower increase.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then the other question was around these calendar shifts. In the last call, you called out the 150-basis-point hit to Q4 from the calendar shift. You didn't call out the Q3, and that ended up being fairly substantial, too. Was that a surprise?","Wesley S. McDonald","No, I can do math. It wasn't a surprise. We just didn't perform as well as we would have anticipated coming off of relatively weak third quarter last year. And the reason I gave the shifted comp was for clarification because there's -- some people report fiscal comps and some people report calendar comps. I wanted to give you guys a flavor because of the people have already preannounced their sales, and they've -- they announced it as a shifted basis.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Understood. And then on the loyalty program, just curious, as you looked across the different markets that you have tested it in, is the list that you're seeing fairly similar or does it differ much from market to market? And can you expand a little bit on what Ms. Gass has intended to add to this program to make it better?","Kevin Mansell","Well, the lift differential is not significant. It's 100, 200 basis points, really, difference market-to-market. And as you know, in short periods of time, that can often have to do with something else -- the market overall might not be performing. I think the honest answer on Michelle's thinking on loyalty is that it's evolving, and she knows she's got a great platform, and she knows she's got a tool to engage, and she's got some experience that has taught her the right ways to do that so that it's not about only giving a better deal or a better price or a better value, but it's about engaging on many other platforms. And I think she's going through the process of thinking about how do we do that most effectively for Kohl's? Or what are the triggers that we get people excited about joining loyalty beyond the obvious trigger, which is, hey, I can get a better deal by doing it. And so she's -- I think she's evolving her thinking on that, and my expectation will be we'll probably try out different things.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So one more, if I could sit on brands. You have not a lot of brand introductions recently. It seemed like it was a bit of a challenging task. And now you've come up with 2 pretty good brands, I mean, I'm just kind of curious, what's changing in the conversations with these brands that allowed you to get these 2? And do you expect to have many more behind them?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I think, really, most of the changes, really, in terms of our -- the insights that we've learned by the results in our own traffic trends, that the insights have clearly indicated a need to strengthen the portfolio of national brands, that we have to restore the level of credibility customers have with the value we give. And so we're just being much more proactive, Dan, on our side, reaching out, trying to identify the white spaces, brands that would make most sense in each of the categories. As you can imagine, we're working with a sense of urgency on that. I would expect to have new brands consistently. So this is not going to be a one-quarter thing. I would expect to be talking to you about this issue in February, at the end of the fourth quarter, as well. So I think most of it is on our side. And then naturally, as brands see brands launching at Kohl's and the way in which we can do it and the commitment that we'll make to delivering a credible presentation and the aesthetic of the brand, that gives other brands more confidence that it might be the right thing to do for them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Liz Dunn with Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Just a follow-up on the E-Commerce re-platforming. So I -- just like your site is down right now. So is the re-platforming done or -- and will there be any carryover impact on fourth quarter? Because I thought you said that things would -- that this would better for the fourth quarter.","Wesley S. McDonald","It will be. The site's down for planned maintenance. We -- it's our last stress test before we go into peak season. And we moved it a little bit forward, so people could use our Kohl's Cash that was expiring at midnight. And that's -- it should be back up here briefly. It was scheduled to be up around 10:00.","Kevin Mansell","Just the re-platform is done, and it's very effective, and it's working, and it's going to allow us to maximize sales in the fourth quarter. We're really confident about that.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then setting aside the re-platforming, where do you currently stand on the profitability of the E-Commerce business? I know that's something you've been making some progress on.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, the way we look at it, I would say we're still in the mid-single-digit operating margin range. We think that a couple of things that are working for us going forward will help us with that. Shipping costs, as we roll out ship-from-store, should be reduced because you won't be shipping across zones, so that should be a benefit. And we have our fourth E-Commerce fulfillment center up and running and automated this year. Last year, it was mostly manual. And that should help us. It's the optimal number of ECs you need to minimize your transportation costs, so that will help on the shipping cost. And we're starting to get some traction in terms of seeing some apparel growth faster than home. Home has been a bigger part of the business which carries a little bit lower margin. But as we get more scale, I think we should start to do a little bit better on the operating margin line. But I think it will be difficult for it to be the same operating margin as brick and mortar.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then finally, I know you're probably sick of this question, but to the extent that J.C. Penney was able to pull off a strong positive comp for the fourth quarter, would you view that as a risk for you guys? Or do you think, since you didn't get a lot of the share, it's really you're kind of operating in a different -- with a different customer base?","Kevin Mansell","I think it looks to me like the latter. Just having gone through the 18 months of their change and transformation and the modest, to say the least, impact it had on us, I would expect the same -- I mean, kind of going the other way. And even as they've become a more promotional store in the very, very recent past, the differences in performance on our stores relative to their stores by trade area, it's just negligible.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","As you think about the new beauty assortment, can you just talk about, one, I guess, how that basket compares in the beauty shop versus your average? And then is there still an opportunity to get more brands as you demonstrate success with the rollout?","Kevin Mansell","I think it's just too early for us to give you any commentary that would be any good for you on the beauty baskets. We're just kind of looking at a business that was -- the reconstruction, the new service model and the delivery of the new brands, all basically happened in October. And most stores were not set until the last week of -- third to fourth week of October. We just know that, initially, the results look really, really good. We've had a big first in sales in beauty. And of course, it depends on which of the 3 types of environments a store has as to what kind of increase we're getting. I think that the beauty initiative, similar to some of the other initiatives we've talked about, is a long-term initiative. And certainly, there are, certainly, suppliers who are probably more in the wait-and-see mode. They'd like to see what the environment really looks like. They'd like to see what the results really are. They'd like to experience the customer service levels that the brands that we do have get. And given those results, I suspect, will be more or less open to considering distribution at Kohl's. I would tell you that in the environments we've set, they're very well done, and they're being very well serviced, and the results are really good.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on the non-credit card customers. You did mention that you're engaging new customers, so can you talk about how maybe that basket compares to the credit card customers, both in terms of categories and then also just the sheer size?","Kevin Mansell","Well, the basket for non-credit card customers is always going to be smaller on the average. Our averages by default of credit card customers' basket is higher. It's really -- the non-credit customer is really more about visits. These are new visits. And so regardless of what their relative basket size is on the visit, it's adding a visit that we weren't getting before. And what we're really focused on is just customer acquisition. And so getting more customers in the door has consistently been the challenge, and we know that that's where our attention has got to go here. And we think loyalty, it's not the only tool by any stretch of imagination, but it's a key tool to do that.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And understood on the lower basket. But I guess, relative to the non-credit card customers who are already existing, I guess, is my question and also on the categories just as a follow-up, are there specific categories that they're being drawn to when it's a new customer?","Kevin Mansell","I don't think either of us probably have the answer to that. I don't.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, the basket for a credit card customer is roughly 10% higher than a bank card customer. But in terms of mix, we've looked at it, there's not a significant mix difference. I'd say new customers are more prone to buy our national brands, which is sort of a reason why we're using that strategy to get more new customers.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. One last one, if I can, just on CapEx. It looks like there's a fairly large increase in the fourth quarter. Is there something specific driving that? I think you referenced IT maybe.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, most of it's related to IT projects that will get installed then. So that's really it. We're also closing on some doors for next year. We have more spring stores next year than we had this year and a couple other non-retail or -- yes, non-retail CapEx projects that we're working on so...","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Can you talk a little bit about -- on the expense side, you mentioned that store expenses and distribution costs increased for the quarter, that they didn't leverage; and marketing expenses, $3 million higher. How are you thinking of that for the fourth quarter and going into next year? And where are you on the tally for share buyback this year?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, on the share buyback, we should be, if we buy the 325 million, somewhere around 820 -- between 825 million and 850 million, I think, so a little lower than what we thought. We do all of our share repurchases on a 10b5-1 plan. And we can adjust that in the last month of the quarter through the earnings call. So when the stock got higher, we, obviously, in the plan, have bought less. So that's why we fell a little short of what we wanted to be in the third quarter. And in terms of expenses, when you're -- if you're adding new stores, your expenses are going to go up for stores. And distribution, most of the distribution expense increase was related to E-Commerce. Some of the store increase was related to payroll, especially with the beauty rollout that we had, as Kevin mentioned earlier. Marketing expense is up slightly. It leverages on a year-to-date basis. But we're investing a lot more in marketing in the fourth quarter, which is why you see the expenses go up in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next -- your final question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Kevin and Wes, you've spoken about increasing the marketing spend. And I just wanted to maybe have a discussion about choosing to go kind of that route versus the actual discounting or amount of promotional kind of intensity that we're seeing in the stores of your peer group. How do you kind of think about advertising more versus actual price points and providing value on the products, especially as we head into the holiday period?","Kevin Mansell","I mean, I think generally, Paul, that all of the research and the insights that we gathered from that research have indicated that we don't have a problem at all with customers on pricing credibility, on being a low-priced leader, on offering great sales, on offering big discounts, on offering great value. So spending more, both in the past and even in the future, against that would not make a lot of sense based on the results that we've gotten in the past and the research that we've done. What is lacking is more customer engagement. We're not gaining enough new customers. And I think that has everything to do with reaching them in a different way, evolving our message, which we're just beginning to do, and I would expect it to evolve a lot as we go into 2014, and reaching them on new platforms more aggressively. So we mentioned digital as a specific example. We mentioned television as another. Not that we don't advertise on television, we always have, but we are doing more on the integration side and more what I would describe as breakthrough kind of advertising. I think if Michelle were here, she would talk to you about being more disruptive in the marketing that we do. And so some of the things like the American Music Award effort, which I think is going to be very unique as the reach of that is going to go way beyond just the people who see the spot and our advertising on the NFL on Thanksgiving Day, these are new venues for us. So we're very convinced that the changes in our marketing are much more important than spending that money against lower prices because we're already where we need to be on pricing.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, from an AUR perspective, I think I mentioned on the call, we're down about 2% for both the quarter and the year. I would expect our fourth quarter AURs to be up a little, but that's only because of we should have a lot less clearance. Our out-the-door price during the competitive holiday season should be at or below last year's.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just touch base quickly, just kind of on the overall holiday kind of merchandise strategy as well. I mean, I noticed in the Black Friday ad, I mean, the first few pages are certainly full of kind of non-core items, such as toys and electronics and TVs and DVDs, et cetera. I know inventory levels are down overall, but can you maybe just kind of give us some color on where you stand on some of these kind of gift-giving niche kind of holiday specific items versus the apparel?","Kevin Mansell","Yes, sure. I mean, it's along the same items as what I just spoke about on an overall basis, which is to try to surprise our customers, to try to give them something different and more unique. If you looked at the Black Friday ad, you probably also have noticed that there are items that are only available in-store, and that's something new for us, so that, that customer gets something very specific and unique. So on that, that all came out of and was informed, obviously, by our own results last year, but just also the research that we've done.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, and our -- we've always had a big toy business. It, obviously, gets exacerbated in the fourth quarter. But last year, we ran a 25 comp in toys, so it's a big business for us in the fourth quarter. It's a big business for us, and we expect it to be a big business again in the fourth quarter.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then just my last question is, the guidance before Q gross margins was tweaked to 7 -- up 70 to 90 basis points. If there was to be upside to the fourth quarter, could you just kind of highlight where you think that would come from?","Kevin Mansell","In my mind, the upside for the fourth quarter is on the top line. That's where we're focused on, all these new initiatives. The marketing strategies that are a little different. We're focused on exceeding that, and we have assumptions in the fourth quarter plan that we think are sensible given the trend of our business, but we're focused on upside on the top line.","Operator","And that was your final question. Do you have any closing remarks? Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"13038":["Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) Q4 2012 Earnings Call February 28, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Wesley S.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Kohl's Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","Certain statements made on this call, including projected financial results, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

I would now like to turn the call over to Wes McDonald, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thank you. With me today is Kevin Mansell, the President, Chairman and CEO. I'll walk us through the balance sheet and P&L and give you some forward-looking guidance, and Kevin will take you through some of our merchandising and marketing strategies for 2013.","As a reminder, the 2012 fiscal year was a 53-week year for accounting purposes. All results reported today are 53-week results, with the exception of comp sales metrics. Details on the impact of the 53rd week are available in the text of the earnings release.","Comp sales increased 1.9% for the quarter and up 30 basis points for the year. The quarterly comp increase reflects a 4.2% increase in units per transaction, offset by a 2.5% decrease in average unit retail. Transactions were essentially flat for the quarter. For the year, average unit retail increased 1.8%, and transactions per store decreased 1.5%. Units per transaction were flat for the year.","Total sales increased 5.4% to $6.3 billion for the quarter and 2.5% to $19.3 billion for the year. Kohl's charge sales penetration increased 80 basis points to 54% of total sales for the quarter. Our annual credit share was 56%, an increase of 130 basis points over fiscal 2011. Kevin will provide more color on our sales in a few minutes.","Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 33.3%, approximately 290 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of last year.","SG&A increased 3% for the quarter, better than our expectations of up 3.5% to 4.5%. SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged approximately 40 basis points for both the quarter and the year.","Depreciation expense increased 10% over the fourth quarter of 2011 to $214 million. For the year, depreciation increased 7% to $833 million. The increases are primarily due to IT investments.","Net interest expense was $85 million this quarter and $329 million for the year. The increases are primarily due to debt issuances in September 2012 and October 2011. Our income tax rate was 37.1% for the quarter, 70 basis points below our expectation of 37.8%. The difference is due to tax credits that were extended when the fiscal cliff deal was finalized.","Diluted earnings per share decreased 8% to $1.66 for the quarter. Net income was $378 million for the current-year quarter and $986 million for the year. For the year, diluted earnings per share were $4.17 this year versus $4.30 last year. The 53rd week increased our current-year EPS by approximately $0.06.","Some information for your models. We currently have 1,146 stores, with gross square footage of 99.57 million square feet and selling square footage of 83.09 million. Square footage is 1% higher than last year at this time.","Moving on to some balance sheet metrics. We ended the quarter with $537 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our CapEx expenditures were $785 million for 2012, $142 million lower than 2011. The change reflects changes in our capital expenditure mix, including fewer remodels and new stores, partially offset by higher IT spending. As a reminder, we opened 12 new stores this fall compared to 31 last fall. Our projected CapEx for 2013 is $700 million.","Our January inventory balance was $3.7 billion, a 16% increase over January 2011. On a per-store basis, inventory dollars are up 12%, consistent with our previous guidance. And compared to February week 1, which is a more apples-to-apples comparison, inventory is up 6% per store. Kevin will talk more about inventory management in a few minutes. AP as a percent of inventory was 330 basis points lower than last year at 35.2%, primarily due to slower inventory turnover.","Weighted average diluted shares were 228 million for the quarter and 237 million year-to-date. On February 27, 2013, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share, a 9% increase over our previous dividend of $0.28 per share. The dividend is -- or $0.32 per share, excuse me. The dividend is payable March 27, 2013, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 13, 2013.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide additional insights on our results.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks, Wes. Let me start by adding some color first to our sales results. From a line of business perspective, children's reported the strongest comp for the quarter, primarily on strength in toys. Women's and men's apparel were both above the company average per quarter. In women's, active apparel was the strongest category, with an increase in the high teens. Updated and contemporary sportswear and classic sportswear also outperformed the company. As we expected, the junior business continued to be challenging. Notable performance in men's included both basics and active. Footwear was slightly below the company average. Athletic shoes were by far the strongest category. Home was also below the company average. Notable strong categories included housewares, bedding and small electrics. And finally, accessories was the only line of business that did not report a positive comp for the quarter. Sterling silver jewelry, watches and bath and beauty were the strongest performers in the accessories category.","From a regional perspective, the West was the strongest region for the quarter.  All other regions were slightly negative.","E-commerce sales increased 43% for the quarter. For the year, e-commerce sales were $1.4 billion, 42% higher than the prior year. E-commerce contributed 320 basis points to our quarterly comp and 230 basis points to the annual comp.","From a brand perspective, 48% of our fourth quarter sales were private and exclusive Only-at-Kohl's Brands, an increase of approximately 30 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase was a result of our newer exclusive brands, Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Rock and Republic, DesigNation and Vera Wang, as well as strong sales in more mature brands such as Chaps, Lauren Conrad, Vera Wang and FILA SPORT.","On the gross margin side, as Wes mentioned, our gross margin rate for the quarter was approximately 290 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2011. While this was lower than planned, we were able to clear much of our seasonal merchandise in order to make way for our spring assortment. We believe that our value equation is now right, and we expect gradual improvement in our gross margin throughout 2013 as a result of lower costs.","Moving on to expense management. On the SG&A line, we performed slightly better than we expected. Our store organization continues to drive payroll efficiency. Our fixed costs generally were flat as a percent of sales, and we also reported significant leverage in our corporate operations, primarily due to lower incentive costs.","Marketing costs as a percentage of sales were flat for the year. Our credit operation is leveraged again this year. Our future performance will be driven by our ability to grow the portfolio and to manage the customer service and marketing functions more efficiently. We would expect more modest contributions from credit in 2013.","Finally, distribution centers did not leverage as we continue to develop the infrastructure for our growing e-commerce business. However, we were very pleased with our improvement in shipping costs and e-commerce fulfillment expenses as a percentage of e-commerce sales versus the prior year.","Moving on to the store experience. We ended the year with 1,146 stores, 19 more than the year-end 2011. During 2012, we opened stores in 20 new locations. We relocated 1 store in Michigan and closed 1 store in Ohio. Our current plans are to open 12 stores in 2013, 9 in the spring and 3 in the fall. Consistent with 2012 new stores, we expect all but 1 of the 2013 stores to be small stores, with less than 64,000 square feet. We remodeled 50 stores in 2012, and we expect to remodel 30 stores in 2013. Most of these remodels are expected to occur in the fall season. As of year-end, approximately 1\/3 of our stores now have customer service in the front of the store. This change has been received extremely well by our customers, who appreciate the convenience of having the service at the front rather at the back of the store. Additionally, all stores now have electronic signs. Relocating customer service and installing electronic signs are key contributors to the payroll savings, which allow our store organization to consistently deliver store payroll leverage.","Last year, we tested several sales floor productivity ideas in selected markets across the country to drive sales. In general, the sales lift in those departments that were expanded, primarily home, did not exceed this loss of sales in the departments reduced. As a result, the test will not be rolled out. However, several ideas developed from the test around more emphasis on certain categories, again, particularly in home, that will be pursued company-wide. We believe strongly in the importance of testing new ideas and concept, and we'll continue to do so this year as well. Those tests, whether product, display ideas, technology or marketing all help us to ensure our ROI goals are met and reduce the probability of mistakes with the customer experience.","Moving on to our investments in e-commerce and in IT. Since its inception in 2001, our e-commerce business has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of more than 50%. In 2011, we reached $1 billion in revenues, and this past year, revenues exceeded $1.4 billion.","Growing sales and improving profitability of this channel has required investments, but we are going to continue to make those investments. On the human side, we're investing in e-commerce merchants, planners and technology positions. We're also improving the foundation of the website and expect to be in a new, more versatile platform this summer, partnering with Oracle. We continue to stress the value of the Kohl's credit card to our online shoppers. Kohl's charge penetration is higher online than in our store, which has improved profitability. We've also made significant progress in reducing shipping costs and continue to identify ways to improve EFC processing costs. We're also making the necessary investments to ensure our customer has the omni-channel shopping experience that she desires. All of our stores are now equipped with WiFi, so she can share her shopping experience real time with her friends. We replaced our gift registries with more modern kiosks and have plans to further improve the kiosk and the gift registry experience on it later this year. We will pilot mobile POS in the third quarter.","Through our global inventory visibility project, we'll be able to better track our in-store inventory, the first of many steps necessary for us to offer in-store pickup for online orders. During holiday 2012, we tested fulfilling online orders from stores and expect to expand this test to 100 stores by holiday of this coming year. We've also expanded our RFID pilot to additional stores as well.","Finally, we're making investments in the infrastructure which supports our operations. We'll be implementing a new after [ph] data management system, which facilitates seamless inventory across all channels and stage deliveries within the period. We're investing in price management, the second generation of markdown optimization, which focuses on promotional and permanent markdown. And additionally, we're investing in new purchase order and new data warehouse system.","Moving on to marketing, on the marketing front, our objective is to reenergize the Kohl's brand to drive more engagement, and ultimately, traffic. In 2013, our advertising will continue to emphasize our value proposition but will be especially targeted at moms, particularly in the 35- to 54-year-old age group. We'll also shift our marketing towards channels that we believe will maximize our marketing dollars. This includes significantly increased TV and digital exposure. In addition, we'll have a more balanced presentation between our private and exclusive national and our national brands in our both broadcast and circular efforts.","In fall of 2012, we piloted a loyalty program in 100 stores, which provided additional flexible value to shoppers who either don't qualify for a Kohl's credit card or simply prefer not to use credits in payment. As with our other pilots, this loyalty program pilot has provided us with significant insights into how our customer shops and how we're able better to influence their shopping behavior in the future. Though we still have more to learn, we are pleased with the initial results of this pilot, and we'll be expanding the pilot to more markets in the spring season.","Before Wes provides 2013 guidance, I'd like to make some overall comments regarding the year. From a strictly financial results perspective, 2012 was a disappointing year for our company. While sales grew for the year in total, there were a number of categories where our growth was not at the rate we had planned and some where we actually lost market share. Just as importantly, our growth came in at higher cost to profitability than is acceptable. We didn't serve our customer at the standard we have set for ourselves. It's also been a year of tremendous change and transition. From a business standpoint, we struggled to find the right delivery of value in our prices, the appropriate level of inventory in each of our key businesses and to evolve our marketing message to engage the customer more consistently. As a result of that, we had a mix of successes and failures and a series of fits and starts throughout the year. Some changes we tested took hold quickly with customer, and we implemented them. Some needed to be revised and continued to be adjusted throughout the year.","On the organizational side, we have gone through a significant amount of change as we put in place new structures and added new talent to leadership positions in many of our key areas. Frankly, there's probably as much changes we have ever had in my time at Kohl's.","We entered 2013 as a smarter and more focused organization. Our strategies are clear and are more precise, as is our plan to achieve them. We will own savings. We will focus on moms, our most important customer, and we'll increase her confidence in Kohl's from all aspects. On the savings strategy, we believe strongly that savings isn't just about the lowest price. It's about price, quality, style and the experience the customer gets at Kohl's. Owning savings includes focusing our marketing message to consistently position Kohl's as the savings leader. It includes ensuring that our prices are competitive first and then even better with our value-added offers. It includes building increased style and quality into the products that she buys. And finally, owning savings includes leveraging our interactions with our customer in our stores every day.","Our second strategy.  Increasing her confidence in Kohl's is about providing the assurance that Kohl's will always come through for her and that she knows we have the store for her, having what she wants to when she wants it, whether it's in our stores or online.","And the third key strategy is focusing on mom. Though moms are our most loyal and highest spending customers, we believe we have significant opportunity to capture a larger share of her wallet.  We know that the customer has a lot of choices. They'll only choose us if we provide the best value, the assurance we have that they need every time they shop and show we are their store through our message, our merchandise and the experience we provide. We're committed to doing that this year.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Wes to provide our first quarter and fiscal year guidance.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thanks, Kevin. Our 2013 earnings guidance is as follows. Total sales increase of flat to 2%. The reason -- comparable sales will also be flat to 2%. The reason is due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2012. Our gross margin rate increase will be 15 to 30 basis points. SG&A expenses are expected to increase 1.5% to 3%; depreciation expense of approximately $910 million; interest expense of $330 million; and a tax rate of 38%. Our guidance assumes 216 million diluted shares for the year. This assumes $1 billion in share repurchases in 2013 at an average price of $50 per share. And including these estimated share repurchases, we expect earnings per diluted share of $4.15 to $4.45 for the year.","For the first quarter, our guidance is as follows: total sales increase of 0.5% to 2.5%; comparable sales increase of flat to 2%; gross margin increase of flat to 20 basis points; SG&A expenses increasing 2.5% to 3.5%; depreciation expense of $221 million; interest expense of $84 million; and a tax rate of 38%. This should result in earnings per diluted share of $0.55 to $0.63 for the first quarter.","And we'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So as we progress through the year, what shall we be watching in stores from a merchandising standpoint? I thought the smaller Coach fragrances and Spanx were moved in the right direction on the national brand side. But can you talk about any initiatives or categories that we should be focusing on?","Kevin Mansell","I think -- this is Kevin, Matt. Generally, the focus is pretty broad. As we mentioned in the script itself, we have essentially a new merchandise team across the entire company. They've been charged with really kind of delivering on ensuring that we have in stock for the customer what she wants, so this is a high degree of focus around basics and in stock. So our service levels on those areas need to improve and remain consistent. I think that's one thing you should look for. I think the second thing, Wes sort of mentioned it, we've been focused on improving our performance with our key national brands. We made some progress on that, particularly in the first -- fourth quarter. I think the fourth quarter was the first quarter, to be honest, in several years where national brands actually grew on a comp store basis. I think that's another thing to look for, our key national brands improving in the presentation in the store and the breadth of assortment and in how much space and attention they get in our advertising as well. I'd say the last thing is about clarity in assortment. We're working hard to remove duplication. That's probably particularly so in our private and exclusive brands. As you know, we've expanded the number of private and exclusive brands a lot over the last 3 years. What's happened as a result of that, of course, is that there has been some redundancy, and things that are carried in one of our private exclusive brands sometimes show up as well in another. So we want to definitely eliminate that. That was part of our effort in our reorganization. Adding new talent and new leadership into private and exclusive brand product development; organization is going to help us do that. So I'd say those are probably the big 4 things. Generally, those things apply to the whole store. So it's less about one particular area.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then on the gross margin side, I mean, do you believe the pricing and the depths of promotion today is where you want it? And aside from easier comparisons, how shall we think about the primary drivers of expansion this year?","Kevin Mansell","Yes, I mean, I think we're -- as you know, we're very promotional store.  That's what drives our traffic and drives our business. I don't see us really changing that, certainly not in a downward way. But I also don't see us increasing either the level or depth of promotion. I think, again, much like our merchandise assortments, providing more clarity, paying more attention to the product and to the brands in our advertising and most importantly probably, as I mentioned in the call, putting more emphasis around media that will reach a broader audience for us. And of course, television is the key one, and with our growing online presence, our digital efforts is the secondary key one. Those areas are going to get significantly higher spend. That's going to come at the expense of areas that have traditionally gotten more of our weight, particularly newspaper advertising and direct mail outside of our credit card business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Kev, could you talk a little bit just on your confidence level around the fact that you have the pricing right in the stores now after a lot of changes last year, sort of coming out of the fourth quarter? What gives you that confidence right now?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I think there's -- I mean, the metrics that we watch on that are the underlying metrics to make up our comp sales. So obviously, average unit retail is a key one of those. We report to you average unit retail for the company. So that can sometimes be affected by mix as one business grows and another one shrinks. But generally, for the year, average unit retail was up. It was up quite a bit in the first half of the year. In the fourth quarter, average unit retail was down. And when we look at it on a trend basis, there was a real consistency to it. As we brought our prices down, we started to reach levels that were more similar to 2011 on an AUR basis. So I think our sense is that you're never going to be perfect on prices. We always have opportunities to improve, but the combination of the AUR metrics, looking this year versus last year and this year versus historical gives us a lot of confidence. And secondarily, of course, we're pretty aggressive in understanding how our prices look compared to competition, and we try to look at that on the basis of what our sale prices are compared to competitive sale prices, not including their value-added triggers. So we have, as you know, really big value-added triggers that we think put us in a premier price position. So that's probably a long-winded answer to say to you, yes, my confidence now is pretty high that our value equation is pretty well set. I mean...","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, I think in November, December, obviously, we had a lot of clearance in January. That drove the AUR down. But if you look at November and December combined, our AUR is down about 1%, and our units remained up 4%. So that means the customer, in my opinion, felt like they were getting  some value.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And on the sort of new 0 to 2% comp assumption for the current quarter and for the year, essentially, what do you expect the growth of credit card sales on a comp basis versus non-credit card? Like how does that sort of flow through as the year progresses, given the penetration level of your credit business right now?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I think from my perspective, I think the non-credit card business has to be sort of flattish, and the credit card business will kind of be up mid -- or low to mid-singles. 4% and flat would get you to 2%, roughly. And we've seen that in the fourth quarter. Our non-credit card business actually in the fall season was basically flat versus being down 6% in the spring. So that, in my opinion, gives you some additional ammunition to support Kevin's confidence and the fact that we're priced right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citigroup.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Kevin, you discussed some of the changes to your marketing plan, a move towards more digital and TV. Can you expand on that as well?","Kevin Mansell","I think we -- let me back up on it a little bit, Deb. We -- as we went through last year, I think one of the efforts that we did talk to you about is Wes' effort around improving SG&A efficiency and improving costs. As part of that, we partnered with outside help to really try to dive into a lot of our key expense areas. Naturally, one of the biggest experience areas we have is marketing. We spend almost $1 billion a year in marketing. And as we did that and really more finely looked at efficiency, one of the things that became very clear is that our share of voice and our impact with the broader swath of customers, reaching a larger audience, was not where it needed to be. And when we dove further into that, it became really apparent that broadcast was an area that we needed to really make a more significant investment into to carry more weight with the customer and make us more appealing to a wider audience. Mainly, that is going to be event broadcast, and it's going to be more timed around our big events. So it's trying to support other efforts that we have in media as well. But I would say that's the biggest single learning was we needed to raise our share of voice in broadcast because we need to reach more customers outside of our core customer, particularly our credit card customer. And that's the way in which we're going to be able to compete more effectively. Obviously, this is a 0 sum game, so there were other areas that provided lower productivity. And we're also sort of overreaching the same customer over and over and over again. And those areas have been scaled back as a result of that. Hopefully, that gives you the answer you're looking for.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. And then as we think about the 0 to 2% comp for the quarter and also for 2013, I mean, there's a lot of it sounds like very positive changes taking place. Are those more back-end loaded? Or how should we just think about all of the different initiatives in place and the comps that you're guiding to?","Kevin Mansell","I mean, we're -- we haven't given any specific quarter comp on the first one. The first quarter, I think Wes just said, he's forecasting 0 to 2% as well. I don't know -- unlike last year, I would say last year, at the beginning of the year, we really kind of felt that the year was more back-end loaded because we were just recognizing that there were just so many changes that needed to be made, that we weren't going to get traction until late in the year. And that turned out to be true. I mean, our best comp, it wasn't what we'd like to be, but our best comp was in fact the fourth quarter for the year. I think this is more even. We do have, Deb, as you know, essentially an entirely new merchandising team. And Dave joined our organization in various times during the course of the year. So I recognize, in some cases, it takes time to get traction there. But I don't know that I see that particularly affecting the individual quarter comps.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Maschmeyer with Robert W. Baird.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Could you talk a bit into your gross margin plans for Q1? What proportion of the hit from clearance inventory did you take in Q4? And what do you think is remaining in the Q1 and how does that play into your gross margin guidance?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, we obviously took what we thought was appropriate. And in Q4, we didn't need to raise our markdown reserve at the end of the quarter. We'd continue to sell outerwear in the first quarter. That will have additional markdowns. All the markdowns, we need to clear the remaining. Fall inventory are in the flat to 20% gross margin. A lot of them, the fact that our inventories are up or because we have more transition merchandise in there than we did last year, I think I spoke to some of you guys about that when we did our January comp call. So we feel much better about where we are positioned for spring selling.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And actually, just a follow-up on that point. Could you talk a little bit more about the areas where you've got -- where you have increases in inventory for the first half of this year and how that really is different from your merchandising strategy in Q4?","Kevin Mansell","With the areas that have come into this year, and I think Wes described our inventory position in 2 different ways: one was just the absolute number that we reported fiscally; and the other was to try to provide a more apples-to-apples consideration. So that number, I think, was more in the mid-single digits up to last year. So using that as a context, if the company was running mid-single-digit inventories higher than last year, it was pretty broad across the store. I mean, there were a couple of exceptions on the high side due to business trends and a couple of exceptions on the low side due to business trends. So an example I would give you is juniors. I think actually on that apples-to-apples comparison, it had less inventories than last year. And that was a result of the fact that we've had very difficult business in juniors, so they need to run with less inventory. An area like athletic footwear, our athletic apparel across the whole store, which has been very, very strong, has been running with much higher-than-average inventories than last year. So I think we actually feel pretty good that the balance of our inventory is sort of directed to the places that are either driving our business, or if they're not driving our business, they're not being funded with inventory.","Wesley S. McDonald","I mean, I think, in comparing that to fourth quarter, I think that was another part of your question.  We obviously went very deep in gift strategy. As Kevin mentioned in his comments, we had some successes and some failures. Big successes were toys. We were up 25% comp in toys for the quarter. Small electrics was another big success, up mid-teens. Some things that didn't work out as well were our investments in seasonal apparel and some of our jewelry and accessories categories. Those obviously, being fourth quarter and very seasonal-related, have very short shelf life. Our inventory in the spring has a very long shelf life. It's obviously not very warm out here in Milwaukee, so we just had 7 inches of snow yesterday. So we're not selling a heck of a lot of shorts right now. But we have a long time to get through all the short inventory, and it will get -- eventually get warm in the Midwest. And the stuff we are carrying now doesn't have a lot of markdown risk in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Jaffe with Stifel.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And I guess a question about marketing and the mix in the margins. Wes, you've touched on some of the successes, such as toys and small electrics, but in more modest margin business. And I'm trying to understand how that -- some of the marketing initiatives for fall or for 2013 become clearer and more compelling to the consumer and also perhaps more focused on higher-margin categories? And could you also talk about mix through the online channel and opportunity to shift that to higher-margin product?","Kevin Mansell","We'll try to take that one piece at a time. I think a part of your question had to do with how marketing will target the categories of businesses that we think are opportunities and might even be higher margin. The way we're thinking about our marketing efforts this year is that we're really adjusting the balance of our investments by media type pretty significantly. And that adjustment on, obviously, spending a lot more dollars on broadcast and digital, there are 2 elements to that effort.  One is just our media weight more, a lot more to increase share voice and presence; and second is message, and the message is going to be broader, so not so targeted to individual items or categories but broader -- a broader message of savings and value across the store. And it's targeted to brands because we think our key national brands should be part of that. And our very key, most important exclusive national brands should also be part of that. So the message is definitely very different than it was last year. When it comes to the category investment, that gives sense to a lot of details. It's probably not good for the call. But I think just stepping back, you'd say, okay, they definitely are spending -- are going to spend a lot more in television and a lot more in the digital platform, and that that investment is going to be a broad message across the whole store about savings for mom and getting her confident again that we have great prices that she can actually believe in and that we give them to her all the time.","Wesley S. McDonald","And from an e-com perspective, I think you're -- and against the headwind there because home is a very highly penetrated area there for us for a couple reasons. One, it's really where we started. The website was a majority home for a number of years. And two, just the giftable nature, a lot of things for weddings and things like that makes it easy to ship it online. Having said that, one of the things our e-com folks are focusing on is more direct shift categories and to broaden the assortment, which is going to be in higher-margin carry -- categories, and also carry much higher AURs. One of the issues with our e-com profitability is our AUR is a lot lower than our competition. And to ship a t-shirt for $10 is the same cost as to ship a t-shirt for $30. So from that perspective, we need to raise the average ticket to reduce the drag on our margins from shipping costs.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Will that initiative be reflected on the e-commerce advertising? Would that be integrated into that?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I mean, it's going to be on the website, obviously, with the broader assortment, and we'll be able to offer more categories. I mean, we're going to try to sell what sells. We're not going to just hang the high-AUR things. We have to have a good mix, just like we do in the tab.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Liz Dunn with Macquarie Capital.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I guess as a follow-up to the last question, do some of these efforts around shipping costs change your viewpoint on e-commerce profitability over the long term? Because I think in the past, we've talked about it being sort of at a mid-single-digit operating margin in that business. Do you think you can get it higher?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, we've made about 100 basis points improvement this year, and we're not fully automated in the 4 EFCs that we have. The key is you have to look at operating margin and return on investment. I think those guys out in Washington don't have a real high operating margin, but they have a really good ROI. It's from -- I mean, talking about Amazon. So one of the things we got to do in continuing to grow, and we tested it last year, was the ship-from-store initiative. That allows us to service the customer during the 4- to 6-week peak, which is where -- really where you need it. The rest of the year, we can comfortably accommodate growth for a number of years in our 4 existing EFCs to crack the code. And raising it from mid-single-digit profitability to high single-digit profitability is really going to be able -- come down to how do we service that customer in that peak period without a lot of capital investment. And that's what we're going to try to do with the ship-from-store initiative.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Do you currently have a position on price matching, like if somebody shows you lower price online?","Kevin Mansell","Sure. Not a specific position on price matching online. That's different than our stores. We have a service promise, which we're very good at, I think, in our stores and online, which is yes, we can. And we're going to take care of the customers. So not to the extent you're talking about. Obviously, a very large percentage of our businesses comes from our own private and exclusive brands. I mean, it is definitely one of the strategies that we thought that was really important for us to drive over the last 5 years because we just anticipated that transparency in pricing was just going to grow. And more and more, we need to be unique in our offerings. So I think to some extent, this is a smaller issue for us and secondarily, I think a smaller issue for us because, as you know, over 80% of our business is apparel and accessories.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just finally, I'm sorry if I missed it, but what's the reason that the SG&A growth rate is higher in the first quarter versus the full year?","Wesley S. McDonald","A lot of it is in terms of shift of remodel expense. So we have more remodel expense in terms of writing off things and preparing for the remodels in first quarter, where last year, we would've done more remodels in spring and taken the SG&A hit in the fall.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Fuhrman with Piper Jaffray.","Alex J. Fuhrman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just want to talk a little bit about shipping and handling revenues and costs as that becomes a bigger part of the business. If I'm interpreting your prepared remarks correctly, it sounds like shipping and handling costs as a percentage of sales or at least e-commerce sales was down year-over-year. Will be curious to know kind of how the net shipping margin, if that has also improved year-over-year or if that might have been offset by lower shipping and handling revenues collected from customers as a percentage of sales? And then if you can just talk about kind of what are the longer term -- as this channel grows to a double-digit penetration, what are the opportunities to contain that net shipping margin over the next couple of years? And clearly, with the growth -- I mean, are there other certain scale levers that you'll hit over the next few years that will enable you to bring shipping costs down or perhaps be a little bit more dynamic in how you fulfill those orders? Or is there anything we should be thinking about, as the e-commerce business scale, that might mitigate the gross margin impact?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I think I partially answered that question with my remarks to Liz. But I mean, our shipping costs in the fourth quarter improved about 270 basis points, that's on a net basis, and for the year, improved about 100 basis points. So we're definitely making progress. It's on the cost side. It's not really on the revenue side. We don't make a whole lot of money from a shipping revenue perspective. We have free shipping pretty much at $75 most days. Sometimes we do $0.99 an item, but primarily it's $75. And then in the fourth quarter, we take it down to $50 to be competitive with the rest of the folks. So our focus on net shipping is going to be really on the cost side, and it's going to be augmented and helped improve when we automate the fourth EFC, balance the inventories a little bit better. And then obviously, in the fourth quarter, it's going to be real important to be able to ship from store to help offset the peak.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So last night, we heard J.C. Penney talk about switching back, becoming more promotional. I'm wondering how you think about that as you think about the guidance for the year. Anything that you got -- you've kind of withheld in the guidance to say, \"We need to switch back to be more promotional to defend share,\" anything like that that you can talk about with it, maybe some changes ahead on the competitive landscape?","Kevin Mansell","No, I mean, I think as we sort of covered in the call, last year was not the kind of year we would like to see. We didn't -- while we grew, we didn't get the growth rate that we were looking for. But more importantly, profitability really suffered as a result. In some cases, I think a poor execution on our part and then some cases of us being very aggressive in going after share. That eventually didn't come. Our promotional positioning is plenty aggressive. We have great voice with the customers, and we kind of touched on the fact that we're reallocating that voice to areas that we don't feel as strong in. But overall, we have very aggressive marketing, so we definitely drive traffic to our stores. People know what Kohl's stands for. We know from our own research, from independent survey price data, that our prices are more than competitive, that Kohl's stands for savings, but also stands for great value. So I don't think there really need to be any tweaks on that. That's really not where our focus is. We need to hone our position more effectively by improving all these other things, which to a great degree is about presenting better products and better ways to the customer, in reaching more customers. So what's happening in other competitors, first of all, it's obviously outside of our control, but it's not really what our focus is. Our focus is internal.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you just help us think about the composition of how you're thinking about the same-store sales guidance for the year between transactions and AUR? I think, historically, you've done better in an environment where you've been able to drive sales through transactions. I only see one year, looking back, when your total comps went the opposite direction of transactions. So is this a positive trend?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, I think every year for us is set out to be a transaction year. We're not usually baking a comp assumption based upon the increase in ticket. So a lot of what we talked about today is to driving the customer into the stores and broadening our media mix to reach more non-credit card customers. That's going to be the key. So I think if we have a good comp this year, it's going to be mostly driven by transaction.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just for the models, is there any reason why there's such a big jump in D&A? This year, it looks like it's up 9%. Is there anything in there, Wes?","Wesley S. McDonald","We're spending a lot -- hell lot of money on IT, which has a life of 3 to 5 years, and also more money on remodels. And new stores are coming down. Remodels are depreciated over about a 8-year period, and obviously, new stores, much longer than that. So as that becomes a smaller part of our mix, new stores, you're going to see D&A is going to grow faster than sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The e-commerce business drove the entirety of the comp growth last year, with in-store sales down. With the kind of a modest remodel program, can you provide a little bit more detail on how you expect to actually drive traffic in the doors? I mean, you mentioned a different advertising strategy. Maybe you could elaborate a little bit more on that? And also, while I noticed you're opening fewer stores this year, have we kind of potentially reached the point of kind of where you think your store count will be kind of in the future?","Wesley S. McDonald","I mean, from a marketing perspective, I think we spent a big part of the call talking about it, and we're not really willing to get into any more detail than we already have. Our new store slowdown is really a function of our performance of our new stores over the last few years. As we've grown our e-commerce business, that's come out -- some of it come out of the stores. By our best estimates, about 1\/3 of the e-commerce growth has come out of the stores, and we're not getting the same kind of returns on our new stores like we used to. That's why we're bring it down, and we're focusing more on IT investments to help make the existing stores more productive and focusing more on remodels to try to add some different things to them from a category perspective to make those more profitable. We talked about the sales productivity test. We learned a lot there. Some of the stuff we'll roll out to all the stores going forward. There's some different nuances in the remodels that we're doing this year, which should help us grow sales per square foot. But again, they're just testing, so that's what we have to do.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then -- maybe I missed this, but does your buyback plans for $1 billion this year, does that include adding debt, similar to what we saw this past third quarter?","Wesley S. McDonald","No, our target is a BBB+ rating. We've communicated to the rating agencies that we will manage a range of 2 to 2.25. If you do the math on this year's results, it gets pretty close to that 2.25. If our results are better than what we said, it's possible we'd add a little debt. But at this point, if we're within the 0 to 2% range, we will not be adding any debt this year.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just last, you spoke, Wes, earlier about the snow, and certainly, weather has been unfavorable this month. Could you just speak to where trends are quarter-to-date, and are they at the low end of the range or a little bit below with the expectation of just seeing some improvement as the quarter progresses?","Kevin Mansell","This is Kevin. I mean, obviously, we can't talk in any detail about what the performance is for the month of February specifically. The trend of our business is incorporated in the guidance that we give you. I will say that I think, like many other retailers that I have listened to, trends of business late in January continued to be weak into February. So I think that's definitely accurate in our case as well. I'm sure that that -- it looks to be a combination of factors, from economic factors like the payroll tax change, to probably gas prices.","Wesley S. McDonald","Late tax refunds.","Kevin Mansell","Late tax refunds to, unfortunately, weather not favorable for selling forward merchandise. So it's probably a combination of things. But I think our experience late in the month of January and continuing into this month in February has probably been like many other retailers, which is the business has gotten a lot weaker.","Wesley S. McDonald","But the beautiful thing about moving to quarterly comp is we can actually look more than 30 days ahead of time.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Heather N. Balsky - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Heather Balsky filling in for Kimberly. Just returning to merchandising strategy, I was wondering if you could talk about some of the progress you've made in the juniors in terms of improving merchandising? And then any learning you may have had from the Narciso Rodriguez launch in November?","Kevin Mansell","Sure. I mean, I think generally, as you know, juniors trailed the store by a lot last year. It's part of our women's overall line of business, so we don't break down junior specifically, but it trailed the rest of women's apparel significantly. I think we're starting to feel a lot better about it as we look at the trend of business in the last 4 to 6 weeks in juniors. It's changed pretty dramatically. It looks a lot I think, Wes, more like the store right now.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes.","Kevin Mansell","Which would be a huge change in trend from what it was in 2012. I think that impact is being driven by better merchandising decisions, new merchandising team, new leadership team in place and a real focus on more clarity in our assortments, being faster but more edited and deeper around the things we believe in. So we're not -- we don't want to get ahead of ourselves at all, but it certainly feels better. So I think some of the things that we talked about in the call that apply to the whole store, eliminating duplications, eliminating redundancies, getting more focus around brands that matter, are working in juniors, I would say. And we're starting to feel better about the results.","Wesley S. McDonald","No, I think in January, the regular-priced business in January, I believe, was flat, which is a big improvement of trend for last year. So we're looking forward to better things out of those guys this year.","Heather N. Balsky - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And the Narciso Rodriguez, was there any learnings from there, the last?","Kevin Mansell","Yes, I'm sorry. The Narciso Rodriguez launch was our first launch in our DesigNation effort, which continues this year. I think there were some significant learnings, not surprisingly probably are the impact of that business online was out of proportion to our typical apparel penetrations, I think by multiple times, if I remember right, Wes? So the amount of goods we sold online as a percentage of a brick-and-mortar business was way more than we would typically have in the overall brick-and-mortar business. I think we learned a lot about breadth of what we offer and depth of what we offer. And we learned a lot about making sure we have clarity in that, in our store, from a presentation perspective. I think generally, our in-store experience on the brand was pretty good right at the launch. And we need to do a better job of maintaining that, then, through the period as well. I think those were probably the 2 big learnings, I would say.","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"13502":["Kohl's Corp.

I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results. Kevin will then provide more details on our Greatness Agenda initiatives and then we'll take some of your questions.","Comp sales decreased 3.9% for the quarter. Transactions per store were down 4.8% for the quarter. Average transaction value increased 90 basis points comprised of 190 basis point increase in units per transaction and 100 basis points decrease in average unit retail. From a line-of-business perspective, Men's and Women's were the strongest categories and home was the weakest. On a regional basis the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Midwest were the strongest.","The West and South Central were the most difficult regions. Gross margin decreased approximately 140 basis points for the quarter about 10 basis points better than we guided to last quarter. Most of the margin decrease was due to clearance markdowns taken to clear excess merchandise. Our SG&A expenses decreased $8 million to $1 billion for the quarter. We effectively managed discretionary spending but were not able to leverage expenses on a sales decrease, as a percentage of sales SG&A deleveraged 75 basis points.","Store payroll dollars were slightly higher than last year as we pulled back on staffing to align with sales but did not leverage. Marketing deleveraged on higher spending associated with our Academy Awards sponsorship and higher digital spending. IT expenses also deleveraged. Partially offsetting these increases were higher credit income, and lower corporate expenses. Our credit share of sales was 58.8%, up 81 basis points from last year. Logistics expenses were also less than last year. Depreciation expense was $234 million. The $7 million increase over last year is primarily due to higher IT amortization. Interest expense decreased $5 million to $79 million for the quarter; the decrease is due to favorable interest rates achieved during our $1.1 billion debt refinancing last summer.","Our income tax rate was 37.6%. The tax rate increased approximately 230 basis points as last year's first quarter included some favorable state tax audit settlements that we didn't have this year.","Net income on a reported GAAP basis for the quarter was $17 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.09. For the quarter, we reported $64 million of expenses related to the store closures and corporate restructuring that we announced earlier this year. The charge includes $53 million of impairment charges on the 18 stores which we close later this year. The remaining $11 million is primarily termination benefits for employees impacted by the closures and restructuring.","We expect to incur an additional $105 million to $110 million next quarter which is slightly higher than our original estimates as we had more store associates than expected choose termination packages over relocation to another stores. Substantially all of next quarter's charge will be to record lease-related liabilities for stores we are closing prior to lease termination. Excluding the store closures and restructure charges, net income was $58 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.31 per share.","We opened three new stores during the quarter, including our first two smaller 35,000 square foot format pilot stores. We currently operate 1,167 stores. Gross square footage is 100.6 million square feet, and selling square footage is 83.9 million square feet. We also opened two Off\/Aisle stores in the Milwaukee market.","We ended the quarter with $423 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $772 million from last year. Inventory dollars per store were 2% lower than the first quarter of 2015, consistent with our guidance of down low-single digits despite the challenging sales environment. Units per store were essentially flat as increases in national brand were more than offset by decreases in private and exclusive brands.","AP as a percent of inventory decreased 650 basis points to 32.9%. All of the decrease is due to lower receipts. We also received some benefit in Q1 and Q2 of last year due to early arriving receipts related to conservative planning after the port disruption in fall of 2014 and spring 2015. Receipt flow year-over-year should be normalized by the third quarter of 2016.","Capital expenditures were $177 million for the quarter, consistent with the first quarter of last year. Weighted average diluted shares were 184 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 185 million shares of stock outstanding.","On Wednesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable on June 22 to shareholders of record on June 8.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin who will provide additional insights on our results.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Wes. The first quarter was well below our expectations in the sales line as a very strong start to the quarter in February was overcome by softer-than-expected pre-Easter business and then a further deterioration in April versus our plans. Our seasonal businesses followed a similar trajectory as the total company sales trend.","A little more color on our sales, Men's and Women's were better than the company with strength in active across both of those categories. Basic and dress clothing were relatively strong in Men's, but Junior's and intimate were better in Women's.","Kids, accessories and shoes were similar to the company with relative strength in Boys and Girls, beauty and fine jewelry as well as Kids' shoes. Home was below the company with bedding, luggage and seasonal being outperformers, with the balance being more difficult.","We did do a good job of managing our inventory, gross margin and expenses during the quarter. Our gross margin rate dropped 140 basis points versus our projection of 150 basis points of a drop due to better-than-planned promotional markdowns. Our inventory per store is now down 2%, in line with our expectations at the beginning of the year. We continue to expect to make progress on inventory throughout this year and we're targeting end of second quarter levels of down mid-single digits on a per store basis.","On the SG&A line, every area of the company was able to pull back on their planned expenses to allow us to spend slightly less than last year in dollars versus our expectations originally of a 3% to 4% planned increase. The team has shown agility to be able to pull back on expenses in a difficult sales environment.","Now like to take a few minutes to update you on some of the initiatives within the Greatness Agenda. In our focus on product initiatives, on national brands in the first quarter we launched Stride Rite in kids shoes and relaunched New Balance in the active area. The launch of Stride Rite helped kids shoes to outperform, and New Balance achieved a 19% comp in the quarter.","Our national brands in total were slightly positive on a comp basis with active and wellness leading the way to the mid-single digit comp. Nike continues to be very strong achieving a mid-teens comp in the quarter. National brand penetration increased approximately 200 basis points in the quarter.","We relaunched Sonoma in the first quarter and have been happy with the results in both Men's and Women's as they've seen improvements versus their prior trend. During the quarter, we also launched REED from Reed Krakoff in the handbags as improving our accessories assortment has been a goal for us, and it's off to a very good start.","Our localization efforts are proving out, and 2016 will be the year that all of our planning efforts for unique assortments by store will come to life in 90% of our store fleet.","As we enter the second quarter, approximately 70% of the assortment is now localized. We saw a modest lift in quarter one but would expect the effect of this to improve as we gain more experience and enter key transitional periods like second and the third quarter where localized assortments should make a bigger impact.","In our focus around omni-channel initiatives we continued to see strong results in digital demand with online generated demand achieving a mid-teens increase as expected. We continue to invest in technology and training in our stores to allow us to ship from store and provide buy online, pickup in store capabilities, providing faster shipping times and more convenience for our customer.","In the first quarter, ship from store was 15% of our online demand, and buy online, pickup in store was 3%. We believe we have a big opportunity there and we'll continue to test marketing that option throughout the year to make it top of mind in our customers for holiday.","Our Kohl's app was used by more than 12 million customers and growing. In the quarter, we added the capability to use Apple Pay with our Kohl's Charge Card and our Yes2You Rewards loyalty program becoming the first retailer to integrate its private label Charge Card and loyalty program within Apple Pay.","On the store update front, we opened two small format stores during the quarter and we have a lot of learnings already that we will incorporate into our fall planned openings. Big learning was the need to be flexible in our offering as each trade area is unique due to the relatively small size of the trade areas and our smaller store size as well. Localization we believe will be critical for our success in this initiative.","We also opened two Off\/Aisle stores in the Milwaukee area, one in an off-price center and one in a strip center. We're pleased with the initial results and we'll monitor any effects on cannibalization which we would expect to be very small. And in late May, we'll open 12 FILA stores to gauge the possibilities in the outlet space.","Moving on to expenses, I mentioned in the year end call that we were beginning an effort to reduce our leverage point on expenses from a 2% comparable sales increase to a 1.5% comparable sales increase.","Despite the fact we're experiencing significant wage pressure in our stores, and intend to continue to invest in our omni-channel initiatives, we feel more confident, that we'll be able to achieve that goal. I think you can see that, given our ability to manage expenses in the first quarter. We expect to find additional savings throughout the year that will allow us to achieve our expense goals.","In conclusion it was definitely a difficult start to 2016. It's hard to gauge how much of the sales shortfall is related to macroeconomic factors and how much is related to company specific factors.","We definitely focused on improving our sales, but especially our traffic to brick-and-mortar stores. We are relooking at all of our marketing vehicles to see where we can drive more business to the stores as well as ensuring our value message is particularly strong. Definitely not satisfied with the results so far and we'll take action to remain top of mind with the families that we serve.","And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And one moment please for our first question. And first we have the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. So what are you guys seeing from a promotional standpoint at the mid-tier out there? Particularly how did your private label perform and while your inventories are in line, do you see any need to be more aggressive with price to drive traffic?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, pricing I mean, is definitely an element of our review in the comment that I made around marketing, Matt. Our private brands underperformed our national brands. National brand penetration went up almost 200 basis points again. The trend line on some of the private brands, particularly Sonoma, definitely improved when we relaunched it.","Pricing is always a big factor. I don't know that we would call out any particularly noticeable promotional effort by other retailers that I see having a major effect on how we are going to go to market. But, when we think about improving the trend line from the disappointment in the first quarter to an improved number in the second quarter, we're definitely looking at pricing, we're definitely looking at marketing vehicles and the level of marketing we need to spend to get traction, particularly in our traffic in brick-and-mortar stores.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, I mean I think it's less about price in the private brands and more about product. We have some private brands that are doing very well like SO in our Junior's area. Junior's continued its strength carried over from last fall, where others private brands are a little tougher. So, I think it's just a combination of both.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then on a follow-up on capital allocation, Wes, what's the minimum cash balance you're comfortable with on the balance sheet and then just the best way to evaluate share repurchase versus almost a 5% dividend yield going forward?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Well, I think the number one priority for cash is to fund our growth so we'll continue to invest in digital technologies to drive that business. So our CapEx for this year is $825 million. That remains the case. We're committed to growing the dividend about 10% and the remainder of that would be left over for share repurchase. So we're still targeting $600 million for the year. We were a little light of that this quarter. We'll take a look at our grid and put in a new grid and target the same $150 million for this quarter. But at the end of the year, where we ended last year I think was around $700 million. That's about where we want to be. So I don't see any particular reason to go lower or higher than that. So given our projections, we would still be able to buy back $600 million this year.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just on inventory, you did a nice job hitting your plans. However, given the much weaker than expected sales environment it is still running a bit ahead of comps. So I guess how much flexibility do you have just to take a further step down in those receipts for the back half of the year and then how should we think about that inventory progression?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","I think the back half of the year is consistent with the second quarter. We would expect our inventories to be down mid-single-digits on a per-store basis, so further reduction from where we are today. And that's really going to be a function of buying less receipts, which we've already planned and worked with our vendors on. So I suspect absent any kind of change further downward, we should be able to hit those end of quarter goals.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean the other thing I would add, Mark, is just there wasn't a lot to get very excited about in our first quarter performance, but one thing that I think the team did well and I think we're going to be well-positioned, regardless of where the business goes the remaining of the year is receipt flow and inventory. And we're down to last year. We're going to be down further than that as we go into the third quarter. And they've demonstrated I think an ability to be agile and bring on receipts as necessary, so that I think is a little bit of a bright spot.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. And then a quick follow-up on SG&A. You address the longer-term leverage point, but how sustainable is this down 1% run rate should the negative comp environment continue over the next couple of quarters? Just talk about the puts and takes there? Thank you.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Well, I think our SG&A guidance like you saw was to leverage at a 1.5 comp. I expect us \u2013 I think that translated into like 1% to 2% dollars for the year, if I recall correctly. We're going have to be lower than the 1%. I think we showed that we could do that this quarter. It wasn't all just related to any one thing, as Kevin mentioned. Every area of the company participated in bringing down their expenses. We have a lot of things underway to further reduce expenses that allowed us to get to that point, and that we'll continue to see that come to fruition throughout the year. But my expectations for SG&A for the year would be somewhere between flat to up 1. So I think we can take it down a level from where we are today.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","And next go to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Thanks, good morning. You had previously guided to a zero to 1% comp for the year. Is that still on the table and can you just discuss the biggest drivers to try to turn that trend around over the next few quarters?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I mean, I think our annual guidance, whether it was on the top line, which was...","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Plus or minus the 0.5%...","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Exactly.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","... (20:58) was flat to 1%.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Which as Wes said, was essentially flat total and a modest increase on a comp basis and also EPS. The first quarter as you know, Lorraine, is a really small percentage of the total year both on a sales basis but in particular on an EPS basis. I think for the first quarter, our expected earnings per share was probably around $0.40, which would be less than 10% of the annual expectation that we gave. So we're really just barely into the year. For us to look forward and make some forecast change based on a really sharp percentage of the year and a very small percentage of the total I think would just be wrong.","We're obviously making plans for being more defensive around things, as Wes said, like inventory or like expenses to be prepared to bring down. But we still feel good that the sales trend will improve in the second quarter. And we definitely feel like it'll improve further as we go into the back half.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","And what are the reasons behind the good feelings around comp improving?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think on a comp basis, we've kind of articulated them in the beginning of the year guidance. One of the big things that you know that hurt us in the third and fourth quarter last year was a build-up in inventory that really took away all of our flexibility to adjust receipts into categories that were outperforming other areas. And so one of the big things I think Wes and I both feel really good about is our inventory position puts us in a space where we can feed the businesses that are performing.","We do have some businesses that are outperforming other businesses. In spite of lower traffic levels, particularly lower traffic levels in March and April, we have categories that are actually doing well. We talked about some of those, and so we want to be in a role where we can feed those. I don't know if you want to add anything, Wes?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, I mean, I think our expectation for the rest of the year would be flat to 1% for the remaining quarter so that when you do the math \u2013 you guys are smart \u2013 that probably puts you towards the lower end of the comp range just maybe even a little bit below, which is why we think we need to take our expenses down to achieve the earnings guidance that we gave. As Kevin mentioned, it's less than 10% of our expectations for earnings for the year, so we feel like there's a lot of room in front of us that we can do different things to try to make that earnings.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Great. And then is there any wiggle room on the CapEx? Are there places that you could potentially cut to help improve cash flow that way?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","No. I think I'd be more likely to try to put the screws to the inventory a little bit more. We have to invest for the long term. Much like Macy's who reported yesterday, we had a very strong February. It was the first positive comp we've run since 2011, and we saw a pretty dramatic drop off the same timing they mentioned. So we'll have to see if that drop-off is a macro-induced thing or if it's company specific. We will know a lot more as more companies report later this week. But it will get warm. We have shorts to sell and we're in a good inventory position. So I think at some point, people will need those clothes and will come buy them","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, the area I think Wes and I both agree, the areas that are probably getting more scrutiny, I don't know that it necessarily impacts this years' actual capital expenditure, but looking out this year through year two and year three forward are probably CapEx around technology. Wes is definitely getting more scrutiny from us as we look at whether or not the investments we're making are giving us the return that we expected to get from them. And the second thing is definitely capital that's dedicated towards fulfillment of our online-generated demand, regardless of whether that capital is in our stores or that capital is in technology or that capital is in a fulfillment center, either existing or future to come. Those two have probably risen to the top in terms of areas we're looking at now.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to discuss a little bit further the composition and cadence of the comp. I believe in the fourth quarter and generally through 2015, transactions per store were roughly flattish. And so given the down 4.8% this quarter and the solid start in February, is it fair to assume that you were exiting the quarter those last four or five weeks kind of down 8%, 9%, 10%? And if so, maybe you can give a little bit more detail on the seasonal goods performance. Specifically, Wes I know you mentioned weather and that shorts weren't selling. So maybe you can give us a little bit more of a handle on what kind of bounce back you might expect if the weather does warm up.","And then lastly on the comp, AUR was down 100 basis points. Wes, do you expect that to be just unique to the first quarter given the aggressive promotions?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, those are a lot of questions for one, but I'll try to answer most of them. The AUR was down mostly because of clearance, so I would expect that to be a one-time phenomenon in the first quarter. Your math on the comp for the balance of the quarter wasn't correct, but you were directionally correct. If you're positive in the first month, you got to be negative in the last two.","From a seasonal perspective, our spring seasonal goods were good in February, poor in March and April, kind of consistent with the comps. They were worse than the company by a couple hundred basis points. It's a fairly significant part of the business, but as we mentioned, Home was the worst category which wouldn't have as much seasonality to it. We got to improve traffic. That's somewhat of a marketing issue that we've got to try to resolve. It also relates to product. Once we get them in the store, our conversion rates are actually improved. We just have to get them into the store.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Paul, just to be clear on one thing, as we look at drivers of comp, whether they're periods of positive comp we have or periods of negative comp like the first quarter, we try to prioritize in our minds what the drivers are so we can attack those. Things like seasonal category performance, which weather often drives that, we don't think is at the top of the priority list in terms of things that were a driver of negative comp in the first quarter. Our seasonal categories underperformed for sure, but they didn't significantly underperform. And so I don't think Wes does either, put them at the very top.","We put things at the top. I think we mentioned there seems to be some more macro issue given performances of both ourselves and competition. There seems to be some change in consumer behavior in terms of traffic coming into our stores maybe because of that. We definitely have opportunity in our marketing area to improve our effectiveness. As we've moved in our media mix from a more traditional whole media mix to a much more future state, we're finding things that haven't worked as well that are probably going to have to be course-corrected in the near-term to get a better result.","And then eventually, yeah, you get down to seasonal categories, and we look at it and say, yeah, you know, the seasonal categories which are a very significant percent of our total business underperformed, and if they performed as normal, we would've done a lot better. But I don't put it at the top.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's very helpful color. Lastly from me, you stated that the comp guidance remains flat to 1% for the balance of the year. You modestly adjusted SG&A dollar growth I think to now kind of more flat to up 1% for the balance of the year. Just on the gross margins, Wes, flat to up 20%, is that still attainable in your view? And if so, should we maybe push a little bit more towards the third and fourth quarter as opposed to 2Q just given the channel still seeing some traffic weakness? Or just help us out on the gross margins Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Before Wes mentions anything himself, I would just tell you, Paul, and just to be clear, we're not updating anything. We are not updating our sales, we're not updating our margin, we're not updating our SG&A, and we're definitely not updating net earnings. The first quarter is a small percentage of the year, and there's not enough information we see to put us in a position where we feel that we could knowledgeably tell you some type of update.","We are just sort of targeting you to areas in which we're going to put more effort, and naturally if you have a disappointment at the beginning of the year in sales, one area that's going to bubble up and we're going to put a lot more effort around, is expense control and bringing down our ability to bring down expenses.","Another area naturally is inventory and ensuring that we not only can meet the lower levels of inventory we had planned going into the second and third quarter, but actually give ourselves ability to even bring it down further. So I realize to some extent maybe it's nuanced, but I think it's an important distinction. So we're trying to be transparent, and these are the things we're doing in response to what we're seeing, but there is no update to anything.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","And in terms of the margin, I think we said at the beginning of the year we had more opportunity in the back half for gross margin improvement just given by our poor performance in the fourth quarter, that remains the same.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. Just as you do look back to this quarter, could you brief us on any of the things you might have done differently if that was possible? And then does this tweak in terms of how you think about the broader Greatness Agenda just as you think about your strategic plans?","Also, on the traffic situation and regarding the softer pre-Easter and then the April, did you have any sense of if it was a different \u2013 if it was a specific demographic? Was there something going on with the younger generation versus older in terms of thinking about where you were more sensitive and losing traffic? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I can probably try to take a whack, Oliver, at the first part, and Wes can talk to you about the traffic drivers. Essentially I think what you're asking is, are there different actions you would have made had you known what was coming in terms of traffic into your stores. And, I can view that in the short-term and the long-term. On the long-term right now, we actually feel pretty confident that the things we're working on are the right things, and they remain the right things. Clearly, speed to get to where we want to be in our plan on those actions needs to be accelerated. We've got to get there faster, there's no question about that.","Emphasis might change, so we typically mid-year kind of review our long-term plan and our moves underneath the Greatness Agenda, and we might emphasize more one move versus another based on what we are seeing. But I think fundamentally we still feel very confident about the plan, that the plan is the right plan and our actions are the right actions.","In the short term, I think Wes and I both say, hey, I think we wish that some of our event handles and effort were better. If we had known that there was going to be macro traffic issue, and in particular I would say in April, and had we known that some of the results of the change in our media mix was going to have the effect it did, in again, mostly I'd say April, we would've done things differently. And obviously informed by that, we're making changes to our June and July plans to accommodate.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, I mean, you've got four or five data points out there from people that have already reported. I be shocked if not everybody had some kind of a down-step change from fourth quarter to first quarter, the absolute value of which depends on the relative strength of the sector that they're in and from a retail perspective. But I think one of the things we are in the process of looking at is we have made a pretty dramatic shift from print and direct mail into digital. That's definitely helped drive the digital business very well. We may need to rethink that mix to reach some more of our traditional customers that get their information from print.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, and on the economic front you gave a lot of helpful details. But we're struggling a little bit because the middle class has rising minimum wages, lower gas and somewhat good on employment (35:01). So how do you help us reconcile or is just very puzzling in terms of those trends versus what we're seeing in retail at large?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","They're not buying apparel. I mean that's a simple answer. I think they're spending money on \u2013 I read some of your notes. I agree with them. They're spending money on restaurants and experiences. Until we get more excitement in apparel there \u2013 it's going to remain in my opinion a replenishment market.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for all the transparency. Best regards.","Operator","And next we'll go to Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great, good morning. I just wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the Home category. It seems like there were some things that are winning but some things that are not and they seem pretty dramatic that they are not working. Are they product cycle related? You've heard from like HSN who has called out Nutribullet and some other product cycles seem to be towards the end. So curious what's going on there for you guys.","And then Wes, on the assortment planning initiatives which we think are really good, the whole localization effort makes a lot of sense for you guys. Wondering if you could share any sort of wins around the metrics whether it be top end or kind of margin improvements that you're seeing from those efforts? Thank you.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Sure. I think from a localization perspective we've seen a slight sales lift. Certainly given our comps, not enough to drive the business. And I suspect at the end of the spring we'll see a much improved margin in those categories. I think we mentioned on the call we're up like 70% entering the quarter. The margin benefit since about 30% were just brought on board in the first quarter probably won't occur till the fall, so I think that will be back half-loaded. But hopefully we can get some sales benefits as we move throughout the year. The Home business was difficult in areas like kitchen electrics. I think was a...","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, what I'd say...","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","...category in electronics...","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Neely, what I'd say on the Home thing is the two things you always look at in Home are always, of course, you called the one out, which is product category performance. And typically in normal cases what we'll see is Home sort of moves together and hard Home or soft Home might be weaker or stronger but it sort of moves together. This quarter, there were definitely category outperformances, underperformances to a greater degree than normal. So we're still sort of going through all that and trying to understand better why that would be. I don't know that it's so much life cycle related. There's certainly cases of that. Perhaps you'd call them out. Maybe the juicer category might be one that that's true of. But I think product cycle, but more importantly category performance, we'll always take a really critical look at.","And then the second one is, Home is more impacted than any other category we sell by marketing. And so when our marketing is not as effective as it needs to be or our event strategy or our media mix strategy is not as effective as it needs to be, Home dramatically will distort that. And you'll see it in the performances of the businesses, which basically means we're not reaching the core customers in the way that we need to reach them. So I don't know that we've decided one is more critical in terms of our underperformance in the first quarter than the other, but I think that they both play a factor. But I think that frankly the event handles and pricing strategies probably played a bigger factor in the first quarter.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you. Best wishes.","Operator","Our next question's from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, thanks guys. It sounds like you guys are leaving the door open that there may be some sort of bigger picture macro issue going on. So just curious if that is the case, if that is a consideration why the assumption that comps improve from what you saw in the first quarter? And I guess additionally I'm just trying to tie that together still with as inventories come down, it seems like it will be a little bit more of a challenge to drive comps. So just trying to tie that together, I think you guys have had some examples where you've been able to turn faster, if you could maybe share those with us and help connect those dots. Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll let Wes talk about the last part.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","I think that's a good question. He just really wants the steak I bet him on the inventory.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So on the \u2013 one of the things we tried to make clear in the call, to be honest with you, Paul, is that right now I think we're having a hard time determining how much of our underperformance was more related to macro factors, which you're right, would have more implication on future performance and how much is related more to our company-specific factors which could have to do with inventory carryover, could have to do with marketing and effectiveness, particularly on events at critical times; could have to do with the transition because of weather, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest.","I think we're still grappling a little bit with that, so we're definitely not in a position that we're putting the stake in the ground and saying, hey, this one is the big driver and therefore, that means this for the rest of the year. I think we're just saying, hey, in total transparency, these are all the things we see.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, there are definitely some company-specific issues from a marketing perspective that we're working on rectifying. So we know that that affected our first quarter. But I mean I think as you see more people report, I'd be shocked if anybody said they had a great March, April. We'll see.","From an inventory perspective, I mean one of the things that Michelle and the merchant and product development teams have been working on very hard is increasing the percentage of our receipts that are sourced faster. So one of the success stories has been our SO brand where we've moved a lot more of the production to the 12 week to 14 week lead time from writing the order to getting it into the store. That's moved up, from a percentage basis, quite a bit. They comped mid-teens this quarter on an inventory reduction of a couple \u2013 of 2%, same as the company.","So, we're trying to move more of our private and exclusive brands to that. Over the next couple of years we want to move from 20% of that being sourced within that timeframe to about 50% of our product. Some of the things don't make much sense that are very cost sensitive and don't change a lot like men's cargo pants or a lot of the kids clothes, you're looking for the absolute lowest price because that customer is so price-sensitive.","But many of our Women's brand both in private and exclusive need to move more quickly to that fast fashion type of model. And Michelle and the PD guys are driving very hard and doing that. SO was really the first example of that. We'll do more of that as we move throughout the year with brands like Simply Vera Vera Wang and Apt. 9 and move into next year.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. And then just a follow-up, with the lower inventories coming, are we also to assume that tied to that would be a less promotional stance that you guys take as you manage inventory down mid single for the second half?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we need to be aggressive on marketing because if you think about the possibility of just generally slower traffic in the sector, then the important thing is to take share. And so part of taking share has to do with certainly, the amount of marketing you do and part of it has to do with selectively and thoughtfully applying good pricing strategies, value strategies. I mean fundamentally, Paul, in the short term, if you are running the business like ours, when you are faced with a surprise because I think we really were surprised by the March, April underperformance. In the short term, you'll lower inventory, you'll lower expenses but you add marketing and drive value. That's what you do to change the trend of our business proactively. You can't wait and hope that things will get better and you have to sort of plan that things will continue this way, and therefore this is what you do.","In the longer term, then other things come into play and you start thinking about capital allocation and how much money you are spending. But that's a much longer-term view, so we're doing the first part...","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, I think we're going to be aggressive on promotional markdowns. Where we're going to save the money is on the permanent markdowns. That's what's getting us into trouble over the last couple years from a gross margin perspective. It's not because we've had to promote more than normal; it's we've ended the season with way too much inventory.","So we have plenty. I know you and I are probably never going to agree on this inventory thing, but we have plenty of room to reduce our inventory without affecting comp. We're so far from where we need to be and are going to do it measured over the next five years. But I think it's not going to affect our ability to drive a comp. Getting people into the store is what's going to affect the ability to succeed from a comp perspective.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Well, we'll see. Thanks, and good luck.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Tunick with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Two questions. One is on digital. I think you guys said that digital grew mid-teens. I think you've originally talked about a 20% growth rate, so just curious on maybe what was happening there? Was that sort of a slowdown in the broader environment or was there a change in some marketing tact? And from a margin perspective in digital, how do you think about the profitability of your e-comm business today versus the bricks-and-mortar business?","And then the second question on your store base, I guess the closing of these 18 stores, maybe what metrics will you be watching for as you think about what the right size of your store base should be I guess in this new world? Thanks very much.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","You are pretty new to the story so I've been an early I guess realist on e-comm versus brick-and-mortar. It's not as profitable and I think everybody is coming around to that. Having said that, I think we missed our plan slightly in digital, it was only on a couple of days, so I don't think there's a material slowdown. The same things that affect traffic in the stores, you don't need shorts you're not going to buy them online just because it's easier, and can ship to your house for free. You will buy it when you need it. So I'm not too worried about digital from that perspective, we kind of guided to a 15% to 20% increase in our three-year plan. And we saw the biggest increase last year in the back half, and I suspect that will be the case this year too as people find it more convenient in the fourth quarter to shop online.","From a store base prospective, we closed every store really that had negative incremental free cash flow, that's how we look at it. We even closed a few stores that were slightly positive. We needed to get a base of stores that was significant enough to see what happens to both online business and surrounding sister stores when we close stores as well as what happens when we close a couple of stores in one particular market. So, we've only closed prior to this year probably five or six stores in my 13 years here. So we didn't really have enough data points.","We'll have to run the numbers as we move throughout the year. Obviously if comps don't improve in the stores, there will be more stores that tip over to negative cash flow, and we will look at that on an annual basis. But for the most part we have stores that are very much generating cash flow, and I don't think you're going to see us close a significant number of stores every year. I think 18 was sort of a starting point, and I think it would be a lot lower than that if we decided to close stores for this year for example.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Super. Thanks very much; good luck.","Operator","Next we will go to Dan Binder with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. My question is regarding your comments earlier about expecting improvement in Q2. And I was just wondering if that was in part based on what you were seeing in the last couple of weeks.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So when we look at performance over time, Dan, it's really fundamentally driven by actions that we take. So we always assume that whatever the underlying trend is, it's not going to change unless we do something to make it change. So we would never give you a forecast for the quarter or for the year based on some performance we had over the last 10 days at the beginning of the quarter. It's always driven by a look back into underperformance, or sometimes over performance, and then actions we take, so they're usually tied together.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","That said, has there been some sequential improvement in the last couple weeks?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We never talk about performance inside the quarter, Dan.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","I thought I'd try. My second question is with regard to just market share. I know, you've talked about, Wes, Amazon I guess showing up in the top 10 on apparel now maybe towards the bottom of the list. I'm just curious as you look at market share data recognizing that you and others were soft, how does your individual market share data look for different categories that you're selling?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It will be a little better informed on that, Dan, in probably about a month. That shared data is typically not as tightly timed to the end of reporting periods. But we'll have a look little better insight.","I mean, I don't think there's going to be any big news in there. I suspect companies who are given up more share in particular categories will continue to give up more share. We have been able to hold our share, but not gain in our share. And I'm not going to be surprised if that wasn't more of the same in the first quarter because generally you've heard some big retailers who have large share in our categories report and they've had underperformance as well. So I don't think there's going to be any big news in there. I really don't.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","And my last question if I could, just on product. You talked about the importance of that. You've obviously had some activity this quarter with some brand launches and relaunches. Can you give us a sense as to whether or not there are new national brands? Even if you can't talk about specifics, if there are more that you expect to announce this year and what other product relaunches you may expect over the balance of the year as well.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I definitely would expect to continue to be able to talk about new brands coming into the store over the year. You kind of know well the lifetime cycle on brand introductions, and it's next to impossible to be able to share with you a new brand that would actually launch in the same year. So any news we have on brand launches coming, and I do expect that there will be some, will really impact our 2017 performance.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I have two follow-ups I guess on Brian's questions earlier. First, what amount of sales recapture from the closed stores are you factoring into your guidance?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Factored zero in it.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right, and then second, you highlight these macro concerns impacting traffic, but there's certainly some secular undercurrents around online. If the weak traffic at your stores and perhaps across the group was to persist, how would you evaluate the potential need or even the potential benefits from consolidation as a strategic alternative?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, as a regular matter of business in our regular discussions at the board level, we're always looking at every single option that we have looking forward, Stephen. So there's nothing that's currently happened that in my mind would accelerate that discussion, and at the same time, there's nothing that's currently happened that would decelerate it. I think it's always on the table.","We generally have had a view that share in categories that we operate in is really important, so having scale is an important factor to long-term success. And so right now, the plan that we've described to you gets us to scale by driving essentially our business organically. We certainly have these new tasks which I think have the possibility of paying off in things like our Off\/Aisle concept or our outlet concept; the first one is with the FILA brand. And I still think that the small 35K store is going to be a meaningful contributor to our long-term performance.","I don't know that that particular store size will add a lot of growth, but I think it will address what we both know is a really key factor right now which is there's too much retail square footage. And so as some of our larger stores come up, we'll definitely be looking at our smaller store footprints as ways to continue to keep presence in a trade area but do it more productively.","Hopefully that answers your question. But there's nothing that's happening right now that we would share with you specifically around consolidation.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's fair and helpful. But are there kind of real synergies that could be captured in consolidation from rationalizing the supply chain, store base and e-commerce platforms?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, usually what you find on that, we're probably kind of moving out of the discussion around our business into more strategic stuff; we probably don't want to spend a lot of time on that \u2013 but I think generally what we think on these things is given a over-stored environment, thinking about possibilities to grow that are additive on the top line, we probably are going to put more focus on the cost line. So as we look at businesses, certainly if there's businesses we think can really improve our competencies in a particular category, we might consider it. But otherwise, if we're looking at scale, we're looking at places where we could take a lot of cost out of the business because I think that's just the right thing to do.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful. Thanks so much. Best of luck in the back-half.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Richard Jaffe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much guys. And just a follow-on question. Regarding the content of the inventory, obviously dollars are down. Are you guys convinced the balance is correct national brands to private label and that the seasonality is also where it should be given it's already May? And then just a follow-up question regarding marketing. Thanks.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","National versus private, I think we're pretty well...","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, national is up and the other two are down. And that mirrors our comp so I feel good about that. It always helps to sell more seasonal goods earlier in the season than it does to sell them later, you know that really well. So having a little less seasonal goods is always a good thing but we actually do have less seasonal goods than last year so I think we're positioned well but I get it, there's no other answer than to say hey, if you've had a tough seasonal performance in the first quarter isn't it nice to have a lot less going into the second quarter. Yes, of course it is but we just have to deal with what we have right now, it's not a big factor. I think Wes probably knows better.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, we bought spring receipts down 9%. So I feel comfortable that we'll be in a good inventory position at the end of the second quarter unless we see a step change down from where we ran.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Don't say it that Wes.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Well.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And marketing, you mentioned that that'd be a source of more tension and I assume more expenditures. Can you talk about perhaps how much and also...","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","I don't think it's going to be more expenditures I think it's going to be looking at what we're doing and shifting weight within the various vehicles. I don't think it's necessarily going to be more spending","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And any more specifics about direction or just wait-and-see?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","We have a team of our best and brightest trying to investigate everything right now. So at a high level, I would think we'd be trying to test a little bit more weight into print and direct mail and maybe pull back from digital a little bit.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Richard.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Kevin, can you talk a little bit about the launch of the REED business? I guess what you've learned in stores versus online, the different categories, handbags versus clothing, price points at this point so far?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean generally, I think we'd characterize it as a success for sure. I actually don't know the specifics on the online versus brick-and-mortar, Wes probably does. I think generally and probably not surprising to you, the handbags performance was really good. The apparel performance was a mixed bag and so I think we're taking a look at that and trying to react accordingly. But I would definitely call it a big success. I mean people have responded really well to the product fundamentally and the price points which as you know were more elevated have not been a factor at all in the success. So it does say to you that, new ideas that are on target, in spite of a general sales slump, do well, they can do well.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, I think we always do a little thing with the online business where they get early access to launches and things like that so there's always a pretty big spike on that but I don't think there's been a material difference between the two after you've had a shake out for a few months.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. And then on the Women's business has it been largely strength in Women's active or has it been sort of broader? And I was just wondering if fit and flare dresses are really driving at all any of the success that you're seeing in Women's?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I like the fact that you have a sense of humor Bob in a tough environment. Women's active is really good, trying to put a more serious note on that. Women's active I think is really good and continues to be good just like active in general is good. The category in Women's I think that outperformed significantly and Wes can jump in, but is our Junior's business, there was a big outperformance in Junior's in the first quarter and that business \u2013 we didn't want to get into this in the call because it's relatively a short period of time and a small percentage of our total Women's business, but that business has implemented a new supply chain strategy to move much more quickly on product and I think it is definitely benefiting them in a huge way and so that's a learning that we're incorporating into other areas as well. I don't know if you want to add anything in there Wes?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","No. I think that's good.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Next we'll go to Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.","Patrick G. McKeever - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks. Just a couple, first on loyalty I think the last time you gave a number there was back in the fall, 34 million members if I'm not mistaken. So just wondering where that number stands currently? And what you're seeing in terms of the impact on the business from the loyalty program? And does that, I mean I know you had talked about tweaking the marketing and tweaking the program, have you done much there and does that factor into the view that same-store sales will start to improve a bit from here through the balance of the year?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Well, I think the loyalty numbers have definitely increased. I don't have a up-to-date number in front of me but it's probably pushing close to 40 million. Some of those are duplicates, so not real unique people that we can measure because people like myself have multiple members on a card and they have different loyalty numbers associated with them. We never looked for a year to bump. One of the things that we're looking for and didn't plan that in our past \u2013 the $21 billion that we laid out a couple years ago. So we really didn't build any incrementality into it past last year in the fourth quarter.","We are making a concerted effort in the back half after we roll out a new point-of-sale system, to use the loyalty information if they've completed their profile to do a pre-screen on them for our credit card and try to get people to move along the value path from not having a loyalty card to having a Yes2You rewards card and then hopefully getting them to sign up for our credit card. So we'll have more to talk to you about that probably at the end of the fourth quarter. The new point-of-sale system isn't rolling out until late in the third quarter, so we won't have a lot of data on that until after holiday.","Patrick G. McKeever - MKM Partners LLC","Okay, and then just a second quick one on beauty. Just wondering there, too, if you have an update? Is that's still driving I think you it said 100 basis points to 200 basis points of incremental comp at stores that had it?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Well, we just completed the last store rollout of a couple hundred stores in the first quarter. It was consistent throughout that. They did not roll out until the end of April, so I don't have any numbers from them yet. But I would suspect that would be consistent and beauty continues to be one of the better performing areas of the company.","Patrick G. McKeever - MKM Partners LLC","Got it. Thank you, Wes.","Operator","And that will conclude the question-and-answer session. Any closing comments from our presenters?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","No, I think an hour is enough. Thanks a lot, everybody.","Operator","Thank you.

Thank you.","I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Wes McDonald, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thanks a lot. With me today is Kevin Mansell, Chairman, CEO and President of Kohl's Corporation. Total sales for the quarter decreased 1% to $4.2 billion. Comp store sales decreased 1.9%. The decrease in comp sales reflects a 2.4% increase in units per transaction, which was offset by a 1.1% decline in average unit retail and a 3.2% decrease in number of transactions. Kevin will talk more about our sales in a moment.","Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 36.4%, approximately 50 basis points higher than the first quarter of last year and significantly better than our guidance of flat to up 20 basis points. We continue to believe that our value equation is right, and we expect improvement in our gross margin throughout 2013 as a result of lower costs and better inventory management.","SG&A decreased 1% for the quarter, better than our expectations, above 2.5% to 3.5%. SG&A as a percent of sales deleveraged approximately 10 basis points for the quarter.","Store payroll continue to be managed very well despite our volatility in sales during the quarter. Our store controllable line achieved significant leverage in remodel-related costs, as all 30 2013 remodels will occur in the fall. Overall, store expenses deleveraged through the inability to leverage our fixed costs with the lower-than-planned sales.","Advertising expenses leveraged for the quarter. We expect to invest more money in advertising in the second quarter after seeing some of the results of our advertising test in the first quarter. Our credit operations continue to provide leverage as revenue increases more than offset increases in marketing and servicing costs.","Distribution centers and information technology did not leverage due to growth and infrastructure investment in our e-commerce business. We continue to improve our efficiency in e-commerce fulfillment, and they achieved significant leverage as a percent of e-commerce sales.","Depreciation expense increased 6% over the first quarter of 2012 to $214 million. The increases is primarily due to technology investments across the company.","Net interest expense was $83 million this quarter, up $1 million compared to the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due to the September 2012 debt issuance. Our income tax rate was 37% for the quarter. This is approximately 150 basis points higher than last year's first quarter, which included the impact of favorable state audit settlements. Net income decreased 4% to $147 million, and EPS increased 5% to $0.66 per diluted share.","For your modeling purposes, gross square footage at the end of the quarter was 101.07 million, and selling square footage was 83.536 million. During the quarter, we opened 9 new stores and also reopened our Caesar's Bay store in New York, which had been closed since Superstorm Sandy last November. Moving on to the balance sheet -- we ended the quarter with 1,155 stores. Our plans are to open 3 new stores and remodel 30 stores this fall.","Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $518 million of cash and cash equivalents. Capital expenditures were $135 million for the first 3 months of 2013, $42 million lower than the first 3 months of 2012. The decrease reflects multiple changes in our capital expenditures, including fewer remodels and new stores, partially offset by higher IT spending.","Our April inventory balance was $4 billion, a 15% increase over April 2012. And our brick-and-mortar stores' inventory dollars are up 10% per store over last year. Kevin will talk more about inventory in a few minutes. AP as a percent of inventory decreased from 46.6 at quarter-end 2012 to 36.7 this year.","Weighted average diluted shares were $223 million for the quarter. And on May 15, 2013, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share, which is payable June 26, 2013 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 12, 2013.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin, who will provide additional insights on our results.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks, Wes. Let me start with sales. As Wes mentioned, comp sales were down 1.9% for the quarter. Though we don't provide details by month, when spring finally arrived in April, we saw significant comp improvements in our weather-sensitive markets, including the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. For the quarter, the West was the strongest region and was the only region which reported higher comp stores. The Midwest, Northeast, Southeast and South Central regions all reported mid-single-digit comp decreases. E-commerce sales increased 31% for the quarter and contributed approximately 210 basis points to our comp. The seasonal apparel was down 8% for the quarter and negatively affected sales by approximately 320 basis points.","Moving on to a line of business perspective. All lines of business reported modest sales decline, as higher sales in basics and other non-seasonal merchandise were more than offset by lower sales in seasonal merchandise categories. Home, accessories and footwear were the strongest categories, performing better than the company. Within home, electrics and luggage were very strong. Within accessories, strength was in bath and beauty, watches and sterling silver jewelry. And athletic shoes were the strongest footwear category. Women's was consistent with the company average. Notable performers again included the active and fitness category. Intimates and sleepwear and special sizes outperformed the company average. Men's reported notable strength in the tailored and dress category. And finally, children's reported the largest sales decreases. Results were generally consistent across all kids' apparel categories.","From a brand perspective, private, exclusive and national brands performed very similarly in the quarter. Private and exclusive brand penetration grew 30 basis points versus last year for the quarter in total. Our newest brands such as Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and Rock and Republic continue to achieve solid double-digit growth increases. And several of our largest brands, such as NIKE and Chaps, also reported strong sales.","From an inventory standpoint, as expected, our inventory levels are up low double digits on a per-store basis over the first quarter 2012 levels. As you may recall, our inventory levels were uncharacteristically low, as we were chasing inventory in many categories through most of the spring season last year. We would expect to end the second quarter up low- to mid-single digits per store versus last year. Most of that investment would be in key back-to-school areas like children's and young men's, as well as areas that were short [ph] of seasonal products, such as men's sportswear.","In marketing, we've been able to read some of the marketing tests we did last fall and in the first quarter. Many of those tests have proven successful, and we are increasing our marketing spend modestly over last year in the second quarter as a result in order to drive sales.","We continue to be very pleased with the early results of our loyalty program, which we launched in approximately 100 stores last fall. We expanded the test to the state of Texas earlier this month and are planning to expand it to other markets in the third quarter. We've listened to our customers in the pilot stores and have made some notable improvements to the program. Included were changes in threshold levels, redemption timeframes and in-store communication. At this point, we're seeing both existing Kohl's Charge customers and bank card customers embrace the program. We've not seen our credit card penetration dip in these markets, and loyalty is increasing the likelihood of the bank card customer applying for a Kohl's Charge Card.","We're also pleased with the financial results in terms of frequency and spending so far. The program continues to provide us with significant insights into how our customer shops and how we're better able to influence our shopping behavior. We plan to use these learnings to further improve the program before a rollout to the entire chain.","In the area of information technology, during the quarter, we made significant additional technology investments. They were to support our online business, to provide ongoing operational efficiencies in our stores and corporate locations and to provide the omni-channel shopping experience that our customers desire. We are on track to replace our e-commerce platform in the second quarter. This upgrade will be virtually invisible to our customer but is foundational to our omni-channel roadmap. We also expect to have the necessary infrastructure in place to expand our ability to fulfill online orders from stores. We expect to expand shift from stores to 200 stores by this holiday 2013. We will also expand our RFID pilot to additional stores and departments later this year. This project improves our on-shelf availability and reduces replenishment costs. Mobile POS is a key benefit of our POS re-platform project. We will pilot mobile POS in the third quarter. And finally, our global inventory visibility project will improve our ability to track in-store inventory and is the first of several steps necessary to offering in-store pickup for online orders. Each of these investments either has been or will be adequately tested before it's rolled out to ensure it meets our ROI goals and does not negatively impact the customer experience.","In closing, from a strictly financial results perspective, first quarter results were better than expected. We're pleased with the management of both our gross margin and our expenses. Our customers continue to give us very high marks on our customer service, noting the improvement in our inventory levels in all of our survey results. The West region is starting to get momentum on the sales line after we improved our store operations there over the last few years. The region has now led the company in sales for the last 2 quarters. However, we're not satisfied with our progress on the top line across the company. Our e-commerce business has remained strong, and we'll continue to invest in its growth for the long term. And as I mentioned earlier, we've had some success with the marketing tests we've been running, and I do believe you will see that in our future top line results. There's also a lot of pent-up demand for spring merchandise out there. We'll be in a much better inventory position in the second quarter than we were last year, and we think it will allow us to take advantage of some pent-up seasonal demand. And finally, our organizational changes are having additional 3 months to take effect.","As a reminder, our 3 broad strategies for 2013 were: to own savings; to focus on mom, our most important customer; and to increase our confidence in Kohl's from all aspects. On the savings strategy, we believe strongly that savings isn't just about the lowest price.  It's about price, quality, style and the experience the customer gets at Kohl's. All-in savings includes focusing our marketing message to consistently position Kohl's as the savings leader. It includes ensuring that our prices are competitive first but then even better with our value-added offers. It includes building increased style and quality into the products that she buys. We made a decision to expand our loyalty program to broaden the customer base with access to value-added offers, and we believe, long term, it could be a very powerful tool to broaden our reach.","Our second strategy, increasing her confidence in Kohl's, is about providing the assurance that Kohl's will always come through for her and that she knows we are the store for her, having what she wants and when she wants it, whether it's in store or online. With our increase in inventory levels, we have seen improvement in our in-stock levels on replenished goods. As we enter the fall season, we would expect to improve on that further as we focus the increasing depth of customer choice while reducing the number of choices. In 2012, our offerings became too broad, and our assortments lacked focus. Most importantly, our organizational changes should have their full impact as we enter the back-to-school season.","The third key strategy is focusing on mom. Though moms are our most loyal and highest spending customers, we believe we have significant opportunity to capture a larger share of her wallet. We continue to do a significant amount of customer research, both quantitatively and qualitatively, to learn how we can serve her best.","In summary, our #1 goal is to drive sales. In order to do that, we have to continue to improve the quality of our merchandise and offer items at a great value. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in our marketing. We need to continue to progress in order to drive increases in transactions per store. Driving traffic will allow us to gain market share consistently from competitors.","With that, I'll it turn back to Wes to provide our second quarter guidance.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thanks, Kevin. For the second quarter, our guidance is as follows: total sales increase of 1% to 3%; comparable sales increase of flat to 2%; gross margin rate increase of 10 to 20 basis points; SG&A expenses increasing 2.5% to 3.5%; depreciation expense of $228 million; interest expense of $83 million; and a tax rate of 37.5%. This results in earnings per diluted share of $1 to $1.08 for the second fiscal quarter.","With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have 2 questions. The first one is, when you look at the inventory levels, is there a different way to look at it on a sort of calendar comparable basis? Did the calendar have a significant impact on your reported levels?","Wesley S. McDonald","Not for this quarter, really. It was relatively same. I think what did have an impact was the receipt level. Obviously, with seasonal merchandise not selling very well in the beginning of the quarter, we were able to cut some receipts in April. The accounts payable dropped about $150 million. About $100 million of that was due to just receipt reduction in April.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question is, when you look at the sales performance this quarter, just the weather impact in the first quarter, how much of that do you expect to get back in the second quarter? And can you quantify any estimate around how much it did hit yourselves this quarter, especially when you look at some of the competitive data that's out there?","Kevin Mansell","I think, Bob, as far as the first quarter goes, probably the clearest way to quantify it is the way we did in our summary, which is to say that seasonal categories, which are the classifications that normally come to mind when you think about spring and summer selling, t-shirts, tanks, shorts, sandals, were down 8% comps. So they had a significant negative drag on our total business. We've included in our assumptions for the second quarter basically our base assumptions for the year, which is a flat to 2% comp. I do think that there's probably a lot of pent-up demand, and we saw some of that breaking news in April, as we mentioned. The trend change in April was pretty dramatic. So we'd like to be optimistic and say we could get a lot of that back, but our base case comp assumptions just include our full annual comp assumptions of flat to 2%.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I think Kevin mentioned that on the call. But if we were to run flat and seasonal, the comps for the quarter would've been 320 basis points better.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You didn't comment on your prior full year guidance of $4.15 to $4.45. Does that still stand?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, if we don't comment, it means it didn't change.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just thinking about the second half, what categories do you see the most comp opportunity from having better inventory position and having some of these new merchants in place?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, I think that, first of all, generally, the basic classifications have great opportunity to grow. And actually, in spite of the weak demand in the first quarter, which meant weaker traffic drove that, basic categories actually performed pretty well. So I think that's encouraging. Our in-stock service levels are up significantly over last year. That remains an opportunity for us going in the fall and holiday because we didn't do a good job on basic categories. And then we've had a pretty broad wholesale organizational change. So I don't know that I would call out any particular category. I think our opportunity in the store in total is pretty wide, to be honest with you, Lorraine. So I would expect that all of our key 6 businesses could contribute to sales growth in the back half.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then can you quantify the impact that the better credit had on SG&A?","Wesley S. McDonald","$10 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Maschmeyer with Robert W. Baird.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","You're up against or you used comparison in Q2, and you're obviously giving comp guidance that's in line with your full year guidance. I mean, so should we think of it more on the high end of that range? Or it sounded like you were pretty optimistic on the opportunity for pent-up demand. I mean, just is there any other shift in advertising or marketing or promotions or anything else that would be a headwind for the comp in Q2?","Kevin Mansell","No, I mean, there aren't any specific headwinds in the second quarter. I think we're optimistic that we'll get some pent-up demand because we are positioned to take advantage of it. And as you said, last year, our performance was driven by a lack of in-stock in those categories. So we do think it's an opportunity for sure. But no, there's no specific other headwinds. I think we did mention that we are investing a little more in marketing. That's due to the results of the tests that we did in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Those were primarily around loyalty, of course, but they were also around application of expansion in broadcast, both event television and radio, and also changes in our direct mail strategy. So I'm hopeful that those also could have a positive impact.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On the advertising front, so you found an encouraging ROI from expanding the broadcast in the quarter. Is that fair to say?","Kevin Mansell","Yes.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So then should we think of that as probably continuing through the holidays. And I guess, any other early thoughts that you might have on the competitive environment for the holidays and how you plan on increasing your share of mind share with the consumer?","Kevin Mansell","No, I mean, I don't think we're prepared to talk about back-to-school or holiday at this point. We're really focused on taking advantage of the opportunity in front of us in the second quarter. But one of the things we work diligently at is to formulate many, many tests and pilots in marketing because we do know that that's an area that has not leveraged effectively for us and needs to perform better from a productivity standpoint. So I would expect that to continue. We're going to continue to be testing, piloting and then applying those learnings to our broad company-wide effort.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies & Company.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, on expenses. I guess, relative to your expectations in Q1, was it just simply better layer management that allowed you to keep the expense growth down? And in longer term, just curious, based on the cost-cutting initiatives that you've taken and pursuing for the last year or so, I'm curious where we are in that, in recognizing them.","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, we've put $80 million in our plan so far, either fall last year or for 2013. I'd say our SG&A performance, quite honestly, every area in the company, other than store fixed expense, beat their plans. So my guidance to you guys earlier in the quarter is based on what our plan is and the comparison outlines just really our result. So the plan -- but every team in the company really did a great job of managing expenses across the board.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then just on the inventory front, I know you guys were under inventory this time last year. So when we look at the increase at around 15%.  I guess, how much of that is sort of catch-up to getting to where you should be versus just being heavy because of a soft Q1? And is the mix of the excess inventory primarily seasonal?","Kevin Mansell","No, I mean, the total inventory ending for the quarter is, frankly, exactly where we thought it would be. And that includes being, as you said, light in our revenue expectations. So we made adjustments during the quarter to make sure we manage that effectively. I -- from my perspective, and I think Wes and I both feel strongly that the basic in-stock commitment we made we're living up to, and that's going to benefit us. But on a year-over-year comparison, we're up quite a bit as a result. And then on the seasonal classifications, those are reclassifications that we were way under inventoried and going into the second quarter last year, so it is definitely a correction to last year.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, as I look at the buckets of inventory, our seasonal inventory is up a little bit more than -- per average store, it's not material. We're actually up a little bit more in things like denim and non-denim long bottoms.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then just one final one on credit. I think you were doing some work with Capital One to mine the data better then give you an opportunity to go a little bit further down on the FICO score spectrum in terms of what you approve and don't approve. Any updates on that?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I put a new scorecard in last October, and that's been running since then. So I guess what I would tell you, it's -- we've been able to maintain our approval rate either a little bit above last year or at last year. One of the things that just came out from Washington is they're going to come up with some rules that's going to make us -- allow us to grant credit to stay-at-home spouses, which is obviously a big part of who shops our store. And we're anxiously awaiting those rules to come out so we can change some of our criteria on our scorecard to allow us to approve more people.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was wondering, how should we think about inventory management in the back of the year? And as you were going through the first quarter with sales that were running below plan, did you have any opportunities to cancel or cut back on any second quarter deliveries in order to try to respond to that situation?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I already sort of answered that. I mean, I said $100 million of the AP drop was due to cut in receipts in April, and we'd obviously adjust the receipts in the second quarter as well. We said the inventories at the end of the second quarter will be low to high -- or excuse me, low- to mid-single digits on a per-store basis. And then as we go into the fall, obviously, especially at the end of the year, when we are very heavy in inventory, I will expect us to be a lot lighter than. We haven't broken out the merchant plans yet by quarter. We're getting ready to do that, but I would expect both quarters to be down, with the fourth quarter being down more significantly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You doubled your target for door-to-store rollout to 200 stores by the end of the year. Can you speak to some of the learnings from the pilot test thus far?","Kevin Mansell","Yes, I mean, as you can imagine, the test has been very positive. I mean, we -- generally, what we've seen is that the costs to shift customers from our test stores, which we're anticipating to be able to do from 200 stores in the Fall\/Holiday, are similar to the costs from our e-fulfillment center. But the customer service levels are dramatically improved because the store location, compared to the customers' residences, is very, very close. So essentially, we're getting much higher service levels for the customer for the same cost to the company.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes. And the shipping cost is a little better, which is another thing. And I guess the last thing is we don't want to build another e-fulfillment center. We've maximized our transportation savings with 4. The only reason to build a fifth one is for capacity. And we have 1,155 stores. We'd like to use the store as the excess capacity for peak season and also, as Kevin mentioned, would increase the speed of shipping to the customer.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. And then with your comments on April improvement in the release, have you seen these more robust trends continuing May to date? And also, could you speak to the expected progression of monthly sales in 2Q?","Kevin Mansell","Well, we're not giving monthly anymore, so that we won't speak to. The only thing I would say about -- because we obviously can't comment on trends in the quarter, but the only thing about May that is, obviously, there's a benefit early in the month because of the calendar shift. Mother's Day sort of appears a little bit earlier in the month. But that's probably true for all retailers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich with Citigroup.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Deb Weinswig. So in terms of looking at the quarter, Kevin, you've said that your first quarter results were better than expected. What were the key drivers behind that?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, they were, to be honest with you, with the very notable exception, which I'll be clear to admit, our top line, which was still disappointing, but I really do feel that was driven strictly by seasonal weather issues. With the exception of that, I think we were almost happy with every other single performance. Inventory management was well done. We ended the quarter with the inventory we expected to, even though we didn't get the topline revenue we expected. Merchandise margins exceeded our expectations, and they were wide spread across the company. And as Wes said, I think almost every single area contributed to our expense results. And the only area that didn't -- of note that didn't really leverage was store payroll but -- the store expense [ph], I'm sorry, because of the sales results. So I think one of the things that makes Wes and I both feel so great about the quarter is that it was very broad, and that's important.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then you laid a lot of tech investments that have happened, but it sounds like there's a lot that's coming. How would you kind of prioritize in terms of 2013 and also 2014 what you think will be the most important in terms of driving the business?","Kevin Mansell","In terms of which area though, Deb?","Wesley S. McDonald","IT.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Your IT investments.","Kevin Mansell","I think it's -- it would be almost impossible to be specific about a specific year's impact. Some of these things are taking hold this year. But as you know, it takes time to sort of gain traction and gain momentum.  A good example to me is the re-platform, right, where we invested a lot in the re-platform, and there's expectations that, with that more robust ability to be more personal in our communication and deliver better service levels. Combined with our ship-from-store capacity, it will give us long-term growth. But to be able to quantify how much of that growth can be at the back half of the year this year versus next year gets really difficult. And I think the kind of the same is true for most of the other items. I think, generally, there's positives for the Fall\/Holiday, but I think the bigger positives are quite coming in 2014.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, there's a lot of systems that we're working on that are foundational in the merchandising area in partnership with Oracle to basically rewrite almost -- or replace almost every PO item-type system that will allow a lot more flexibility in terms of analyzing the business. But Kevin is right, the e-com platform is definitely going to help us this year, but it's going to hopefully help us in the next years and the following year to come. It was expensive, so hopefully we have a multiple-year payback on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Swinand with Morningstar Investment Research.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a question on your comments that you have narrower and more focused assortments. In your prepared remarks, you've mentioned that. Do you believe that's influencing gross margin and even inventory turns? Or is it still sort of in the transition phase?","Kevin Mansell","I mean, I don't know that it's had a significant impact right now. I think we see it as a really important driver of 3 things. One is top line results because we think of a more focused assortment presented on the floor just gives us a better platform to present to customers, but definitely an impact on both inventory turn and the resulting merchandise margins because we know that we got unfocused and over-assorted, and that cost us a lot with the customer. And it cost us an awful lot in terms of margin over the course of last year. So I think we see it affecting all 3 things. You'll see more of it in the fall. I've been sitting through the fall planning meetings, and we've really made it a big focus to look in every division, choices versus last year, and then depth versus last year. So it's something the team has really embraced across all merchandise areas, and that's when I think you should see it.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","What do you think led you to get unfocused? Was it just testing to try to see what would work in a tough sales environment? Or...","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, without rehashing sort of old news, but I think one of the things we recognized last year is that we needed to improve the quality of our decision-making on our merchandise assortments broadly across the company. And that led us to strengthen our merchandise team, almost every single area of planning, buying and product development. And as you know, it's not as if we don't have good system capabilities to make these decisions, but ultimately, it's about leadership. And we've, as you know, made significant amounts of leadership changes at the end of last year, and we're thinking that that's going to have a positive impact as we go into fall and holiday.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. On the near-term stuff, you mentioned some weakness in the weather-sensitive categories in the first quarter. But you also saw strength in some of the non-weather-sensitive like home, accessories and footwear. So I'm just wondering if maybe you saw a dollar shift out of the weather-sensitive stuff and into non-weather-sensitive, and if you could see, kind of a giveback in the second quarter when the weather turns. And then also, I'm just wondering if you could share the comp metrics that you gave. I guess, those always include e-com. I'm wondering if you could share what they were at the store level.","Kevin Mansell","On the looking forward versus looking backwards, where the business came from, I mean, basic categories performed better than non-basic categories, but I don't see the results of those being dramatically inflated by the lack of selling in the seasonal merchandise. Generally, when seasonal merchandise is a little soft, basic categories are a little stronger. That's been consistent forever, and I am sure that will be consistent going forward. But no, I don't really see that as a headwind at all for basic categories in the second quarter, particularly considering, as we talked about, the tremendous effort and investment we've made in inventory in basic categories to be in stock in the second quarter.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","But when you say basic, you're not talking about home, accessories and footwear, though, are you?","Kevin Mansell","Certain classifications and assuming most to home is basic. I mean, the vast majority of home is basic. And footwear categories, it's sort of a -- it depends. In the area of athletic footwear, we find that there's a lot less seasonality in the business. In the area of casual footwear, of course, with categories like sandals being really important and really heavily seasonal businesses. And then the other things that we kind of throw in the basics are the basic categories like underwear and dress shirts and ties, denims, categories that you would normally assume.","Wesley S. McDonald","And for your other question, I mean, e-com was up 30% -- a little over 30% and was 210 basis points on the comp. It obviously had better traffic than the stores. I'm not interested in really breaking that up that much. Given the fact that it's less than 10% of the business, the metric differences aren't material.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then just maybe longer term, as you look at the strength in e-com and I guess maybe weaker store traffic, does it make you rethink what the right number of stores are just in terms of your overall footprint over the long term? Because it does seem like e-com sales are potentially coming out of the stores, and I'm just wondering if you rethink the number of stores that you should have longer term.","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I think they're coming out of everybody's e-com business. We're not alone in that. Well, I think we're just a little more honest about it than other people. If you look at our sales per square foot with e-com, it's basically been flat for the last 5 years. So as far as reducing the number of stores, we look at everything on an incremental cash flow basis. If it doesn't provide incremental cash flow, we'll close it. And there's a handful of stores, but I'm not thinking we need to close a large amount of stores at this point. You're talking about a handful.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, the most significant impact of online on our strategy on the stores, to be honest with you, is to make the stores smaller and to take advantage of the online. And I think it would be very difficult for Wes and I to look way out in the future and decide whether or not the total number of stores Kohl's could ever have is going to be dramatically influenced or not. But certainly in the short term, we're opening fewer stores.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just I guess if you can help me just break down the gross margin year-over-year changes in the quarter a little bit, you said -- I think you said gross margins exceeded your expectations. So maybe you could help us think about how much of the year-over-year change was due to seasonal markdowns, how much was related to cost benefits and maybe just some of the components there?","Kevin Mansell","Yes, I mean, we don't get into the detail of where the margin came from, from which area. I think the most I could provide color on that is to say that the margin improvement was widespread, and it was across the company. And it was both brick-and-mortar and online. So it's pretty consistent, I would say.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, and we gave you guys -- obviously, we have higher expectations internally than we give you externally. and I would tell you the merchants made their plans. They haven't made that in a while, so I'm very happy about that. And we can continue to do that. I think we'll have good margin performance throughout the balance of the year.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And if we could talk about the components of the comparison or the comp sales maybe in the second quarter. Frankly, you obviously lapped your biggest AUR hurdle from last year in the second quarter. So if I try to look at some of the -- your guidance going from 0 to 2%, and then if I want to look at the positive comps, is it safe to say that baked into that assumption is that from the transaction sluggishness in the first quarter was pushed into May and probably still see a negative AUR in the second quarter?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean I think if I was trying to prognosticate, I would say the transactions need to be positive for us to -- flat to positive for us to run a positive comp. AUR is probably going to be down, and UPT will probably be up. And as we move through the back half, especially in the fourth quarter, I would expect AUR to be up, given our margin performance last year, and units to be down.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then one last question. Obviously, we don't have a lot of details yet on the changing strategy of J.C. Penney, but it seems intuitive that those guys can look to drive traffic with heavier promotions and that they would more likely to do that in categories like the basics that you talked about today, where they can mark the product down with less gross margin damage. Have you seen any early reads if they've, I guess, started dipping their toe back into heavier coupons here in recent weeks that we could think about?","Kevin Mansell","Not really, and to be totally honest with you, I just don't think we're in a position to talk about that, anyway.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Fuhrman with Piper Jaffray.","Alex J. Fuhrman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I would love to talk a little bit more about the e-commerce fulfillment strategy, and I think in prior quarters, you've given a little bit more color about the actual impact to gross margin from shipping and handling. And it sounds like, from your prepared commentary, that you're sort of talking about some fulfillment efficiencies. I mean, with that, could you actually see an improvement year-over-year in your net shipping margin? And then kind of looking forward to the balance of the year, obviously, e-commerce as a percentage of sales is going to be a lot higher. I mean, is there an opportunity to stem the margin erosion from shipping and handling, just given the improvement in the net shipping margin even as your e-commerce business grows? And then if we could just clarify quickly, Wes, I think you said that the cost of fulfilling an order from one of your stores is about the same as it is from your DC. Is that just the marginal cost of one order? In other words, is it still cheaper to do from the store when you factor in the depreciation associated with having to build out another DC?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, I think if you'd factor in the adding of an incremental DC, then yes, the store would be cheaper. In terms of your earlier question, the shipping cost has improved dramatically year-over-year. It's still -- and because of the cost as a drain on the margin, you'll get more details in the Q, but it hurt our overall margin rate this quarter by 10 basis points. Much less than it has in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Glick with Buckingham.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Kevin, just a question on your national brand strategy. It sounded like in Q1, the performance was similar to private and exclusive. And then you talked a quarter ago about putting more emphasis on those brands in marketing. Just wondering if you could update us on your thoughts to sort that business, as well as some potential opportunities in the center core area where you're underdeveloped and possibly have the sales opportunity in accessories?","Kevin Mansell","Well, in national brands and the private, exclusive brands essentially ran almost the same performance for the quarter, which was the second quarter in a row where national brands performed at or better than the overall stores. So from a trend standpoint, to be honest, that's a pretty big change in the trend. I think, as we talked about at the beginning of the year, we're really focused on making sure that our most important national brands are getting their due in inventory investment, premier floorspace, visual and more prominent marketing. Much of that is sort of emerging in the second and the third quarter. I think that we believe that that'll be particularly noticeable by the time we get to fall. So I'm optimistic that we'll see even more traction as we go into the third quarter with national brands. On the center core business, it's definitely a business we're focused on. We -- the business that outperformed the store, though it wasn't exciting in terms of its results because, as we said, all 6 areas of business were, in fact, slightly negative. But I do believe that with some of the testings and remodels that we're doing, there's a lot of good things to come in that world. So I would expect that world to perform better as we look through the rest of the year.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Are there any brand opportunities that you can talk about at this point, Kevin? Or...","Kevin Mansell","No. Yes, it would be premature to talk about any details.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Can you talk a little bit about your credit card sales growth versus the non-credit card sales growth? And then as you had mentioned mobile, is the mobile pilot still on track for the third quarter and has anything changed?","Wesley S. McDonald","In terms of credit versus non-credit for the quarter, credit was up low-single digits, and non-credit was down mid-single digits, so a little disappointing from that perspective given the performance in the fourth quarter. But I expect some of the things we're doing with loyalty, as well as some other advertising changes in the second quarter, I think, will get the non-credit customer back onboard. They also have a reason to buy because now they can buy shorts because it will be warmer than it was in the first quarter. So I think we'll make some progress there. And the mobile initiative is really tied to the re-platform, so assuming that the re-platform goes in, you'll see some of those initiatives happen in the fall.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just wondering if you could maybe give us a little more -- or a little color on the DesigNation initiative, how that's doing, how the Derek Lam merchandise is doing right now. Is that -- has that been less weather-sensitive than the rest of the store, if that merchandise is selling better in-store or online, that sort of thing, and what's the plan there going forward?","Kevin Mansell","DesigNation, as you know, this is our second launch with the designer. We had Narciso Rodriguez in the Fall\/Holiday and Derek Lam just a few weeks ago. I think the consistency that we see is that there's a lot of excitement with consumers around it. That's a positive thing for word of mouth and for keeping consumers engaged. So that's definitely fulfilling our expectation there. Second, it's very, very strong online. Maybe that's not a surprise to you, but both the first launch and this more recent launch have both performed exceptionally well online, where we got a lot of consumer engagement. The actual performance of each of the brands has driven -- been driven a lot, of course, by, also, overall traffic. So I think we probably didn't do quite as well in April with our Derek Lam expectation but -- as we had originally planned in our brick-and-mortar. But unfortunately, as you know, we had lower traffic than we expected as well. So I don't know the exact number, Patrick. I don't know that we made the plans, but we came pretty close, I think.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just to follow back up on gross margins, could you just speak about the contribution of the lower sourcing costs, as well as what was the impact of markdowns during this period, if any? And also just on inventory, do the move from being up 10% per store to low- to mid-single digits, is that just a function of the comparisons or just -- if you can just help us get more comfortable with that?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, the drop is a function of the comparisons. We really didn't have any seasonal inventory in May and June, and we delivered polos the Thursday before Father's Day. So we were chasing most of the quarter. And as far as the components go, I think it was pretty much balanced. We had less clearance markdowns than we thought and a little bit better markup with the lower costs. So to get more granular than that, there's a lot of moving pieces, and I'm just happy we beat our guidance.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And operating income was down again this quarter year-over-year, and share repurchases is helping the bottom line quite a bit. Just as we look at your cash balance, which is half of what it was a year ago, I know you noted the AP is down, but in order to get to that $1 billion in buyback for the year, should we expect for you to add debt in the third quarter as you did a year ago?","Wesley S. McDonald","No, we won't add any debt, and the cash flow will get better towards the end of the year as the inventory comes down.","Thanks, everybody. Appreciate your time.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Kohl's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference. [Operator Instructions]","Certain statements made on this call, including projected financial results, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Also, please note that replays of this recording will not be updated. So if you are listening after February 27, 2014, it is possible that the information discussed is no longer current.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Wes McDonald.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thank you. With me today is Kevin Mansell, Chairman, CEO and President. I'll walk through our P&L and Kevin will talk a little bit about our merchandising and marketing initiatives, and then I'll conclude the call with our guidance for our fiscal 2014.","Comp sales for the quarter decreased 2%. As a reminder, our actual comps and our guidance excluded the 53rd week in fiscal 2012. Some of our competitors, especially in specialty retail, report on the shifted calendar, which excludes the first week of the 2012 fiscal quarter. On this shifted basis, our sales -- our comp sales decreased 0.4% for the quarter.","Our average transaction value increased 2.8%, the largest increase in more than 2 years. AUR was especially strong, up 3.6%, partially due to significant reductions in our January clearance sales. Transactions per store were slightly negative during the holiday season, but fell off significantly in January. For the quarter, transactions were down 4.8%. Kevin will provide more details on our sales in his prepared remarks.","Our gross margin rate for the quarter increased 71 basis points, consistent with the low end of our guidance. We are especially pleased with this performance given the shipping challenges that we experienced in the quarter in our E-Commerce business. A shortened holiday shopping season, inclement weather and our own operational challenges in our fulfillment centers all contributed to higher shipping costs as we use faster, more expensive shipping methods to fulfill our customers orders.","We also saw a higher percentage of our online sales during the highly promotional Thanksgiving and Cyber weeks. Our SG&A expenses were 2% higher than last year, which was more than our expectations of a 75 to 125 basis point increase. Higher fulfillment expenses for our online business were the primary reason for our actual costs exceeding our original guidance. Marketing expense also exceeded our original plans.","Depreciation expense increased 5% over the fourth quarter of 2012 to $224 million. The increase is primarily due to depreciation at our E-Commerce fulfillment centers and IT amortization.","Net interest expense increased $2 million to $87 million for the quarter. The increase is primarily due to the September 2013 debt issuance.","Our income tax rate was 36% for the quarter, a full percentage point lower than our expectation of 37%. The change was primarily due to favorable state audit tax resolutions.","Net income was $334 million for the current year quarter and $889 million for the year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.56 for the quarter, $0.03 higher than the guidance we provided earlier this month, as final gross margin was stronger than expected.","We opened 12 new stores this year, bringing our current store count to 1,158, our gross square footage to 100.3 million square feet and our selling square footage to 83.7 million square feet. We expect to open 5 new stores this spring, including one relocated store. We also plan to permanently close 2 stores and temporarily close one store for a complete rebuild. We expect to open another 4 stores in the fall, including the rebuilt store. So for 2014, we'll have a net increase of 5 stores.","We remodeled 30 stores in 2013 and expect to remodel approximately 35 stores in 2014. We ended the quarter with $971 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of more than $400 million over a year in 2012. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in 2013, almost 3x the level generated in 2012.","Our capital expenditures were $643 million for 2013, $142 million lower than 2012. The decrease reflects multiple changes in our capital expenditures, including fewer remodels in new stores and lower E-Commerce fulfillment center spending, partially offset by higher IT spending. We expect capital expenditures in 2014 to be approximately $725 million.","Our inventory -- our January inventory balance was $3.9 billion, a 3% increase over January 2013. On a per-store basis, inventory at cost increased 1%. The increase is primarily due to our renewed focus on national brands, which have a higher cost than our private and exclusive brands. Kevin will talk more about inventory management in a few minutes.","AP as a percent of inventory was 35.2%, 30 basis points higher than last year. The increase reflects lower markdowns and better payment terms, partially offset by slower inventory turn.","Weighted average diluted shares were $215 million for the quarter. We repurchased 4.6 million shares during the quarter and 15.4 million shares for the year. To reduce some confusion, we are now separately presenting our share repurchases and shares withheld on restricted stock vesting separately in our statement of cash flow.","On February 26, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.39 per share, an increase of 11% over our previous dividend. The dividend is payable March 26 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 12.","I'll now turn over to Kevin who will provide additional insights on our results.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks, Wes. As Wes mentioned, our fourth quarter comps were down 2% on an unshifted basis and down 0.4% on a shifted basis. We're very pleased with the results in the November and December holiday season. By extending our hours on Thanksgiving, we were able to be the first stop for our customers and she responded well, driving significantly higher sales on the Black Friday weekend.","We set record levels of both transactions and sales, both in stores and online, on individual days several times over the holiday period. Sales for the combined November and December period were well above plan. This momentum did not carry into January as lower levels of clearance inventory resulted in sales which were significantly lower than our expectations.","Earlier this year, we completed our E-Commerce re-platform. The re-platform provided the backbone to support current and future omni-channel initiatives. From a customer-facing perspective, the re-platform provided an improved checkout experience and effectively handled the incremental holiday traffic.","E-Commerce sales increased 16% for the quarter. The customer responded very well to our offerings, and we posted strong results during 2 of the most important weeks of the year at Thanksgiving. For the year, E-Commerce sales totaled $1.7 billion. Our E-Commerce sales have now almost doubled since 2011 and have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of almost 40% over the last 5 years.","On a regional basis, the Southeast, West and South Central regions reported the strongest counts for the quarter, while the more weather-sensitive regions, the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, underperformed the company average.","Looking at our results by line of business, apparel categories outperformed non-apparel categories. Men's reported the highest comp on strength and outerwear and active. Women's also outperformed the company on strong outerwear and active sales as well. Children's apparel was consistent with the company average.","Toys was slightly positive after posting a 25% increase in the fourth quarter of the year before. In home business, the customer responded well to our new premium electronics offerings, which included Beats headphones and speakers and LG televisions. In accessories, strong results in our bath and beauty categories as a result of our beauty remodel program and the new brand launches were offset by lower jewelry sales. And finally, in footwear, footwear saw strength in both juniors and active.","Our renewed emphasis on national brands continues to generate positive results. In recent years, we introduced many successful new private and exclusive brands, Jennifer Lopez, Mark Anthony and Rock & Republic as examples. We continue to aggressively support these brands, but believe it's important to rebalance our product offering between our quality Only-at-Kohl's Brands and our iconic national brands to drive maximum customer traffic and to maximize sales. During the fall season, national brands consistently outperformed the company total.","On the inventory side, we're very pleased with our efforts to bring down our inventory levels in 2013. We decreased our fall receipts significantly in order to ensure we ended the season clean. On a unit basis, our inventory per store, excluding E-Commerce, is down 4%, with our clearance units per store down 15% from last year. National brands are flat on a unit-per-store basis, while private brands are down 7% and exclusive brands are down 10%.","Moving over to marketing. During the holiday season, we focused on delivering strong value, while finding new, exciting and more disruptive ways to reach our customers in the channels they use most. From powerful broadcast integrations to exciting new product offerings in store and online, our efforts resonated.","This spring, we're building on that positive momentum with Wink of Pink, an omni-channel campaign that leverages the trend color of the season to tell a compelling story from a board assortment of merchandise to meaningful, new national initiatives that build on our commitment to women's health.","We expanded our loyalty program to California and the Pittsburgh market in the third quarter of 2013 and plan to roll to additional markets. After that spring rollout, the program will be available in approximately 30% of our stores. We continue to be very pleased with the sales lifts that we are seeing in our current loyalty markets, and we now expect to have loyalty rolled out to all markets in the company by the end of the fiscal year.","In closing, as we look forward to 2014, we do so with a renewed focus on connecting with our customers and providing their families with the amazing product, easy experience and incredible savings that they expect from Kohl's. This year, we'll add several new brands to our portfolio.","In the spring, we'll combine the magic of Disney, one of the most recognizable brands in the world, with our highly successful Jumping Beans brand. In only 5 years, the Jumping Beans brand has become our fourth largest brand with annual sales in excess of $600 million.","We'll also launch the next DesigNation designer, Peter Som. We'll roll out 2 new brands in the fall, IZOD and Juicy Couture. The IZOD rollout will be one of the largest menswear rollouts in our history. The Juicy Couture brand will be part of our efforts to capture more of the athleisure market.","We also will continue to strengthen our current mega brands. In 2013, Croft & Barrow, SONOMA and Apt. 9 reported a combined $3.7 billion in sales, almost 3\/4 of all Kohl's consumers purchase one or more of these brands last year. We continue to see good results from our national brands as investments in inventory and in-store presentation and marketing led to their outperformance in the fall season.","Our renovated beauty department brings an exciting new shopping environment to customers in approximately 280 stores. Early sales results continue to be very promising, with increases in beauty sales of 20% to 30%, and we expect to roll out an additional 200-plus stores this year. We continue to experiment with different in-store environments for beauty in order to maximize our return on investment. With these renovations, international beauty and fragrance brands that we launched this September, we believe Kohl's is becoming top-of-mind might as our customer chooses where to shop for their beauty products.","We're making significant investments to create an exciting omni-channel experience for the customer, whether she's shopping in one of our stores, from her phone or from her laptop, we're creating a consistent experience to ensure she can connect with us wherever and however she wishes.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Wes to provide our annual guidance.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thanks, Kevin. For the fiscal year, our guidance is as follows: Comparable sales, flat to up 2%; total sales, up 50 basis points to 2.5%; gross margin improvement of 10 to 30 basis points; SG&A expense dollars increase 1.5% to 2.5%; depreciation expense of $950 million; interest expense of $342 million; tax rate of 38%; and share repurchases of $1 billion and estimated average diluted shares of 204 million shares. This results in earnings per diluted share of $4.05 to $4.45 for fiscal 2014.","And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Obviously, November, December, I'd love to talk a little bit more about that. In terms of the loyalty program and some of the initiatives you said, could you give us a little bit more color as to -- maybe just isolating November, December, how that new loyalty program performed relative to balance of chain or some sort of control group? And just one other big picture question for you, Kevin, if you will. On mobile, for 2014, I would imagine mobile continues to be the significant source of additional growth for your E-Commerce business. Are there any sort of key initiatives we should be looking for in '14 as it relates to mobile?","Wesley S. McDonald","I'll take the loyalty one, and Kevin can take the mobile one. Loyalty, we've just been seeing relatively consistent results. I'd say the lifts, depending on market, have ranged from 1.5% roughly on the low end to 3% on the higher end. Interestingly, our biggest lift has come in Pittsburgh, which is our highest credit penetration market in the tests so far, so that's very encouraging. In some of the markets that we're rolling out in the spring, we're going to roll it out to additional high-credit penetration markets to see if we can replicate that lift. But we're very encouraged with the loyalty program thus far. We're making some tweaks to it in terms of making it more than just about encouraging transactions at Kohl's to make a more emotional connection. And Michelle has been working on that quite feverishly over the last few months, and that'll be something that will be integrated in the loyalty program as we roll it out by the end of the year.","Kevin Mansell","Neely, on the mobile side, the largest percentage of our total investments in CapEx for this year are in technology. And within the technology investment, the largest percent by far is in omni-channel and personalization initiatives that we're launching this year. There's a whole bunch of mobile-enabled customer experiences that we plan to begin to roll out. They include things like the next chapter of loyalty, an effort to create a new tablet-centric site, enhancing our mobile wallet experience and then developing and launching a whole series of in-store experiences around location-based marketing, personalized offers and more product information. So we're highly focused on it. Obviously, mobile is driving visits and it's important that we have best-in-class mobile experience.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Drbul from Nomura.","Robert Scott Drbul - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I guess, the first question is, on the mix versus the gross margin, can you just give us updated thoughts around how you see this playing throughout 2014 around some of the mix shift with the national brands and gross margin implications -- the current thinking on that?","Wesley S. McDonald","Sure. First of all, national brands increased in penetration in the fall season, both in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So we're very happy to see that take hold. I reran the numbers yesterday, so it's a good question. If 100 basis points goes up in national brands in terms of penetration, if it comes out entirely of our private brands, which we would not expect, we would expect it to be more likely from the exclusive brands, it would be 7 basis points of headwind. If it came out of entirely of our exclusive brands, it would be 4 basis points of headwind. The shifts were not going to be dramatic on an annual basis from our penetration in national brands. We're certainly going to pick up quite a bit in 2014 in the back half when we roll out IZOD. But I don't think there's going to be any gross margin pressure at all from any shift in terms of moving more to national brands. It'll be offset by the fact that we're going to try to improve our gross margin through inventory management in all 3 types of our brands.","Robert Scott Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And on the fall brands, the Juicy line, is that a line that the men's piece will be a big portion of? And Wes, would you be expecting to use your employee discount on a lot of the Juicy products?","Wesley S. McDonald","No, I think it's pretty much just going to be on the women's side of the business. But it is athleisure, so who knows.","Operator","Your next question comes from Oliver Chen from Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Regarding your gross margin outlook, what are the main drivers for the nice look forward to the upside there? And also, as we look at the comp going forward and you engage in the national brand and beauty side, what are the main enthusiastic drivers in terms of what will support the comp in terms of unit versus transaction and traffic?","Kevin Mansell","This is Kevin, Oliver. On the margin, I think the way you want to think about the margin is, as Wes said, the move to more aggressively support our national brands is really sort of neutral. I don't think we expect really any significant change in our margin performance because of that. We're working, as you can tell, really hard on managing our inventories more effectively. So I think the tailwind that we see on margin would be the continued execution of our inventory management strategies, which would lead to improved sell-through, lower clearance levels and therefore, better merchandise margins. The headwind that, of course, we're facing is the impact of the growth of online because our online business does operate at lower merchandise margins, primarily due to merchandise mix, more than anything else. So the improvement in our merchandise margins and brick-and-mortar is obviously more substantial than the overall improvement we're guiding to because of the headwind from the other side. On the comp performance, there's a series of initiatives that we think we're really -- have been talking about probably now for the last 2 quarters that we think are going to drive sales. National brands is obviously one of them. Our recommitment to that is important to get the customer more engaged. Our loyalty program is working. It's being expanded, and we fully expect to have it completely rolled out by the end of the year, but more importantly, a more comprehensive program that would enable us to engage on more things other than just a better transaction for the customer -- a lower-price transaction. Beauty is working, as we said. Comp increases in beauty in the beauty stores compared to the non-beauty stores are anywhere between 20% and 30%. New brands. We've been, in the last couple of years, efficient on new brand introductions. You heard about a whole bunch of new brand introductions beginning this spring and then more aggressively in the fall. All of those things, I think, are really positive from the sales side. I don't know if I missed anything, Wes.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean, I think the biggest thing that's going to drive comp, we have to get transactions per store moving in a better direction. The average transaction value that was up this quarter, we fully expected given our performance last year, especially on clearance in January. So it was no -- we knew AUR was going to be up pretty significantly this quarter, but that's not going to be an ongoing thing. And for -- in order for us to drive comps better than what we've been running the last few years, we've got to get transactions per store, more visits per store moving in the right direction.","Operator","Your next question is from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","[indiscernible] comp at the higher end of the range for this year, what would be the underlying traffic and ticket components as we think about it? Should we think about the year as second-half loaded? And any comments on February so far?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes. I mean, I think we're obviously thinking that comp's going to come mostly from traffic. I can't tell you if it's going to be 1 and 1 or traffic's up 2%, ticket's flat. I'm hoping that we get a slight ticket benefit just from better management of our inventory. So AUR's going to be up slightly, not to the extent that it was in the third quarter. Definitely, with the new brands coming in the back half with IZOD and Juicy, we would expect fall to be a little bit better than spring. And in terms of February, our business hasn't been any different than everybody else that's reported already. It was pretty slow in the beginning of February and it's picked up recently.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the marketing front, can you just -- can you talk to some of the things that Michelle is working on and what we should look for as the year progresses on that front?","Kevin Mansell","Yes. I mean, we test on a few of them frankly during the course of the call. If I was prioritizing them, I would say #1 priority that Michelle has been focused on is to evaluate our current loyalty program and create a more improved platform to go forward with. And so I think she's happy about the fact that she has something to work with, but she also knows that it could -- it needs to be enhanced substantially for it to be most effective. So we're getting lifts. So that's really encouraging, just the fact that we're getting lifts. We're definitely highly focused on identifying new customers. So there's a whole series of initiatives that Michelle is focused on, from the way we deliver our marketing, literally in our print and in our broadcast to the loyalty initiatives and other initiatives that she's working on, and it's highly targeted towards expanding our reach. So as I said, our #1 priority is to identify ways for us to broaden the reach, to improve transactions. Loyalty is probably, right now, the #1 way we're going to get there, but there are a whole series of other ideas that she's working on. And we've had some success; she had some great success in a few instances in the fourth quarter, particularly around the Thanksgiving Day period and we benefited greatly from it. As you saw, our November, December sales were almost up 1% comp so we had some great success.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Wes, if you can just go back and talk about some of the hurdles in the fourth quarter with shipping and just maybe kind of outline to us how that -- you plan to improve upon that? For this upcoming year, any investments that need to be made on the shipping side?","Wesley S. McDonald","Sure. Well, I think the issue, it really comes in to 2 different buckets. I guess, the first thing I'd say is our peak, I think, is a little bit different than other retailers. The week of Thanksgiving, we get 10x our average volume. So that creates a pretty big spike, and we planned for that backlog. We just didn't execute in all of our distribution centers. We did a really good job in one of them. On the West Coast, we did -- we were affected by weather in our Dallas DC as other people were in that area. But we have to solve the throughput problem. So in order to that, a couple of different things we're doing. We're taking our ship from store -- number of stores up to at least 500 for this year, that will help significantly. We're also moving more units to our regional distribution centers. That's our brick-and-mortar. They're going to handle the more bulky stuff that has to do ship alone anyway. So those are 2 things we're focusing on. We're also looking at a bulk, another bulk distribution center, whether we run it temporarily or we use a third-party service provider to do it. So again, alleviate that peak demand. We're also really working on practicing peak everyday in the off season where we're trying to drive as many units as we can on a daily basis out and getting as many units out in one day as we possibly can. The shipping costs, that was really -- so that was really all about expense. The shipping costs really just occurred as we had to use more expensive units or methods of shipping with FedEx and UPS as we got closer to Christmas. I don't think we were alone at that. I think we are all going to have to, in retail, rethink the cutoff dates because there's only so much capacity in the pipeline that FedEx and UPS can provide. And I think everybody read about some of the issues they have on the shipping side with just meeting the demand that's out there. So we all have to be -- in a business -- more realistic as to what we can get delivered those last few days before Christmas.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just on the balance sheet. I know this past fall, you went to the markets and got some debt. Is there any expectation to lever up this year in order to complete the $1 billion in buyback?","Wesley S. McDonald","No. I mean, the function of really completing the $1 billion in buyback this year, we were light. I have to put in a 10b5-1 plan the third week of November, and it just runs automatically. And the way that we built the grid, it wasn't able to complete what we thought given the movement of the stock price. No, I don't expect to go to the markets. We ended the year with almost $1 billion in cash. We're going to generate another $1 billion in free cash flow next year, I believe, as well. So I think we'll use the free cash flow to buy back the shares and then take the cash balance down a little bit towards the end of the year. We don't need to necessarily have $1 billion at the end of the year. I think we've been targeting somewhere around $500 million or $600 million. So no need to go to the markets in 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Heather N. Balsky - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Heather Balsky on for Lorraine. I was hoping you could just talk about your outlook on inventory over the course of the year and also for the long term. In addition, address some of your plans to better manage inventory during the year.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes. I mean, I think our goal, really, over the next 3 years, we've been pretty consistent with this, is to try to take inventory down roughly 5%, mid-single digits on an annual basis. So we're a little high now due to the mix of the business. We'll work through that, and we'll be more aggressive as we move through the year. I would expect, at the end of the year, if we're talking a year from now, we should be -- our inventory should be down somewhere, x E-Comm, mid-single digits.","Heather N. Balsky - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. And can you also just talk about your strategies in terms of pickup from store and how you're thinking about that for this year?","Wesley S. McDonald","Sure. We're -- from ship from store I mentioned earlier, we're doing about 500 stores. Pick up from store, we're doing tests in 2 significant markets. What we would expect to do is read those tests, and we'll have the ability to do it in more markets, just this question of reading the test. One of the things we want to make share we can do is deliver, obviously, on the promise to the customer on the pickup and make sure that they can identify -- our store associates can identify the items in the store and pick them quickly. And we just have to figure out, as we test that, whether that's 1 hour, that's 4 hours, whatever the right level is, we want to make sure we have that figured out before we roll it out to more than just those few markets.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","If you -- can we talk a little bit about the E-Comm? I think you said 16% growth in the quarter. Was that right, Wes?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then so obviously, there was some fulfillment issues in those. Just want to think about how that trend should stretch into early 2014, both on the top line -- is that where -- where you think the throughput issues are contained in the quarter? And just due to capacity or should we think about a more muted growth rate than we saw in the early part of last year?","Wesley S. McDonald","No, I think the throughput issues are really a 2-week issue. So we won't have any throughput issues, for sure. I think we need to regain some trust from the customer and we're working on that. We disappointed some people and we've tried to make them whole the best that we can. But we won't be limited in terms of throughput any time in the first 3 quarters. It's really about getting them to the site. Kevin talked about mobile. One of the things that we worked on last year, as you guys all know, was our re-platform. We did not put a lot of effort into enhancements on our tablet app and our smartphone apps because we were focused on doing the re-platform. You'll see a lot more change on both tablet and smartphone this year, which is going to help our conversion rate. Desktops have a better -- higher conversion rate than tablets, which have a higher conversion rate than smartphones. With a lot of the traffic moving to mobile, we have to develop a much better app for both tablet and smartphones in order to drive the conversion rate.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, just bigger picture and longer term, as you think about so much of the world shifting to E-Commerce and online and certainly, we get a lot of questions about whether the consumer had a tipping point with how they are going to conduct their holiday shopping going forward. When you guys think about the store portfolio at 1,100 stores, is that still the right number of stores for you guys long term?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes. I mean, I -- we talked about -- we're closing a couple of stores whose leases came up. I think you'll see that more in the future. We have a watchlist of stores that are negative cash flow; there are about 5 to 10 that we look at on an annual basis. A lot of those have improved over the last year, so -- and it's not significantly cash flow negative. What I think we need to do a better job of is utilizing those stores as multipurpose assets, if you will. Ship from store is certainly going to be used in more and more stores. I'm not sure if it needs to be in every store. There's some very high-volume stores that we have where they're probably busy enough servicing the customer in those stores to worry about shipping from the store. But at some point, buy online, pick up in store is going to be everywhere. And that's going to be, I think, a big help because it drives traffic to the store. And as I've read through some of the notes from our other competitors, they're seeing store visits and store shopping from those pickups as well. So I think we just have to do a better job of making our stores multipurpose.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And finally, as you think about the CapEx for the year, is there -- and maybe some of the planned spending in stores and the investment that you guys do in the stores? Is that -- can you -- is that a composition of what you think you'll be spending on this year in the stores? How is it different from some prior years or what are the priorities in store here?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, the majority really is -- or not the majority, but we're spending about $275 million in IT. That's actually a little bit less than this year, but we don't have the re-platform. I think a lot of what you'll see in store is more about merchandise presentation. So obviously, with the IZOD and Juicy rollouts, you're going to have some pretty impactful strike points in the stores as well. We've put in the infrastructure to do ship from store and to buy online, pick up in store in those couple of markets I talked about. We're also doing RFID and in certain merchandise categories in most of our stores now. Those are the -- and then obviously, beauty, we're rolling out to over 200 stores. I think it's 214. We are testing in beauty, I think we mentioned it in the script, a sort of in-between concept. We have a full shop and then a relatively inexpensive retrofit. What we've seen so far is in our high-volume stores, the full shops are doing very well. In our lower-volume stores, what we need to do is put more of those less expensive retrofits. What we're trying to figure out from an investment perspective is, in the middle-volume stores, what's the best way to treat beauty. So we have developed a prototype that's kind of in between in terms of cost, and we're going to be testing that as part of the 214 stores. And that should give us a good read as to how quickly we can roll out beyond this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Charles Grom from Sterne Agee.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just on the omni questions, at what point will your inventory systems be able to speak to one another so you can essentially do all that, including site to store to door?","Wesley S. McDonald","They do today.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","They do today, okay. So at some point in the next couple of years, you should be able to do the whole platform -- site to store to door, pick up store...","Kevin Mansell","Well, I think our -- I mean, the truth is, Chuck, that we can do that right now, and we have the capability of doing buy online, pick up in store and ship from store now. What we're feeling our way through is how many stores do we want to use ship from store on that would give us the highest level of productivity because, as Wes said, high-volume stores are probably not the stores we're going to use for that. We'll use stores that are in the more middle of the pack or lower end of the pack of stores to ship from store because they're geographically across the whole country anyway, and they'll make those stores a lot more productive, we believe; at least in the initial test, that's what we're finding. And then on buy online, pick up in store, that's just how fast we're going to move on it. And we're going to launch it and we're going do it in major markets, and we can roll it out as aggressively as we want based on what we learn in the findings.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the fourth quarter, the shipping and -- the higher shipping costs and the higher fulfillment costs, any sense of magnitude that you like to share with us for how much that cost you guys?","Kevin Mansell","No. I mean, it's hard to -- there's so many elements to that because if you start to go down that road a little bit, you also get into, well, how much did it impact the sales. So if people were dissatisfied, did they not come back later in December and buy. It's a significant number. I mean, we had incredible success in the 2-week period, of the week before Thanksgiving and the week after Thanksgiving. And at the end of the day, we weren't able to deliver the traditional customer service that we would expect, to those customers online in terms of shipping it. And then we felt the aftereffect of that between then and the Christmas Day.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes. I mean, I would expect to be more productive in 2014 in the fulfillment center. So hopefully, we'll do better on the SG&A line. I couldn't tell you right now on the shipping cost part just because we're going to have to ship things more expensively to meet the peak demand. That's one of the things we learned last year. And I do think that the capacity that the FedExs and UPSs of the world that they won't -- they're going to have -- they only have a fixed capacity. So it's going to move back, I think, in terms of what they're willing to promise all of us as shippers that they can deliver in time for Christmas, so...","Kevin Mansell","Again, we're back to why ship from store is really important [indiscernible]","Wesley S. McDonald","And pickup.","Kevin Mansell","[indiscernible] Buy online, pick up in store and why that's so important.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Exactly, right. Okay. And then on that AUR increase, is that mainly a function of the -- down 2.4% from a year ago or was it because of the increase in penetration in national brands? Or was it some cost inflation?","Wesley S. McDonald","I'd say it was more about the January clearance. If I look at the AUR through November, December, it was up a little. But not to the -- it was significantly up double digits in January.","Kevin Mansell","Yes, it's all -- it's just about the mix. We had so much lower level of clearance.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then just on the comp for the full year, is there any shifts in between quarters, marketing events? So just -- as we kind of start to put the model out by quarter, is there anything we should think about?","Wesley S. McDonald","No, except for the Easter shift, we're almost back to normal.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, the only thing, as Wes mentioned, I think the earlier question or maybe in the call, the weight of our new initiatives, as you heard in the call, have a tendency to be -- beginning more in the second quarter and accelerating into the third quarter. So whatever implication that would have on our expectation, that would move it, I would say.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then just on that February comment you made earlier, I mean, have you guys taken a look at your good weather markets versus your bad weather markets? Do you think that slowdown in the front half was mainly a weather issue? Or do you feel like that the consumer is under a little more duress lately?","Kevin Mansell","I think that -- I mean, I think the consumer's definitely under duress, no question about that. When we look at the business, in both January and February, frankly, our West Coast business, which has had good weather, particularly for spring selling, has performed really well, I think, Wes, consistently very well. So that gives us a lot of optimism relative to the product offering and availability of selling spring once there's more reasonable weather in particularly the Midwest and Northeast.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, it's minus 3 this morning, Chuck, out here, so Kevin and I are not updating our polos yet.","Operator","Your next question is from Liz Dunn from Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I was -- wanted to circle back on the loyalty program and just sort of understand what kind of a penetration are you achieving? And does it vary in markets like Texas or -- versus Pittsburgh, where you might have a different penetration of the card? And then are any of the things that you're learning about loyalty impacting some of the card benefits? And then finally, what's the -- what are you doing for marketing in terms of increase in dollars for 2014? I would imagine that's an area you continue to kind of distort spending.","Kevin Mansell","On the loyalty thing, the penetration, frankly, is pretty consistent across the whole country. And to be totally honest with you, that's probably a little bit -- has been a bit of a surprise to us because we had some expectation that markets which had really high credit penetration might not be as successful on loyalty, because there were just so many existing credit card customers that the opportunity to attract new customers that are non-Kohl's card customers might be less. That's actually not proving out to be the fact. And in fact, one of the highest credit card penetration markets we have is the Pittsburgh market in the whole country. And we chose that market as one of the test markets just to see the impact of loyalty in that market, and that has been an incredibly successful loyalty market. It actually might be the most successful loyalty market that we have. So we're -- that probably fuels a lot of optimism about the fact that loyalty is actually not in essentially any of our highly penetrated credit regions. So it's not in the Northeast, it's essentially mostly not in the Mid-Atlantic or the Midwest to any significant amount. So that's a big positive as we see it. The amount of new customers, so that's outside of the current credit card customers who might also sign up for loyalty, I mean, I think they're running pretty close to 50%, I think, right, Wes? I mean, about half of the -- if we have x number of loyalty customers in a test store, a little more than the cap [ph] of...","Wesley S. McDonald","A little higher than non-credit, yes.","Kevin Mansell","Are non-credit. So that's really exciting. That was always the big objective is get these new customers engaged more effectively through loyalty. There are really are no impact to the card benefits. The card customers get everything they always got. They just get a little more. And as I said, I think Michelle's excitement is focused around the delivery of loyalty, what does loyalty look like, how does it get engaged online, what are the benefits that are outside of just the transactional benefit of maybe getting an additional $1 back on a purchase. And I think she's pretty excited about some of the ideas that are being generated. There is a new level of loyalty marketing that is going to be launched this year -- completing a new campaign. It looks totally different. The communication is totally different from what we've done, but it's built fundamentally on the learnings that we had during the course of the test. So as you can hear, I'm very optimistic about loyalty. And I think every day that goes by, I get more confident about the possibility in loyalty. On the marketing side, we're essentially pretty much holding our marketing for the year overall. But obviously, loyalty is getting a pretty big increase. So some of that money comes out of more traditional marketing that hasn't been as effective for us.","Operator","Your next question is from Dan Binder from Jefferies Company.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just following up on this discussion of loyalty. I'm curious, what percentage of the transactions in these test markets are -- what percentage of sales are with loyalty cards? And then I think with the credit card, there is some sort of profit-sharing relationship with the bank. And I'm just curious, when you get a credit card customer that signs up for the loyalty card, are they doing anything in terms of picking and choosing events and how to use the card that would cause the economics of the credit card to erode?","Kevin Mansell","No. Wes can add some value on the credit card piece. On the percent of business, I think we're just not at a point we want to share that because we'd send you down a path that might turn out to not be true when we expand it because we're essentially only in roughly 25% of the stores. So we don't have a big enough base to speak confidently about that. And secondly, as I said, loyalty is going to look very different going forward in terms of the customer face of it. And so that could very well change what we're experiencing. We're not thinking it's going to be negative. We're thinking it's going to be an accelerant, for sure. Generally, our credit card partner, Capital One, has been our partner on loyalty. They're engaged on this issue. We've made them a partner every step of the way, and we've actually accelerated their engagement. So they understand that loyalty is not a threat at all to the card business that we have to them. It has nothing to do with the profit-sharing arrangements. So that's...","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, we haven't seen any change in behavior where people would be using their bank card more often. It's a good question, Dan. It's one of the things I was a little concerned about in the beginning. But we have enough data now that I'm not real worried about that anymore. What we've seen is they've continued to use the credit card whether or not it's a credit event or not.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. My second question is on brands. You obviously had a few that you've already announced and are planning to roll out this year. I'm just curious from a pipeline perspective, is -- I'm assuming you're not stopping there. Is there any other potential brands you could announce this year, even if you don't want to be specific today?","Kevin Mansell","We're definitely pushing hard on this topic. The way I would characterize it -- I think over the course of the next few months, we're going to probably be sharing a little bit longer-term view of what we see as the sort of accelerants to our business and trying to provide more detail about the implications on that on our future -- next 2, 3 years business. Brands are an important element of that, and they're particularly important as we'll share with you in certain segments of our business where we think we can take a really leadership position. So I don't want to get ahead of myself on that, but there are certain areas in the store and certain areas of customer interest that we're going to heavily focus on, and that, to some extent, will drive the areas that we're most interested in accelerating our brand penetration. An easy example would be active and wellness. Active is an area that we're highly penetrated in, both in apparel and footwear, and we know we have a huge opportunity to expand that platform into other categories and also to increase what we're doing in active in the existing world. And those would be, for instance, one of the things we'd probably be talking to you about, and that would therefore, imply really be focused on new brand initiatives in that world.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then just the final thing was on expenses. You've done a remarkable job managing in the last few years, and I think you had some consultants helping you get some costs out of the back non-customer-facing parts of the cost structure. I'm just kind of curious if you can give us an update on where you are in that process and what you're doing this year to still manage that pretty tightly.","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, we've -- when we've uncovered them, we've obviously put them in the budgets and taken the work out where appropriate. I would say that we've built it into our guidance. So if you do the math, we expect to leverage at a 2% comp, that's what we guided to. The remaining initiatives from that, lie mostly in IT and credit and they're related to finishing some IT work on some projects that we have planned for this year. So we have a lot built into the next -- for this year. We have a little built in for '15, and then we'll have to relook at it because we have to continue to improve.","Operator","And then your next question is from Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just want to follow-up again on the marketing side. Can you just talk a bit more about the response to some of the changes on that front with the higher profile ad buys and focus on broadcast and social media? And then it sounds like the budget is saying relatively consistent. So maybe where are you pulling back with your greater emphasis on loyalty and these higher cost avenues?","Kevin Mansell","Well, we definitely have had some successes. Michelle likes to talk about those as green shoots, so things that she's been able to focus on in a very short period of time with her team and create change, and we've seen some really exciting results around that. Probably the one that's the easiest to understand that I'm sure you saw was our effort prior to the Thanksgiving event around the MAs and an effort with Jennifer Lopez, and that had a tremendous amount of impressions and a tremendous amount of excitement generated and it translated into traffic and it translated into sales. Obviously, she knows full well that those small steps have to now translate into bigger steps. We have an initiative underway right now. One of the color trends of the season is, for sure, pink. And there's an initiative that launched just at Presidents' Day and has been ongoing around that. I think those kinds of things you're going to see a lot more of, an awful lot about loyalty. Obviously, it's a 0-sum game, so we're planning on spending essentially anymore in marketing. And if we're going to fund loyalty and we're going to fund some of these big ideas, then there are other areas of funding that have occurred in the past that we've identified that haven't produced results. And Michelle is focused on those, and those are the areas that are going to be pulled back. Print is clearly one of those areas, for sure.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then following up on the beauty side, any data you can share on how the tests are impacting frequency of visits in those stores? And then any data you have on the costs associated with the further rollout?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, we've seen -- it's very early, so I don't want anybody to read a whole lot into this. We've seen low-single digit overall lifts in the stores, which is critical to the success of the program. So from that perspective, I think we're very pleased with what has been going on. In terms of investment, it really varies. I don't want to really get into specifics. It's -- at the low end, it's tens of thousands of dollars in investment; at the higher end, it's hundreds of thousands of dollars. And like I mentioned earlier, we're just trying to find the right mix in terms of looking at the sales volume because that's important. Obviously, a 1% lift in a store that does $12 million is a lot different than a 1% lift in a $24 million store. So that's something that we're going to work on and finalize this year. We'll have a really good plan to roll out the balance of the chain in '15 and beyond.","Operator","Your final question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","As you think about remodels, we've heard a lot about marketing and the loyalty program. Connecting it with the stores and the remodel program, how do you see the stores matching the marketing program and sending the message? What should we be looking for in the remodels this year that may have been different than last year?","Kevin Mansell","I think -- yes, Dana. I think one of the things we're looking at in remodels, we're going to continue to do a significant amount of total store remodels going forward. But more and more, we're highly focused on identifying new initiatives that would require capital that could make the store look different and also generate very specific returns, both in the business and in the overall store traffic. A good example of that is beauty. So as we looked at spending a fair amount of money on the beauty initiative, because it's a significant capital expense both last year and this year, we were looking at the results of that and saying that, \"Hey, it would be better for us to roll out beauty to the whole company quickly in various formats,\" depending upon what gives us the best return than it might be to remodel completely 20 other stores because we're looking at the lifts and the lifts are good. Loyalty, the implications of loyalty in the in-store environment would be another thing. Moving customer service to the front of our stores, from where it was in the back, in some cases, that might be another thing. New brand initiatives require capital, and we're saying that we're serious about new brand initiatives, particularly national brands like Disney, like IZOD, like the DesigNation, definitely like Juicy Couture. Those require capital -- significant capital investments. And we're seeing better results by accelerating those kinds of initiatives, again, than we're necessarily seeing from remodeling a whole store somewhere. So I just -- we're going to spend just as much money on investing in our existing infrastructure. Wes talked about some of the operational pieces like buy online and pick up in store and what that requires or ship from store and what that requires or mobile enhancement in-store and what that requires. We just believe it will be spent a little differently than maybe historically we've looked at investing in our store base.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, most things will touch every store instead of just a few.","Okay. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Wes McDonald, Chief Financial Officer of Kohl\u2019s Department Stores. Please go ahead, sir.","Wes McDonald","Thank you. Good morning. With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President. I will start today\u2019s call by walking through our operational results. Kevin then will provide more details on our sales and greatness agenda initiatives. I will conclude our remarks by providing our initial guidance for fiscal 2015 and then open up the call to your questions.","We are pleased with our fourth quarter results. Comp sales increased 3.7% for the quarter, our highest quarterly comp since the fourth quarter of 2010. All lines of business were positive and all regions were positive. Net income grew 10% and our earnings per share were $1.83, a 17% increase over last year. The comp reflects increases in both average transaction value and more importantly number of transactions. Average transaction value reflects a 2.8% increase in average unit retail, which was partially offset by a 1.1% decrease in units per transaction. This resulted in an average transaction value increase of 1.7%. Number of transactions increased 2% reflecting increases in both online orders and in-store customers.","Diving a little deeper by line of business for the quarter, children\u2019s, footwear and men\u2019s all reported mid to high single-digit increases. Active and fitness categories were strong in all lines of business, women\u2019s, men\u2019s, footwear and children\u2019s. Women\u2019s home and accessories also generated positive comps for the quarter, but underperformed the company average. As our omni-channel strategy continues to mature, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish between the store sale and an e-commerce sale. Because we no longer have a clear distinction between store sales and e-commerce sales, we are no longer separately reporting e-commerce sales.","For the quarter, comps were relatively consistent across all regions with results that range from positive 3% to 5%. Total sales increased 3.9% for the quarter and for the year were essentially flat at $19 billion. Comp sales decreased 30 basis points for the year. Our gross margin rate decreased 13 basis points for the quarter and 8 basis points for the year. Merchandise margin increased over both prior year periods, but was more than offset by an increase in the impact of shipping cost.","Our SG&A expenses were 2% higher than last year\u2019s fourth quarter and leveraged 29 basis points. Store expenses including payroll, fixed costs as rent and controllable costs such as utilities leveraged by 30 basis points. Lower corporate expenses were offset by higher marketing spend to support the loyalty launch and drive holiday sales, IT investments and slightly lower profitability in our credit card business. For the year SG&A expenses increased 1% and deleveraged 21 basis points. Leverage in our credit card business and store distribution operations were more than offset by deleverage in our other operations.","Depreciation expense decreased $3 million from both the prior year quarter and year. The decrease reflects lower depreciations on our stores as they mature which is largely offset by higher IT amortization. Net interest expense was $84 million this quarter and $340 million for the year. Interest on capital lease \u2013 capitalized leases decreased in both periods as the leases matured. For this year this favorability was more than offset by interest on the $300 million of debt that was issued in September 2013. Our income tax rate was 35.3% for the quarter and 35.7% for the year. Both periods reflect the benefits of favorable state tax audit settlements.","Net income was $369 million for the quarter and $867 million for the year. As I mentioned earlier diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $1.83 for the quarter, for the year diluted earnings per share were $4.24, consistent with the midpoint of the guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year. From a store and square footage perspective, we currently have 1,162 stores one fewer than the end of the third quarter. We ended the quarter with selling square footage of 83,758,000 square feet and gross square footage of 100,394,000 square feet. We generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow for the year and ended the year with $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents.","Capital expenditures were $682 million for 2014, $39 million higher than last year. The increase reflects higher corporate spending on IT and credit facilities, higher IT spending and lower remodel spending, 2014 spend was slightly lower than our original estimates due the timing of projects. Ending inventory and inventory per store decreased 2% from January 2014. Units per store were down slightly more, 3%. Our accounts payable as a percentage of inventory was 440 basis points higher than last year at 35.2 it was 39.6 this year. The increase is due to higher receipt volume and timing of payments to some of our vendors.","Weighted average diluted shares were 201 million for the quarter and 204 million for the year. We repurchased 12.3 million shares of our stock during the year including 2.1 million shares during the fourth quarter. We ended the year with 201 million shares of outstanding stock. On February 25, 2015, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share, an increase of 15% over last year. Since paying our first dividend in 2011, we have increased the dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 16%. The dividend is payable March 25 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 11.","I will now turn it over to Kevin who will provide us an update on key greatness agenda initiatives.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks Wes. As you know in early 2014, we introduced our new multiyear vision that we refer to as the greatness agenda. Over the last year our associates have fully embraced this new vision and it has become part of the Kohl\u2019s culture. In October we provided additional details regarding the greatness agenda and introduced our senior leadership team in our first investor conference in 7 years. We talked about measuring our progress in terms of sales, associate engagement and customer engagement. You have just heard our progress on sales. In order to continue to increase our associate engagement, we just assembled nearly 3,000 of our leaders from across the country for a multi-day conference where we worked together to strengthen our leadership skills and explored ways to bring the greatness agenda to life and to deliver on our 3-year plan. That conference was a significant investment in the development of our leaders, but one that we believe will pay off as we deliver on that 3-year plan.","As a reminder, the five pillars of our greatness agenda are amazing product, easy experience, personalized connections, incredible savings and winning teams. In amazing product, one of our strategies was to refocus on our national brands. That focus continues to pay dividends. The emphasis on national brands resulted in higher comps in our national brand portfolio than in our private and exclusive brands. For the year, penetration was evenly split between national brands and only at Kohl\u2019s brands, as national brands grew in penetration by 180 basis points.","Among the strongest performers by brand during the quarter were Nike, Levi\u2019s, Carter\u2019s, Fila Sport and Jumping Beans. Nike, our largest national brand reported a 24% increase in fourth quarter sales. The collaboration with Disney helped drive a 27% increase in Jumping Bean sales in the fourth quarter. Frozen was a big part of that growth and we look forward to more collaboration with Disney in 2015. Levi\u2019s, Carter\u2019s and our own Fila Sport all increased approximately 10%. During 2014, we added over 15 new brands such as IZOD, Juicy, Fitbit, Nespresso and Gaiam to name just a few. And just yesterday, we announced the launch of Bliss, a prestige skincare collection. This launch further establishes Kohl\u2019s as a go-to beauty destination. The Bliss partnership will offer signature skincare and body products beginning in March on Kohls.com and at over 500 stores and expanding to all stores by the end of 2015.","Under our easy experience pillar, beauty is the key part of driving sales. The Bliss announcement is just another step in creating industry leading beauty departments in all of our stores. Approximately, 500 of our stores currently have the new beauty format, but by next fall, that number will increase to about 900. In addition to adding new brands, we are creating a new environment that is both aspirational and approachable. We are also testing some different things in our 12 full store remodels this year as well as some ideas to drive sales in our in-aisle program, while presenting more cohesive seasonal themes and ideas.","In personalized connections, we have continued our investment in improving our platform, both in mobile and tablet and continue to develop our Kohl\u2019s wallet allowing for easy storage of all of our promotions and our Yes2You Rewards as well as Kohl\u2019s Cash. Our investment in improving our mobile platforms has resulted in increased conversion rates across all channels. Our efforts in personalization from a marketing standpoint produced approximately what we expected in 2014. And most importantly, we have data and learnings in order to improve our effectiveness in 2015. We have built 10 key behavioral segments and are focusing on our four largest customer opportunities in 2015. Our localization efforts are in the rollout phase and we expect them to have a lot more impact in 2015. As part of the localization efforts, we are optimizing mass-media to better serve our markets from the tab perspective allowing us to invest savings in other forms of media.","In incredible savings, for several quarters now you have heard us share our excitement and optimism about our Yes2You loyalty program. The program launched nationwide in early October and has far exceeded our expectations. To-date, we have approximately 25 million customers enrolled in the program, 20% more than our original 2014 goal. More than half of these customers do not have a Kohl\u2019s charge card. And enrollment in the program provides us with customer specific data that will further our personalization initiatives. Additionally, enrollment in the program drives traffic and incremental sales.","In closing, we have only just begun our journey in the greatness agenda. In this first year alone, we have already delivered in several areas, including creating an industry disrupting loyalty program under our incredible savings pillar and increasing our penetration in active and wellness as well as building a new beauty business under our amazing product pillar. We are also on target to reach our milestone goals in personalization and being world class in mobile under the personalized connections pillar. The fourth quarter results indicate the momentum created through these initiatives.","As we look ahead, the greatness agenda, its pillars and our values will be our consistent roadmap for the work we do everyday. We have made good early progress. We feel we can now move with greater speed as we continue to seek out more ways to innovate and to bring the greatness agenda to life.","Now, I want to turn it back to Wes to provide our initial guidance for fiscal 2015.","Wes McDonald","Thanks, Kevin. We expect earnings per diluted share of $4.40 to $4.60 for fiscal 2015. This guidance is based on total sales increases of 1.8% to 2.8% and comparable sales increases of 1.5% to 2.5%. We expect gross margin as a percent of sales to be flat to up 20 basis points for the year. Continued rollout of our beauty initiatives will create some margin pressure in the first quarter as we liquidate the old product to make way for the new product.","SG&A expenses are expected to increase 1.5% to 2.5% over 2014. We expect SG&A to increase more in the first quarter than in the balance of the year, roughly 4% to 5% in the first quarter versus roughly 0.75% to 1.75% for the balance of the year. There are a number of differences contributing to the higher first quarter expenses. First, based on the success of beauty, we will be rolling the beauty initiatives to roughly 450 stores compared to less than 100 stores in early 2014. As a reminder, 2014 installations were mostly in the fall season.","We will also have higher store expenses associated with the acceleration of rolling out buy online, pickup in store to all stores and expanding ship from store to all stores due to the success we saw with these initiatives last year. We will continue to invest in technology and capacity to further accelerate our improving omni-channel experience. Finally, we had several non-recurring items that helped last year and hurt this year in the first quarter. Our changes in how we market to our customer more efficiently start to take effect in the second quarter providing significant savings while increasing our reach for the balance of the year.","We expect depreciation expense to be $940 million and interest expense to be $335 million for the year. Our guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 37% and $1 billion in share repurchases at an average price of $70 per share. We expect capital expenditures of $800 million in 2015, approximately $120 million more than 2014. 2015 CapEx is expected to include $350 million for IT spending, $250 million for store strategies, including new stores, remodel, beauty and other easy-experience initiatives, and $200 million for base capital projects.","With that, we will be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Bob Drbul","Hi, good morning.","Wes McDonald","Good morning.","Bob Drbul","Wes, I just have a question for you, on the guide when you think about sort of the omni-channel guide and shipping as \u201814 heads into \u201815, how do you have that factored into your gross margin guidance?","Wes McDonald","Sure. Well, what we have tried to do, I think we talked a little bit about back in October, but over the next three years, we are trying to get back to where we were in the store gross margin, which is roughly a couple of hundred basis points around 38 and change. The margin hit from e-commerce mix in terms of higher percentage of home and a little higher percentage of national brands is worth about 10 to 15 basis points and then shipping cost on total gross margins probably worth about 20 to 25 basis points each year over the next three years. So, that\u2019s really how we built the guide. That\u2019s included in our flat to up 20 guidance for total company.","Bob Drbul","Okay. And then Kevin just had a couple questions for you. The first one is can you share with us Kohl\u2019s perspective on retailers voluntarily raising minimum wage throughout the U.S.?","Kevin Mansell","Sure Bob. First of all, we obviously don\u2019t operate in a vacuum, but we never have. We have a pretty robust and very successful system in place to assess the competitive market across the whole country. And fundamentally we pay what\u2019s necessary in each market to attract and retain the talent we need. Frankly, cost of living are not the same everywhere and either our wages. As an aside and I realize wages are getting some focus. While wages are really important, there are a lot of other factors driving peoples\u2019 decisions about where to work. The work environment, the way associates are treated, future opportunities for growth and advancement are just a few of many. And as we shared with you back in October at the investor conference, our store associates engagement is in the top percent of retailers. So we definitely intend to keep it there.","Bob Drbul","Got it, alright. And then Kevin, I just have \u2013 I have one more question for you, I think your first pillar is amazing product and I was in the stores recently checking out some of your footwear offerings and you seem to have a good offering on the wedge sandals and platform high heels and I just wondered if you think that the footwear business that you had success in the fourth quarter will continue into 2015?","Kevin Mansell","I had some anxiety when you were asking \u2013 getting ready to ask that question because I was thinking for sure I am going to get a question from Bob that I won\u2019t be able to answer. I will do my best. I mean footwear has been strong. Our casual footwear business has been strong, but frankly our active footwear business, athletic footwear has been much stronger and I would suspect that looking out into 2015 given the big focus we have as you know around active and wellness that athletic footwear is going to continue to outperform. And we are just putting so much energy and so much behind that initiative.","Wes McDonald","Thanks Bob.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","Hey, good morning guys and a nice quarter. From a share perspective how do you guys view your pricing perception today where do you think your core customers indexing with some of your department store peers in the off-price. And then really from a market share perspective just how you view the opportunities and particularly the pickup in traffic that you have seen any drivers that you think are really behind that?","Kevin Mansell","Sure, Matt, it\u2019s Kevin. I mean from a pricing perspective we sort of lump that under our incredible savings pillar. And historically and consistently and still today, that\u2019s a space in which we get really strong marks for consumers on that Kohl\u2019s ability to deliver great value is at the very top of retailers. Our opportunity I think is to broaden the reach. So much of our value equation has been driven through our proprietary credit card offering, and as you know Yes2You loyalty is really all about expanding that reach. And then really trying to deliver savings and therefore pricing perception strength at a very personalized level. So it\u2019s unique to each customer, so that each customer is kind of dealt with based on what\u2019s important to them.","On a market share basis, in the fourth quarter to be honest with you there were \u2013 there always are better businesses and businesses that are slower. In general, all of the businesses performed pretty well, they were all positive first of all as Wes indicated. Some outperformed, like men\u2019s or children\u2019s. Some underperformed the store average. I would say the business that we are probably most highly focused on really gaining more traction in is our women\u2019s apparel business. It has trailed over some period of time the company performance. We are starting to make headway. The gap between women\u2019s and the rest of the store is narrowing, but we are clearly not going to be happy to women\u2019s runs with or ahead of the store. So I would \u2013 if I picked one area, I would say it\u2019s women\u2019s apparel that we are focused on really try to gain more share.","Wes McDonald","Yes. I think one of the things, I forgot to mention in the scripted remarks is to Kevin\u2019s point about broadening our reach. The comp this quarter was driven by both credit and non-credit card customers. So our credit card customers were up sort of mid single-digit, but our non-credit card customers were up low single-digit. That\u2019s the first time that\u2019s probably happened, coincidentally \u2013 not coincidentally since the fourth quarter of 2010, back when we had the last really strong comp that we had. So we have to keep that going. It\u2019s got to be \u2013 we got to get flat to positive comps in the non-credit card business to be as successful as we would like to be. And the credit card guys should continue to outperform, but that was a good first step.","Matthew Boss","Great. And from a quarterly cadence, have you seen the top line and traffic momentum continue into February. And more so, I mean do you think we are seeing any impact from lower gas ad what\u2019s the best way to think about an earlier Easter this year?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean speaking about the quarter, obviously we don\u2019t comment on individual months\u2019 performance. But I think we have continued to get strength, particularly in the areas of the country that haven\u2019t been so affected by weather. I mean there have been some areas as you know that have been really impacted by weather. I don\u2019t think Easter, the timing of Easter has really got a major effect on our quarterly results. You kind of know I think Matt that our quarterly results have a tendency to be driven really by the other more important factors for us, which are how quickly weather works in our favor on seasonal apparel, how effective our individual marketing events. Particularly in this case, at this time of year our efforts around personalization, how are they working, how quickly these omni-channel efforts get traction. And then of course just product choices for sure, but beyond that there is probably not a lot to add. Wes?","Wes McDonald","No. I think you covered it.","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of luck, guys.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Charles Grom representing Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.","Renato Basanta","Good morning. This is actually Renato Basanta on the line for Chuck. Congrats on the nice quarter.","Kevin Mansell","Thank you.","Wes McDonald","Thanks.","Renato Basanta","So I guess first, I was just hoping you could have drilled down a little bit more on the Yes2You program in terms of what you are seeing from a traffic and frequency perspective, particularly how the typically slower January period was presumably affected by the program. And I guess related to that, maybe if you could just talk a little bit more about the progress in I guess improving engagement and fostering relationships with the 25 million members?","Kevin Mansell","Sure. I mean Wes and I can probably both add some color on that. I mean generally, Yes2You was \u2013 continued to be a positive in January. It was positive in December. It was a positive in January as well. As you know that program is really all about in the future being able to deliver more unique and personalized offers to customers and really kind of connecting with them on an engagement perspective. So it\u2019s being driven early on I would say and Wes can add color on the savings aspect of the program. It\u2019s a way for consumers to quickly, who are not Kohl\u2019s charge customers gain more ways to save and they are using that. So it was a plus in January for sure. And we see it as a big plus in the first quarter as well.","Wes McDonald","Yes. I mean, in January was \u2013 I mean we were up above three for the first 2 months combined. And January obviously was much better than that. We were up high single-digits. So a lot of that was finally lapsing clearance, the clearance that we had last January and then obviously the rewards program was a big part of that as well. I think one of the things that we are going to learn from both the combination of Yes2You rewards and personalization is to do a better job of onboarding new customers, probably not brand, brand new to Kohl\u2019s, but people that we don\u2019t know an awful lot about. We hadn\u2019t done a very good job of that in the past. We sort of pounded on the people who already liked us. But I think with personalization, our marketing folks have a really good strategy to get people who either sign up for rewards or sign up for a credit card or hopefully both onboard in the next 30 days to 60 days to get them back in for that second or hopefully third trip.","Renato Basanta","Okay, thanks. And then you guys have a done a nice job of bringing some new brands onboard, you have the Bliss launching soon, can you just talk a little bit about expectations for additional brands perhaps later this year? And maybe talk about the types of brands that kind of fit in Kohl\u2019s wheelhouse?","Kevin Mansell","I am working \u2013 I mean, we are obviously focused on continuing to expand the portfolio. There are certain parts of our business that are more important to do that than others probably beauty is clearly one of them as we expand the new beauty initiative. I don\u2019t know that I would pick out any particular area. We have done a great job in adding some newness into active. Active has been a really strength in the business. I doubt that we are unique in that, but it has particularly outperformed. But we have added some new brands, including Puma and including Gaiam, which in apparel launches in April I think of this year. So, I wouldn\u2019t call any particular area out. I think it\u2019s just a focus on in particular our existing national brands. And that\u2019s really where a lot of the lift is coming as we recommit to those in both our inventory and our stores and our marketing.","Wes McDonald","Yes. I mean, we have had Nike for an awful long time and they were up 24% in the fourth quarter. So, it\u2019s really maximizing the value of the powerful brands we already have and then bringing in newer brands to fill in the holes we have.","Renato Basanta","Alright, guys. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks, guys.","Wes McDonald","Hey, buddy.","Paul Lejuez","What can I do? Couple of quick ones. Credit card expectations, what do you expect in 2015 and how does that help or hurt you on the SG&A line? Loyalty customer, what percent are new to Kohl\u2019s as far as you know? And just last, what\u2019s your view on Target going free shipping at $25? Thanks.","Wes McDonald","Okay. Credit card profitability I think will be over last year. I am not sure we will leverage as a percent of sales. That really is going to depend on our top line sales, but we will have higher credit card income this year than we did last year. In terms of loyalty, I think it\u2019s 52% of the loyalty members are non-credit card holders.","Paul Lejuez","But are they new to Kohl\u2019s, Wes, or were they shopping Kohl\u2019s and just not a credit card customer?","Kevin Mansell","The actual percent that are \u201cnew\u201d would be a guess on our part, first of all, Paul Lejuez. First of all, it would be a guess to be honest. Well, we can \u2013 I don\u2019t have the number in my fingertips. I think Wes is actually looking through some papers right now to try to find it, but we will try to give you an assessment of what it is. There is a certain percentage that we feel are definitely new to Kohl\u2019s.","Paul Lejuez","Yes.","Kevin Mansell","So, we will definitely get back to you on that.","Wes McDonald","Yes, I can\u2019t find \u2013 the font is too small. I will get back to you on that. And then free shipping at $25, that\u2019s something that just I don\u2019t think will work for us long-term from a profitability perspective. I can\u2019t comment on Target\u2019s ability to make it work, but we are comfortable where we are at. We are trying to improve speed of delivery to customer. We are very excited about buy online, pickup in store and hope that can be a bigger share of our omni-channel business.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, in all truth on that one, Paul, I think that we have learned that we are much better off putting all of our focus around really delivering great customer service and that\u2019s why we are making some investments, as you heard Wes talk about earlier in the year that were probably not originally contemplated a year ago to accelerate, let\u2019s say, for instance ship from store. We never really planned to have it in every store, but it\u2019s been so successful. It\u2019s going to be in every store. Buy online, pickup in store, the original plan was we pilot it in the fourth quarter and then we think about a pace of acceleration over the course of the year, but we are kind of so excited about it and the meaning of it on our inventory effectiveness in our stores and delivering great service that we are accelerating that. So, I think there are just so many other areas that we are focused on in that seamless experience. And the reason is we have learned that\u2019s what drives behavior. That\u2019s what will drive traffic. So, launching a new tablet experience, now launching a new mobile experience, giving a great customer experience on the site and in delivery, providing Yes2You value to customers who haven\u2019t maybe considered Kohl\u2019s, those are things to me that are much more important than what trigger level you provide free shipping at.","Paul Lejuez","Yes. Yes, great. Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Binder","Good morning.","Kevin Mansell","Good morning.","Dan Binder","My question was on the loyalty program. You have got some areas that are now in their second year. I am just kind of curious after the first year of sign-ups what that growth in sign-ups looks like in the second year? Does it sort of flatten out or do you continue to get fairly robust growth there?","Kevin Mansell","Well, growth in \u2013 I mean, obviously growth in sign-ups once you have annualized slows down from a rate perspective, because you are up against a very significant launch and then annualizing a regular program. But we continue to sign up new customers in every store and market across the country. And as you said, some of those were in a pilot, that are now more than two years old I think, Wes?","Wes McDonald","Yes, I mean, I would expect us to get another 10 or 12 million people signed up this year. So, it would be at 35 to 37 at the end of the year. I know the marketing guys have a more stretched goal than that, but that seems like a reasonable assumption for us. And we have \u2013 to be honest we are testing a lot of different things to get lift in the second year, which we haven\u2019t rolled out very widely on.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, the other thing, Dan, is the thing that I think is unique to us is that we have a very particular experience with is we have been driving essentially our old loyalty program, which is our credit card program for over 20 years. And the problem with that program as you know is there gets to be a point where customers, while they love Kohl\u2019s, don\u2019t want to use private label credit card. And so Yes2You loyalty provides access to those customers, but importantly, sort of the behavior that we see, including in the sign-up process and then the comping the launch of it is very similar to the experience we have had over many, many years with our credit card, which is we are definitely going to lose some customers over time, but we are gaining way more than we are losing in these markets in which we had pilots that are now as I said over 2 years old. So, I feel like we have some experience here that is sort of unique and that we can draw \u2013 and we are drawing on it. I mean, Wes is drawing on it and our marketing team, in particular, Michelle\u2019s team is really drawing on it.","Dan Binder","And then just two other things, one, can you just breakdown in your comp assumptions the transaction and ticket growth? And then with regard to the tax rate, a lot of retailers have lower tax rates this fourth quarter because of the extension of the Work Opportunity Act. I am just curious as we think about the tax rate next year it\u2019s higher, I think rough math year-over-year it\u2019s a hit of about $0.10. Is there a possibility that tax rate comes back down again in the latter part of the year if that is extended?","Wes McDonald","On the tax rate, yes, there is certainly a possibility. We never build that in if it\u2019s not something that\u2019s absolutely known. I think our tax rates gone down for the last five years. So, I would say it\u2019s probably a conservative assumption, but it\u2019s the best that we know at this time. State settlements, you can\u2019t really predict and you can\u2019t really predict when legislation will take effect on that. I am sorry, Dan, what was the other question?","Dan Binder","The breakdown of your comp assumption?","Wes McDonald","Comp assumption. Yes. I mean, we are going to have at least flat traffic. I would suspect transaction value will be up a couple of percent. So, the ability for us to do better than a 2% comp will be probably predicated on what transactions per store are.","Dan Binder","Is that ticket affected by lower cotton prices impacting AUR this spring?","Wes McDonald","No. I think AUR is going to continue to be up just because of mix of business, national brands will continue to increase penetration in there, a little higher AUR than our private and exclusives. So, cotton benefits will come in the back half. They are somewhat mitigated by pretty high wage rate increases overseas and some other more technical stuff that our product development guys are telling me is going to cost more money in terms of dye and things like that. But \u2013 so I think there will be a modest benefit in the back half from a cost perspective, but mix will outweigh that. And hopefully we will continue to do better on inventory management. Kevin alluded to buy online, pick-up-in-store and ship-from-store. We are just trying to do a better job of inventory management overall. So if we can reduce the amount of clearance that should also help drive AUR too.","Dan Binder","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen. Please go ahead, sir.","Oliver Chen","Thanks a lot. Congrats on a great finish to a solid year. Regarding your inventories, they look under really great control. Just an industry topic about the slowdown, is that impacting your receipts or how you are thinking about planning. And also, Kevin, I just wanted to ask you and Wes a general question in terms of how you felt holiday went relative to your expectations, and if there \u2013 how would you prioritize any tweaks that you make to the greatness agenda as a result of the overall holiday performance?","Kevin Mansell","Sure. It\u2019s Kevin, Oliver. On the inventory and in particular I guess you are alluding to the ports slowdown and stoppage that impacted flow through the port. We are definitely affected like everybody is affected, no question about it. The way those things work, of course is we try to mitigate it through logistics strategies to push product to other access points, of course but certain categories or businesses typically get affected more. If I was looking at the ports slowdown in a list of things that can either be a headwind or tailwind, it\u2019s definitely been a headwind, for sure. It was a headwind in the fourth quarter. And it will be a headwind for a little while still, I would say. But if I put it in a priority of other things that actually create business change, some of the things that we have talked about like our ability to deliver amazing product, our ability to have more effective marketing through more utilization of personalization or loyalty, weather as a factor at any point in time, those things all outweigh this. Unfortunately, in certain categories they can be important and one I always allude to with Wes is sleepwear for instance in the fourth quarter is basically all imported and it was all relatively late. And as a result it impacted sales in sleepwear pretty dramatically.","Wes McDonald","Yes and will impact sleepwear margin in the first quarter.","Kevin Mansell","Yes. So you get these individual things, I would say.","Wes McDonald","I do think we are in a little better shape than some people as we have been bringing in about 50% of our imports come in the East Coast as the normal course of business and we have been doing that for the last 8 years and have very well developed relationships. So adding some additional volume, if necessary will be a lot easier than other retailers who might only have one or two DCs and bring everything through the West Coast. It will be very hard for those folks to switch to East Coast and develop new business relationships.","Kevin Mansell","In terms of putting the holiday in context, I think in general what we would say is as we went into the holiday as you heard from us back at that investor conference at the end of October, we had expectations that the initiatives we were talking about to you would create growth in the fourth quarter in the range of 2.5% or so. We delivered more than that. Why did we deliver more than that, essentially I think the initiatives delivered pretty much exactly on target, but the underlying business got better. And I think it got better to acknowledge of better macro environment. I think that was definitely part of it. We shared in that with other people. But it also just got better because some of the everyday work that we are doing and the essential moves that we are making in the greatness agenda are paying off, so there is still plenty of opportunity. I alluded to our biggest area of opportunity which is our women\u2019s business, positive comp in the fourth quarter that\u2019s great news. That\u2019s a real change in trend, but it still trailed the store. And that\u2019s been an ongoing issue that we are really attacking as we move into 2015 and I feel like we have some strategies to kind of create some momentum there.","Oliver Chen","Okay. And just a quick follow-up, some retailers are calling out the idea of potentially customers trading up, is that a dynamic that you are seeing within your portfolio as you look across which products are working and the pricing trends?","Kevin Mansell","I mean, other than the big piece which Wes talked about which is the national brand focus, I mean if you want to call that trading up I guess you could because it does enhance average unit retail what you sell.","Wes McDonald","It\u2019s a great thing about being in the middle. When things are good people trade up, when things are bad people trade down. So I think that\u2019s happened over the course of my 12 years here. But I think the biggest thing to Kevin\u2019s point was the increased emphasis on national brand we are providing great value on those brands and people are reaching up a little bit.","Oliver Chen","Great. Thank you. Congrats, best regards.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Michael Binetti representing UBS. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys. Good morning, congrats on a good fourth quarter.","Wes McDonald","Good morning.","Michael Binetti","Just a few questions on the comp sales guidance, the comparisons are a bit lumpy here and then there is obviously you have got a lot of new initiatives going on, it sounds like they are hitting plan, but the underlying business is better. And then we have \u2013 I guess you, Kevin you referenced some weather in February, so maybe you can just help us think directionally through the model for the year, I know you guys don\u2019t want to get back into the quarter-to-quarter, but with as much noise as we are seeing maybe just a little bit a help on how to think about the cadence through the year?","Kevin Mansell","Yes. We are definitely not going to get into quarterly guidance. But I don\u2019t think we think about the year on the top line any differently over the course of the year. We think there is relatively equal opportunity across the whole year. If there is a lumpy part to our year it\u2019s as Wes alluded to, it\u2019s the level of expense growth in the first quarter compared to the rest of the year. I look at that as really just a decision on our part to make investments earlier in the year because they are working. These are all areas, as Wes mentioned, that we have been piloting and are testing and are succeeding beyond what we thought they would and so we have sort of accelerated it earlier investments that we would have probably paced out a little bit more over the course of the year. And whether that\u2019s ship-from-store, or [indiscernible] or mobile re-platform, or beauty rollout or any of the things that he touched on even the broader technology spend which we have accelerated the pace of in the first quarter. I just look at them as investments. And we are \u2013 as you heard from us in October, we are focused on where we want to be in 3 years. And this year, is just a step on the path to get through whether it be 3 years from now. And I realized that you have to make judgments on how companies are performing over the course of the time. But we just don\u2019t run our business that way. We are not going to run our business that way. But in particular, on the top line...","Wes McDonald","There is not a lot of volatility it may be a little bit higher in the fall than in the spring. But I think that you guys sort of lapped at my extra day calculation, but it came in right on. So we get another day for that in the fourth quarter that will help a little bit. But other than that it\u2019s not really a ton of variability that\u2019s going to cause anybody any consternation.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Just checking if the West Coast and the weather were impacting anything?","Wes McDonald","No, it\u2019s a good question; I understand why you asked.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And then regarding your comments that you pulled forward some of these initiatives that you thought were working, a big piece of the earnings algorithm coming on your Analyst Day was the progress of the operating margins online, I am seeing as you are changing up the pace of some of the investments, can you maybe talk us through how we ended the year in relation to where you guided the margins for that business headed over the next 3 years and then maybe are you pulling forward some of the opportunities to start expanding that margin this year? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell","Let me \u2013 Wes will answer the question about how we ended the year because he can give you some color.","Wes McDonald","Yes. I mean I think I feel like we talked in the prepared remarks about how the lines are getting really blurry. So we are really thinking about the business in totality just because it\u2019s so difficult to figure out what\u2019s really an online sale versus a store sale, anymore. But I mean in general, we performed much, much better on the merchandise margin side of the business there. We did a much better job of handling clearance at the end of the fourth quarter and for the year for that matter. We are still working on fine tuning the algorithm on shipping. We invested a ton of money and speed in the spring in last year to offset some of the issues that we had in the fall of 2013. We had a great plan and a great team for fourth quarter and they performed excellently in terms of getting things to the customer and we really didn\u2019t have very many hiccups at all. What we have to figure out is ways to get more items in the box and to keep more orders together. So, one of the things that I talked about with the technology initiatives, we are making some changes in the first quarter to allow us to do a better job of that in ship from store environment, so we can try to send it to a store that\u2019s going to create the fewest packages possible to fulfill.","Kevin Mansell","I mean, it\u2019s an area that we definitely have invested a lot in talent in focusing on improving operating performance, but we have also put a lot of resources behind. So, as Wes said I think we understand what the issues are, but the things we have talked about we believe actually are going to help us in that regard, so\u2026","Wes McDonald","Yes, I feel \u2013 I mean, like we are going to do much better over the course of the three years on UPH and the EFCs. We got a really good plan. We got a path. We know what to do there. You can\u2019t force the customers to order what you would like them to order. So, the shipping cost thing is a pretty complex thing, but we are going to get better at it each year, but as I mentioned earlier when somebody has to breakout, it\u2019s going to be about a 20 basis point headwind for us on margin, but we should be able to overcome that through better inventory management.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Neely Tamminga","Great. Good morning and congratulations to you guys. Hey, just a real quick question on inventory, how should we be thinking about the cadence of inventories we pass through this year? That would be helpful. You guys have done a really good job of pulling those levels back overall. And then on the beauty rollout, Kevin, if you know and\/or less, can you give us a sense of how big Bliss is going to be maybe in the size of either linear feet or are you guys going to take over a whole gondola dedicated to Bliss? Are you getting the full kind of complement of their products? It\u2019s a great add.","Kevin Mansell","Yes, thank you. On the inventory?","Wes McDonald","Yes. On the inventory, I think our target by the end of the year \u2013 and it might be different by quarter \u2013 is to be sort of down in the 3% to 5% on a unit basis just like we ended this quarter. On a dollar basis, it could be a little less down if national brands continue to increase in penetration. I hate to be repetitive, but it\u2019s like a 3-year plan. So, we are going to try to do that again next year and then into 2017. We have a lot of opportunity to make the store inventory work harder for us through ship from store and buy online, pickup in store. So, this will be a learning year for buy online, pickup in store, because we only had experience for about a quarter in 100 stores. So, I suspect we will make some improvement next year. I expect to make dramatic improvement in 2016, but I feel like we are going to continue to make progress throughout the year.","Kevin Mansell","On Bliss specifically, I mean, first of all, it\u2019s definitely a significant add. It\u2019s in an area in which we are on a relative basis weaker than in our overall beauty offering. We are weaker I would say in skincare and body products. And this really enhances that a lot. Space allocation, Neely, is very different, because as you know we piloted different presentation and space allocations and we landed with essentially two levels. So, in a level 1 or larger presentation, they have essentially more of the gondola presentation that you alluded to in the smaller presentation is not as big obviously. And then there are actually some stores, where there will be Bliss products in, but it won\u2019t be the full offering. The online offering of course will be more substantial, but we are definitely very excited about the partnership, because I think they are actually a really innovative resource and they have a lot of great ideas.","Neely Tamminga","We agree. Congratulations you guys. Good luck.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.","Kevin Mansell","Hey, Paul.","Paul Trussell","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just a question on CapEx, Wes, I believe you mentioned $800 million for this year, had about $350 million that was related to IT. Are there kind of any one-time or any items specific to this year or is $800 million kind of the run-rate?","Wes McDonald","No, that\u2019s going to be kind of the run-rate, I think, we talked about in October $750 million to $800 million. I think IT it\u2019s just the cost of playing poker. We were a little lighter. We came in, I think we budgeted $300 million last year and only spent about $280 million, so some of that is a flip forward from last year into this year. But IT is going to be somewhere between $300 million and $350 million every year. The store 250 that I talked about is probably going to be the same for next year as we finish rolling out beauty. And then as we cycle into 2017, we will start to ramp up the pace of remodels again. We will go from I think we are doing 12 this year to 50 next year to 75 in 2017. And then base capital will remain about 200. That\u2019s really investments in some of our easy experience initiatives as well as some investment in DCs and EFCs for new sorters and new technology and just normal repair and maintenance of replacing HVACs and roofs in the stores as our store base gets a little older.","Paul Trussell","Got it. And just going back to Neely\u2019s question on beauty for the 500 stores that already have the new beauty concept, is there any notable difference in sales that you can point out and how we should think about the impact of you guys adding in these beauty concepts into additional stores this year and the lift you may see?","Wes McDonald","Yes. I guess there is good news on that front. We have built-in and I think we talked about it in October, but the stores that had more than $15 million in sales that had what we would call a level 2 experience. So, that\u2019s sort of the most fancy for layman\u2019s terms, beauty environment, they got about a 2% lift. We didn\u2019t build this in, but we came up with sort of a hybrid option that was between really a retrofit option that we tried initially last year and the high-end shop, that\u2019s about half the cost of the high-end shop. Those stores, there were about 80 of them, also got around a 2% lift for holiday. Holiday is a little strange, because you got a big fragrance business that\u2019s in there that drives a lot of business. So, we want to see how it performs post holiday. But if that happens, that would be something that would be incremental to sort of the guidance that we provided for the 3-year plan in October. So, we are encouraged by it, but fourth quarter is not something you can make a decision on whether that\u2019s really going to work or not.","Paul Trussell","Got it. Appreciate the color. Good quarter, guys.","Wes McDonald","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Swinand with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Paul Swinand","Good morning. Paul Swinand from Morningstar. I wanted to drill down on the national brands a little bit more. I noticed on your prepared remarks you said that this was the first time in a while that you got a lift both from existing customers and I think non-credit card customers. Any analysis that says the national brands is part of that? And then obviously you are marketing the national brands are you promoting them at the same level as your private brands?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean, in terms of the analysis, essentially I think your question is about what the market \u2013 what the basket look like in the various categories of customers. I think our experience has been that new customers definitely lean into national brands, because they already have the experience and the credibility with those to begin with. So, as we have enhanced our efforts around national brands, I think that\u2019s been a positive for new customers. I don\u2019t have the specific basket info, Paul, but Wes, can definitely get back to you for sure with that. What was the second part of your question?","Paul Swinand","Well, so it sounds like the customers that aren\u2019t existing Kohl\u2019s customers are coming in and discovering that you may have better brands than they thought. So maybe as you market them more and reach new customers with the market, you will get additional traffic as kind a lagging indicator?","Kevin Mansell","Right. I mean, I think what you were asking I guess was investment. And we definitely are investing more in national brands both in marketing, I would say, Wes, for sure, but also in-store presentation. So, you can probably see that when you go into the store. There is several brands that have enhanced presentations.","Wes McDonald","Yes. We spent a lot of money with Carter\u2019s and Nike and...","Kevin Mansell","Levi.","Wes McDonald","Levi, and there\u2019s a whole litany of brands where we improved the in-store presentation. Some of these guys have gone to sort of minimum advertised pricing. So, the one advantage that we have over some of the other guys is the exclusions don\u2019t \u2013 any exclusions that are involved don\u2019t include Kohl\u2019s Cash or loyalty redemption, so that provides a little extra value for some of those national brands that are really priced the same across the stores that carry them.","Paul Swinand","Interesting. Thanks a lot. Best of luck.","Wes McDonald","Alright, thank you.","Wes McDonald","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time and running through March 26 at midnight Eastern Daylight Time.

[Operator Instruction] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michelle Gass, Chief Executive Officer of Kohl's Department Stores. Please go ahead.","Michelle Gass","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. With me is Bruce Besanko, our Chief Financial Officer. I am pleased to introduce the call and report that our results for the second quarter exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Our comp sales increased 3.1% for the quarter on a shifted basis, delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth. Our ongoing focus on the key pillars of our Greatness Agenda and our two key priorities of driving traffic and operational excellence continue to deliver strong momentum across the business.","I am confident that the strategies we have in place along with an organization that is operating with great speed, agility, and innovation will position us for long-term sustainable growth. I would like to thank the entire organization for their outstanding level of execution this quarter, and their tremendous commitment to the health and success of the business.","I'll now turn the call over to Bruce for a review of our second quarter financial results. After Bruce's remarks, I will return to add more color on the business and update you on our key initiatives.","Bruce Besanko","Thank you, Michelle. Comp sales for the quarter increased 3.1% on a shifted basis, our fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp growth, and a significant acceleration from our first quarter. Shifted comp sales compares sales for the 13-week period ended August 4, 2018 and August 5, 2017. Unless noted, our comp comments are on a shifted basis. For additional information on the calendar shift caused by the 53rd week in 2017, please refer to the appendix of the June 16, 2018 analyst meet-and-greet presentation, which is available on the Investor Relations pages of our corporate Web site.","We achieved comp sales increases in both stores and in our digital channel. Digital was especially strong with a mid-teen increase. The comp sales increase continues to be driven by an increase in average transaction value. From a line of business perspective, Men's, Women's, and Footwear were our strongest performers. Children's and Accessories also reported comp sales increases. Home, which reported an especially strong comp in the first quarter was slightly negative in the second quarter. From a region perspective, all regions reported positive comps. The Midwest, South Central, and Mid Atlantic outperformed the company. Michelle will provide additional comments on our sales results in her remarks.","Moving to gross margin and inventory, our gross margin increased 42 basis points as our teams again delivered higher-than-expected margin results. The strong gross margin improvement was a result of our ongoing focus on inventory management, which contributed to cleaner inventory and less permanent promotional markdowns, as well as the positive impact of our operational excellence initiative on our shipping costs. With regard to the growing benefits of our sustained approach to inventory management, there are four key initiatives driving our results. First, our standard to small initiative continues to drive lower inventory levels and higher profitability. We expanded our standard to small program to another 200 stores in 2018.","Second, localization has allowed us to have the right product in the right store at the right time. Third, the Speed initiative has positively impacted our proprietary portfolio by allowing us to better flow receipts to match customer demand. And last, we strategically reduced customer choice while increasing depth in key items. All of these initiatives have resulted in improved inventory metrics. Our inventory per store decreased 8%, our tenth consecutive quarter of inventory reductions. Our inventory is turning faster, our clearance levels continue to be well managed, and our aged inventory is decreasing. The inventory initiatives have also contributed to our already strong cash position.","Moving back to the income statement, SG&A increased 4% or $52 million to $1.3 billion for the quarter. All major lines of business reported expense leverage except IT where we're making deliberate investments in the cloud and other technology initiatives to drive future efficiencies and growth. Depreciation expense, of $241 million, was generally consistent with the prior year as additional IT and IT, amortization, and depreciation on our fifth ecommerce fulfillment center, which opened last summer, were more than offset by the reduction and depreciation due to the maturing of our store portfolio. Net interest expense decreased $10 million for the quarter, primarily due to the benefits of this year's debt tender transaction. Higher interest on our investments also contributed to the decrease.","For the first time, we repurchased debt in the open market during the quarter. We repurchased $28 million of our debt at slightly below par. We plan to monitor the market for future opportunities to repurchase more of our debt. Moving on to taxes, our tax rate was 24.5% for the quarter, significantly lower than last year primarily due to the tax reform. Net income for the quarter was $292 million, an increase of 40%. Diluted earnings per share increased 42% to $1.76. Looking at our store portfolio, we ended the quarter with 1,158 Kohl's stores, which is unchanged from last quarter. Gross footage was 99.1 million square feet, and selling footage was 82.8 million square feet.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $514 million over the prior year quarter end. As I mentioned earlier, our inventory per store decreased 8%, and contributed to a 375 basis point increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio which was 39.3% at the end of the quarter.","Moving on to capital management, capital expenditures were $312 million in the first-half of 2018, $87 million lower than the first-half of 2017. The decrease was driven by lower spending on ecommerce fulfillment centers and timing of technology spend. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million for the year.","Weighted average diluted shares and shares outstanding at quarter-end, were 166 million and 167 million respectively. We repurchased 1.4 million shares of our stock during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 2.5 million shares. Last week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.61 per share. The dividend is payable on September 26 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 12. As a reminder, we adopted the revenue recognition standard in the first quarter. Historical financial statements can be found under Revenue Recognition Accounting Standard in the Events and Presentations section of the Investor Relations pages of our corporate Web site.","As announced in our release, we're updating our annual adjusted earnings guidance to the range of $5.15 to $5.55 per share. This excludes the one-time debt extinguishment charge of $42 million or $0.19 per share taken in the first quarter. Comp sales on a shifted basis are expected to be positive in the second-half of the year, and to increase 0.5% to 2% for the full-year. We now expect gross margin to increase 25 to 30 basis points for the year, and SG&A to be at the high end of our previous guidance of up 1% to 2%.","And now I will turn the call to Michelle who will provide additional details on our results and an update on our key initiatives.","Michelle Gass","Thank you, Bruce. Our strong second quarter performance demonstrates that the strategies we put in place are accelerating our performance while the teams continue to manage the business with great discipline. I am pleased with the progress and success on all areas of our business including sales, gross margin, and inventory. We reported positive comps in both our stores and online.","We saw continued momentum in our national brand. We also saw a significant improvement in our proprietary brand performance. Our focus on inventory management allowed us to deliver an 8% reduction in inventory per store and a 42 basis point increase in gross margin. These results are a direct reflection of the progress we are making on our key priorities, driving traffic and operational excellence aligned with our strategic pillars focused on production, personalization, value, and the experience.","I will begin with an update on our product initiatives. National brand sales increased 4% driven by strength in apparel and footwear which is largely due to our continued growth in the active category. Looking more closely at our active brands, Nike, our largest national brand, continues to outperform the company through its core and new offerings which included launching golf this quarter. Under Armour has delivered very strong growth in its second year and accelerated from its first quarter sales performance. Adidas had another outstanding quarter as our customers continue to react favorably to our expanded and elevated assortment.","As I mentioned on our last call, as part of our efforts to invest in our active and wellness initiative in a bigger and bolder way, we recently launched an active expansion test in 30 stores earlier this month. This expansion results in an increase in square footage for the active business by approximately 40% and will provide customers with almost 50% more choices including unique items available only in these test stores.","We have also enhanced the experience with new merchandizing and marketing elements across the store. It is also worth mentioning that beyond active, we experienced strong growth across many of our national brands. Our national denim brands such as Levi and Lee jeans did particularly well with the launch of our back-to-school campaign.","Now moving to proprietary brands, our proprietary brand portfolio had its best performance in over five years. As an organization, we have had an intense focus on improving the performance of our proprietary brand while also editing the overall portfolio, reducing inventory, and narrowing customer choice. The traction we are gaining is a direct result of our speed-to-market strategy. The Speed model has provided the ability to make decisions closer to the season, to test key programs before companywide rollout and to enable our teams to respond to the specific business trends allowing us to chase strength while reducing exposure to weaker performers. The core capability we are building in Speed along with brand and value clarity will provide long-term benefit to this important part of our business.","In the second quarter, we saw sales acceleration across all apparel categories, Men's, Children's, and Women's. While we are of course very pleased with the broad-based performance across our apparel categories, I am especially excited by the results in our women's business which outperforms the company for the first time in two years. Driving sustainable improvement in women's has been a key focus of our organization. And we are now seeing the results of our efforts.","Our proprietary women's portfolio was especially strong driven by key brand such as Apartment 9, which we re-launched last fall, LC Lauren Conrad, ELLE, and our SO Junior's brand. Our focus on brand clarity, product assortment, and narrow choice has been a key driver of the improved results in our women's business. We have also properly balanced our investment in key items with a more relevant offering in our fashion collection.","As we look forward, we are encouraged by the building momentum in the women's business. We have a strong pipeline of new initiatives coming this fall to support further growth. First, we will enhance in-store presentations in national and proprietary bottom. Second, we will add a new experience for our plus customer with new fixtures, graphics, and mannequin elevating the experience for this underserved customer. Third, and perhaps the most exciting, is the previously announced launch of POPSUGAR.","In mid-September, we will launch a new proprietary brand POPSUGAR at Kohl's across our entire women's apparel and accessory categories. This new brand represents an entirely new approach by partnering with a leader in the digital space; one with a very large social media following with millennial women. In addition to the branding and marketing efforts, the brand will use realtime data to inform and build a collection that is relevant to this important customer. We view POPSUGAR as a terrific complement to the other critical areas of our women's business.","Looking further ahead, I am also very excited to announce today that in 2019 we'll be launching the iconic Nine West brand at Kohl's. The introduction of Nine West elevates our overall fashion offering for women and millennial customers, and strengthens Kohl's position as a destination for the most sought after and relevant brand. Beginning next summer we will offer Nine West shoes, handbags, and exclusive line of apparel in all of our stores with an expanded assortment available online.","Moving on to our personalization effort, we continue to see personalized marketing as the future of our customer engagement effort. And we are making significant investment and progress in this important area of our business. The vision of our personalization initiative is to drive both traffic and conversion by having our customer see the right message at the right time, in the right place in response to their preferences.","We want our customers to engage and to seamlessly move across the site, store, and mobile experiences. We have several key personalization initiatives in flight that supports this vision. First, Smart Cart which launched on desktop in the third quarter of 2017 was expanded to the mobile channel this quarter. This program incentivizes customers via Kohl's Cash to come to the store to pick up their online orders rather than shipping it to their home.","Smart Cart generates attachment sales in addition to reducing shipping cost. We are deploying personalized search, dynamic media personalization as well as product recommendation. All of which continuously learn from customer behavior to recommend products to our customers. And lastly, we have scaled personalized triggers which include savings alerts and personalized emails of top selling relevant products. Our personalized efforts are enabled by the investments we are making in best-in-class technology including an artificial intelligence and machine learning framework which constantly adapts to customer behavior to drive optimal result.","Transitioning now to loyalty, as you know, we launched a new Kohl's Rewards pilot in late May in a hundred stores across eight markets, Phoenix, Raleigh, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Austin, San Antonio, Buffalo, and Rochester. The program has three primary goals to acquire and retain customers, to simplify our loyalty asset, and to reinvigorate Kohl's Charge.","As a reminder, the new loyalty program is unified under one platform Kohl's Reward with the key reward being Kohl's Cash. Members earn 5% of their purchase in Kohl's Cash every day and Kohl's Charge members earn 10% every day. We are also testing a suite of additional benefits as well. We are in the early days of the pilot. And we expect to gain important insights on what aspects of the program are most appealing to our customers. We look forward to providing an update later in the year as we learn more.","Now let me give you an update on our experience strategies including both digital and in-store. We are very pleased that our digital business had another strong quarter with a mid-teen increase in sales. Mobile again represented the majority of our traffic growth at 70% of total digital traffic and almost half of digital sales. Many of our investments continue to pay off in driving both sales and traffic across our digital channels including, Your Price, personalized search and growth in bulk bids driven by Smart Cart, an expanded assortment availability. With the continued acceleration of our digital business, our stores are doing an amazing job supporting our fulfillment strategies, fulfilling close to 40% of digital units during this quarter.","In late July, we successfully launched Buy-Online-Ship-to-Store, which we refer to as BOSS. The service is currently available in about 20 stores, but will be rolled out to all stores in the next few months. BOSS will significantly broaden the assortment available to our customers for free pickup and store, complements our existing buy online pick-up and store platform and is another great way that we can drive traffic into our stores.","Now moving onto our focus on our stores, given rapidly changing customer expectations as the in-store experience and growing challenges of operating physical stores, we continue to utilize the Your Store learning lab to quickly test new concepts while building a longer term road map to continually refresh and evolve our future store. We are testing in 58 Your Store labs across the country including ideas that both elevate the store experience and enhance store operations. All enabled by technology and analytics.","A few examples of concepts that we are testing in the Your Store lab include mobile checkout, way finding, in-store lockers for online order pickups, new merchandising and staffing concepts, store layout changes, including our right-size initiative, store manager tools and we're looking forward to testing a new customer service center concept in two stores later this year.","Finally, I'd like to briefly update you on our store optimization strategy. We continue to make significant progress on our standard-to-small initiative. With the most recent conversion of an additional 200 stores this quarter, we now have 500 standard-to-small stores operating as smaller stores.","As Bruce mentioned earlier, this effort has been a key driver to inventory productivity and margin accretion. It is also providing a better and more localized experience for our customers and importantly paved the way for our rightsizing initiative to create and sublease space to complementary neighboring businesses.","So in closing, we are extremely pleased by our second quarter results and how the company has performed year-to-date. We exceeded our internal plans on all financial metrics and have increased our annual guidance accordingly. I am more confident than ever that our initiative supporting our two key priorities of driving traffic and operational excellence are succeeding and positioning us for a long-term financial health and success.","Before I turn the call over for your questions I'd like to again thank the 140,000 amazing associates that are committed to Kohl's success. The continued momentum we experienced again this quarter is a direct reflection of their efforts.","We are happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","Thanks and congrats on the nice quarter.","Bruce Besanko","Thank you, Matt.","Matthew Boss","On same-store sales, Bruce, I guess, at the high-end of your full-year shifted guidance, it implies positive 2 to 2.5 comps, again on a shifted basis in the second half, and I think it's interesting because that's despite tougher comparisons. I guess two questions, is that a good way to think about the model going forward as you think about the initiatives in place particularly as we move into next year and beyond? And I guess, the second question would just be -- that's the back-half shifted comp -- how best to think about the reported comp in the back-half of the year?","Bruce Besanko","Why don't I start, and then Michelle, feel free to jump in. So, on the back part of your question, what we said earlier in the year holds still, which is that in the first-half of the year we would expect that the fiscal comp would be stronger than the shifted comp, but that reverses out in the second half and in fact the shifted comp is going to be stronger than the fiscal comp in the second half. So that's the way to think about it.","So the guidance that we provided for the full year is now up. It went from [0 to 2] (ph) 0.5% to 2%.And in the back half, we said that we would be positive on a shifted basis in the second half. And I think we're - given the momentum of the company, we're executing well; I think that's why we provided that guidance.","Michelle Gass","Sure. And I\u2019ll add a little color on our confidence in the back half. A lot of it are the strategies we've put in place that have been building really over many months and many quarters, and it's great to now see the traction. And we view this traction, this momentum as sustainable. So the initiatives I spoke to this past quarter, so the success of our national brands and active, that momentum continues. A brand like Under Armour which we're now comping is actually accelerating its comp. So as we think about the back half of the year, really our three key national brands in active, we expect to continue.","I'm particularly excited about the strength in our apparel categories. I talked a bit about Women's, we're seeing great strength in Men's, we've seen a great uptick in our Kids business, and across the board that's coming both on the back of active and national brands, but importantly, really a sea change we're seeing in the performance of our proprietary brand.","Brands like Jumping Beans in Kids, I mentioned the Women's brand and as you know, the proprietary brand penetration in Women's is roughly two-thirds of the business. So with that tailwind, we are really excited again, we see no evidence of that letting up on top of our digital growth, the technology initiatives, so the momentum that the team is creating, I feel really good about, and then we do expect to benefit in the back-half from store closures and in particular with Bon-Ton closing the doors especially as we think about holiday, we're going to be a great destination for those customers to shop.","Bruce Besanko","Can I just build on that too, Michelle, on the competitor store closures. So we believe last year we got our fair share or more than our fair share of the competitor store closings. As you guys know, we actually tracked each of our stores relative to those nearby competitor stores that closed and we believe we got our fair share.","What's different this time around, this year with the Bon-Ton store closures that is different than last year is two things. One, the Bon-Ton chain is actually liquidating versus just having closed stores. And so, customers will not have the opportunity to go to a different store that might be nearby. So that's one thing that's different about the competitor store closures this year.","And the second thing is that the Bon-Ton stores are typically located in regions where our brand is particularly strong. And so for those two reasons, it's a little different. We're actually expecting some nice benefit from that. We're going to again put marketing dollars strategically against those store closures. So we think that's a nice -- should be a nice benefit in the second-half.","Matthew Boss","Right. And then just one follow-up, with inventory down 7% exiting the quarter, I guess, just help us to think about gross margin drivers maybe in the back-half, and Bruce, as we think forward, I guess, what inning would you say calls it in today on the inventory management front as we think multi-year?","Bruce Besanko","We're in the first-half of the ballgame, I think, on inventory. We've only guided though this year. So inventory for the year we expect to be down mid single-digits, that hasn't changed. We've had a good start in the first-half.","In regards to margin, we've had -- we've actually exceeded our expectations on the gross margin front in the first-half. What I've got modeled in for the second-half is -- particularly on cost to shipping where we've seen a benefit, and we're modeling what is more historic trends there, and we do expect to see some benefit from inventory management continuing. As I said, we expect inventories to be down for the full year in the mid-single-digit range.","Matthew Boss","Great, best of luck.","Bruce Besanko","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thanks, good morning. Can you help us dig in a little bit on the components of your comp growth, I think you mentioned driven by average transaction value. What were the specific underlying drivers there?","Bruce Besanko","Hi, Lorraine, yes, so as you know we no longer break out the components of comp sales. As far as I'm concerned as the finance executive, as long as I'm driving a positive comp and can therefore leverage and accrete on EBIT, I'm fairly happy. I did say our ATV drove our comp sales in Q2 and Michelle pointed out that traffic remains our number one priority. I can make one piece of color for you, which is we do have automated counters in most of our stores if not all of our stores. We compare that against competitors. We all reported to a third-party and our traffic count is, we believe, in good shape relative to what we see from the competitors.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Okay. And then just looking at the fourth quarter, you know, I know you gave back-half guidance, do you think you can comp that positive six in the fourth quarter? Do you think the fourth Q comp can be positive and maybe just talk about some of the specific drivers, be it Women's apparel, POPSUGAR, how you build up to that?","Michelle Gass","Lorraine, so great question and as we figure today, we feel very confident that we can comp the comp. As I was mentioning earlier, the key initiatives that have given us benefit year-to-date will continue and arguably accelerate as we head into the back-half and especially for Q4. We know Q4 and holiday is the time where really Kohl's shines and stands out. So, on top of the expected tail end we'll get from the store closures and Bon-Ton liquidating, we have some great initiatives. So national brands feel really good about that, active has become a true gifting opportunity in Q4. We saw that last year, we have a bigger and broader assortment for this coming year.","Very bullish on our proprietary brands, the speed model is getting tremendous traction. We've got great items on the proprietary side. I did mention Women's, so, yes, we have a very solid plan for Women's but really across all of our apparel business and footwear businesses. So I mean, across the board, I'm feeling extremely confident. It's also worth mentioning that you know, while we're not the biggest player in toy, we have a bit of a curated assortment and we're bringing in two powerful brands this holiday, Lego and FAO Schwarz. So that will give us a real boost to our toy business. So all-in, I think we're very well-positioned.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Bob Drbul","Hi and good morning. I guess, just on the home category, I think you said it was slightly negative. I was just wondering if you could talk to the trends a little bit in that you've seen first quarter to second quarter and is this the outlook for the back-half of the year there? ?","Michelle Gass","So thanks, Bob, for the question. When we look year-to-date, home is actually one of our strongest categories. We had some promotional shift that impacted between Q1 and Q2; I'm not overly concerned about that. Oftentimes, well, when we see strength in apparel, sometimes home gives up a little bit. So there's nothing there that is jumping out saying that we have any cause for concern.","I think we have a great line-up as we head into the back-half and home has historically been a strength for us given both the strength in our national brands on the home front, hard home as well as great, proprietary brands on the soft home side. So we're expecting a strong back-half in home.","Bob Drbul","Got it. And then just on the gross margin, I think, Bruce called out shipping costs were better this quarter versus last. So I wonder if you can maybe quantify the drag in shipping and the expectation on even on an annual basis in terms of the free shipping component.","Bruce Besanko","Hey, Bob. Bruce; I don't want to quantify that, what I can tell you though is that in the spring season, all of the first-half we've done a nice job in terms of our cost to shipping and hats off to the teams that have done just a fantastic job. The fulfillment efficiencies that we've seen in the first-half we don't expect to continue in the second-half. And in fact I've said it, we're modeling something that's more a regression and a mean for that. I think it's just -- we're going to need to see what happens in the fourth quarter this time around before we think about anything more in terms of our modeling.","Bob Drbul","Got it. And just one last question if I could, the two-second style guide, Michelle, are you seeing that benefit the apparel sales at all? Are you having any luck with that initiative?","Michelle Gass","Thanks, Bob. We'll do that one for later.","Bob Drbul","All right.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Lejuez","Hey, thanks guys. Can you maybe talk about the monthly cadence during the quarter; I believe you said weather-driven store closures hurt your first quarter comps by about a hundred basis points. Did you see that come back early on in the second quarter in May, and maybe talk about exit rates coming out of the quarter? Also curious if you have any update on the Amazon relationship and how the L.A. and Chicago stores performed versus the chain.","Bruce Besanko","I'll take the first part of that. Michelle, you can have the second quarter. Paul, thanks for the question. So, it's amazing to me how our apparel sales seem to track weather trends. So we came off of the first quarter with warmer weather, and we saw, as we said in the first quarter call, we saw our sales start to come back. That continued in the first period of the second quarter where temperatures were warmer and we saw a nice rebound. In the next period, we were positive but the weather trends were slightly less favorable but still good. And then in July, we saw good and warmer trends again. So I find it interesting that we seem to track very closely with weather patterns, and that's what happened in the quarter with apparel sales.","Michelle Gass","Great. And to your question on Amazon, so we've been in this pilot now for about nine months. To your point, L.A. and Chicago we've got about 80 stores across those two markets where we're piloting the return. And just to refresh everybody, it's free returns and we also accept package-less returns. And then also in those two markets, across the two markets, we have two on store-within-a-store as we refer to as the SWAS stores. We just recently did a modest expansion where we expanded our returns process into the Milwaukee area, so we've added another 21 stores, taking us up just over a hundred stores. I'd say, for both parties, we're really pleased with the partnership. We're exited about the customer response. We continue to track this very closely.","As you know, Kohl's is pretty famous for diving deep in the data, and make sure we understand all aspects of the key metric. So we're still doing that. We're still assessing it. It's a big deal for us. It's a big deal for them. But I think, overarching, what both parties are most pleased about is what a great customer experience we're creating for our customers and theirs.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks guys. Good luck.","Michelle Gass","Thanks.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Max Rakhlenko","Hi, this is Max on for Oliver. Thank you for taking our question. So first, can you talk about as you're increasing square footage in Active, what are some of the areas where you're cutting back on? And can you remind us what percentage of sales Active is. And then we have one follow-up.","Michelle Gass","Sure. So in regards to the Active test, basically, like we're doing all of our merchandizing today, it's really a localized decision process. So we've used the opportunity, and every store is a little bit different of the 30 stores, to look at where we can enhance the Active presentation and remove lower productivity fixtures. So it isn't, in this case with the 30 doors like one brand that's being exited, it's case-by-case and category-by-category. So we feel like we're continuing to drive localization and optimize the whole store experience, while we're also expanding Active. In terms of Active penetration, we penetrate in the upper teens. Of course, we've seen that grow even to date, even before this expansion because of the great success we're seeing.","Max Rakhlenko","Got it, thank you. And on digital margins, can you discuss where those are versus in-store? And what are some initiatives to help improve those? Thanks a lot.","Bruce Besanko","Yes, we don't break out the channel margins. What I can tell you though is that digital tends to penetrate more, I think, in Home, and obviously you've got the cost of shipping involved with the digital.","Max Rakhlenko","Got it.","Operator","Our next question is from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.","Chuck Grom","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Bruce, just on the gross margin guidance for the second-half, it appears it complies flat to slightly up. Just obviously a little bit of a step-down from the front-half. Just wondering, when you look at the efforts you've had in the front-half standard-to-small, localization, speed, and the reduced choice in inventory. What are you expecting on all those fronts?","Bruce Besanko","You're exactly right, Chuck. So we outperformed our internal expectations both in Q1 and Q2 for gross margin. And in addition, we outperformed in terms of our cost of shipping. Gross margin was up 42 basis points in Q2, in Q1 it was up 50 basis points. There were a few drivers behind that. There's the inventory management, and in particular better clearance and promotional markdowns. We also have the fulfillment efficiencies that I mentioned, and then higher BOPIS penetration. So all of that said, we ended up raising our full-year guidance to 25 to 30 basis points of increase for the full-year. It was lower than that previously. And as we look at the holiday, that's obviously our Super Bowl, and so we expect a higher digital penetration during that. It's a little bit more promotional. And so I think the guidance is appropriate.","Chuck Grom","Okay, fair enough. And then I know it's a little bit early, but any thoughts so far on back-to-school? And on the Bon-Ton, I believe a lot of those stores began to close at the end of July. I'm just wondering if you're starting to see any benefits so far from Bon-Ton.","Michelle Gass","Sure, I'll take that one. In terms of back-to-school, I mean, obviously we're in the swing of the season. As I mentioned in the script, we felt really good about our denim performance. But we really saw success across the board, very broad-based, hence the success of our Apparel business this particular quarter. Active continues to increase in back-to-school seasons. Our sneaker business was strong, our T-shirt business, so really across the board. And we're optimistic that continues as we head into back-to-school.","Chuck Grom","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up, on the standard-to-small, I think you're partnering up with five to 10 stores starting this fall. I guess, how close are you guys to signing up more tenants within those 500 doors that you've now retrofitted?","Michelle Gass","Yes, we believe the standard-to-small rightsizing opportunity is a very big deal for the company. And we're excited. We're having lots of conversations, we're in some negotiations. I wish I could be in a position with share what some of those retailers and prospective tenants are. We can't do that yet, but just say that we're building a nice robust pipeline of interested parties.","Chuck Grom","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great, thank you so much. I wanted to ask just a follow-up to Paul's question on the Amazon partnership. And I'm wondering if over the course of the next six or 12 months you would expect some sort of an expansion in that particular strategy? And then Bruce, can I just follow-up on your SG&A commentary. SG&A showed some very nice leverage sort of across the categories here in the second quarter. I'm not sure how to think about SG&A leverage as we go through the back-half of the year given the calendar shift. So any guidance or any color you have there would be helpful. And then lastly, inventory here looks like it's in really exceptional shape. Should we be looking at kind of similar levels as we progress through the third and fourth quarter? Thanks so much.","Michelle Gass","Kimberly, I'll kickoff on the Amazon question, and then I'll let Bruce answer the other two. As I was mentioning earlier, we feel really good about the customer experience that we've created, say, we feel good, the Amazon partners we work with also do. We're still in the assessment stage. You asked about expansion, so I mentioned we did actually just recently expand into Southeastern Wisconsin, so we're excited to now broaden the store base to over 100 stores and learn from our Milwaukee customers as well. So I would stay tuned, but we're feeling optimistic. And then over to you, Bruce.","Bruce Besanko","Yes, so I'll take both the inventory and the SG&A question. On the SG&A front, so as we indicated on the prepared remarks, SG&A was up, call it, a little over $50 million, about 4%. We de-leveraged slightly a little bit less than 10 basis points. As I said, all major lines of the business leveraged with the one exception which was IT, which was planned to be leveraged. In fact, we came in a little better than our plan in the quarter. The reason for that investment in KT is both our cloud migration strategy, which is a multiyear strategy. We tend to be in the investment mode now on that cloud migration strategy. And then secondly, broadly investing in our omni-channel and digital experiences, that Michelle and Kevin had previously talked about, that have delivered such tremendous benefit to us, such as the smartcard, Your Price, some of the efficiencies that we're starting to see elsewhere in the business.","So as we look at the second-half, we obviously have the 53rd week and we'll take affect of. But what I would tell you is that we now expect, on a full-year basis, that our guide is going to be at the high end of that 1% to 2% up. And let me just make one last comment, which is we continue to be focused on our operational excellence. That's the number two priority in our company. As many of you know, Joel Tim led that effort and is leading the effort right now. We've don't pyramid-by-pyramid reviews of cost. We're tracking those costs that have been put into the budget. And Michelle continues to challenge all of our teams to deliver even more. So I think we're in great shape there. We're going to deliver more than the $250 million that we'd previously talked about, so. But the guide for the full-year is up; it's at the high end of the 1% to 2% range. And then finally on inventory, so\u2026","Kimberly Greenberger","Okay, and inventory?","Bruce Besanko","So, sorry, Kimberly, you had asked about the inventory. What I'll tell you about the inventory is that, broadly for the year we're expecting it will be down mid single digit. So I would take and use that metric as sort of the guide given what we've seen in the first-half of the year.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark Altschwager","Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'll take one more stab at Amazon here. Can you give us a better sense maybe of the learnings you had with the original pilot? What you're seeing in terms of traffic lift or conversion? Presumably, if you're expanding, you would think you're seeing profitable traffic or seeing a good ROI overall. But is that a fair assumption or just any metrics you can share on that front would be great.","Michelle Gass","Mark thanks for the question. So, no, I'll just really reiterate what I said earlier, which is this is a big deal for us and Amazon. We are studying it very closely. As you know, as we've taken on things of this magnitude in the past, whether first loyalty test or our Beauty expansion, we want to make sure we optimize and we get it right. And then, of course, it's us and it's Amazon to make any further decision. So as I said earlier, very pleased with the customer response. It is a frictionless experience. Hopefully, Mark, you'll have a chance to try it out at some point. But we're getting really great feedback from customers.","And we're pleased, and certainly Amazon is very pleased about that. But all elements have to work. The operations have to work, the financials have to work. So we are doing our best to really understand and dig deep before any decision is made going forward. But -- or like I said, excited to have expanded the pilot now to a hundred stores, gives us a really robust dataset to make a great decision down the road.","Mark Altschwager","Got it. And, Michelle, could you also just touch on the marketing strategy surrounding the POPSUGAR launch, sounds like that's going to be a more meaningful driver in the back-half. How are you planning to leverage the personalization tools to really get after that millennial customer? And I think you also mentioned leveraging real time data to inform the assortment. What exactly does that mean? And how are the lead times with this particular assortment going to compare to the broader Women's Apparel assortment? Thanks.","Michelle Gass","Right. Mark, so what I heard from you is really two questions. One around the marketing and how we're thinking about that, and secondly the real time data. So I'll actually start with the latter, with the real time data. So this and it is targeted to the millennial customer, fast fashion, if you say. So we have a new process working with some new vendors to really leverage insights, not only from POPSUGAR, say in millions and millions of followers across their different properties. So we're able to take advantage of insights from those customers as well as just the trend curve overall from a data analytics to create product, respond to product, chase what's working, pivot where we need to. So this will be on a very fast cycle, and we're really excited taking what we're doing in speed, but taking it to the next level. So the turns are expected to be quite quick.","On the marketing side, we're already done some co-marketing with POPSUGAR. Things like when we re-launched Apt. 9, they were one of our marketing channels. We saw really great engagement with customers. So, you are correct, our intent is to -- and it's going to be with their name as well, so we get the double benefit. But we have a very aggressive, kind of, broad-based marketing program across their entire audience. As well as we will be taking advantage of our personalization capabilities, so tailored to that millennial customer, both in things like display ads targeted to the millennial customer, as well as our own millennial customers through personalized email, personalized search, et cetera.","So, yes, we're excited. It will launch mid-September. And it is one of the things that we believe will bring some real newness and fashion relevancy into the assortment.","Mark Altschwager","Thanks for all the detail. Best of luck.","Michelle Gass","Great, thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Randy Konik with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Randy Konik","Yes, thanks a lot. I guess, my first question, just I want to dig in more on the digital side of things and focus. In terms of take rate, are there any kind of metrics you can share on the take rate there and the advantage or the attachment you're getting on the customers coming to the door. Because it seems like as at millennials become more of a consumer and use more of their mobile, it seems like a big opportunity. So I'm just curious of the metrics that you can share with us, and then the metrics you're trying to monitor or the milepost you're trying to get towards with that offering?","Michelle Gass","Sure. So I'll start with that one, Randy, and Bruce can add in if I miss anything. So first off, we are seeing our BOPIS penetration increase. We have a lot of efforts against that because we really do see it as a win-win; help their shipping cost and it gets traffic into the stores. So we have talked about the Your Price and the Smart Cart, and those are two key benefits from a value standpoint. So basically, a Smart Cart works if you have something in your cart, we're incentivizing with $5 Kohl's cash to come into the store versus the shipping side of things. We also have, through our technology capability, expanded the assortments, so it's making a lot more choices available to customers on BOPIS, and that has also had a material impact to sales.","So metric-wise, I can tell you we're up. I can tell you that we're in the low double digits as a percent of sales. Regarding digital, we think there's a lot of upside there. Hence, what we're rolling out as we speak, is our Buy Online, Ship to Store, our BOSS initiative, which will really dramatically expand the offerings to customers. And again, we'll use those same tools to incent. And then you also asked about attachment. We do see a pretty significant attachment, upward in the 20% to 25% range. So that is all good. So you can expect to see us, especially as we head into the holidays. That will be a big focus for us.","Bruce Besanko","And I'd just add the comment that Michelle made in her prepared remarks around the stores, and generally how well the stores have been performing. They obviously comped positive this quarter. But the other thing that Michelle mentioned in her prepared remarks was how they contribute to the entire digital experience. And they touch upwards of 35% to 40% of our online order. So they just do a terrific job too. So the take rate, the attach rate, and the contribution by the stores have all been nice.","Randy Konik","Got it. And then a question on the standard-to-small strategy is there any kind of metric you can kind of give us that show the differential between, let's say, the inventory turns in the smaller footprint versus the traditional or gross margin dollars per box? And then second, just so we know, I think your 500 stores is -- what's the actual long-term kind of plan there just so as a reminder how many you think you can get towards a smaller footprint? And I guess the reason I'm asking is it appears that while the question around moderating inventory levels for the balance of the year versus the reductions in the front-half of the year? There just seems to be more of a longer-term tail of inventory productivity to still come in this business over the next few years, not just the balance of the year.","Bruce Besanko","All right, let me see if I can parse that out. Michelle, jump in if you think I might've missed anything. So, first of all, we started with a very small test a couple of years ago. We eventually went to 300 stores, and then this year we've added another 200. So right now, we're at 500 stores on the standard-to-small. That's all we've sort of provided to all of you. Well, obviously if that changes we'll certainly update that. But right now we're at 500 stores.","In regards to inventory, what I can tell you is there's been an inventory reduction, obviously, as a consequence of the standard-to-small, and it's a low double-digit percentage decrease in inventory in those stores. The consequence of that decrease in inventory, which is part of the contribution of our broader inventory initiatives, but the benefit of that is that we actually see gross margins improving slightly in the standard-to-small stores because of the mark down benefit that we -- and clearance benefit that we see from reduced inventory. So, that's the story on the standard-to-small. It's a terrific story. And I think we are going to continue to see how these new 200 stores perform. And then we will update you as that unfolds.","Randy Konik","Okay. And just lastly, Michelle, just update on Beauty, what thoughts there long-term; you obviously have gotten improvement in the women's business to start here, just curious on that category.","Michelle Gass","Yes, great question. I believe Beauty is a great opportunity for Kohl's. We have made good inroads over the last couple of years. More recently we brought in elevated product philosophy. One we recently introduced, it's done really well. And we do have some new exciting brands coming this fall holiday.","So you will hear about those as we launch them. But we have a really good lineup. So you are correct. Our customer base penetrates highly female. It's a great attachment purchase. And you can expect to see more investment from in Beauty in the years to come.","Randy Konik","Understood. Thanks, guys.","Bruce Besanko","Thank you.","Michelle Gass","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Dana Telsey","Good morning everyone and congratulations on the nice results. As you think about the cost of shipping, how do you think of that improvement going forward; key drivers and opportunity that you see? Michelle sounds exciting about Nine West, what do you see that taking place of? And when does that brand get expanded as you mention those category expansion opportunities? And just lastly, any thoughts on tariffs and the impact on private label what you see there? Thank you.","Bruce Besanko","I will get the cost of shipping and tariffs. And Michelle, you take the other question. So, on the cost of shipping we have seen some of fulfillment efficiencies in the first-half. As mentioned, Dana, what we are modeling in the second-half is more what we've traditionally seen in our cost of shipping. I think we need to see how the holiday performs as a particularly tough moment in time with the sales levels and so on. So we will see how that -- how it works in the second-half here before we start making any -- any other change. But I will tell you the gross margin as we said outperformed in the first-half. And then we raised the guidance in the second-half.","With respect to tariffs, naturally we are monitoring that situation closely. We are working with our vendors and internally to assess any impact to Kohl's. It is important to note that we have a nice diversity across our manufacturing base. And, of course, the tariff hasn't yet been applied to apparel. But we are obviously monitoring the situation closely.","Michelle Gass","Great, and Dana, thanks for the question on Nine West. We are really excited to announce that today. We will be launching in mid-2019. As I mentioned, it will be broad based across categories. So we are going to develop with our partners, Authentic Brands Group, an exclusive line of apparel. And then, of course, we will be bringing in accessories like handbags and then footwear.","On the footwear side, we made great progress on the national brand side over the last couple of years, clearly on the athletic side with Nike and Under Armour and Adidas, and more recently on casual footwear. So, brands like UGG that we introduced a couple of years ago, Steve Madden, and Clarks and a few others.","So as we think about Nine West joining Kohl's, we think it's going again elevate the overall experience. And it's highly relevant to our female customers. And especially, we call it the millennial customers. So we are looking forward to that launch. In terms of to your question what it replaces, we are working through that as we speak. And it may vary depending on which are the particularly categories. But we do see this as a significant and exciting addition to the Kohl's lineup.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","And that will conclude the Q&A session.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. These instructions will be repeated when we're ready to begin the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Wes McDonald, Chief Financial Officer of Kohl's Department Stores. Please go ahead.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning. With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman and CEO and President. I'll start today's call by walking through our operational results. Kevin will then provide more details on our Greatness Agenda initiatives and then we'll open up the call to your questions at the end.","Comp sales increased 1.4% in the quarter, our second consecutive quarter of positive comps. We know that two quarters of positive comps is not overly impressive, but we think that this second quarter of growth is a clear indicator that the Greatness Agenda initiatives are gaining traction and we're well on our way to achieving our long-range goals.","Gross margin increased 17 basis points, slightly more than our expectation. Net income grew 2% and our earnings per share was $0.63, a 5% increase over last year. The 1.4% comp increase reflects higher transaction value, including a 2.7% increase in AUR, which was partially offset by a 1.3% decrease in units per transaction. Number of transactions were flat to last year, but that is a significant improvement over our longer-term trend, as our Greatness Agenda initiative gained traction.","Diving in a little deeper by line of business for the quarter, home, footwear and men's all reported increases greater than 3%. Children's was consistent with the company average. Accessories was essentially flat to last year, and women's was slightly negative.","Geographically, which now includes online originated orders, the Midwest was the strongest region. The west, northeast and southeast were consistent with the company average. The mid-Atlantic region reported higher sales but was slightly below the company average and the south-central region was slightly negative.","Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 36.9%. As I mentioned earlier, 17 basis points better than the first quarter of last year. Substantially all of the increase was due to higher merchandise margin rates driven by more strategic direct mail marketing and promotion. SG&A increased 2% and deleveraged 7 basis points compared to the first quarter last year which was less than expected. We were able to leverage our marketing, credit and store-distribution expenses. We achieved significant improvement in our fulfillment centers dedicated to online-generated orders.","However, planned increases in IT investments, as well as higher store fixed expenses, more than offset the leverage. Higher IT amortization was the primary reason for the $11 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense.","Interest expense was $84 million for the quarter essentially flat to last year. Our income tax rate was 35.3% for the quarter, this is almost 60 basis points better than last year as we had a favorable state tax audit settlement during the quarter. Diluted earnings per share increased 5% to $0.63 for the quarter and net income was $127 million for the quarter. We ended the quarter with 1,164 stores; gross square footage of 100.507 million square feet, selling square footage of 83.85 million square feet. We opened two new stores during the quarter.","Capital expenditures were $176 million for the quarter consistent with last year, IT spending was relatively flat year-over-year. Store refresh spending shifted from new stores and remodels to cosmetic shops but dollars were consistent. Corporate CapEx was also consistent year-over-year but shifted from opening our Dallas call center supporting our credit operations last year to our Menomonee Falls corporate campus this year.","We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalent. Inventory per store increased 4% and units per store increased 1% over last year. On a unit basis, national brands are up 10% per store while private and exclusive brands are down 5% and 7%, respectively. The difference between units per store and cost per store reflects the higher cost of national brands. AP as a percent of inventory increased from 34.7% in 2014 to 39.5% this year. The increase is primarily due to increased receipt volume partially offset by slower inventory turnover.","Our weighted average diluted shares were 202 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of our stock. We ended the quarter with 202 to million shares of stock outstanding. Yesterday our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share which is payable June 24 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 10.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin who will provide additional insights on our result.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Wes. It's been more than a year since we introduced the Greatness Agenda, our multi-year plan to be the most engaging retailer in America. The Greatness Agenda was built on five pillars. Amazing product, incredible savings, easy experience, personalized connections, and winning teams. These concepts are fundamental to the way we do business and we're continuing to approach them in new ways, ways that are inspirational, customer-centric, disruptive and often surprising.","Let me start with amazing product. Amazing product is about offering products in categories that excite our customers. This year, we're focused on key entertainment brands and properties including Cinderella, Marvel and the highly-successful the Jumping Beans and Disney collaboration. We will also be the family destination for all things Star Wars.","The second area of focus will be around our sports offering, featuring NFL, NCAA and Major League Baseball team shops presented in an entirely new way. Our goal is also to lead in the active category and become a destination for the wellness lifestyle. Key active and wellness initiatives include expanding Nike offerings, new and expanded brand launches including Bliss, Gaiam Yoga apparel and Champion and Puma. We also continue to launch new wearables that focus on wellness activities and sleep.","In the outdoor category we're planning a major relaunching of our Columbia brand this fall. New brands like Breville in small electrics, Fruit of the Loom in underwear and expansions with Fitbit and Nespresso have also occurred in the first quarter.","Easy experience is about creating seamless experiences often driven by the launching of new technology. We continue to have a lot of traction in our efforts to be world-class in mobile. We now have seven million app downloads and continue to enhance our tablet web and app experience. In the first quarter on tablet, we optimized our pages to be more search engine friendly, enabled multi-select filters resulting in better conversion and improved our big data algorithms to provide more relevant product recommendations.","Utilizing our wallet in our app we are now able to deliver personalized messages which can be scanned and redeemed in-store. We also launched voice-based search on Android and image-based search on both Android and iOS. The pace of development will actually accelerate in the second and third quarter across the mobile platform.","Last month we rolled out buy online pickup in store to our entire chain. Functionality is being rolled out in phases starting with desktops and laptops. Tablets and mobile will be added late summer into early and fall. Although it's early, we're extremely pleased with initial volumes and attachment sales.","And finally, 200 additional stores received the new beauty experience in the first quarter, and by August we expect to have brought this new experience to 900 of our stores. Continue to make excellent progress in building and activating an unmatched personalization capability. We are augmenting our behavior segmentation with shopper type, life stage and lifecycle data, and we now expect to have 5 billion personalized touches with consumers in 2015. We've expanded our localization assortment strategy and by the end of the year almost half of our business will be transitioned, tiered assortments by store, and all businesses will be localized by the end of next year.","As our Yes2You loyalty program matures, I become more confident than ever in the impact that it will have on strengthening customer loyalty and increasing sales. When we launched the program nationwide last October, we had 10 million customers enrolled in the program. After one month, we had over 17 million customers.","Today, almost 29 million customers are enrolled in the program and it grows every single day. Yes2You members tend to be younger, female and from more affluent households with kids. They tend to be from our most engaged customer segment. During the first quarter, over half of transactions were loyalty transactions. We continue to see that loyalty members are shopping more often and spending more with each trip. This is especially relevant as we saw a sizable decrease in shopping behavior for customers that are not part of the loyalty program.","It's important to note that we're seeing consistent results for customers that were part of the 2012 original pilot, the 2013 expansion and the 2014 nationwide launch. Despite the early success of the loyalty program we continue to design program enhancement. We're testing exclusive loyalty strategies including mystery point offers and loyalty days and rewarding customers for referrals along with social media interaction. And we're looking forward to the October anniversary of the nationwide launch and developing a national anniversary launch plan.","In closing, we're pleased with positive impact that the Greatness Agenda is having on our results and we remain committed to the bold moves that are part of the Greatness Agenda. In our national brand portfolio penetration increased 200 basis points and comps have been significantly better than in our proprietary brand portfolio. We're capturing the active and wellness market. Momentum in this category is strong and continues to grow even stronger. Active categories reported a high teen comp for the quarter.","Localization and personalization efforts continue to mature and loyalty exceeds our most optimistic expectations. We're pleased with the results we're seeing but we also recognize we still have opportunity to improve in businesses which are not as directly impacted by the Greatness Agenda initiatives. Specifically, areas like juniors and jewelry which were weaker.","At this time I'll turn the call back to our operator who will provide instructions on asking questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And one moment, please, for our first question. And that'll will be from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee CRT. Please go ahead.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Kevin, Wes, could you guys walk us through the cadence of the comps in the quarter in a bit more detail, how bad was February you spoke to that in your release and how much improvement have you seen in March and April and any color on May, in the first two weeks?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Well, we wouldn't be able to provide any color on May obviously, but quarter developed very differently. February was very weak and the March-April combined period because we can't really look at March or April independently due to the Easter shift but the March-April combined period I think accelerated to around 200 basis points.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, February slightly negative and March-April combined was around 200 basis points.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Around 200 basis points. Okay. Great. And then, Wes, just any difference in trend between credit versus non-credit?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","They were both positive. Non-credit was actually better than credit for the first time in a long time. We focused a lot of our efforts on loyalty and Kevin talked about and also really strengthened our lowest prices of the season event. In April we had our best event there in the last four years so a lot of things we're doing from a marketing perspective are to drive more occasional customers in more frequently but that's a good sign. We have to do that long-term to get the comp \u2013 the kind of comp lift we want to get going forward over the next three years so that was very encouraging.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean generally, Chuck, I think as we looked at the quarter, February was under our expectations for sure for some cases, I think, macro reasons. But March and April combined were basically right in the middle of what our expectations were.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Okay. And then on SG&A growth came in below what you guided, Wes, 1.6% year-over-year in dollars. How should we think about the cadence of SG&A dollar growth over the balance of the year? Is there any sort of pockets where if you expected it would be a little higher?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, I mean, there's no difference in our year guidance which is \u2013 I think it was 1.5% to 2.5%. We came in a little under. Some of that was in marketing which we'll continue to look at ways to reinvest that so for the second quarter I would look at SG&A being slightly up from our run rate probably closer to the 3% to 4% range. Some of that will depend on \u2013 we had an extremely strong quarter from a health and hospital perspective that continues. There could be some favorability there as well. Credit will continue to provide some leverage but that would be the sort of the elevated would be in the second quarter and then I think you can continue to use what you have in the back half to get you to the 1.5% to 2.5%.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","All right, great. Good luck. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew R. Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. So as we think about the margin profile longer-term, what would \u2013 I guess what would need to happen for you to see upside to the 9% EBIT margin target? And if you could just rank the gross margin drivers that you have from here to offset e-commerce and some of the mix headwinds? I think that would be really helpful.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Sure. In terms of operating margin, nothing's really changed from October. We said it was going to be 9%. We'd have to get better comps. That would probably be the number one driver of our performance in that. And then I guess the second biggest driver would be to see how big buy online, pickup in store can be to mitigate some of that shipping cost headwind which we've talked about in the past. As far as margin, how we got to be up the 17 basis points, it was a combination of better promotional markdowns and lower clearance markdowns offset by obviously a little bit lower IMU given the increase penetration in national brands.","Headwinds from national brands continued to run in that sort of 4 basis points to 7 basis points per 100 basis points that I talked about, so for the quarter it was 16 basis points. National brand penetration increased 227 basis points, so you can do the math, so it was closer to the seven basis points because private brands were a little bit worse on the comp side and also had a little bit lower margin.","Shipping costs were a little higher in the quarter than they are for the year, just because it's sort of a lower volume quarter. And we continued to work on the mix of online generated orders that get shipped from our stores versus our e-commerce fulfillment centers. So that continues to be a balance of cost and speed improvement if you ship it from the store but we have to continue to do a better job of making \u2013 we try to ship as many units together as we possibly can. So very happy with the margin performance this quarter, internally, it's the first time our merchants have hit margin plan since 2011. So, feeling very good about that and hopefully we can continue to do that going forward.","Matthew R. Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just from a top line perspective, what would be the drivers of the embedded multiyear acceleration beyond this year? If you could just kind of walk through what you have this year but then what you have in 2016 and 2017?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think we've kind of laid that out, Matt, in pretty good detail to be honest with you. I mean, we guided to a 1.5% to 2.5% for the year so let's just say the midpoint is 2% over the course of the year. And we're expecting to accelerate that modestly in year two and three of the three-year plan we gave you. And each of the component parts of the both bold and essential moves we're making under each of the pillars contribute some level of increasing volume over the course of the three-year period.","This year of course loyalty is very important. Longer-term, personalization is probably more important because as you know personalization has a big impact around the effectiveness of our marketing and driving more traffic into the stores. In all, transparency, I think the performance in the first quarter just increased our confidence that the three-year plan we laid out is very achievable.","Matthew R. Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Binder with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. I was curious if you had any sense of impact from port issues if any, with inventory and whether or not that would affect markdowns in Q2?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, generally port issues were a factor in first quarter selling in selected categories that are heavily impacted. But there's no question when we go to through the selling results that certain categories of classifications were negatively influenced by port delays. I don't expect any of those to have any impact looking forward on our merchandise margin.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","From an inventory perspective, it obviously delayed some receipts that came in later in the quarter. And the reaction when the port issues were occurring in the third and fourth quarter, we made some changes to pull up some receipts for back-to-school especially in active and footwear. So I would expect our inventory levels at the end of the second quarter to be up about where they are today. And then we continue to work towards ending the year with inventories on a unit basis at least down sort of that low single digit area but we wanted to make sure we protected the back-to-school business which is a big footwear time and obviously active has been a great business for us running up mid-teens this quarter so we wanted make sure we had enough inventory for that key season so we pulled up some receipt.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC","Have you tried to quantify the comp impact from those delays in Q1?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, because I mean at the end of the day, right, if there was any shortfall to our internal expectations on sales it was really about traffic. We're looking to drive increases in traffic and traffic was essentially flat in the first quarter. So the availability or non-availability of merchandise in a particular category really isn't influencing that.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC","You did mention that better or noted a more balanced promotional calendar. I'm not sure if we should \u2013 should we interpret as less promotions and do you think that affected traffic?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that the way you should think about that is it's related to our effort to be more effective, particularly around personalization and around loyalty and to get a more consistent pattern of sales results from both our credit customer, who continues to be critical to our success, but also our noncredit customer. So I just think fundamentally it's kind of reinforced in our minds as a leadership team that the path we're on around marketing effectiveness, personalization impact, personalized touches \u2013 I mentioned that we're going to have almost 5 billion personalized touches in our customer marketing this year \u2013 and loyalty is all on the right path. It's all the right thing to do and it's getting us the results we're looking for.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, I think from our perspective the bold moves delivered what we expected for the quarter. What really happened was the base business that doesn't really have any bold moves directly attached to it deteriorated a little bit. For example, juniors was really tough in the quarter, and that was a 90 basis points drag on our overall comp. So we expect to get that turned around in time for back-to-school. But that was a big part of the comp being a little bit lower than the higher end.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC","Got you. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question's from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, good morning. Just following up on the last question can you talk about each of the programs, the loyalty, cosmetics, e-commerce, etc. and how they impacted comp? And then what was the impact of the deterioration of the underlying or base business?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I don't think we're going to want to get into the individual quarter results in each of the bold moves under the pillars, to be honest, Lorraine. I would just broadly say and reinforce what Wes mentioned, which is that the bold moves drove the results that we expected them to. It just reinforced that we are on the right path and we should continue to aggressively implement them. Some of the base businesses were less exciting, and so they were more of a headwind in terms of our overall business.","Just in listening to the questions, I get the sense that there is some disappointment in our results and to be totally honest with you the management team, I think we had a great quarter. We were basically right in line with our expectations on sales. Merchandise margin overachieved because of the effectiveness of some of the marketing initiatives we put in place around personalization and loyalty and the company did a good job of managing expenses. So we're actually pretty excited about the quarter we had, and I think I would just reinforce again what Wes said, which is the bold moves in the Greatness Agenda are working, and if anything we're getting more excited about them as we look forward over the course of the next three years.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, oversimplified, the bold moves delivered what you would expect, like a 2.5% comp, let's call it. I just told you juniors was 90 basis points drag, Jewelry was 30 basis points, that's 120 basis points. That gets us pretty close to the 1.4%.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess just looking at it differently, the 1.4% is below your full-year guidance and the fourth quarter, you're obviously up against a very strong results from last year. So, maybe if you could help us \u2013 just as it relates to the back half what you expect will accelerate by then to get you back into the range of your full-year comp guidance?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, again, I don't think we want to get into quarterly results or monthly results and how each bold move impacts the overall results. I would only reinforce again our expectations for the year of a 1.5% to 2.5% comp with a pretty consistent result by quarter to get there. Of course there's always going to be differences. Weather in a particular quarter might impact it more positively or less positively. We feel really good about it.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","I mean, in November, December comp in 2013 was the best performance we had in like three years. We were able to comp that last year. Sometimes you guys have the tendency to oversimplify things with the two- and three-year stack comp. We have a lot of marketing tools in our arsenal to try to drive business even if the comp comparisons are difficult. That's what we get paid to do. So I think we'll come up with a good marketing calendar that will allow us to get that comp for the 1.5%, 2.5% for the entire year.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Swinand with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Research","Good morning and thanks for taking all the questions as usual. I just wanted to ask a little more color on the \u2013 your saying data algorithms and the billion touch points. Can you just give us a little more color on how it works? And then I guess a second part of that question as you get more and more touch points how do you ensure that you're not just adding more volume and the quality of touch increases, it doesn't start to lose engagement with the customer?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I mean the key metrics to try to understand whether or not the implementation of the personalization initiatives, including the loyalty component, really is about marketing effectiveness, right? I mean, are we spending the same amount of marketing as we did before and generating more sales results hopefully due to traffic mainly. And that's what we're seeing happen. So I think we laid out, in some detail, the areas that we're most focused on. There is a focus around personalization as it pertains to print inserts. So we gave you some examples of markets in which we're testing that impact with really positive results with the expectation it's going to roll out nationally this fall.","There's obviously a dramatic change in the way we're approaching direct mail, both on our big credit events which typically occur once a month and on our interim events which are things like pick a day so very big change there and we're getting really clearly better results on marketing there.","And then the third piece of course which I touched on in the call is the impact of our ability to now with our customers deliver personalized offers to their wallet through the Kohl's app which as we said already has 7 million app downloads and growing. So the combination of all those things are sort of different examples one on the digital side, another on the print side and the third is direct mail of how personalization impacts how we spend money.","The end result is we should expect that we're going to get a better sales results with spending no more money than we did before. And so far, both in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, the results have kind of reinforced that.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it doesn't necessarily mean an increase in frequency. It's just a better offering that's targeted more to you. If you buy men's clothes, it doesn't make sense to send you a mailer that's full of a lot of Lauren Conrad and Jennifer Lopez. So it's definitely not a frequency thing.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Research","Okay, great. Thanks a lot for that.","Operator","Our next question is from Taposh Bari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Taposh Bari, your line open if you're on mute possibly.","And we will move on to Bob Drbul with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Hey, Bob.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","I guess Kevin a couple of questions on you talked about expanding your Nike offering and the relaunch at Columbia. Can you just provide a little bit more detail sort of on the timing of that and what exactly is going on with both of those brands?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I mean, the expansion of our Nike offering includes intensification in inventory levels overall. And broadening the mix of what we offer on a style basis as well. And it's ongoing throughout the year though I think there'll be an acceleration as we move into the third quarter. On the Columbia brand, I would put that in the context almost of a relaunch and that's been a great brand for us for a number of years that we haven't done as good a job as we should have in presenting to the customer.","So there are levels of the Columbia brand relaunch but it includes entering much more aggressively into the sportswear category in addition to the traditional outerwear and cold weather accessories and to have a much bigger presence online. And then we've identified in the range of 300 to 350 stores that'll have a much different in-store presentation, an enhanced shop essentially in both women's and men's. So it's a pretty big deal, Bob.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, I mean, Nike was up better than the active and wellness category it was up about 19% comp and Columbia on a very small base, was up 45%.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Got it. And just on the capital allocation piece of it can you just provide updated thoughts around that? And particularly are you contemplating would M&A be in the mix at all as you look at your cash flow from here going forward?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think it's always been in the mix. We covered that at the investor conference. I think we even reinforced it again at the beginning of the year. But it's within and through the filters of our Greatness Agenda, so as we look at possible acquisition opportunities, they would really need to provide leverage within the existing Kohl's business that we have today in addition to perhaps being a way for us to grow our overall sales.","So, we're not really looking at any businesses that would just be a bolt-on, I mean, I think we want to stay true to the filters of the Greatness Agenda and regardless of the area that an acquisition might develop in it would really need to reinforce something we're doing in our pillars or our bold moves and in some way be leveraged inside of Kohl's to get the maximum benefit.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","I mean, with that filter, I think it would be very unlikely that we would buy a wholesale brand because that would cause distribution that the brand may currently have to possibly go away and then so you're paying for a lot of sales that no longer exists. So, it would have to be a smaller type company that had growth outside of Kohl's but like Kevin said possibility is for us to bring it inside as well.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt McGinley with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on the personalization effort as it relates to non-credit versus credit sales. I believe you said that the non-credit sales were higher than the credit sales in the quarter. What does a personalized offer look like for a non-credit recipient versus somebody that is actually on the credit program today?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Well, it's really so far through our lens of loyalty. So to try to use the data we have, that's really all the data we have so far in the non-credit card customer that's really actionable. So we try to take what they do as well and then broadly, which is less to do with personalization, it's strengthening events like friends and family and like the LPS to be stronger from a price perspective, and as Kevin mentioned earlier, trying to \u2013 basically it's just a reallocation of markdowns so we're moving some markdowns where we weren't getting a ton of incremental sales related to the credit portfolio and reinvesting them in broader vehicles like friends and family and LPS to drive the overall business.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","I mean, the third piece is also just personalization as it relates to our app. Because roughly half of those downloads have been customers who are not credit customers. So we're continuing to utilize that as a way to reach them with more personalized offerings.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Next question is more of a modeling question on depreciation. In the beginning of the year you guided depreciation about $940 million and at the run rate you had in the first quarter is going to be pretty significantly under that. Is there some favorability you had in depreciation where there may have been a surge at the end of the year where that rate would come in for total dollars at a lower rate than what you had originally guided?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","No, I still expected it to be $940 million. We have a tendency to be conservative on that guidance given the fact that IT projects are not to the day delivered when we think they are so it's more likely than not we'll be under but I don't think it's going to be significant.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Good morning.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Good morning.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Kevin, could you speak a little bit more about some of your product categories? So two product categories in one region, that's what I'd love to chat about. So home did really well. Could you give us a little sense of what's going on there since it performed above the chain average? Is it national brands? Is it around decors and around essentials? Like any sort of color would be helpful.","Then on the flipside on the other end of the spectrum women's it sounds like Columbia is part of an initiative to maybe boost up some national name brand in sportswear. There are there other maybe unannounced yet initiatives going on in women's to kind of boost that up may be in the second half?","Then Wes for you on South-Central being negative you guys dug deep into oil-based economy type situations, are you seeing particular weakness in local economies that are really dependent on oil? That would be helpful. Thanks.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","I'll actually take one merchant question, believe it or not. So on the home side, a lot of it's about electrics and the wellness side of things, so Fitbit and Jawbone and some of those things we've brought in to support wellness Gaiam and then also bedding and bath were very strong. And then from some things that were a little bit weaker, luggage was slightly negative and then tabletop was pretty tough.","On the South Central region, as your question was a leading question, and you're right, the oil-based regions have some deterioration. Texas is a little worse than the rest of the South Central region, particularly Houston.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","On the Women's thing, Neely, that's two different tales I would say. Our core Women's business the Missy, the plus size, the intimate business, actually was very good and outpaced the overall store comp. I don't exactly know when the last time that happened. Wes probably does, but it's been a long time. So I would say that was something that we're really excited about. That was a big difference and a huge change in the trend. It's an area that we've been really focused on improving on and we have some initiatives going in the fall, including certainly the Columbia one, but initiatives around our active business that are driving some of those results and things like the re-intensification of our Nike Business, the launch of brand like Gaiam are having a really positive impact in the active space.","On the other end of the spectrum is our juniors business. The juniors business underperformed the store by quite a lot, so that was a drag on the overall Women's business, and that's something as Wes said that we're working hard on and we expect to get turned in the other direction as we go into the second quarter.","Neely J. N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Michael Binetti with UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey guys so a question on loyalty, as you look at lapping the loyalty launch program nationally I know you said you're focused on lapping that which is a big boost to trends late in the year last year. I think you said you're testing some new components in the same markets that were your pilot markets for the loyalty program last year. Can we hear a little bit more about those tests, what you're seeing and how do those tests roll through the year this year?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there is a plan. Let's break it down into pieces. On loyalty overall, when we developed the multiyear plan we gave you, which included the 1.5% to 2.5% comp this year, loyalty growth was a component part of that. It really was only a component part of that through the first three quarters. We did not include any expectation for our loyalty list in the fourth quarter at all. What we now think is that given the growth, which has been significantly higher than our expectations were, and given the results we're getting, that that could provide a boost in the fourth quarter from our original expectation. And the reason we feel that way is we're putting together sort of an anniversary of the launch last year in combination with the testing that we're doing. So we kind of covered a few of the testing things in the call, I think relative...","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, we're not going to give you the results of the tests, but we're testing a lot of different things and we'll use those in our playbook as we move through the fourth quarter and then into next year. And the other obvious thing is we're going to have probably 35 million people on loyalty going into the fourth quarter, which is double what we had in the fourth \u2013 going into the fourth quarter last year.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So really, I mean, I think Wes and I both agree that the really important component as we go into the holiday season of our change overall in customer engagement probably is around personalization, because personalization really had little to any impact in the fourth quarter of last year and we expect it to have a massive impact on our performance this year.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. So if we could talk about e-commerce margins for a minute, you've talked about the disadvantage that you guys have structurally from your lower AURs and how that hurts as you participate in the cost of business, let's call it free shipping. Can you talk about any new initiatives you're looking at that can help you fight back from traditional e-tailers like Amazon with their big Prime program to help you boost margins in e-commerce against that kind of an industry backdrop?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Well, we're focusing more on omni-channel as the lines are getting all blurred, but your question is relevant in terms of shipping costs. The biggest, I think, advantage that we're going to use is buy online pickup in store. We just launched it. It's early. We had a couple of days where we had 6% or 7% of the business was \u2013 on an order perspective \u2013 was buy online pickup in store, which saves you $5 a box on average from shipping cost and we're seeing attachments rates between 15% and 20%.","So that's the biggest thing I think that will help us against not only Amazon and others but just in improving the overall profitability of that online generated order business against last year. I think that's the biggest one. And then like I mentioned in my comments, we're doing a much better job in e-fulfillment, our UPH and the DCs was up I think over 20% this quarter and we still believe there's continued room there. The most difficult problem we have is trying to figure out the balance between where to host the inventory in the stores versus the EFC and where to fulfill the order.","There's a lot of unlocked opportunity there from a maximizing store inventory productivity but it has to also be balanced off against the extra cost that you have to split shipments because that just adds another $5 to your shipping cost. So we're learning there. We've got all of our smartest people on it from e-com perspective, fulfillment perspective, IT perspective but it's going to be a learning year on that for this. This would be the first year where we've really significantly done ship from store in all four quarters.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Just as a quick follow-on is the buy online, pick up in store savings in the attachment rates, are those in the early days here, are those trending roughly in line with what you saw when you pointed us to e-commerce margins improving mid single digit?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, I had no expectation honestly. I put in like 1% for BOPUS. So anything above one would be a benefit and the attachment rates are kind of in line with what we expected but that's nothing we really built into that three-year plan. So as that continues to mature that could provide some upside to it.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, the other upside is buy online pickup in store while we finished the launch nationally at the end of the first quarter and the results Wes is talking about have to do with that, it's only available as we mentioned in the call right now on desktop and laptop and so mobile which rolls out in the second quarter essentially could be a huge lift to the impact of BOPUS because, as you know, mobile traffic is what's driving the business.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, thank you. As you do kind of post-game February what are your thoughts on changes you might have been able to make in the marketing or inventory management of product. It sounds like that was more of a one-time trend in nature. I was just curious about that. And then we also wanted to ask about how you're feeling about the inventory freshness now in terms of your inventories relative to your sales? And what kind of near-term strategies you might have as you think about that?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Well, I'll take the inventory. AP as percent of inventory is up 500 basis points versus last year so I feel very good about the freshness of the inventory. As I mentioned on the call, it's materially invested in national brands which have very little markdown risk and supports the active and wellness initiatives primarily which are up mid-teens. So I don't \u2013 there's not going to be a margin problem in the second quarter.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","On the marketing, I mean, honestly, I don't think there's anything, I mean, there's always things in any individual event that we would do differently every week of the year. But in general, I don't think we felt that there were any problems at all with the marketing effort in February. To be honest with you, I think it was probably functionally a low traffic month that was heavily hindered and hampered in certain parts of the country by weather.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, we spent $5 million more on snow removal in February. So that was probably the biggest issue.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Just to follow up on personalization, which sounds like a big opportunity, what are the \u2013 are all categories a big opportunity there and is traffic the main upside driver as personalization works? I'm just curious about some of the finer details as we think about that for the back half.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, personalization impacts the customer experience in the whole store. So I wouldn't call out any particular areas more advantaged of personalization versus another. I mean, there's three really big impacts on personalization. One, it drives incremental sales. There's just no question about that. Everything we've looked at through the testing and the now more rollout reinforces that.","Two, we know it's a more effective use of our marketing dollars. We can spend the same amount of money and get better sales result if our offers which as you know are plentiful, are more personalized and targeted. We don't waste markdowns where customers don't care and yet we target the markdown we're taking very much in what they want, so marketing effectiveness is really important aspect.","And the third piece is we'd like to think that if our forecast bears fruit, as it did in the first quarter, that what would result is a more effective merchandise margin as well because we'll spend markdowns really on things that will trigger more traffic.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And finally, back-to-school, it sounds like active is a major component. What do you think is the most different on year-over-year basis as we look to your inventory planning or marketing planning for the back-to-school and fall season?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, probably the one category which was uniquely particularly weak last year which has definitely seen an improved trend is denim and that's positive everywhere. So I think if you go back to last year's back-to-school, denim generally, probably not just for Kohl's but a lot of retailers was a big drag on traffic and sales in the quarter, it's an important category. It's a destination category for us as you know and it's a relatively high, average retail and transaction influencer. And so an improved trend in denim is really a good signal for what could come for back-to-school.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Is that high-rise, low-rise, and mid-rise and washes and different treatments, are you seeing this with your customers?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean it just depends on the individual business and I think while we're been oversimplifying this, Oliver. As we saw the massive growth over the last let's say 18 months in the active business, we saw to some extent a corresponding slowdown in the denim business and what's nice to see right now \u2013 and denim is a really important part of our overall business particularly as you said back-to-school. But what we're seeing now is the active trend continues if anything it's accelerating and the denim business is starting to resuscitate. So, I wouldn't call out any particular space in the store or any particular fit or silhouette in the store. I would just think about it more as, okay, denim looks like it's returning more to normal.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Bob Drbul might be able to answer that question for you.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I'll have to give him a call about skinny denim later. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Kevin you talked about performance in the base business versus the bold moves and obviously the full-year plan is for total comp. So if you are seeing some unexpected weakness in specific categories like juniors can you just talk about what gives you the increased confidence that the bold moves will be enough to offset that through the year? Then specifically do you expect comp trend to improve through the year or will the ramping initiatives be somewhat offset by some of these other headwinds that you identified?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","On the overall question which has to do with comp trends, I think the fact that we had 1.4% comp in the first quarter and we're reinforcing that we believe even more strongly in the 1.5% to 2.5% for the year sort of implies that we expect there will be an acceleration of comp trends. And there's a whole bunch of reasons behind that, most of which we've kind of already covered.","The bold moves versus the base, essentially the bold moves met or exceeded in every single case our expectation. And yes, I would say there's a couple of areas that were a surprise. We didn't expect the slowdown in juniors to be to the degree that it was. We didn't expect the slowdown in jewelry to be to the degree it was. But to be honest Mark, there are always businesses and categories in the store that sort of cycle through positives and negative periods and quarters and we've been pretty good at being able to address those and deal with it and improve the trend.","So, that is not an area I'm worried at all about. I mean, our entire focus is all about the pillars and the bold moves because over the course of a longer period of time, things like the weather influence in February or the impact of a port delay on a category or multiple categories of merchandise go away and you come back to looking at your underlying strategies and those strategies, if anything, I would say we have increased confidence in. So, I think we tried to communicate at a pretty high level of confidence at the end of the fourth quarter and what we saw, I would say were there or more today. We actually feel better today.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. And can you update us specifically on your plans for SONOMA and maybe talk about the opportunity to improve the shop ability in the women's department?","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Sure. I mean, both of those are high priorities for us. We'll probably, as we move into fall, talk in more detail about essentially a reinvention of our overall Women's business as we move forward. Certainly a big component part of that, but also a big component part of business in men's and home and footwear and accessories is the SONOMA brand. And SONOMA brand is one of our biggest single brands in the store. It does over $1 billion a year and the results have been lackluster. So without going into great detail on the call, I would just say to you that we're really highly focused on improving the clarity around our SONOMA brand and I would expect to hear about essentially a relaunch of the SONOMA brand as we move into the end of this year into next year, but we'll take steps along the way","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, in Missy, actually, in the first quarter was basically flat. That was a big improvement over its trend. So I think it's definitely moving in the right direction.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks again, and best of luck.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Thanks.","Operator","And next we'll go to Bernard Sosnick with Gilford Securities. Please go ahead.","Bernie Sosnick - Gilford Securities, Inc.","Thank you. With regard to your last comment about women's being flat that of course includes the juniors. And flat I can see from your mix of sales the women's down to 30% of the total in 2014, 260 basis points lower than in 2007. Flat is quite good. So could you tell us a little bit more about what's happened in women's because in fact you just said earlier that much more is expected in the fall. Could you flesh that out?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well there's a lot of pieces to that, Bernie. In our overall Women's business, of course we include our traditional Missy and plus size business. We include our intimate business. We include, of course, our juniors business. The performance in the first quarter in Women's was better in total than it has been. So we had a better trend. In particular, though, which is the area we're most focused on because it's our core customer, our Missy business was significantly better and actually ran \u2013 I think, Wes, better than the store did.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, Missy was up about 2%.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So there's been a lot of attention given to I would say two big things. One we're benefiting from a really strong position in active and wellness in women, and that business is running way better than the overall women's business is. And that's being driven essentially by both national proprietary brands, Nike on the national brand side and both Fila Sport and Tech Gear on the proprietary side.","We also launched at the very end of the quarter, though it didn't have a meaningful impact on the quarter results, it's going to on the year, a new yoga brand, an initiative with Gaiam, and that's going to be a significant lift as well. So active has influenced it positively. The effort around clarity of offering I think is influencing it positively, and the combination of both of those things are getting our Women's business back to where it needs to be. And as you said, Women's is important because essentially that's our core customer.","Bernie Sosnick - Gilford Securities, Inc.","One other thing in that regard, juniors actually I think you said at the meeting in the fall had been running favorably, an improvement over a weak trend and then suddenly there was a reversal in the first quarter. Now these things happen in the fashion business but why do you believe there was such an extreme change?","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, typically when you see \u2013 my experience has been over time, when you typically see that, it's about product. And as you said, faster businesses, younger businesses can have more reactions in an interim period as it relates to the product that's being offered. So I would say the primary driver of the poor performance in juniors has to do with the product offering we gave the customer and that's what we've got to address. What's nice is that it's a fast-moving business, so you can address it really, really quickly.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, you can fix really quickly.","Bernie Sosnick - Gilford Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much. That's helpful.","Wesley S. McDonald - CFO, Senior Executive VP & Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Bernie.","Operator","And we have time for one final question and that will be from Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.","Patrick G. McKeever - MKM Partners LLC","All right. Thanks. So just a couple. First of all just wondering if you are feeling any wage pressure just given what's going on in retail with some of the bigger retailers raising wages? And then just secondly Kevin and Wes wondering if you could give us an overall assessment of the consumer and any thoughts around gas prices being down $1 or so year-over-year and perhaps why more of that is not going to retail or at least that's what appears to be the case? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, overall in wages, Pat, our expectation is wages will continue to rise and we've put that into our thinking over the course of the year and my expectation is wages will probably continue to rise and we've always managed that. I feel pretty effectively because we really taken a sort of trade area by trade area approach to it. The pay what is necessary to get the kind of quality associate we need and combine it with the kinds of other benefits and working environment that kind of retains them. So while it is a headwind I guess you would say over the course of the near-term, it's built into our thinking already.","On the consumer, I know some of the sales results in the first quarter around some of the retail companies have been probably less than expectations were. First of all, we don't endorse expectations on a quarterly basis. One of the reasons we do annual guidance is because we look at this business over the course of a much longer-term. And individual quarterly results just like in the past individual monthly results don't really provide a gauge for the underlying consumer sentiment. So we're pretty happy with the results in the first quarter. And there isn't anything that we're seeing with the consumer that would change our view for the year. I think it's still generally positive versus last year. So we think over the course of time, the consumer is in a better place and is going to have a positive impact on our sales.","Patrick G. McKeever - MKM Partners LLC","Good stuff. Got it. Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Pat.","Wesley S.

Sir, please go ahead.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thank you. Good morning. With me today is Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President. I'll start today's call by walking through our financial results, and then Kevin will provide an operational update and our thoughts on 2017. We'll then open up the call to your questions. Comp sales decreased 2.2% for the quarter, consistent with the 2.1% holiday decline that we reported in January.","For the year, comp sales decreased 2.4%. As we look at the comp metrics for the quarter, average transaction value increased 3.8%, average unit retail increased 3.7%, while units per transaction increased 0.1%. Transactions per store declined 6.0% for the quarter. For the year, average transaction value increased 3.1%, average unit retail was up 1.5%, and units per transaction were up 1.6%. Transactions per store were down 5.5% for the year.","From a line of business perspective, men's was the strongest category for both the quarter and the year. Accessories was the weakest category in both periods. On a regional basis, the Southeast was the strongest for the quarter, and the West was the strongest for the year. The South Central region was the most challenging in both periods.","Our gross margin improved 33 basis points for the quarter as we improved in both permanent and promotional markdowns. For the year, gross margin decreased 6 basis points as increases in the final three quarters were not sufficient to offset the first quarter decline.","SG&A increased $28 million to $1.36 billion for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, SG&A deleveraged 106 basis points. Our credit area was the only area to leverage their expenses versus last year. For the year, SG&A expenses were $4.43 billion, a decrease of $17 million from 2015. As a percentage of sales, SG&A deleveraged 55 basis points. Our teams again did an admirable job of managing our expenses against their internal plans, but most were unable to leverage on the lower sales.","Depreciation expense was $239 million for the quarter and $938 million for the year. Both were consistent with last year and our expectations.","Interest expense decreased $4 million for the quarter and $19 million for the year. Lower interest on capital leases as the portfolio matures and the store closures that we had earlier in the year contributed to the decreases for both the quarter and the year. The annual decrease also reflects favorable interest rates achieved during our $1.1 billion debt refinancing in 2015.","Our income tax rate was 36.7% for the quarter and 36.6% for the year. Our tax rate increased in both periods as the prior-year periods included some favorable state tax audit settlements that we didn't repeat in 2016.","For the quarter, net income was $252 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.44. There were no special items in the fourth quarter in either year. For the year, on a reported GAAP basis, net income was $556 million and diluted earnings per share was $3.11. Excluding store closure and restructuring costs in 2016, and debt extinguishment losses in 2015, net income was $673 million for the year and diluted earnings per share were $3.76. We ended the year with 1,154 Kohl's stores with gross square footage of 99.1 million square feet and selling square footage of 82.8 million square feet.","During the year, we opened nine Kohl's stores and closed 19 stores. Eight of the nine new stores are in our new small 35K store format. We also operate 12 FILA outlets and three Off\/Aisle centers. We ended the year with $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $367 million over last year, reflecting improving working capital, especially in inventory.","For the year, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow, a $593 million improvement over last year and the highest free cash flow in our history. We made additional progress on our inventory reduction initiatives during the quarter, reducing inventory per store by about 5%. All businesses and all brand types reported lower inventory levels. We were also better able to flow in our spring transitional goods. As a result, our AP to inventory ratio increased 870 basis points to 39.7%.","Capital expenditures were $768 million, $78 million higher than last year. Most of this increase is due to spending for our fifth e-commerce fulfillment center, which is scheduled to open next year. Our actual capital expenditures were lower than our guidance of $825 million due to the timing of payments and the shifting of several IT projects into 2017. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million in 2017, of which approximately $350 million is for IT spending, with the remainder split between store strategies and base capital, primarily an omnichannel investment.","Weighted average diluted shares were 175 million for the quarter and 179 million for the year. We repurchased 2.7 million shares of our stock during the quarter, bringing our total for the year to 13.3 million. We ended the quarter with 174 million shares of stock outstanding.","On Wednesday, our board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. The $0.55 dividend is payable March 22 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 8.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin who will provide some additional insights on our results.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Wes. While I would like to make a few comments regarding 2016, most of my thoughts will be focused on our plans for 2017 and beyond.","From a strength perspective, we made great progress last year on the management of our inventory levels and expenses across the company. We also showed great improvement during the course of the year on merchandise margin. Our opportunity, of course, continues to be on the top line, and that has been driven by disappointing traffic metrics. I still believe that the strategic framework of the Greatness Agenda is the path to changing that top line trend over time, and our associates feel the same way.","In our focus on product initiatives, we've successfully grown the depth and breadth of our national brand portfolio, and we saw national brand penetration increase to 54% of sales last year. National brands were up low-single digits for the year, with particular strength in NIKE, Carter\u00b4s, Levi's, Columbia and Van Heusen, and the launch of Apple Watches in the fourth quarter.","As we move into 2017, we expect the launch of Under Armour will drive the penetration even higher, and project it to be a significant enough business in year one to add 75 basis points to 100 basis points to our overall company comp.","We're also starting to see better results in our private brands as our speed initiatives take hold. Our key private brands which were involved in our speed initiative last year achieved a low single-digit positive comp in total for the fourth quarter. As the speed initiative expands this spring to other private and exclusive brands across apparel and soft home, the percentage of our proprietary brand business impacted by the speed initiative will move from 25% at the end of last year to about 40% of our overall proprietary sales this year.","In addition, the relaunch of our Jumping Beans children's brand should turn that business from a drag on our sales to a major positive.","And finally, our localization efforts now impact about 85% of our assortment and are having a positive impact on sales, as well as reducing inventory levels at the same time.","In our focus on omnichannel initiatives, we are beginning to see the results of our multi-year multi-billion-dollar investment in digital technology as online demand and fulfillment metrics are improving. Online demand was up in the low-teens for both fourth quarter and for the year. We also improved our shipping and fulfillment expenses as a percentage of digital sales, while increasing the speed to customer by half a day overall.","Just as importantly, approximately one-third of our digital sales units were either shipped from store or picked up in our stores in the fourth quarter. Our ship-from-store capability enhancements, along with buy online, pick-up in store enhancements, have improved the customer experience and leveraged the power of our store portfolio. We'll be aggressively marketing the BOPUS functionality option and ease this year, and expect the penetration to climb significantly in 2017.","Mobile continues to drive digital engagement metrics, and 30% of our digital sales came from mobile devices for the year. Mobile devices account for over 50% of our digital traffic. The investments and experiences involved in our Kohl's Wallet, our Kohl's app, and Kohl's Pay are driving our 19 million Wallet users' engagement. The same is true of our mobile-centric Yes2You Rewards loyalty program.","Moving on to our focus on inventory and expense management. Inventory levels and receipt flows were areas we made major progress on last year, and we saw the benefits of that growing in importance throughout the year. By year-end, overall inventory was down about 5% in dollars and 7% in units.","More importantly, our fall seasonal inventory was down about 25%, and our spring forward transitional inventory was up about 9% within that total. This impacted several key metrics very positively, including merchandise margin for the fourth quarter, in-store and logistics expenses related to material handling, and a dramatic improvement, as Wes mentioned, in cash flow for the year.","Our intent is to continue to lower inventory per store about 3% per year for the next three years at cost, with larger reductions at retail and in units. An improved supply chain focused on speed, localization initiatives, and leveraging technology to increase the percentage of inventory shipped from stores to fulfill online demand or online demand picked up in store will all play a factor in this. This is one of the most important initiatives in the company.","We're also pleased with our ability to manage our expenses lower when we did not achieve our expected sales results last year. With the pressure of higher hourly wages in our stores and distribution network, spending less overall on SG&A was a very meaningful accomplishment. Having said that, we need to do better. As a result, we've launched a profit improvement project, take significant expense out of our company. I expect to share more about that effort as we go through this year, and expect some impact coming later this year with the majority coming in 2018 and 2019.","Drivers of that effort will be to improve speed and agility across the company, in the same way we've accomplished it in our product and inventory initiatives. As I just indicated, on the product side, this has resulted in lower inventory levels and better profitability. And I believe the same approach in our expense structure will have a similar and permanent impact. I would expect all areas of our expense lines to participate in the profit improvement project.","Moving on to our focus on store optimization. As you know, we made a decision to close 18 stores last year, with most closing in June. Now that the fourth quarter is behind us, we've been able to measure the impact of those closures in a number of ways, at a customer level, at a store and market level, and on the impact in online sales.","We believe that overall, we've retained about a third of the sales from the closed stores in other nearby stores, and about 90% of the online sales in those areas. This is less than we estimated. We want to continue to monitor the results throughout the spring season. Those results will help inform future decision-making on store optimization.","Our overall perspective though and the importance of our store portfolio remains the same. We believe stores are very important and critical component of our future success, and we're committed to leverage them to their full extent. There's great power in stores in an omnichannel world.","We also know, however, that the average sales per store have fallen as online sales have risen. And so an ongoing rigorous process for store performance review is critical to long-term success. We continue to review performance by store. It's against the menu of options considered to improve that performance when less than desired. Certainly, our first focus continues to be to drive traffic in a positive direction in all stores, and included among actions after that are the following.","First, remerchandising and refixturing full-sized but lower volume stores to improve both profitability and customer experience. This effort is called standard to small, and is being expanded this year by 200 stores. It has shown, to-date, no result in an impact on sales, but an increase in gross margin due to right-sized inventories, and lower four-wall SG&A due to lower inventory and more efficient use of space.","A second option is rightsizing or relocating existing stores into smaller footprints. This allows us to maintain our presence and trade area, and improve productivity and profitability in much the same way. Our 55,000 square-foot and our new 35,000 square-foot prototypes now allow us to execute this profitably given that we've built the operating model through the testing of these stores.","The final option, of course, is removing from our store portfolio, those stores that don't make a positive financial contribution and look to have no promise to do so. This is only done when the first two options don't provide a better solution. This was the case with the stores we closed last year. And future decisions will now be informed more directly from that experience.","The result of all of these efforts is that we'll achieve a rationalization of square footage over time, not necessarily fewer stores, but probably less square footage.","In summary, before I turn it back to Wes to provide 2017 guidance, I want to reinforce that while we're committed to investing in the long-term health of our business, we also intend to continue to be good stewards of capital. As you saw in our press release, our board has approved a 10% increase in our dividend for 2017. In addition, we'll continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchase program, would expect to purchase less than we did in 2016, targeting $300 million to $400 million in repurchases. We do feel that the uncertainty in our sector will continue, and we want to maintain a strong balance sheet that would allow us to execute quickly as opportunities arise to garner share.","So, with that, I'll turn it back to Wes to provide some information on guidance.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Kevin. We expect earnings per diluted share of $3.50 to $3.80 for fiscal 2017, including the 53rd week. The guidance is based on the following assumptions: comp sales of flat to down 2%; total sales of down 1.3% to up 0.7%, including the 53rd week. Sales in the 53rd week are estimated to be approximately $160 million. Gross margin rate performance to increase 10 basis points to 15 basis points. We would expect more significant improvement in the first quarter with the remainder of the year with very modest improvement.","Our SG&A dollars are going to increase 50 basis points to 2%. Excluding the 53rd week in 2017, we would expect SG&A dollars to be flat to up 1.5%. SG&A dollars in the 53rd week are expected to be approximately $25 million.","Depreciation expense for the year of $960 million. Interest expense of $300 million for the year. Our tax rate for the year is going to be projected to be 37.5%. Tax rate's higher than our historical rate as new accounting rules will require us to recognize income tax benefits and tax efficiencies related to share-based payments as income tax expense rather than as equity in our balance sheet. Given our current stock price, we would expect the new rule to increase our effective tax rate. The effect will not be equal by quarter. For the first quarter, I would expect it to be approximately 39.5% for the quarter, but still be 37.5% for the year. And the guidance assumes share repurchases of $350 million.","With that, we'll be happy to take the questions you have at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And one moment please for our first question. And we'll go to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow up, Kevin, on the comment that you made about reacting quickly as opportunities arise to garner share and how that relates to your balance sheet. Is that speaking of an acquisition in particular? And would you be looking at stores or brands? Or maybe just a little bit more color on that and how it might impact your share buyback this year.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","There isn't anything specific in mind, Lorraine. I think it's informed by two things. One, it's just an acknowledgment that we've been unable, to-date, to drive the top line positive, and so being more thoughtful about the balance sheet simply makes sense to us. But yes, secondarily, I think that we do want to stay in a particularly strong capital and balance sheet standpoint in order to take advantage of things like new brands that might come where we could invest in them, much in the same way as we did with Under Armour, and drive increased top line in the future.","So things like new brands certainly come to mind, perhaps store opportunities where we have relocation or rightsizing availability. So I wouldn't say there's anything in particular, but it's sort of acknowledging the environment that we're in and, at the same time, recognizing that we're in phenomenally good capital shape, and so we want to be poised if something appears to us to be an opportunity.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, I think it's also, as Kevin mentioned in his comments, the uncertainty in the environment would cause, I think, most retailers to increase the amount of cash cushion just to provide some flexibility. And I'll echo Kevin's comment; the Under Armour fixtures were not cheap. So it's helpful to have those type of flexibility for investments should new brands come up on the horizon.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question's from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Nice job on the inventory execution. We had a question related to accessories and women's. What do you think needs to happen to that product? And has that improved? Do you expect it to interplay with improved traffic? And a second question was on the omnichannel CapEx this year. What are the key projects that you're conducting? And what are you prioritizing in terms of the CapEx for omnichannel? Thank you.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Oliver. It's Kevin. And I'll answer on the product side, and Wes can mention some of the specifics around the investments on capital and omnichannel. I mean accessories has been a drag on the business, both in the fourth quarter, where it underperformed actually the most of all of our six business categories, and also for the year, where it was similar in terms of underperformance, and I think it's all product related. And so you've heard Michelle talk about the need to improve product decisions, about the need to improve speed in our sourcing in order to flow receipts more quickly when we see product cycles develop, to lower inventory so that we have more flexibility. And it's clearly a big focus.","Our women's business overall has more modestly underperformed, not to the extent that accessories did, but they're connected, as you well know. So I think it's a lot about product, and I think she feels like the inventory management initiatives, the product initiatives that we're focused on will improve it over time. And it includes, of course, the underperformance in our fine jewelry business as well. On the initiatives and the omnichannel investment, I'll let Wes tell you...","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, I think the one thing in accessories that we are pleased with is the continued strength of the beauty business, and we expect to continue to grow that in 2017 as well. From an omnichannel perspective, there's a couple things going on. We'll continue the rollout of our new point-of-sale system, which should help our associates in the store assist customers easier to look at things in the store and online. Kevin mentioned that 50% of the traffic is coming from mobile, so a lot of the projects are continuing to improve the conversion rate on the mobile side of the business. As most people, our conversion rate on a phone is a lot less than a conversion rate on a desktop. We want to make that as frictionless as possible.","And then Kevin also mentioned we spent a lot of dollars in capital on our fifth e-commerce fulfillment center. We'll spend some additional dollars and open that sort of in the back-to-school timeframe to be ready for holiday. We would expect that distribution center to be three times as productive as our existing fulfillment centers, given the level of automation that we're putting into that building.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. And, Kevin, you gave a lot of great framework for the real estate and square footage. The five-year story on square footage, do you have a yardstick about where that may end up, whether it'd be 10% to 20% lower? And as you think about the square footage, is there an interplay between resource allocation and also the ability for a right-sized optimized footprint to have stronger traffic, in-store traffic?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","There's no vision in terms of the square footage in the future. I think the thing that we're pretty aligned on is that with more business being initially driven online, while we will continue to work hard to improve the percentage of that, that we can fulfill from our stores, whether shipped from store or buy online, pick up in store. The overall impact is that the brick-and-mortar stores will continue to probably do a little bit less. We're trying to modestly improve that, of course, from where it's been because we were down, as Wes said, traffic in the 5% to 6% range last year. But it's really all focused on the strategies we just talked about. We do think that having a big footprint is really important. We sort of suspected that as we closed the stores that we closed last June, that it could have an impact on omnichannel sales in those trade areas, and it did. So that just sort of reinforces the need to have a great footprint, but they'll be smaller. I mean that's really what it's going to be about.","And as you know, we tested the 55,000 square-foot stores for quite a long time, but last year, we tested the 35,000 square-foot stores, and I think that now gives us a lot of confidence that we know how to operate those stores profitably. In terms of resource allocation, I'm not exactly sure what you're getting at.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","[You are] better able to prioritize where you should invest in the stores. It sounds like there's a good robust program for thinking about optimizing square footage, but one of the debates is as you do shrink square footage, there could be some space that's not as brand appropriate, and there could be opportunities to continue to think about where the dollars are best spent in fixtures, people, marketing. So part of the paradigm is understanding the spectrum of ROIC in terms of closures. I think that retailers are looking across a whole framework of thinking about this.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, I mean, obviously, not every store gets the same level of fixtures. So if you guys go out and look at different stores in Under Armour, you'll see some stores that are high-volume that have a more robust presentation, and then the stores that are lower volume, we obviously need to showcase the brand, but they won't have as many bells and whistles as the high-volume stores.","I think what we've done, we have about 185 small stores that are actual footprint small. We have another 115 or so that we've got on that standard to small program, so about 300 stores that are operating pretty efficiently. We're going to add another 200. So, 500 of our 1,150-some stores are going to be run like a smaller store. We think that we'll have better opportunity from a gross margin perspective and lower expenses to hopefully improve ROIC.","Kevin also mentioned, I think, we're looking for opportunities to bring in other retailers to take that square footage that we're able to carve out to drive some additional traffic to the developments that we're in.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I mean, overall, Oliver, I think we're leaving you with, hopefully, the impression we think footprint in terms of number of stores is important, and we don't necessarily see that going down. It actually, possibly could even go up.","Second, they're going to be smaller stores for sure. And the way they're going to be smaller is to use technology to enable process inside the store more efficiently and fulfillment inside the store more efficiently, and use our speed initiative and our sourcing strategies and our localization initiatives to be able to make better decisions on which brands and which categories are emphasized more in a smaller footprint. Hopefully that gets your answer done.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, that's very helpful. Thank you..","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","And you've used your questions up for the year, so we'll move on to the next one.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, thanks.","Operator","And next, we go to Bob \u2013 oh, excuse me. They've dropped out of queue. We'll go to Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Great. Good morning.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Good morning.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co.","I wanted to ask about some of the comp puts and takes near-term. Obviously, a much easier comparison in Q1, and presumably, some benefits surrounding the UA as that builds throughout the year. Just in the context of the flat to down 2% comp, how are you thinking about the cadence through 2017? And is there a baseline traffic number that will be needed to achieve that level? And then any color you can provide on February. Obviously, the industry traffic has been pretty \u2013 it's pretty tough out there. Thank you.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Sure. If you look at last year, we were down a little over 2%. We're essentially implying that we'd be down in the middle of our range around 1%, so that says we got to improve 100 basis points, 150 basis points. I don't think there's any particular quarter that we're focused on. Certainly, there was weakness in the first quarter last year, but at the same time, as you know, we've really, dramatically reduced inventories this year. So our clearance levels and fall transitional inventories are way down compared to last year, so that always has an impact early in the quarter.","I think we're looking at the Under Armour launch as an ongoing investment, so it's definitely not quarter focused. I mean, we see that lifting sales over time. So I really, honestly, we haven't targeted one quarter to be a little better than another. If you look at the performance last year, we had weak traffic all year really. And so, for us to get from, let's say, down 2% plus last year to down, let's say, 1% or even flat, we need to improve store traffic from down 5% or 6% to be down more like 3%. That's really what the math works out to be because our expectation is that omnichannel sales will continue to grow somewhere in the low double-digit range.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, I mean, and if you're just looking for total sales guidance, like Kevin said, I would just use down 2% to flat for comp across all the quarters. There's a 60-basis-point delta in the first quarter and second quarter due to the closed stores from last year cycling through. There's very minimal sales growth in the third quarter and fourth quarter from new stores. There are just going to be a few new stores opening of the 35K variety in the fall, and then I would just add in $160 million in the fourth quarter for the 53rd week.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co.","That's great. Thanks. And any commentary on February?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","No. I mean, we try to avoid talking about periods when we're in the middle of them. And I think pretty much what we gave you, Mark, in terms of how we look at the periods is about the extent of what we can say.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Fair enough. And congrats on the Under Armour rollout. The floor sets are looking great.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Good morning.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I guess the first question that I have, Kevin, is when is Wes' pontoon launch going to take place here? And do you have any update for us on how the search is going for the next CFO?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","The actual pontoon launch, I can't comment on. I'm sure it's coming sometime this spring. No, the process is ongoing, Bob, and there's nothing really to update you on. I feel pretty good about it, and Wes and I all along have been aligned that he would stay with us through this transition and then move off once we land on somebody. But I would still expect it to be sort of early in this spring season sometime.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And then, Kevin, with the Under Armour launch, can you just talk a little bit more around how you're positioning the health and wellness in your NIKE offering, and sort of what you're seeing around the entire pad?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Sure. I mean, using last year as a baseline, Active and Wellness grew basically double-digits last year. And it's on the trajectory, from a planning perspective, in 2017 to continue at that kind of rate of growth. Under Armour, we look at as being fundamentally, really incremental. I mean it's such a desired brand. If you've seen the stores, Bob, I think you'll see that we've expanded the space in the Active areas by 25% to 30%, depending upon the store.","We think there's such massive opportunity with Under Armour in categories like women's apparel, our children's apparel and footwear that they really could impact the overall business. So we're not really looking at other Active brands being diminished by the introduction of Under Armour. We're really kind of looking at Under Armour as an incremental opportunity. And that's why I think we sort of guided to Under Armour could have an impact as much as 100 basis points in the overall company comp for the year.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. And then, Kevin, just on the women's business, the LC Lauren Conrad dress-up shops, are those going to really help the women's business start to turn a little bit? Do you think that, that's a \u2013 you're onto something there?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I think if you're referring to Lauren Conrad and her dress-up shops, I'm sure she's rolling over right now, Bob. No, in all seriousness, Lauren Conrad is probably one of the shining stars of our proprietary brands. We have talked about the fact that while our private brands, SONOMA, Apt. 9, Croft & Barrow, are really starting to see some traction as we got further and further into last year, and we see a lot of opportunity going in 2017, the drag on our brand performance and our product performance has really been on exclusive brands. And the two big exceptions there are Vera Wang, which has continued to perform well, but notably, Lauren Conrad that has performed well consistently through all of this. So, in all seriousness, Michelle would tell you, that is a business we're looking to grow a lot. Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. On the inventory front, Wes, what inning do you see us today on the reduction effort? And what categories do you see as the largest opportunity from here?","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Well, I'm an Orioles fan, so I'm a fan of the three-run homer, so I think we made a pretty good first step this year, but I think over the next three years, Kevin mentioned, we're going to be down on average about 3%, with more on units and on the retail dollar side. So, I mean, our aspirational goal would be to try to get at a cost basis of closer to 4% over the course of time. I'm not going to burden the new CFO with that expectation, but I think if you go back and look at some of our statistics, we were at the 3.4%, 3.5% number back in 2010 and 2011. I think that's a realistic number to get to over the next few years, which would require bigger reductions than what I just mentioned, but we're signing up for 3% a year for now.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I mean, in all honesty, Matt, the inventory initiatives, I mentioned it in our prepared remarks, is probably the most important initiative we have after driving top line positive. And we just see this as an ongoing process. And if you think about all of the technology initiatives that we have, they're all focused on improving utilization of inventory in our stores because that's our biggest asset. So whether it's ship-from-store or buy online, pick up in store, all that technology is trying to use the inventory we already have to drive sales more effectively and efficiently, and then you know that the biggest initiative we have on product really has to do with speed. And we know that, that will have not just short-term, but long-term impacts on our turnover. And so we just think we're really early here, last year was sort of the beginning, but this is a permanent long-term strategy for us to improve speed to market on our sourcing and technology to enable better utilization of our inventory across the whole portfolio. And we're seeing the benefit from localization in a big way because we're able to place inventory in our stores in the right way.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah. I mean oversimplified, last year was taking a really blunt instrument and just cutting receipts, and we had so much room. I think the next few years are really about flow, and using the speed initiative and localization to our advantage.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then just on the mix strategy for national brands versus private label, with the Under Armour launch and NIKE expansion, are you guys fielding calls from any other new brands, anything to look forward to?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, we're not \u2013 I mean I wouldn't want to get into the specifics around focuses on brands, but we've made it clear which areas of our business we think there's opportunity in. We do believe that given our commitment to our footprint, our physical footprint across the country, that we become a more appealing choice for brands. And I think as others shrink, that only enhances the opportunity we have to take advantage of that. So it's definitely a focus, there's no question about it, but I wouldn't want to get into the specifics, Matt.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Bernard Sosnick with Madison Global Partners. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Morning.","Unknown Speaker","After the 2015 holiday season, you pointed to weaknesses in marketing that were going to be corrected in 2016. It doesn't seem to have helped very much. I'm wondering what you would say in terms of your assessment of the marketing effort, personalization, which was supposed to be a big step forward, as well as the change in advertising dollars, newspapers, et cetera.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, I think \u2013 I mean to point \u2013 to be totally honest with you, Bernie, to point to marketing as either our issue or our opportunity would be not very thoughtful. I mean we have multiple things going on at the same time, which is generally a sort of weak apparel environment overall. We have lots of challenges that we've talked about at length in our product assortments, some in certain categories like accessories, some in certain parts of our branding like exclusive brands, so these things kind of all impact traffic and all impact sales.","You're right that we've consistently said that we think loyalty as an instrument and personalization as a vehicle are our long-term strategies to drive more efficiency in marketing, and I can't point to the fourth quarter of last year as a massive improvement there because we spent more on marketing and we actually did fewer sales. So you're 100% right on that. But we do see in the underlying metrics that personalization is the path we should be on, and that loyalty is the key avenue for us to use personalization in. I don't think there's any question about that. Nothing is changing about that at all. I don't know, Wes, if you want to add anything.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, I mean, I think that the one thing that was different than our expectations was we expected a certain lift out of loyalty in the second year and we just didn't get that. And as we dug more into it and talked to some experts from the outside, that was probably a bad assumption on our part to assume a similar lift in year two as year one. As you start to anniversary the program, you have to make it more enticing to the customer that's been with you for a year, and some of the customers actually were with us for two years as they were part of our pilot group.","So I think Michelle and the rest of the marketing team have done a good job of experimenting with more targeted promotions. We did a lot of that in the fourth quarter. I think what Kevin said is really true going forward as marketing has to be more personalized, so they can't just be a blanket offer. It just becomes a lot of noise. You have to know your customer a little bit better, know what they're buying, and target the offer to particular categories that they're interested or target \u2013 if they are incented to get off the couch and go to the store, if a 20% off versus a 15% off, we have to take that into account. Where if they only buy kids' clothes versus men's clothes, we got to take that into account as well.","Unknown Speaker","I have an add-on question, if I may.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Okay.","Unknown Speaker","In this area of pricing transparency, have you looked at your pricing methodology, high, low? I know that there's a movement toward a differentiated product which is not vulnerable to price transparency and pricing action. But overall, Kohl's seems to have lost something in terms of its value message; otherwise, traffic wouldn't be down as much. And despite the Greatness Agenda, Kohl's hasn't shown that in this era of stress for retailers, an ability to outperform other retailers. So is it perhaps an issue of pricing methodology?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Well, I think there's no question, Bernie \u2013 I think you had a question in there somewhere, but I think what you're asking is what are we doing to make our value more clear to customers. And so without taking a lot of time on the call \u2013 and I'm sure Wes would be happy to take you through this separately in more detail \u2013 simplification of our value is a key priority in marketing, and we see doing that by tailoring our messages through our loyalty platforms, which are fundamentally Kohl's Cash, Yes2You Rewards and the Kohl's Charge, on a personal basis to consumers so it's more understandable. And then on a very personal basis, providing offers to them that are unique to them in real time so that they activate and engage more often, because that's fundamentally our problem, is that people aren't responding to the more traditional media that we have at the same rate they used to.","So, I mean summarizing it, that's kind of the plan and the strategy. And the results we're seeing gives us some confidence as we scale this up that there's real value there, but we have to show it. I would definitely acknowledge that the only way you show that is to improve the traffic levels in the store from last year's level to a better level this year, and then I can tell you it's working.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, I mean, I think some of the omnichannel initiatives we're working on for both desktop and the phone is to give the customer what the out-the-door price is. And that takes into account all the types of discounts that we have available. I mean I think the pricing strategy will remain focused on our credit customer and the program and the extra value. That provides Yes2You loyalty and Kohl's Cash, and those are things that all of our research has shown people like that. And they have a high use of that and a high redemption rate, but we just have to simplify so they understand that they can get better value when applying those discounts that they can whether it's searching online or at another store.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Bernie.","Operator","Next question's from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks. It's Tracy filling in for Paul. I was hoping you guys could talk a little more about your speed initiative, and what currently is the difference in the lead times? And which businesses are currently on the initiative and which do you expect to move to the initiative this year? I'm just wondering also if some of these businesses just lend themselves more to the speed type of initiatives than others. Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Sure. Well, the speed initiative really began to roll out early last year. Wes will correct me if I'm wrong on any of this, but I think we focused, first and foremost, logically on areas where speed's a more important factor, which was a category, for instance, in women's like juniors, where brands like SO, our young private brand for juniors, we could have a meaningful impact by delivering more often and more quickly. And that \u2013 those results, which were phenomenal, but, of course, in a relatively small part of the overall store, then began to roll out into other parts of our business.","Women's apparel is definitely a focus in this effort. And so speed's starting to take hold in other key proprietary brands in women's apparel like SONOMA and like Apt. 9, and now like Croft & Barrow, were the next avenue. And then finally, of course, we also know speed impacts \u2013 speed impacts everything, so it also has begun to roll out into home as well. So I think we gave you some statistics which are very generalized, but basically kind of said, hey, of our proprietary brand portfolio, at the end of the year, about 25% of our proprietary brands were being impacted by the speed initiative. And as we go into 2017, we see that moving up to 40%-plus in terms of its impact.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, Kevin is exactly right. I mean, it's mostly in the juniors area, so SO was the first one. It also includes Mudd and Candie's, and then it would also include more of the contemporary brands, so SONOMA, Simply Vera Vera Wang, Lauren Conrad, and then we added Apt. 9 in the back half of last year. So more to come on the remaining exclusive brands like Jennifer Lopez, and then, as Kevin mentioned, getting into other non-apparel areas on the home side.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I mean, the other thing I'd say, Tracy, on speed to reinforce something we talked about in the call, but the experience we've had on the speed initiative in product, we believe that is actually the blueprint for working with more speed and working with more agility as a result across the whole company. And so we're going to use that blueprint in trying to reimagine everything from our organizational structures in various areas, including our stores, to the way we approach our business overall. And we think what that will do is allow us to also begin to bring down expenses more effectively and more permanently. So speed and agility, overall, is probably the number one strategy we have at Kohl's.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah. And if you're looking for, I think you mentioned lead time...","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","...at the 40% this year, you're talking 40% of it would be between three months and four months.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Compared to...","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","From concept to \u2013 we don't have a fancy word for it, but concept to customer.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Versus the rest of the assortment that's not on the initiative is...","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Probably, on average, closer to six months.","Tracy Kogan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Great.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of questions, first just on the gross margin guidance calling for up kind of 10 basis points to 15 basis points. So that's just a slight acceleration from 2016. I guess how are you thinking about the underlying merchandise margin within that assumption versus fulfillment cost? And then in terms of the shape of the year for gross margin, your biggest opportunity is in Q1. Should we be kind of thinking about that as kind of capturing most of the gross margin improvement or should we see maybe more of a measured improvement?","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, that's what I tried to say on the call. So, I mean, I would say majority of the improvement would be in the first quarter, and the remainder of the year would be flat to up slightly. And then from a merchandise margin perspective, the sort of rule of thumb that we've had and given is shipping cost plus mix of business in digital is about a 30 basis point headwind to overall gross margin. So the way that it will feel to the merchants, they'll have to deliver a 40 basis point to 45 basis point improvement on what they can control.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on e-commerce and kind of the split shipments there, are the declines in split shipments being offset by \u2013 or fully offset by increased fulfillment costs? Or how should we think about the magnitude of these two factors and just the net impact going forward?","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Well, our shipping and fulfillment expenses as a percent of digital sales are improving. That's what you want to happen. I expect that will continue to happen, especially as, on the fulfillment side, as we have the fifth EFC coming up, that's going to be much more productive. The shipping costs are really, like you mentioned, a function of reducing the amount of split shipments. So we continue to tweak the technology that we have available. It's a pretty complicated algorithm, but it basically prioritizes, above all, keeping the shipment together, because shipping across a certain number of zones costs a little bit incremental money. But if my average cost to ship a package is $5 or $6, if I have to ship two because I split it, that's much more of a cost than it is to pay an extra couple of quarters for crossing zones.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","And I think, Wes, in the fourth quarter, we finally got some improvement in packages per order.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yes. Yeah.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Which is \u2013 that's a signal, I think, for us that the investments we've made in the technology side to help do the logic in terms of how orders get fulfilled are starting to pay off. And that's why we pointed to that, because I think the fourth quarter was actually the first time that we saw an improvement there moving in the right direction.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","And then just last question, I think it's following up on Drbul's question earlier on the athletic space. Did you say what the NIKE growth rate was in Q4? I think you've talked about it in quarters past.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","I think for the year was mid-teens. I don't remember what it was in the fourth quarter.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I think pretty close to...","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","It was pretty consistent all year.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Thanks. I'll let someone else jump in.","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Tiffany Kanaga - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. This is Tiffany Kanaga on for Paul. Thanks for taking our questions. Would you dig into your traffic-driving initiatives a little more? And in particular, whether you expect Under Armour to bring in new shoppers and additional trips or be more of an increase to UPT? And would you also please discuss how you expect Under Armour to impact your broader assortment and if we should expect any changes outside the brand?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Sure. On Under Armour's impact overall, I actually \u2013 I think the way we're looking at that is that it should drive positive momentum both on traffic, because frankly, they do have a younger customer. And I think it's a customer who's been going elsewhere to get that brand and now can come to Kohl's. But it will positively impact UPT because overall, national brand transaction value in average in retails are, in fact, higher. So, as I said at the beginning, it's not all necessarily a one-for-one positive impact on sales, but for the most part, we're looking at Under Armour as an incremental business. It's not cannibalizing some other business.","So we think it will be a plus overall, and it'll be definitely a plus in the Active space for sure. Moving on from Under Armour, I think we've just got to just keep it more generalized, Tiffany, that national brands, we think, are really important to our future. And so we're going to continue to focus on being the place with a physical footprint large enough to give distribution avenues and opportunities to brands that they either don't have today or they have but they're shrinking. And so we just think that, that's a place for us to win big. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go to Dan Binder with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dolph B. Warburton - Jefferies LLC","Hi. This is Dolph on for Dan. You mentioned earlier that the store \u2013 the sales transfer rate for this year was a little below your expectations. Do you happen to measure the transfer rates on the few stores you closed last year? And does that help set your expectations? Then I have a...","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, we had very few data points, so we expected to get about 38% overall, and we got 34%. So it was a little bit less than we thought. We'll continue to monitor it. We'd expect it maybe to \u2013 that the holiday period was perhaps the high point, but we don't know because we haven't closed a whole lot of stores up until last year in our history.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I mean, we give you these numbers, they're very generalized numbers because by default, they're averages. And so the percentage of sales that we retain from a closed store in a particular trade area can range greatly. They could be as low as 20%, depending upon the market, to as high as 50%, depending upon the market. So, Wes is right, it's on an average, we estimated 38% retention and we got 34%. We didn't know what would happen on omnichannel sales, but we suspected we might lose a little momentum and we did. And those two facts really help inform how we look going forward at stores.","Dolph B. Warburton - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. And my follow-up, just on wage pressures that you might see this year. What's kind of built in to your expectations in terms of...","Wesley S. McDonald - Kohl's Corp.","It's built into the overall guidance, but it's a big number. It's $50 million or $60 million we'll have to overcome.","Dolph B. Warburton - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And that will conclude our Q&A session. Gentlemen, any closing comments?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","No. Thanks very much.","Wesley S.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Bruce Besanko, Chief Financial Officer of Kohl's Department Stores. Please go ahead.","Bruce H. Besanko - Kohl's Corp.","Thank you, John. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for being with us. I'll start today's call by walking through our 2017 operational results and providing our initial 2018 guidance. Kevin Mansell, our Chairman, CEO and President, will then provide some additional details on our results and an update on our operational priorities. After our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions and we'll be joined today by Michelle Gass, our CEO-Elect.","We were very pleased with our performance for the year, particularly the momentum we saw in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter comp sales increased 6.3%, driven by the 6.9% increase for the combined November and December holiday period that we announced in early January. Our exceptional fourth quarter results contributed to 1.5% increase in comp sales for the full year.","By definition, comp sales exclude approximately $170 million of sales during the 53rd week of fiscal 2017. The strong quarter sales were driven by transactions, both in our stores and online. We also saw a significant improvement in average transaction value as a result of higher AURs. We saw consistent fourth quarter sales performance across the entire business with both stores and digital channels, as well as all lines of business and all parts of the country reporting positive comps.","From a line of business perspective, Footwear reported a double-digit comp for the quarter. Home and men's also outperformed the company with high single-digit increases. Geographically, we saw strength across the country as all regions reported mid to high single-digit increases. Kevin will provide additional details on our sales results in his remarks in a second.","Continuing down the income statement, our gross margin rate increased 43 basis points for the quarter, which was the result of effective inventory management that resulted in fewer permanent and promotional markdowns, which were more than offset by shipping headwinds. For the year, gross margin increased 15 basis points, which was at the high end of our guidance.","SG&A increased $99 million to $1.46 billion for the quarter. Approximately $30 million of the increase was due to the 53rd week. As a percentage of sales, SG&A leveraged 39 basis points.","Store payroll and expenses were well managed with the improved sales trends. Marketing expenses also leveraged as effective marketing drove higher sales. These favorable results were partially offset by higher incentives resulting from our strong results.","For the year, SG&A expenses increased 1.7% to $4.5 billion and leveraged 11 basis points. All areas of the business did an excellent job of managing their expenses in line with the progressively improving sales trends.","Depreciation expense was $267 million for the quarter and $991 million for the year and increased more than prior trends.","During the quarter we identified 22 million of IT projects that didn't fit into our current strategic and cloud migration plans and were impaired. In addition, depreciation increases were driven by the opening of our fifth ecommerce fulfillment center and some other IT investments.","Net interest expense decreased $1 million for the quarter and $9 million for the year. Interest income increased due to higher yields and investment balances. Reduced interest expense on capitalized leases as the store portfolio matures was partially offset by an additional week of interest on the bonds.","Now moving on to taxes. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017, and contains several key tax provisions that affected us including a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, our effective tax rate was 5.1% for the quarter and 23.1% for the year.","Tax reform reduced our tax rate by 27.6 percentage points for the quarter and 12.2 percentage points for the year. Most of the benefit was due to revaluing our deferred tax liabilities at the 21% tax rate. This revaluation resulted in a non-cash deferred tax benefit of approximately $120 million.","Additionally, as I mentioned on our third quarter call we received a state tax settlement that reduced our tax rate by 4.1 percentage points for the fourth quarter and 1.8 percentage points for the year. We intend to use the benefit of tax reform legislation to continue to support our capital deployment priorities. We'll continue to invest in our customer experience, our people and technology to support our omni-channel strategy, including our migration to a cloud environment. In addition, we'll use the proceeds to continue to provide returns to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, as well as to further fortify our balance sheet as part of our commitment to maintaining an investment grade rating.","On a GAAP basis, net income for the quarter was $468 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.81. For the year net income was $859 million and diluted EPS was $5.12. The 53rd week contributed approximately $0.10 to our EPS in both periods.","For the year, excluding the benefit of tax reform in the 2016 store closure costs, EPS increased 15% to $4.31 per share which was $0.11 higher than the high end of the updated guidance that we provided in early January.","Now to be fully transparent and assist with the models I'd like to provide some additional details on the impact of the various tax items on our financials. The state tax settlement which was unrelated to tax reform increased net income by $20 million and our EPS by $0.12 in both the quarter and the year.","The reduction in the federal rate increased our net income by $14 million and our EPS by $0.08. Revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of tax reform increased our net income by $122 million. Given the difference in the share count used to calculate EPS for the quarter and for the year, the revaluation increased fourth quarter EPS by $0.74 and the full year EPS by $0.73.","So looking to our store portfolio, we ended the year with 1,158 Kohl's stores with gross footage of 99.2 million square feet and selling footage of 82.8 million square feet. During the year we opened four new Kohl's stores and relocated one existing store.","Now transitioning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our fiscal 2017 year-end balance was $234 million higher than year-end 2016. The increase was driven by our outstanding holiday results and inventory management, which was partially offset by cash outflows in the 53rd week.","For the year we generated $881 million in free cash flow. The decrease from last year was largely attributable to AP payments in the 53rd week.","Inventory per store both in dollars and in units decreased 7%, reflecting our continued focus on inventory management. In 2018, we expect a mid single-digit percentage decrease in our inventory levels. Our AP-to-inventory ratio decreased 380 basis points to 35.9%. The decrease was a result of AP payments in the 53rd week of the year.","Moving on to capital management. Capital expenditures were $672 million for the year, $96 million lower than last year. Technology spending was comparable to last year. The reduction was primarily due to the completion of the beauty rollout, corporate improvements and new stores in 2016.","We expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million in 2018, of which approximately $350 million of it is for IT spending, with the remainder split between store strategy and fulfillment center investments.","Weighted average diluted shares were 167 million for the quarter and 168 million for the year. We repurchased 409,000 shares of our stock during the quarter, bringing our total for the year to 7.7 million. We ended the quarter with 168 million shares of stock outstanding.","As a result of our significant cash flow generation, our Board of Directors increased our dividend by 11% to $0.61 per common share earlier this week. We've increased the dividend every year since first paying a dividend in 2011. The dividend is payable on March 28 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 14.","Now looking ahead to 2018, our initial guidance is for earnings per diluted share of $4.95 to $5.45 for fiscal 2018. This guidance is based on the following expectations: comp sales of flat to 2% higher, total sales of down 1% to up to 1%. As a reminder, this includes the impact of approximately $170 million of sales in the 53rd week in 2017.","We expect our gross margin rate to increase 5 to 10 basis points for the year. SG&A dollars are expected to increase 1% to 2% for the year. We estimate depreciation expense will be approximately $960 million and interest expense is expected to be approximately $280 million. We believe our effective tax rate will be approximately 24% to 25%, and our guidance assumes share repurchases of $300 million to $400 million for the year.","Now, given the atypical volatility caused by the 53rd week in 2017 and the timing of certain of our expenses, we're also providing additional details around our first quarter expectations. Please be advised that we're providing this detail only to set expectations for the first quarter and we'll only provide quarterly details as needed in the future. So with that first, the calendar shift is expected to favorably impact our sales in the first half of the year and negatively impact sales in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect first quarter comp sales to exceed the high end of our annual guidance.","We expect first quarter gross margin to be at the low end of our annual guidance, as we anniversary an 80 basis point improvement in last year's first quarter margin rate. SG&A is expected to increase mid single-digits percent due to costs associated with our cloud migration strategy, leadership changes we announced in the fall and investments in stores and omni-channel fulfillment. These assumptions result in earnings per share of $0.45 to $0.50 for the quarter.","This guidance doesn't include changes that will be required to make when we adopt the new revenue recognition accounting standard in the first quarter. The most significant change will be the presentation of credit card income. Historically, we reported the net profit of the credit portfolio as a reduction in SG&A. Under the new standard, we'll report revenue from the credit card portfolio as a newly-created revenue line on the face of our income statement. Other changes required by the standard aren't expected to have a significant impact on our income statement. We'll update our guidance to reflect the standard during our first quarter call.","As we noted in our release, we're shifting our earnings reporting cadence this year and expect to report the first quarter 2018 results during the week of May 20. Since joining Kohl's, the team and I've reviewed a variety of our Investor Relations and other practices and determined that this is the preferred timing for us. Our subsequent quarterly reporting going forward will follow a similar timeline.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin, who will provide additional details on our results and an update on our key initiatives.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Bruce. Let me start with a few overall comments in the quarter and year results and then provide an update on the progress we're making on our two priorities, driving traffic and operational excellence through the lens of each of the key pillars of the Greatness Agenda.","Overall, sales for the fourth quarter were the highest level achieved in the history of the company and our increase in comp sales of 6.3% was the largest increase in sales since 2001. The consistent improvement in sales trend we had seen all year accelerated in the fourth quarter.","While our January results slowed in pace compared to our holiday results, we still achieved a positive, low single-digit comp sales increase for the month of January, which was well above our expectations. This was in spite of much lower-than-expected inventories coming out of the strong holiday.","While I'm obviously very happy with the sales results, I'm even more pleased in the breadth of the key drivers of the sales success. Most importantly, the fourth quarter sales results were driven by improvements in traffic, which, as you know, is our number one priority. Traffic was positive both in-store and online and in both cases well above the prior year-to-date trend.","On a category basis, footwear, men's and home outperformed the total, but all categories were positive for the quarter, including the very important women's apparel category.","On a regional basis, all regions were positive, and the results were further aided by our successful efforts to capitalize on competitive store closures in our markets.","I'm particularly happy that the improved sales results were combined with a very strong improvement in our gross margin results at the same time. Our increase in gross margin was primarily a result of more effective inventory management through our speed, localization and stores standard to small initiatives. The gross margin results were also helped by markdown optimization through the use of data and analytics, and these combined efforts more than offset the mix headwind of a much higher growth rate in our digital business.","Similar to our sales results, our SG&A improvement came from a number of important expense areas. These results have benefited from the efforts around our second priority of operational excellence. Our two largest expense centers, marketing and stores both leveraged for the quarter and were the primary drivers of our SG&A performance.","As you know, we've made significant investments in new technology solutions in both of these areas with a focus to improve productivity long-term.","Looking then at progress on each of our key pillars. First, around our product initiatives. Our active footwear and apparel business grew 25% comp stores for the quarter, accelerating over our full-year increase of 19% comp increase. The result was driven by a high single-digit increase in Nike sales, an extremely strong and above-planned performance with Under Armour and a double-digit increase in sales with adidas. There are several strategies in place to continue this growth in active footwear and apparel throughout 2018, including increased investment in inventory, fixturization and space for the category.","There were a number of key national brands that also achieved strong results in the quarter including Levi's, Carter's, Columbia, Van Heusen, Haggar and Skechers. Each of these brands comped well ahead of the company total. These results, combined with a strong home performance in the premium electronic and kitchen categories, drove our overall national brand performance much higher. We had an 11% increase in national brand sales and our national brand penetration grew to 62% of total sales for the fourth quarter.","Our proprietary brands had the most improved performance, however, over their prior year-to-date trend, and were essentially flat for the fourth quarter. This was an acceleration of over 600 basis points from their third quarter result.","Throughout 2017, we have edited out some of our proprietary brands in certain categories, which while a headwind on the overall sales performance in proprietary brands has benefited inventory and margin performance. The impact of both our speed and localization initiatives are gaining traction on our overall results, which is reflected in the improved performance. In particular, this drove very strong results with our Lauren Conrad brand and our Simply Vera Vera Wang brand.","Our speed brands reached 40% of total receipts for the year, with a future target to achieve 60% of total receipts. Speed brands outperformed the total proprietary brand results by 250 basis points due in large part to our ability to chase receipts.","Second, in our efforts to provide a seamless and easy experience, online sales grew 26% for the fourth quarter driven primarily by traffic, but also improved conversion. And online penetration to our total business reached 25% for the fourth quarter. Stores fulfilled 36% of digital demand units in the fourth quarter, and omni fulfillment key performance indicators were all better than last year.","There were improvements in productivity, cost and most importantly, the customer experience. We believe our stores are our biggest asset, and as you know, we're highly focused on creating a best-in-class omni-channel experience by leveraging our stores more fully. Investments we've made in new point-of-commerce, new associate mobile applications are having a positive impact on productivity in our stores.","Improved customer digital experience around things like endless aisle, price verifier, Kohl's Pay and Your Price are all improving the customer experience and improving conversion in the store. We also believe they're paying off in driving repeat traffic as customers engage more often with the new tools.","Third, in the area of personalization and savings, we continue to make significant progress in the use of data and analytics to drive improved results by personalizing much of our engagement and connection activities with consumers.","Technology investments have allowed us to effectively launch new strategies like personalized search, Smart Cart and Your Price. Your Price particularly has been a key driver of the acceleration in our digital growth rate by simplifying our value message.","The marketing team has also been very successful in improving our marketing effectiveness by optimizing our media spend across platforms, with a particular focus on our digital spend. This resulted in significant leverage in our marketing expense for the quarter.","The combination of the technology investments, personalization, optimization, and of course, product initiatives have improved our results on new customer acquisition. Our new customer acquisition growth was up in the mid-teens in the fourth quarter, which we believe will pay dividends as we move into 2018.","Finally, as we've indicated before, we believe we have an opportunity to bring our key loyalty assets of Kohl's Cash, Kohl's Charge and Yes2You Rewards into one simpler and easier-to-understand platform which will be called Kohl's Rewards. Beginning in late May of this year, we'll be piloting that new program in about 100 stores across eight markets. All Yes2You Rewards will be converted to our iconic Kohl's Cash currency in the pilot markets.","In the same way as we've used technology to improve our overall store and marketing productivity, we intend to use data and analytics to provide richer rewards for both Kohl's Charge and non-Kohl's Charge customers enrolled in the program, while eliminating less effective marketing tactics at the same time. We believe we can embrace far more customers with the new program and accelerate both our rate of customer acquisition and the retention to our brand; in short, a platform that will be simpler, richer and broader in reach. We would expect that post the pilot period, some version of the new platform will roll out to all of our stores in 2019.","And finally, in the area of store optimization, we're clearly seeing the benefits of amplifying the role and relevancy of our stores while focusing on improving their productivity in an omni-channel world. We believe in the power of our brick-and-mortar stores in that future world. Our standard to small strategy has improved inventory productivity as these 300 stores have produced comp sales consistent with the company's sales results on inventory levels well below the average full-sized store. This has led to merchandise margin improvement well above the average store. This strategy has been a key driver of our overall reduction in inventory, which as Bruce indicated, was down 7% per store at year-end.","Based on the success of the standard to small program, we will be rolling out this strategy to an additional 200 stores in 2018 and we expect to achieve further inventory reduction and margin accretion as a result. Our standard to small success has also enabled us to recognize we have an opportunity to right-size many of these stores as a next step. After completing two proofs-of-concept store right-sizing in fall 2017, we are now accelerating our plans in this area in 2018. We will right-size approximately 12 additional stores, including a 5 to 10-store pilot effort with fast-growing supermarket chain, Aldi. We believe the opportunity to leverage our real estate through this effort has benefits on both the top line with increased traffic and the bottom line through expense offsets, both fixed and variable.","Our new 35,000 square foot stores, which have all been opened in the last two years in both small and large markets, had a very successful holiday. We benefited in some cases from competitor store closings, and I do expect that to continue. These stores provide another blueprint for us to maximize our store presence in both smaller and larger markets and to continue to identify operational improvements we can transfer to our larger footprint stores.","On the innovation side, we continued to evolve and expand our testing of our future store via an initiative we call Your Store. Your Store is a learning lab environment to test and improve and prove concepts that we believe will help us develop best-in-class customer experiences and operate our stores more efficiently in the future. While we started the Your Store pilot in May last year with eight stores, we have now expanded it to 58 stores across the country. Ideas that are successful in these pilot stores are expanded and then rolled out to all the company stores.","Some examples of the type of tests include next-generation checkout, reallocation of store payroll to elevate store service and store management empowerment via predictive analytics that allow individual stores to detect and act on unrealized store demand. We believe that Your Store will give us an opportunity to improve our rate of return on store technology investment and improve our store productivity.","Finally, I know there's continued interest in the results around our pilot with Amazon on returns and Amazon shops within Kohl's. Given that the pilot has now been running for only four months and most of that time was in the holiday season, we need more time to draw conclusions that could be applied more broadly. In fact, package-less returns which is a key element of the overall return experience, has been in place only since late January.","I can reiterate that the customer experience and the customer feedback continues to be extremely positive. We've had initial discussion with Amazon about how and where we will expand the pilot and we'll share the details on that when they're finalized.","In summary, the fourth quarter and the annual 2017 results have continued to show significant progress in our performance. Our two priorities of driving traffic and operational excellence are clearly the right ones. Actions taken under our driving traffic priority are resonating with our customers, and investments in actions around operational excellence are being embraced by our associates and improving our speed and agility as an organization.","On the number one priority of driving traffic, we've entered 2018 with a lot of momentum on the topline and in the effort to attract new customers to maintain that momentum going forward. We believe that our strategies around product, around personalization and around loyalty are the keys to continue our traffic and sales growth into this year.","As you just heard, we're innovating, testing and rolling out new concepts that will make the customer experience more seamless and easier than ever. The confidence in our ability to drive traffic more consistently has been reflected in our more positive guidance on the topline for 2018.","On a second priority of operational excellence, we've made better-than-expected progress on our efforts to remove more than $250 million from our ongoing expense base and now expect to comfortably exceed that goal. That process has also allowed us to identify areas to gain efficiencies on the cost of shipping and product development side that will positively impact gross margin.","These savings, along with the positive impact of our lower tax rate, has then allowed us to make the necessary investments in customer experience, in our people and in technology, including our migration to the cloud. I hope you can see that we're investing in and innovating around all parts of our business.","Bruce shared the importance we place on keeping and improving on a strong balance sheet to allow us to continue to look long-term as we make those further investments.","In closing, I want to reinforce again how confident we are that the actions under our two priorities of driving traffic and achieving operational excellence are working, are providing clarity and mission to our customers and our associates and are driving our improved performance.","And with that, Bruce, Michelle and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll go to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, and congrats on a nice quarter.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, on the top-line, store comps have improved four straight quarters now. I guess, can you talk about some of the drivers to-date? And then, looking forward, what's the best way to think about ranking some of the drivers and initiatives, Smart Cart, traffic, and the convenience partnerships with Amazon and Aldi? And, I guess, lastly, any categories where you see additional national brand opportunities similar to the launch of Under Armour in athletic?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Sure. This is Kevin. Maybe I'll try on the first couple things and then I'll ask Michelle to lean in on looking forward on brands. In terms of past drivers, I think to the extent that we can, Matt, we included most of them in the commentary in the script. There is definitely not one thing that is driving our business. And typically when business is improved that's the case, and that's certainly what we want. What we want is that there are a whole bunch of initiatives all contributing.","So I mentioned at the end of the script that we think as we look back on 2017 and we saw this constant and consistent improvement that, we look perhaps more than anything else to the initiatives around product. We've made big improvements in product and Michelle on the private brand side has been able to head it down. A lot of inventory pulled out of categories where they weren't productive, and certainly faced a headwind all year on that. But now we're in a great position as we go into 2018.","New brands; definitely a part of the success, I think the efforts in technology around personalization, particularly on engagement, were a big driver. As we look into 2018, those two things are going to continue to be big drivers. I think we have a lot of optimism about improved performance in proprietary brands continuing.","It goes without question, Active was a massive importance. I think the bet that Michelle and her team made on Active and Wellness three years ago, while it's been consistently good, has now turned into great, and there's just huge opportunity looking forward.","And then the final one that I mentioned and I think as a team, we feel really strongly about, while we're only piloting a new loyalty program, we're certain that making our loyalty program simpler and making it embrace more customers, that's going to work. And what the component parts end up being after the pilot period, that can always evolve as we learn what works more effectively. But the improvement in our loyalty program we think long-term for the company is a really key aspect of growth.","On the brands, I'll let Michelle talk about it.","Michelle D. Gass - Kohl's Corp.","Sure. I share the optimism with Kevin. I think, we enter the year with great momentum and all the things he said. There's continuing to be more upside in Active. We see tremendous opportunity in our proprietary brands, and especially in the Women's category, we began to see that turn in the fourth quarter.","We expect that will continue. And I think importantly, while we drive sales, the team is doing a great job managing the business well. The inventory reduction initiatives, the Speed agenda, choice count reduction, and really, a speed, agility and a chase mindset so we can get after those sales.","In terms of brands, we are always looking at what brands would enhance the portfolio across all of our categories, and certainly, you've seen us add a number of new brands not only in Active, but across the board, especially in categories like Home and Footwear. And that will continue. We do have a pipeline of brands expected to rollout over the coming year. We just this quarter have started rolling out in the Footwear category Sam Edelman so that's another great addition to the line. And more to come on that.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just one follow-up. On the balance sheet, with debt leverage now at 2.5 times and annual free cash flow around $1 billion, I guess can you just outline the priorities for capital allocation from here?","Bruce H. Besanko - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, there's been no change, Matt, in the priorities that we've had previously. So we're going to make sure that the business gets all the cash it needs to invest, including in our technology areas, so that we can continue the cloud migration, the investment in the omnichannel experience and so on. So the business is going to get all the cash it needs to operate, and then we'll continue to provide an opportunity for dividends and dividend growth, share buybacks, and then in this commitment to win our investment grade.","We want to make sure that the company has adequate financial flexibility, which is why we're committing to this investment grade, and that'll give us great financial flexibility to continue to do things like share buybacks and dividend growth.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Kevin, just on the new customers up mid-teens here in the fourth quarter, just can you give us a little bit of perspective on how that relates to the rest of the year? And then if you could, just dissect what type of customer that's demographically, and what you're going to do to cultivate that relationship in 2018.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","The way I would think about the progression over the course of last year is similar to if you looked at the way our sales moved during the course of the year where we frankly had a very weak first quarter and then we improved substantively in the second, improved to the positive in the third, and then accelerated a lot in the fourth, that's kind of the story on customer acquisition.","There was poor results early in the year which were more similar to the year before, so we knew this was an area of focus. Michelle's new Chief Marketing Officer, Greg Revelle, has made this a really important priority and his team is making a difference. And so sequentially, just if you looked at the comp results over the year, sort of customer acquisition moved the same way, just faster, and so that's \u2013 you hear a certain tone of confidence as we look into 2018 because, as you know well, Chuck, customer acquisition is the key. Clearly for long-term success, retention becomes the key, but you got to start with more customers to begin with. So I think that's how I'd think about the rate.","In terms of the type, it's more of what we currently have, so from that perspective, I think we feel great. We have a lot of strategies in place, not the least one is the product strategy around Active and Wellness that we do think over time will cultivate a younger customer for us, and we're seeing that in our business. But I would say generally to be honest with you the new customer we're getting looks a lot like the core customer that created the business that we have today, and the important element is we're finally on a path where we're getting more of them.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay. Helpful. And then, as you discussed earlier, that January was a little bit of a slowdown. Just wondering if you could just talk about that all. It doesn't sound like you're concerned, and then just anything so far in February.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah, I mean, to be totally honest with you and not to refute what you just said, but certainly in comparison to a 6.9% increase November to December, a low 2% plus increase in January is a deceleration, but it's positive sales increase coming out of a holiday period where we did exceptionally well. And, as you can imagine, therefore, had substantively less inventory and, in particular, a lot less clearance inventory, which is an important component of January sales. So I don't actually look at it as a slowdown. I think, Michelle and I both were extremely pleased with January. We would not have expected that, and as I said, as you know, clearance is such a big aspect of January sales and we had so much less to be able to still get a positive sales comp tells me that we're operating on chasing receipts pretty well.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay. Anything on February?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","February \u2013 we include February in our guidance. I think, the way Bruce described it is that it's positive, and it's helped. Our outlook is helped in the first quarter by the shift in the calendar.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Corrine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrll Lynch","Thank you. Good morning.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Good morning.","Lorraine Corrine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrll Lynch","Your fourth quarter success sets up an interesting challenge for forecasting comps in 2018. How are you thinking about the progression of comps and inventory receipts through the year? And what are some strategies that you're using to try to lap that plus-6% in the fourth quarter 2018?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I can give you a little bit on how we're thinking on the progression, and I'll let Michelle answer the question on the holidays, though. As you can imagine, her team is well ahead of the curve on that one. So they have a lot of big plans to do exactly that, which is comp, that big comp.","On the progression, you heard from Bruce sort of broadly how the sales will probably come, which will be overall stronger than the guidance in the first half of the year and probably slightly less than the overall guidance in the second half of the year. That's sort of around the edges is how I would think about that. The first quarter is more notably different, for sure, because it's more positively impacted by the shift.","Prior-year comps, in general, we haven't found to be good indicators of future performance and if future performance is typically driven more by the key initiatives that the company has and so, as I said, there's a certain note of optimism I'm sure you're hearing about those sales because customer acquisition has improved, our product initiatives are working, our inventory is in phenomenal shape, which allows us to flow fresh and new receipts into our stores, and the combination of these other investments in technology and personalization we think are going to drive new business. Particularly to the holiday, I'll let Michelle take that.","Michelle D. Gass - Kohl's Corp.","Sure. I think, the success this past holiday is a testament to the core strategies that we've been operating against, frankly all year, and in my mind, that continues. It's things we've already mentioned. We will lean into Active all year and, as we saw this past quarter, Active will be a big piece of our growth plans for holiday next year. Proprietary brands, the continued acceleration there; we have lots of plans around newness innovation. And then of course, at holiday times, value is a key driver and what we saw this past quarter was just how much our Kohl's Cash program and promotion resonated with customers, so we had our learning this year and we'll certainly apply that again going forward. But I'm really confident, even though, certainly, it's a big comp to comp, I think already we have great plans in order to address that and have a positive result.","Lorraine Corrine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrll Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Nice quarter, and great initiatives ahead. On the Amazon relationship, what factors are you monitoring in terms of what you're looking at which will be important for you to analyze? And also, does that interplay with product assortments you make for yourself just to maximize what you're doing in your own innovation? And our second question was just on online margins. You've done a really good job with fulfillment and using your stores. So what are some guidelines around the long-term prospects for there and minimizing split shipments? Thank you.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","On the Amazon pilot, I'd characterize it consistent with the way I've characterized it before. We really only have one objective here, which is the key priority we have as a company is to drive traffic and ways in which we can innovate and ideate to help improve the trend of traffic we're open to consider, and this is one of those ideas, and we think it has a lot of merit, as you can tell. We're more focused on it being a great customer experience and making sure that that customer is happy when they do arrive in a Kohl's store because that gives us the best opportunity to convert them into a sale. I mean, that's fundamentally what we're focused on. The implications on our product assortment really don't play a role there. It's about driving traffic. So I'd say that's the answer on the Amazon.","On the online margin, I think, you know Oliver, the background and the whys as to why online merchandise margin and gross margin online is lower than our brick-and-mortar, so we probably don't need to go into that. But clearly, the two key components there are product and product placement because we know that if we can improve the way we place product so that it's more prepared to fulfill demand at a lower cost, we win. I think, Sona and her team have a lot of initiatives in place coming into 2018 that they believe will help in that.","And then secondly, really technology and technology driving the decision-making about how we really maximize the productivity on the cost of shipping. And to be totally honest with you, I think Michelle and I would both say we're really proud of the job that team has done because you know that costs on shipping generally have been moving up and yet they've been able to leverage cost in shipping on online as a percent of digital demand, which, in my eyes, is a pretty darn good performance on their part. So I think on both that aspects of the margin piece of our online business, we're feeling pretty good that we have a lot of things in place to continue to improve.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And, Kevin, that's really helpful. And our last question is on customer acquisition cost. You have a really robust ability to look at existing versus new in customer base evaluation. What are you seeing with customer acquisition costs? And how do you expect this to trend in terms of the interplay between your programs and using bricks and clicks here?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I'll let Michelle take that.","Michelle D. Gass - Kohl's Corp.","Yes, I'll take that one. Great question, and I'm really encouraged and excited about all the work that Greg and his team are doing to drive greater analytics on the business, as Kevin mentioned earlier. He mentioned in his commentary earlier that we are making a significant shift into digital. That is all based on the sophisticated modeling that Greg and his team are doing around ROI, and so we anticipate that, over time, our new customer acquisition will, that cost will come down. And in fact, we're already seeing that. We're seeing the impact grow and we're seeing the cost decrease. So we believe that's a fantastic formula going forward, and that translates into both stores and into our online business.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Best regards.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Kevin, you talked about the goal of driving traffic and Amazon being one of the partnerships that you're hoping might help in that respect. I'm curious what you saw. Did you actually see better traffic results in those stores, where you were accepting returns? Maybe even more specifically in the 10 stores, where you have shop-in-shops, if you could maybe speak to that.","And then, separately, I'm just curious about the drivers behind your comp assumptions this year from a traffic and ticket perspective, and do you assume positive store traffic, maybe talk about your store versus e-com expectations that are built within your comp assumptions. Thanks.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Sure. I mean, while I appreciate your interest in probing more deeply on Amazon, Paul, to be totally frank with you and direct, there's really nothing more to add than what I gave during the scripted comments. It's just literally too early, and I think, you've been in this business long enough to appreciate the fact to try to draw conclusions out of a holiday period when we had so many other massive initiatives in place would end up coming to potentially a different \u2013 an incorrect answer.","So you'll hear when we are more confident about being able to isolate that impact in these stores, how we feel about each of the little individual pieces. So there's really nothing more to say on Amazon. I want to make sure you know we're very optimistic. We feel very positive. There's nothing we're seeing that doesn't make us believe that it's just another idea for us to drive traffic.","In terms of other drivers, looking forward, I think, your question is more about kind of looking forward. For the most part we kind of covered the key ones. We don't share assumptions looking forward on the mix of brick-and-mortar versus online, or the mix of hey, how much of this is ticket, transaction, units, traffic. I would just leave it that we're focused on traffic being the driver and we've made that clear.","I don't think we can make it any more clear and that doesn't matter whether it's in-store or online. We're looking to drive our topline performance by driving our traffic metrics and then we hope that like what happened in the fourth quarter, all these investments we've made in technology improve conversion. And that's a formula for great success, so there's really not much else to add to that one. Thanks, Paul.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good luck, guys.","Operator","Next question is from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc.","Great. Good morning, and congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to follow-up on Under Armour. Just as you hindsight the year, are you able to tell us how much that contributed to the comp in fiscal 2017? And how are you thinking about the opportunity to begin to lap that rollout this spring?","Michelle D. Gass - Kohl's Corp.","Hey, Mark. It's Michelle, and I'll take that one. Well, we are very, very pleased with our results with Amazon over the last year. It did exceed our internal objectives. Of course, I can't share the specifics around that, but let's say it is in the top amongst our top active national brands. As we look forward, we see that growth continuing. I mean, we're at the beginning of a long great journey with Under Armour, not unlike what we've had with Nike and also with adidas. They're giving us new product. We're just in the midst of launching, as an example, Under Armour Golf, and more on that to come so I couldn't feel better about the brand and the partnership.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","And I know you know this, but just to clarify. Michelle said Amazon, but she meant Under Armour.","Michelle D. Gass - Kohl's Corp.","Oh, did I say Amazon? A little slip there.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc.","No problem. And then, just a quick follow-up on the private label Speed initiatives. You saw a nice comp improvement across all the categories in the fall season. Maybe just remind us what percent of the private label assortment will be on Speed for the spring season and how does that compare to spring of last year? Thanks.","Michelle D. Gass - Kohl's Corp.","Mark, we're still working through that. We're roughly at about 40% of the assortment right now in our proprietary brands being on Speed. I fully anticipate by the end of 2018 we'll be at 50%, and that number over time will go to 60% plus. I mean, Speed is the core strategy of our proprietary brands, and it's giving us lots of benefit on both the top line and the bottom line.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc.","Great. Thanks for the color. Best of luck.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Good morning, Bob.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Kevin, on the announcement of the pilot with Aldi, how many stores do you think that has the potential to be in your fleet? And is Aldi \u2013 is there an exclusivity around the convenience partnership with them, or can it be other retail partners as well?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Let me just start by saying, okay, what's the landscape, the scale, or size of the opportunity? Frankly, the size of the opportunity in our eyes is the 500 stores by the end of this year would have moved from a standard footprint to a small footprint. All of those stores can be candidates to be right-sized, and we obviously, as you can kind of tell, we think this is a big idea.","We're already getting all the operational improvements of making them small stores. So you heard us talk about it on the inventory, working capital side, you heard us talk about it on the improved margin side. I didn't allude to this, Bob, but standard-to-small stores have a phenomenal improvement in customer engagement scores, which is driven by improved findability, ease of shopping, standards in housekeeping, so those are all sort of on the side, but they're really good.","But we think store optimization is a big idea because, as you know, and I realize we keep repeating this, but we believe in our stores. We have an amazing platform of stores. We're uniquely positioned I think to execute this idea of right-sizing because our stores are new. Most are strip center or freestanding in areas that are highly wanted from a real estate perspective, and so, companies who are looking to grow are looking to grow in the trade areas in the markets in which we already operate. So I think we start in a phenomenal spot. The real estate team has done a magnificent job of creating these proof-of-concepts so that we know what we're getting into from both the cost and execution perspective.","In terms of where we see this going, I think we're focused on traffic driving retailers with good strong balance sheets and outlooks. So certainly, the one that we're doing the pilots with falls into that category. Generally, I think we would all say that the filters start at places like groceries, supermarket chains, just because they drive a lot of traffic, but it's certainly not limited to that. There are other sectors that I think are good pairings with us. People in the fitness category, for instance, I think are great combination with Kohl's, and there's many others. But it's traffic drivers, strong brands, strong balance sheets where we know that we can coexist together for a long time.","So, honestly, I realize that I'm sounding probably pretty optimistic about this, but that's because we think we've got a big idea here. And most importantly, I think we're very uniquely positioned to execute on it.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. And, Kevin, on February 5, 2006, the Steelers won Super Bowl XL, and I was actually there to witness that game. Shortly after that, one of my favorite running backs, Jerome Bettis, retired on top. With these exceptional Q4 results led by that 6.3% comp, do you feel like Jerome Bettis this morning?","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","I definitely don't feel like Jerome Bettis. I appreciate that, but in all seriousness, Bob, you know that retail is kind of a daily hand-to-hand combat business, and I do think as an organization we feel like we've been on a journey for the last few years through the pillars of the Greatness Agenda.","To be honest, our board several years ago really bought into those pillars in the Greatness Agenda and they have been very patient in waiting for traction, and we're finally giving it to them. So I will tell you that whether it's our board or our longer-term shareholders or certainly the management team here, there's a lot of satisfaction that we're getting that traction.","But most importantly, honestly, last year is last year. It's over. And the only thing that matters is the next years, and we do feel these priorities: driving traffic, operational excellence, but more importantly the initiatives and the actions under each one, they are on target and they are working, and I think Michelle is going to fuel them as we look forward.","Bruce H. Besanko - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Congratulations, Kevin. Good luck, Michelle.","Michelle D. Gass - Kohl's Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will be from Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, everyone, and congratulations.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thank you.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Two things. As you think about the women's apparel business, it's something we've been watching for a long time, what's driving the improvement there and what should we be looking forward to in 2018? And then if you think about the buckets of expenses, any update on wages and how you're planning and thinking about wages for the upcoming year? Thank you.","Michelle D. Gass - Kohl's Corp.","Okay. Hi, Dana. It's Michelle.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Hi.","Michelle D. Gass - Kohl's Corp.","I'll take the first one on women's. As I said earlier, I'm really encouraged with the momentum that we're seeing accelerate on the women's business. And I'd answer it in a couple ways. Number one, it's highly related to what we're seeing on proprietary brands, which is correlated to our speed agenda. Our proprietary brands make up 70% of our women's business. And again, it's important to remind everybody, women's represents 30% of Kohl's. So it is critically important for us to see long-term sustained health on that business. So the improvement in proprietary brands is driven by speed, number one.","Number two, I would say clarity in the assortment. We're doing a lot around this. Chris Candee, our GMM of women's with his team in editing out underperformers, driving choice count down, and improving depth, so that's a key strategy. And then I'd also say clarity of pricing in our value offers and making sure that we continue to lead in both the quality and value space. So I'm really optimistic as we head into 2018 that we'll see that momentum continue.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","On the wages thing, I can kind of give you a high level and then I'm looking at Bruce because I think he can probably give you...","Bruce H. Besanko - Kohl's Corp.","Yeah.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","...a couple more specifics. But wages and primarily, as you know, Dana, the primary part of our overall payroll is store and fulfillment-related. So when I say wages, that's sort of what I'm talking about. Wages have been in the past and are assumed and planned to be up in the future, and that is just the dynamic in the world in which we operate, and we're planning for that and it's included in the guidance that we give you. And that is, as I said, really driven by store and fulfillment wages.","We have a really comprehensive process for studying wage rates and, more importantly, work availability on a market-by-market basis, and so we manage it that way. When we're not competitive in a market or if we don't believe we're going to attract and retain the best talent, then we adjust our wages in the market like we do anything else, and that has worked for us. That analytical approach I think has worked for us for a long time, and we continue to apply it going forward because we think it's the right strategy; manage wages the way we manage everything else, which is at the local level where we have to compete.","In terms of specifics, Bruce might have a couple.","Bruce H. Besanko - Kohl's Corp.","I'll add a couple of points quickly, Dana. So store wages are going to continue to be a headwind. We've got that baked into our 2018 budget, and so consequently, it's embedded in the outlook. Over the past two years, we've invested, call it, upwards of $100 million in incremental store wages to remain competitive, and we expect that to continue for the foreseeable future.","As Kevin said, leading to the second point, our compensation plans are designed to be market competitive. This comprehensive process that we have in place has worked well for the company over the years, and we're going to continue to do this sort of market-by-market analysis and make changes as necessary.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","And the one other thing which I didn't mention that I'd add to what Bruce just said is this is why you hear us talk so much about investments in technology to improve associate productivity because that to me is the way we have to compete at that store level. Because we're going to pay the wages that are necessary to get the best talent; now we've got to give them better tools so they can be more productive.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","Thanks, Dana.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","I'll turn it back to the company if you have any closing comments.","Kevin Mansell - Kohl's Corp.","No. Thank you all very much for joining us on the call, and we look forward to talking to you soon.

We are very pleased to be reporting another quarter of solid financial results.","Comp sales on a shifted basis increased 2.5% our fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth. We experienced growth in both our national and proprietary brand and a good performance across the company, with particular strength in apparel led by our men\u2019s and children\u2019s businesses.","Our ongoing focus on inventory management and speed to market resulted in another great quarter of inventory reduction on a shifted basis and contributed to a 25 basis point increase in gross margin.","Our sustained momentum demonstrates the traction we are continuing to gain with our product, marketing, digital and store initiatives, while our focus on operational excellence was a key part in driving our 40% increase in third quarter earnings per share.","And while we feel great about the short term results we are delivering, we are also continuing to invest in our business for the long term. The entire organization across our stores, distribution centers, call centers and corporate offices are executing at an incredible level with great discipline, speed and agility. I\u2019m encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw throughout the quarter and the momentum that we are bringing into the holiday season.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Bruce, who will provide details on our third quarter financial results. After Bruce\u2019s remarks, I will return to add more color on the business, update you on our key initiatives and provide some initial thoughts on the holiday season.","Bruce Besanko","Thank you, Michelle and good morning everyone. As just mentioned, comp sales for the quarter increased 2.5% on a shifted basis, consistent with our reporting in prior quarters; this shifted comp adjusts for the 53-week last year by comparing sales for the 13-week periods ended November 3, 2018 and November 4, 2017. So our shifted comp of 2.5% is a like-for-like comparable sales figure.","As a reminder, additional information on the calendar shift can be found in the appendix of the June 16, 2018 analyst meet-and-greet presentation, which is available on the Investor Relations pages of our corporate Website.","Digital was especially strong with another mid-teen increase. We\u2019re also pleased with the results from our stores which were essentially flat for the quarter. Our driving traffic initiative helped us achieve a positive trend in transactions which together with an increase in average transaction value resulted in a positive comp for the quarter.","From a line of business perspective, we saw a broad strength with all lines of business reporting positive comps, except for the accessories business which was essentially flat. As Michelle mentioned, men\u2019s and children\u2019s were particularly strong, women\u2019s was positive in the second consecutive quarter and reported strong sequential improvement as the quarter progressed.","For the company, all three periods had positive comps with October being the strongest. From an omni channel perspective, all regions reported positive comps with the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions being the strongest.","Our strategic initiatives continue to drive the momentum in our performance. We also believe our positive Q3 sales results were amplified by the competitor store closures. In total, we believe approximately one third of our store base is being favorably affected by department store competitor store closings, a significant increase over the one fourth that benefited last year.","We expect the Bon-Ton closures to be especially opportunistic, given the strong overlap of their store and customer base with ours in markets where we tend to outperform. This increase in closures provides a unique opportunity to capture market share. We\u2019re investing incremental marketing dollars to ensure we can continue to capture what we believe to be more than our fair share of sales and customers from these competitors store closings. Michelle will provide additional comments on our sales results in her remarks.","Moving to gross margin and inventory. We have another strong quarter of gross margin performance with an increase of 25 basis points over the prior year quarter. Year-to-date our gross margin has improved nearly 40 basis points. The margin improvement is primarily the result of less permanent and promotional markdowns, due to our ongoing inventory management initiatives.","Our inventory per store decreased 2% after adjusting for holiday inventory that was received in Q3 this year compared to Q4 last year, due to the calendar shift caused by the 53rd week in 2017. This was our 11th consecutive quarter of inventory reductions.","On a calendar basis, our total inventory increased 5%. These reductions are being driven by a significant or organizational focus on inventory management enabled by four key initiatives; first our standard to small initiative continues to drive lower inventory levels and higher profitability. We now have 500 stores converted under this initiative compared to only 300 last year.","Second, localization allows us to scale brands and categories to appropriately react to customer demand at a store level. Third, we\u2019ve strategically reduced customer choice by 13% while increasing debt by 6% in key items.","And lastly, the speed initiative allows us to better flow receipts of proprietary brands to match customer demand. We continue to expect a mid-single digit percentage reduction in inventory this year, which translates to an expected improvement in inventory turns of approximately 15 basis points for the year.","SG&A increased 3% or $35 million to $1.4 billion for the quarter. Our stores organization again did an amazing job managing their expenses. Our stores leverage their payroll, as they were able to offset wage pressures with expense savings from our operational excellence initiatives.","Our credit and marketing expenses also leveraged. As planned, IT didn\u2019t leverage due to deliberate investments in the cloud and other technology initiatives in order to drive future efficiencies and growth.","Depreciation expense was $243 million and was consistent with last year. We continue to expect depreciation to be approximately $960 million for the year.","Net interest expense decreased $11 million for the quarter, primarily due to benefits of this year\u2019s debt tender transaction. Higher interest on our investments also contributed to the decrease.","Moving on to taxes, our tax rate was 17.6% for the quarter, significantly lower than last year and prior quarters, the reduction in the tax rate was due to tax reform as well as favorable audit results. We now expect our tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the year.","Net income for the quarter was $161 million, an increase of 38%. Diluted earnings per share increased 40% to $0.98.","Looking at our store portfolio, we ended the quarter with 1,159 Kohl\u2019s stores. During the quarter, we relocated one store in the Milwaukee market, and opened one new store in North Carolina. Gross footage was 99 million square feet and selling footage was 82.7 million square feet.","And now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $311 million over the prior year quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our inventory decreased 2% on a per store basis, after adjusting for the calendar shift. Our accounts payable to inventory increased 770 basis points to 53.3% driven by a shift of holiday receipts into Q3 this year.","And now on to capital management, capital expenditures were $458 million year-to-date for 2018, $89 million lower than 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower spending on ecommerce fulfillment centers and the timing of our technology spend.","Weighted average diluted shares were 165 million for the quarter, and we had 166 million shares outstanding at quarter end. We repurchased 1.5 million shares of our stock during the quarter bringing our year-to-date total to 3.9 million shares.","Last week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.61 per share. The dividend is payable on December 26 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 12.","As announced in our release, we\u2019re increasing our annual adjusted earnings guidance to $5.35 to $5.55 per share. This excludes the one time debt extinguishment charge of $42 million or $0.19 per share taken in the first quarter.","For the full year, we now expect comp sales to increase 1% to 2% and gross margin to be at the high end of up 25 to 30 basis points. We continue to expect SG&A to be at the high end of up 1% to 2% and now expect share buybacks to be in the $350 million to $400 million range.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Michelle, who will provide additional details on our results and an update on our key initiatives.","Michelle Gass","Thanks, Bruce. I will now provide more color on our performance in Q3, touch on a few of our key initiatives and discuss our outlook for the holiday season. I am pleased with how our team continues to focus on driving positive sales growth, while managing the business with discipline.","Our third quarter performance including sales, gross margin and inventory demonstrates our continued momentum and is a direct reflection of the progress we are making on our key priorities, of driving traffic and operational excellence.","So let me start with a review of our third quarter results beginning with product. I am especially pleased with the continued strength in our apparel business, both across our casual apparel businesses as well as active.","Our men\u2019s business led the company with strength across all of our core men\u2019s categories. We experienced notable growth in our men\u2019s private brands, such as Sonoma and Croft & Barrow, as well as the national brands such as Haggar, IZOD and Columbia.","Our men\u2019s active business was incredibly strong, driven by our key asset categories and brands and amplified by additions in Golf and Big & Tall. Our Children\u2019s business also delivered an outstanding Q3. We believe, we have a very unique position in the children\u2019s apparel market, given our differentiated and balanced portfolio of private, national and active brands.","During the quarter, our proprietary brand Jumping Beans posted a mid-teens comp. Our Carter's business accelerated and our Kid\u2019s active business continued as positive performance.","As you know driving sustainable improvement in our women\u2019s business is one of our key areas of focus. And we had another quarter of positive comp sales as customers are responding to the changes underway in driving brand and value clarity as well as delivering more relevant fashion through our speed initiative.","Let me add just a little color. Sales in our proprietary women\u2019s brand portfolio, which represents approximately two thirds of women\u2019s sales were strong, driven by key brands such as Sonoma, Apartment 9, LC Lauren Conrad and Simply Vera Vera Wang.","We launched POPSUGAR in mid-September, and we\u2019re encouraged by the initial response from a younger demographic that we targeted, as well as early online sales. We have continued to manage the women\u2019s business with great discipline by focusing on under penetrated categories such as bottoms, jackets, dresses and skirts, while also continuing to reduce customer choices and increase depth of inventory of key items. In fact, women\u2019s has led the company with customer choice reductions and debt increases to date.","Moving on to our overall brand portfolio. Looking at our national brands, which represents approximately 60% of our sales, we saw almost a 4% increase in sales in Q3. Our active business, which represents about 20% of our business, was up close to 10% in comp sales.","Our top three active brands, Nike, Under Armour and Adidas continue to perform well, with category additions and relevant product offerings resonating with our customers. Turning next to our proprietary brands; our proprietary brands delivered another quarter of positive growth. Our top three private brands, Sonoma, Apartment 9, and Croft & Barrow all of which have been refreshed and relaunched over the last three years, all performed particularly well.","As you know, we\u2019ve had an intense focus on improving the performance of our proprietary brands, through our speed-to-market initiative. We\u2019ve reduced our end-to-end timelines by 40% enabling us to make decisions closer to the season, test key programs before a companywide rollout, and respond to sales trends in a timely way.","In the third quarter, we successfully chased millions of units of our strongest performing merchandise. We remain confident that the core capability we are building in speed, along with our focus and driving brand and value clarity will provide long term benefits to this important part of our business. ","It\u2019s also worth noting that our fall seasonal categories had a great start in Q2, Q3 and delivered a high single digit comp across many product areas, including fleece, outerwear, and sleepwear.","Next, let me move on to speak about our marketing efforts. Our driving traffic initiative starts with how we engage our customers and we continue to evolve our strategy to maximize the effectiveness of our marketing investments.","Over the last few years, we have made a significant shift in how we deploy our media dollars. Moving spend from traditional vehicles such as print into digital channels, which allows us to be more agile to respond to market and environmental factors even such as weather.","Importantly, being much more dominant in digital allows us to be more personalized, which is a big part of our current and importantly our future marketing efforts. Throughout the year, and including the third quarter, we are leaning into our loyalty programs such as Kohl\u2019s cash, Yes2You Rewards and Kohl's Charge to protect core loyalists and attract new customers.","As you are aware, we are in the process of testing our next generation loyalty program, and we will share our plans with you going forward as we learn and refine the program. We are incredibly pleased with our Black Friday Ad Leak event that took place on November 1st. This is the second year of this campaign and the results far surpassed our expectations, both in-store and online, which gives us confidence in our product strategies as we move into the holiday season.","Now let me give you an update on our channel strategies, including both digital and in-store. We have continued to invest in digital to drive greater engagement and impact with our customer, which includes, our mobile app, Your Price, personalized search, Smart Cart, BOPIS and the recent launch of BOSS.","We have improved our digital platform to increase find ability, create a more personalized experience, reduce friction, and help our customers maximize their savings. All of this is paying off by driving increases in both traffic and sales across our digital channels.","In the quarter, we achieved a mid-teen increase in sales. Mobile again represented the majority of our traffic growth at over 70% of digital traffic, and almost half of digital sales.","Let me touch on a few of our digital initiatives in a little more detail. First, we are especially excited by the accelerated adoption of our Kohl app. More than 25 million customers have downloaded our app to date, and approximately 5 million customers are actively engaging with the app on a monthly basis. Customers are using the app either to make purchases or to use functionality in store like the wallet, which puts all of our customer\u2019s offers in Kohl\u2019s cash in one place.","The app now represents a significant part of our traffic and our sales and we are encouraged by how our conversion growth outperforms all other digital channels and how it's driving customer loyalty. We expect app adoption to continue to grow as we invest in making experience even more seamless and personalized for our customers.","Next, we are leveraging our entire store network to get Kohl\u2019s dot com orders to our customers fast and efficiently, with BOPIS, Ship from Store and our recently launched BOSS capabilities.","BOSS significantly broadens the assortment available to our customers for free pick up in-store, complements our existing bogus platform and importantly will help us drive traffic into our stores. We are leveraging our Smart Cart capabilities to incentivize customers in real time to pick up their orders in the store versus shipping it to them, a win for both driving traffic, and reducing shipping cost.","In addition, we\u2019ve added twenty five hundred handheld devices to support associates for omni channel fulfillment and the recently introduced smart fulfillment, which allows associates to replenish the right inventory at the right time from the stockroom to the store floor.","These investments will increase the number of units picked per hour and associate productivity. Lastly, we have built a strong fulfillment network to serve our growing Kohl\u2019s.com business. Our fifth EFC has been fully operational for over a year, and we\u2019ve begun construction of our six EFC this year. It will be highly automated and three times more productive than our first generation EFC.","Now moving to our stores; we maintain our commitment to our stores and believe that having a robust store portfolio is essential to support the ongoing growth of our omni-channel business. We also continue to believe that our stores can and will be a great source of innovation as we experiment and test new ideas to ensure our future relevancy.","Stores are here to stay, but their role is evolving. This quarter, we launched two pilot stores where we are testing a new customer service center concept, that includes a centralized checkout, a new impulse merchandising approach, self-checkout, new self-service kiosks and BOPIS lockers. We\u2019re also equipping our associates with iPad to be able to assist customers through mobile endless aisle.","We are looking forward to getting feedback from our customers, as we test more technology driven solutions to make their shopping trips to Kohl\u2019s even more easy and convenient. Lastly with regards to our store focus, we are continuing our pilot with Amazon in Chicago and Los Angeles markets and this quarter, we expanded the pilot to include southeastern Wisconsin.","We now accept Amazon returns in about 100 stores and have tripled the number of Amazon shops inside Kohl\u2019s stores from 10 to 30 shops. Additionally, we\u2019ll be selling Amazon branded products across all stores for the holiday season, including Black Friday favorites such as the Amazon Echo and The Echo Dot.","As I am speaking to you just two days before Thanksgiving, let me briefly now turn to the upcoming holiday season. As we approach Black Friday, and the all-important selling season throughout December, I can confidently say that Kohl\u2019s is ready.","First, we are entering the season with momentum. We now have five consecutive quarters of sales growth, a highly engaged customer base, and an organization that is firing on all cylinders.","Second, we have a very strong product assortment for the season. Like last year, we expect the strength of our active business and our national brands to continue. Our core business across proprietary brands is improving, and this year the team is amplifying a new big idea around Cozy, a strong consumer trend in an area that plays to our strengths.","This includes categories such as Fleece, Sleep, Flannel, Sweaters and Sherpa across apparel, footwear and home. Additionally, we\u2019ve enhanced our toy offerings by introducing two iconic brands for the holidays, LEGO and FAO Schwarz. Both of those brands are already off to a great start.","Third, we have a strong marketing program that will again differentiate us this holiday season. Building on prior year\u2019s success, our strategy centers on the unique value we offer in Kohl\u2019s cash. And every year we find ways to drive enhancements to strengthen the engagement with our customers.","Our marketing approach is built on an agile model that allows us to adapt and move quickly week by week throughout the season. We have a very strong holiday campaign and we have increased our marketing spend this year to give our messages the weight and presence we need to reach even more customers.","Fourth, we expect digital to continue to be a key growth driver it has been for the business all year long. I spoke earlier to the investments we are making and we believe these focus areas and in particular BOPIS and BOSS will be especially important this holiday season.","Fifth, our stores are operationally ready. We started our holiday hiring earlier than ever in our appropriately staff to give our customers the great service they expect from Kohl\u2019s. We have equipped our store associates with new technology to ensure a seamless shopping experience.","And lastly, as Bruce mentioned earlier, we expect to be very well-positioned to gain market share over the holidays from competitive store closures that have happened throughout the year. The holiday season is when Kohl\u2019s is at its best, and this year will be no exception.","So in closing, I\u2019d like to thank the 140,000 amazing associates that are committed to Kohl\u2019s success, not just during this all important holiday season, but every day of the year. The teams focus in driving innovation, working with speed and agility, and operating with discipline is producing sustainable results and ensuring our success over the long term.","We\u2019re happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen","Hi, thank you. You had a really strong fourth quarter last year, and you have a lot of great initiatives ahead. How would you prioritize the comp store sales initiatives in terms of fourth quarter, and the different items from product and marketing that you\u2019re doing?","And also on a second, a follow up is on thinking about digital fulfillment cost over a longer time horizon. What do you see as opportunities in terms of leveraging certain items or accommodations or investments you made [in the bank] [ph] as your e-comp penetration continues to nicely increase? Thank you.","Michelle Gass","Thank you, Oliver. I\u2019ll take the first one around holiday in the fourth quarter, and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Bruce. Yes, I was just saying, I feel really really good about the holiday season. We\u2019re bullish. I mean, we have most of the quarter ahead of us of course, but the initiatives I spoke to, I mean they really do all work together. Our product initiative is a lot of the things that have been working all year with the added plus up of key holiday items like I mentioned Cozy, we have other categories that do particularly well, like beauty and jewelry.","But across the board from active, national brands and private brands, I feel like we\u2019re really well positioned. And I think on top of that, as Bruce mentioned in his remarks the focus on inventory, in reducing choices, but increasing debt will serve us particularly well. So that\u2019s product.","Then I couple that of course with how we\u2019re engaging with our customers and marketing and our Kohl's Cash initiative. The work we\u2019re doing around engaging with the customer across all of our loyalty programs. We have more personalized efforts this holiday than we did last year. I feel like we are really well positioned from a marketing standpoint.","And then of course digital, which has been growing all year in the mid-teens, that continues. And that will be particularly relevant as we head into the holiday season. Again, I feel really great there; we\u2019re made more investments from a technology standpoint. The initiatives around things like Your Price, BOPIS and BOSS, which serve us well not only in shipping costs, but also importantly get those footsteps inside the store. We\u2019re doing things like Smart Cart as I mentioned, which create that real time incentive with Kohl\u2019s Cash to actually have them make the choice to come into the store, that\u2019s all really good.","And then I\u2019d hit on stores, feel really great about how the teams are ready. We\u2019ve hired well, they are fired up, again we\u2019ve equipped them with more technology to so -- to ensure that they\u2019re spending more time on the customer floor versus in the back room and you know we both mentioned the notion of the competitive store closures. So we think that will benefit us particularly in the store, but also online.","So all that being said, feel like we\u2019re incredibly well positioned and we\u2019re bullish headed into the holiday season.","Bruce Besanko","And then to hit on the second part of your question, Oliver, about digital fulfillment cost over the long-term. Our customers want a seamless omnichannel experience and our investments and strategies are guided by that customer want. Michelle mentioned BOPIS and BOSS as examples where in the long run we\u2019re helping to fulfill on the digital side with easier pickups, which also drives attachment sales for us.","Michelle mentioned, EFC 5 which has three times of productivity of our earlier EFCs. We\u2019ve recently found land for our EFC 6 and are making investments into that. Our tech investments in stores are driving productivity and, of course, our operational efficiency efforts are reducing the cost of shipping in the long run. I would say in the very short run in Q3, we did see a regression back to the mean in terms of shipping costs, but as you saw, overall, our gross margin increased 25 basis points for the third quarter.","Oliver Chen","It's very helpful. Best regards. Lastly, what\u2019s your take Michelle in how the customer is behaving this year versus last? Does the customers -- you ramp up on awareness of a lot of these digital options and customers continue to transform how they conduct shopping. Just curious about your characterizations of that kind of environment as well as the promotional atmosphere, you have a lot of data in personalization where you can drive specialized promotions to the extent that you need to. Thank you. Happy holidays.","Michelle Gass","Thank you. Yes. So, Oliver, I feel really good about where the customer is today. I think we\u2019d say that the backdrop around the customer, consumer indicators are positive. They have been all year. So there\u2019s certainly no reason to believe that will change as we head into the holidays and I think as I said earlier, I think, we are well-positioned. Holiday, of course, is already as always a promotional time and we do that, really, really well. So I\u2019m anticipating like we\u2019ve done in last years, that we\u2019ll leverage our promotional know-how and shine this holiday like we have.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards.","Michelle Gass","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please so ahead.","Bob Drbul","Hi, good morning. I was wondering just on active, as you look into the fourth quarter, in terms of the level of promotions year-over-year into Black Friday and the momentum in that business, can you just talk about, you said it\u2019s continued I think double-digit growth, but just the promotions and the marketing sides around the active piece and if that can continue. I was just wondering if you could also just address, when you think about the fourth quarter, the weather comparisons that you\u2019re facing and how you\u2019re planning forward versus last year's benefit from the weather?","Michelle Gass","Sure, well Bob, I\u2019ll start on active and then I\u2019ll let Bruce speak to the weather. As I mentioned in my remarks, active really for the last couple of years has been on a fantastic growth trajectory. Our customers and we have data to suggest this -- customer research we\u2019ve done, continue to see us more and more as an active destination and like we saw last Q4, when people are out there shopping, they\u2019re buying for gifts, but they\u2019re also buying for themselves and active is here to stay, it\u2019s part of people\u2019s lifestyles, people are wearing actives for work out, they are also wearing it to run to the supermarket or the coffee shop. So I think given that Kohl\u2019s is so kind of known for being a casual apparel destination, we\u2019ve been able to extend that into being a destination for active.","As it relates to how we think about active and focusing on active for the holiday, it will have a prominent place in our overall holiday portfolio just like it did last year. We feel great about the product both in terms of what we have with our national brand partners as well as with our private brands and categories like fleece, which I mentioned are part of kind of this overall Cozy strategy we have, I\u2019m anticipating that we\u2019ll have a great quarter in that regard. And I\u2019ll hand it over to Bruce.","Bruce Besanko","And then on the weather question, Bob, weather is less of an issue in Q4 than it is in some of our other quarters. Holiday shopping becomes the main driver in the fourth quarter versus weather. That said, cold is -- cooler temperatures is good for us and we know it\u2019s supposed to be cool here in the holiday period. As it relates to Q3, the temperatures became more favorable year-over-year in mid-to-late September. We saw as the weather cooled, our sales picked up, we were positive in all three periods, but we were in large part the result of weather helped accelerate our businesses in the back half of the third quarter.","Bob Drbul","Got it. And Michelle, in terms of the POPSUGAR launch, two questions for you on that. Do you believe you\u2019re bringing in that millennial customer and just within the items there is the POPSUGAR Teddy Bear Long Coat, are you having any success with that?","Michelle Gass","Bob, I love that you do your research. Well, first off, as it relates to the millennial customer, myself, the entire team, we are highly committed to that being a key strategy of the Company as we go forward and we have many initiatives aimed at that customer. Certainly POPSUGAR is a big one as we look ahead into next year. We\u2019re going to be introducing Nine West, that\u2019s also going to be we believe a great brand. And, in terms of, early days, we are beginning to see that it's pivoting to a younger customer.","Like any strategy, this is going to take time, but again, given the level of commitment, not unlike the commitment we had to active four years ago, we\u2019re fully expecting that we\u2019re going to have a great impact with that key customer. Then, in terms of, what was it the Teddy Bear Coat? Yes, I would say on the outerwear in POPSUGAR, it's doing really, really well. So on that one in particular, I'm not sure as I sit here today, but overall, outerwear has been very popular. So thanks for the question, Bob","Bob Drbul","Thank you, Michelle.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. I wanted to ask about the dynamics around the fourth quarter gross margin. Your guidance assumes some decline and I was just wondering what the factors are that drive that?","Bruce Besanko","Yes, let me talk a little bit about that. So what I, let me first start with what I said. What I said was that our gross margin for the year, Lorraine, would be at the high-end of up 25 basis points to 30 basis points and in particular, our inventory initiatives, we believe, will continue to deliver good gross margin results. Just also though bear in mind that as the fourth quarter penetrates higher in digital sales that will increase our cost of shipping. In addition, the holiday time is typically more promotional and so we\u2019ll react to that. So I think -- look I think the cost to shipping will be an impact. I mentioned just a second ago that it regressed back to the mean, which was what we expected.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark Altschwager","Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask about just traffic. It was encouraging to see transactions growth in Q3. Bigger picture, how would you gauge the success of your traffic driving initiatives specifically and is the level of store transactions meeting your expectations? That's my first question. Thanks.","Michelle Gass","Mark, I\u2019ll take this one. As you know driving traffic and operational excellence, two key priorities across the Company we're highly focused on and we feel really good across the board of the traction that we\u2019re getting. We think about traffic overall, so, we don\u2019t break it out between stores and digital. We are an omni-channel retailer and so we\u2019re pretty agnostic in terms of where they are shopping as long as they are engaging with Kohl\u2019s. We believe our benefit is that we do have a very strong omni-channel strategy against many of the initiatives and the initiatives do touch largely both channels.","So if we think of clearly from a product standpoint, all the new brands, innovations and then the speed to market that we're bringing with our proprietary brands, that\u2019s about driving relevancy and driving traffic whether it\u2019s Kohl's.com or into our stores. Our loyalty and personalization effort, big focus. As you are aware, we're still testing the loyalty pilots. We fully expect sometime over the next 18 months that we\u2019ll be rolling some version of that out. We\u2019re a test and learn culture. So we need to make sure it's absolutely right before we take it to full scale.","I'm really excited about the progress on personalization. That\u2019s giving us the agility through our digital means to be highly relevant and I think especially as we have both, as I said earlier, reaching out to a new millennial customer, but we have to be maniacally focused on protecting that core customer base and personalization gives us new muscles to do that. As it relates to our stores in particular, clearly, in the environment in brick and mortar, this is a focus for us. So we can leverage digital by initiatives like BOPIS and BOSS to bring them into the store.","We are continuing our journey on right-sizing. So, as you know, it\u2019s taking the opportunity of stores that we\u2019ve already pulled out inventory out of. Now we have extra space, so leasing that space to partners who can help us drive traffic. We\u2019re making very good progress on that. We\u2019re talking to a number of potential partners and our goal is to find complementary businesses that can sit alongside us. We help drive the traffic to them and they help drive traffic to us. So I think across the board, Mark, we have a suite of initiatives and importantly, we have the whole organization focused, both in terms of driving traffic with our core business, product marketing et cetera as well as thinking about disruptive new ideas and you're familiar with some of those.","Bruce Besanko","I might just add on to Michelle that we now have traffic counters in all of our stores. We report those measures to a third party as do many retailers and then we compare ourselves to the rest of those retailers and in that data, we both year-to-date and in Q3 are beating industry traffic measures.","Mark Altschwager","That's really helpful color. And then separately just regarding operational efficiencies, what further opportunity do you have to take some cost out of the business to fund labor and technology? As we begin to look into 2019, just how should we be thinking about normalized SG&A growth rate? Thanks.","Bruce Besanko","Yes, thanks, Mark for the question on OE. As you know, one of our executives, Jill Timm is leading that effort. She\u2019s been doing that now for well over a year. We\u2019re right on our path with respect to this first phase of OE savings. So we\u2019re in our second year now. We\u2019ll have yet a third year next year and we\u2019re actually going to exceed the $250 million that Jill and the Company had proposed in its initial wave. We are now doubling down and starting a new effort, in large part because we know that there will be continued headwinds from wage pressures, continued investments needed to fulfill our customers' wishes with respect to our omni-channel strategies and so we know that we need to find more ways to find cost.","So that effort is unfolding today. I'm sure we'll have more to say in the quarters ahead, but know that the things that we are doing today are going to make us more productive and more efficient, we have tech investments like smart fulfillment that Michelle talked about in her prepared remarks. We\u2019re innovating as she mentioned two things like self checkouts and testing iPads for faster checkout. EFC technology is going to continue for us, EFC 5 is a good example of that where we have three times of productivity. So, all of those things are designed to create greater levels of efficiency and productivity. We know we need to remain focused on that and it is our number two priority.","Mark Altschwager","Thank you and best of luck over holiday.","Bruce Besanko","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Randy Konik with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Randy Konik","Yes. Thanks a lot. I guess for Bruce. I want to just dive a little bit deeper into the gross margin outlook for the fourth quarter because when I look at, it was mentioned that the transactions grew in the quarter, the last month of the quarter was the strongest and others are not seeing that as much. You\u2019ve clearly got this momentum building into the fourth quarter and when you mentioned the fourth quarter gross margin guide assumes higher shipping expense and more promotional or assumes a more promotional environment, I guess more promotions from a seasonal perspective, how much of those two buckets is just an assumption versus something you\u2019re actually seeing in the business because if I look at some of the BOPIS, the Smart Cart technology is being implemented, it would appear that the shipping expense should start to kind of I guess moderate or be controlled going forward and from a promotionality standpoint, it seems like you\u2019re getting a stronger business going into holiday with your peers falling by the wayside and you\u2019re seeing strength in key businesses like active. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what\u2019s real versus assumed in the approach of the guidance for the gross margin in the fourth quarter??","Bruce Besanko","Okay, thanks, Randy for the question. I\u2019ll start and then Michelle feel free to jump in if you\u2019d like. So here\u2019s what I can tell you, here\u2019s what I see from our teams. What I see from our teams is an incredible focus on inventory management that is driving significant benefit, in fact, a reduction in inventory for the past 11 quarters if you take effect of the fiscal shift here in the third quarter. So just a very significant focus by the management and our teams and they\u2019re delivering on that focused effort. So it\u2019s just been a tremendous benefit for us. Year-to-date we\u2019re up nearly 40 basis points in gross margin. So that\u2019s what I can tell you that I see with utter clarity as I look at our business teams today. It\u2019s driven by standard to small, localization, the Speed initiative and then reducing customer count and increasing our depth and those are delivering really excellent results.","From a cost of shipping perspective, the cost of shipping continues to be a headwind. It was a headwind in Q3 as expected. The cost of shipping regressed back to a more normalized level. As we penetrate more and more particularly in the fourth quarter around our omni and into the digital cycle, there\u2019s going to be higher cost of shipping and that\u2019s just a fact of life. We also know that in the fourth quarter, there is just generally more promotion that happens and so we\u2019ll take effect of that in our gross margin outlook and so when we bundle that all together, we remain very confident, but at the same time we know that, as I mentioned that the gross margin will be probably at the high-end of the up 25 basis points to 30 basis points that we\u2019ve talked about.","Michelle Gass","Yes, I'll just -- I'll build on that. I think that's absolutely right. Our responsibility is to both drive traffic and drive sales and then do that in a profitable way like operational excellence as Bruce spoke to earlier. So I think in particular to the fourth quarter I think to Bruce\u2019s earlier comments, we\u2019re guiding to the full year, we\u2019re not calling out Q4 in particular. We\u2019re not expecting anything unusual from a promotional standpoint or nothing worse than last year. It just is -- and so that's sort of our baseline. So we as an organization are focused, number one in maximizing the customer engagement, driving sales and then doing that in a profitable way. That's been the case all year. That will again be the case in the fourth quarter.","Randy Konik","Great. And then if I\u2019m moving away from the fourth quarter for a second. If I think about the strategies you talked about with reducing customer choice and focus on proprietary brands, supply chain speed. Is there any kind of specifics you can give us on what that benefit has done to perhaps inventory turns or margin differential because those strategies obviously can have a longer tail beyond the fourth quarter into 2019 and beyond. So I'm just kind of curious on what types of benefits you actually see on the turn side and on the incremental margin, gross margin side from those two different strategies thus far?","Michelle Gass","Sure, I\u2019ll jump in here and Bruce can also add in. So, I mean, Speed is an absolute core strategy for us to drive sales and drive margin expansion. So to your earlier specific question, yes, we are seeing increases in inventory turn and that is a focus, it\u2019s a multi-year focus for us, drive sales up, bring inventories down and then we get all kinds of benefits from that. I\u2019d say I\u2019d start with the customer, the customer is getting fresher, more relevant product and we get to chase into early in the season what\u2019s working and in some cases, we\u2019re getting more of things that are working in under eight weeks and we\u2019ve built that muscle, we\u2019ve built that capability.","So number one, I get particularly excited because of the difference it makes with the customer. Number two, I\u2019m equally excited in what it means to the P&L in that you are able to drive sales, of course, but then in terms of turn and then markdown reduction, those go hand-in-hand and a key reason why we're seeing the favorability in margin is because of our reduction in both permanent markdowns and promotional markdowns. It's worth mentioning that our aged inventory is down significantly versus last year with again, it's kind of a great cycle because the more you do that, the more you can bring in the fresh receipts.","So number one I get particularly excited because of the difference that makes with the customer. Number two, I\u2019m equally excided and what it means to the P&L and that you are able to drive sales of course, but that in terms of turn and then markdown reduction both go hand-in-hand and the key reason why we\u2019re seeing the favorability in margin is because of our reduction in both permanent markdowns and promotional markdown. It\u2019s worth mentioning that are aged inventory is down significantly versus last year with again it\u2019s kind of a great psycho because the more you do that the more you can bring in the fresh receipts.","Bruce Besanko","And I\u2019d just add that there is four variables here that I mentioned, the localization, standard to small, the depth and choice, and then speed, all of those we believe are contributing, but it\u2019s to disentangle the four variables in a dynamic ever-changing environment is difficult.","Randy Konik","Appreciate. That help, guys.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. Michelle, maybe higher level; if you finish the year at a two comp or the high end of your guide for this year, I guess any structural reason you think the trend in your business should moderate next year? Maybe just any help by category where you see the most opportunity remaining?","Michelle Gass","Yes, great question. So we\u2019ve guided the one to two. We\u2019re all working hard to make sure that we are A, within it and would love to be at the high-end, but we haven\u2019t come out there yet. We have a big quarter ahead of us. And the goal for the team is to drive positive growth. We haven\u2019t yet as you know, provided fiscal 2019 guidance, but we have an entire organization focused on two key priorities driving sales and traffic and doing that with operational excellence.","Matthew Boss","Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up, Bruce to circle back to your comments on expense efficiency, any change to your ability to leverage SG&A at that one and a half to two comp going forward in the model?","Bruce Besanko","Yes. We haven\u2019t updated that Matt though, obviously in the third quarter we didn\u2019t achieve it on a two and half shifted comp or one fiscal comp, but no update on that. We still expect to leverage in a typical quarter we expect to leverage on one to two comp.","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of luck.","Michelle Gass","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll next go to Alexander Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alexander Walvis","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. We have a few questions on some of the strategic initiatives in your stores. So, the first one was, we were wondering if you could give us an update on the athletic pilot where you\u2019re expanding space in certain stores. How is that performing and is that likely to be expanded into further stores?","Michelle Gass","Sure. So, thanks for the question. As I said earlier, we continue to be very committed to our active business and our future active opportunities. We have great partnerships with the three key national brands Nike, Under Armour and Adidas. We are in pilot as you know in about 30 stores and we are rigorously studying those. As we've shared in the past, we significantly increased the space allocated inside the stores, so it is upwards of 25% of the real estate inside the store.","We've increased customer choice quite significantly in the order of 40%. Like any test, there is things that are working really well, there are some opportunity areas, but my expectation going forward is that we will see some version of that active expansion going forward. We haven\u2019t made that decision yet, but it\u2019s a key part of our strategy going forward. So I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how these stores do during the holiday season in the fourth quarter and then early next year, we\u2019ll make a decision on the next steps.","Alexander Walvis","Fantastic, and then a similar question on the Amazon pilot, thanks for the color on the number of stores that have those returns desks in them now and the numbers with the Amazon shop-in-shops, is there anything materially differed in the performance of those formats in the different regions as you\u2019ve rolled them out and would you say that you have more confidence around or less confidence around the ability to roll that out to a larger numbers of stores in the fleet??","Michelle Gass","Yes. I think similarly to a number of tests that we\u2019re running, it is kind of, core to our DNA that we like to test and assess these pilots especially ones that have significant consequence if we roll them out broadly so things like loyalty or active or even Amazon. As we said in kind of I think prior calls, we\u2019re really pleased with the pilot. We\u2019re driving a great level of customer engagement, customers love it. This quarter will be important for us because clearly, it\u2019s a big time when people have a lot of packages to return.","It is our first quarter where we have packageless returns, which is really a key point of difference in the whole returning process and we didn't go live with that till January. So this is our first -- fourth quarter as it relates to packageless returns. We now are across three markets. So that gives us a greater sense of scale in terms of the opportunity. So we and Amazon are continuing to assess that, but like I said, we feel really good about the customer experience, how it reduces friction for them and more to come.","Alexander Walvis","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, it is Tracy filling in for Paul; I had a question on the standard to small strategy. I was wondering if you're seeing the same results out of the newest I think 200 that you rolled out this year. And then as you look at the fleet overall, how many stores do you think can be put in the standard to small format, and out of those stores, how many do you think have the opportunity to partner with another retailer or another company? Thanks.","Bruce Besanko","Was originally in I think it was 200 stores and then we obviously increased it to 500 stores. The same performance that we saw initially is unfolding in all of the stores that we've now moved to the standard to small and then I think another part of your question was whether or not what universe of those stores could be \u2013 work size with a partnership is that -- was that the other question?","Unidentified Analyst","That\u2019s right and actually out of your broader fleet, how many stores can be in this smaller format and yes, of those, how many do you think are possibilities to have partners?","Bruce Besanko","Well, we\u2019re always evaluating the fleet. We know that some of the stores are too large and so -- but we haven't talked about beyond the 500, what that number would be and then in terms of the universe of those stores that could be partnered, we\u2019d say that there is a good amount of those stores. We haven\u2019t quantified that for ourselves yet, but we know that that's an opportunity set for us and to the extent that we can take advantage of it, we will.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our final question will be from line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.","Chuck Grom","Hey, thanks, good morning. Clearly the elephant in the room for you and most of retail today is the tougher compare from last year and your ability to comp that comp. So given that concern and given that November was really good for you guys last year, curious if you could shed some color on what you\u2019re seeing here in the first few weeks of the fourth quarter to alleviate that fear. And then just so we have our model set, Bruce, what\u2019s the delta or spread you're expecting between shifted in fiscal comps in the fourth quarter and is it your expectation to have positive shifted comps here in 4Q?","Michelle Gass","Great. So Chuck, I\u2019ll start. Thanks for the question. As I said earlier, we\u2019re extremely confident as we move into the holiday season. The biggest thing we have right now is we have momentum. We have five quarters of consecutive growth. Our customers are engaged and we have every reason to believe that we\u2019ll continue through the holiday season. Holiday is a really special time for Kohl's and for many customers it is -- their destination is part of their holiday tradition to shop Black Friday or Cyber throughout the holiday season.","I do believe it's when Kohl's does show up at its best. So I think consistent with the strategies that we\u2019ve had under way having a really thoughtful focused product strategy, a balance of active of our strong apparel business, national brands, proprietary brands, we have some new category extensions like toy with LEGO and FAO Schwarz. So I feel like we have an incredibly strong product portfolio. I think our marketing engine is fired up. We have a highly differentiated value proposition in Kohl's Cash, I think, coupled with the very significant, kind of, deep agile digital muscle that the team has been building all year and certainly the great opportunity to leverage it. I mentioned in my earlier remarks, but we are spending more this holiday season than we did last year, which I believe will also give us some tailwind.","Digital and stores think omni-channel critically important, we have a number of enhancements on the digital channel, things like Your Price, I mentioned BOPIS and BOSS and getting more of those customers to come in the store to pick up, which is a really good thing, Smart Cart we had just introduced last Q4. So we have been able to kind of learn that model. So that\u2019s largely incremental for us this holiday season as is BOSS.","And then I think just really importantly is we have the opportunity to capture market share with competitive closures. So, Bruce mentioned earlier in his remarks around Bon Ton, that customer and those geographies are in the sweet spot for Kohl's. So I take all of that as we sit here a couple of days in front of Thanksgiving and Black Friday and we\u2019re leaning in and I feel really, really good about the season in front of us.","Bruce Besanko","And in relation to the shifted comp, I couldn\u2019t be more delighted than to take another question on the shift. Like in Q3, we expect Q4 to be negatively impacted by the shift in the second half we\u2019ve talked about the shifted comp being greater than the fiscal comp, which is the opposite of what occurred in the spring season. Remember too that you can take essentially the average of the first and second quarters, and know that that should wash itself out in the second half. And then the final comment I would say is, that the fifty third week last year for us was a \u2013 it\u2019s always a weaker week, and it was worth about $170 million last year. And so hopefully that can help to check.","Chuck Grom","Do you think the shift will be about 200 basis points, is that about 7.5?","Bruce Besanko","That would be the math I would use.","Chuck Grom","Okay. Thanks very much for the color. Best of luck.","Bruce Besanko","Thank you, Chuck.","Michelle Gass","Thank you. Thank you to everyone listening on the call today and wishing you all a wonderful holiday season.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time today through December 20th 2018 at midnight Eastern Daylight Time.

SG&A was 3 million higher than the first quarter of last year. Marketing costs were lower than last year as we shifted some spending to the second quarter. Our credit card business reported higher revenues.","Partially offsetting these improvements were higher remodel costs as our remodels are occurring earlier this year than they did last year and higher investments in our E-Comm fulfillment centers and information technology.","Depreciation expense was 216 million for the quarter, essentially flat to last year. We are decreasing our annual depreciation guidance from 950 million to 900 million. Most of the change is related to remodels which are lasting longer than the depreciable lives that we had originally given them for accounting purposes.","Our interest expense was 85 million for the quarter, up 2 million due to the $300 million of debt issued in September of 2013. Our income tax rate was 36% for the quarter. This is lower than expected as we had a favorable state audit tax settlement during the quarter. Our diluted earnings per share were $0.60 for the quarter, down $0.06 from the first quarter of last year and net income was 125 million.","During the quarter, we opened four new store locations and relocated one existing store. We permanently closed two stores. One store is being temporary closed and rebuilt and will reopen with three additional new stores this fall. We ended the quarter was 1,160 stores, gross square footage of 100,340,000 square feet and selling square footage of 83,715,000. Our plans are to remodel 33 stores this year. This is generally consistent with last year. Most of this year's remodels will be completed in the spring season.","Capital expenditures were 176 million for the first quarter of 2014, 41 million higher than the first quarter of 2013. Most of the increase is related to a call center that we purchased in Texas. Remodels were also higher as our remodels are occurring earlier this year than they did last year and IT spending was also a little higher.","We ended the quarter with 717 million of cash and cash equivalents, higher capital spending and the timing of tax and non-inventory payments resulted in negative free cash flow for the quarter. We ended the quarter with 4 billion of inventory, a 1% increase over last year. Kevin will talk more about inventory in a few minutes.","AP as a percent of inventory decreased from 36.7 of the quarter 2013 to 34.7 this year. Our first quarter weighted average diluted shares were 208 million. We repurchased 3 million shares of our stock during the quarter. On May 14, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.39 per diluted share which is payable June 25 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 11. We continue to expect earnings per diluted share of $4.05 to $4.45 for fiscal 2014 consistent with our previous guidance.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin who will provide additional insights in our results.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks, Wes. As Wes mentioned, our first quarter comps were down 3.4%. Though sales were below our expectations for the quarter, I am encouraged by the consistent improvement that we saw as the quarter progressed. Looking at our results by line of business, children's and footwear outperformed the company. In children's, infant and toddler sales were strong and in footwear, strength continued in our athletic shoe business.","Men's and women's apparel performed with the company. Notable performance in men's included active apparel and young men's. In women's, for the first time in many quarters juniors was the strongest category achieving a positive comp. Intimates also outperformed the company in women's.","Accessories and home underperformed the company. In accessories, the new beauty brands continue to contribute to strong sales and soft home was the best performing category in total home.","On a regional basis, the West was the strongest region. The Southeast and South Central regions also outperformed the store average. The Midwest was generally consistent with the store average and the Northeast and the mid-Atlantic regions were the most challenging.","From a mix perspective, we're pleased with the results that we're seeing in our national brands since renewing our emphasis on them last fall. For the third consecutive quarter, national brand penetration increased. The national brands reported a higher comp result in our private and exclusive brand.","Our renewed emphasis around national brands does not mean we are abandoning our exclusive brands. Our customer continues to recognize the value these brands provide and we expect to continue to innovate on the product side and deliver the incredible savings customers expect from us on these brands.","In April, we launched the first collection which combines the magic of Disney and the quality and value of our Jumping Beans brand. This was a tremendously successful initiative and will be rolling out new elements around more of the Disney portfolio throughout the rest of the year.","This June, we're launching Fit Bed as part of extending our active and wellness business. And finally, this fall we're on target to launch both the IZOD brand in men's and the Juicy Couture brand in women's. A partnership with Elie Tahari will be introduced as the next phase of a DesigNation strategy this fall as well.","On the inventory front, on a per store basis, excluding E-Commerce, inventory dollars were down 1% while units were down 4%. We continue to make investments in national brands increasing their inventories while reducing our private and exclusive brand inventory. We ended the quarter with seasonal inventories down to last year and well in line with our plan.","In closing, I want to take a moment and give you some insight into our thinking and strategy for the longer term. As you know, we build a new leadership team across the company over the last year and a half. Frankly that's been driven by the need to drive better results, particularly on the top line and evolve our business more fully and with much greater speed. The only remaining leadership role to be filled is our Chief Merchandising Officer position which we will fill externally.","We built and grew a very successful business on brands, value and convenience; elements that remain core to our heritage and are important to today's families. Change in our industry is happening faster than ever. Competition has intensified. Consumer behavior is shifting and expectations surrounding the speed and choice continue to be raised. We need to evolve as a company and we're ceasing this opportunity to refocus, reenergize and pave our path forward with a new and clear purpose. We expect greatness and we have a plan to get there.","Over the last six months or so, the new leadership team has created the plan we are calling, Our Greatness Agenda. Our Greatness Agenda is a multiyear vision built on five pillars; ideas that are fundamental to the way we do business, their amazing product, incredible savings, easy experience, personalized connections and winning themes.","To explain each a bit more; first, amazing product. We've always had amazing product but our customers' wants and needs continue to evolve. As a result we've got a renewed focus on providing the right merchandise mix, being more locally relevant and tailoring products to every customer across every channel. Our new beauty offerings are just one great example of the amazing new product that customers can find in many of our stores and online. By yearend, almost half of our stores will feature a new and exciting beauty department.","Second, incredible savings, helping every customer get more from every dollar. We provide ways to save that families won't find anywhere else like Kohl's Cash, our Kohl's Charge Savings and most recently, our loyalty program pilot. We continue to see very positive results in our loyalty test in California, Texas and Pittsburgh but continue to improve and evolve the program to make it even more compelling to our customer.","We're now more convinced than ever that the vision and loyalty that has come out of the testing will be a key element of driving our top line in the future. We'll be introducing that new vision to the Milwaukee market and re-launching it in the Seattle market later this quarter with a plan of rolling it chain-wide by the end of the third quarter.","Third, easy experience; consumers demand a seamless, easy, inspiring experience whenever they shop. We continue to make significant investments to improve the shopping experience for our customers wherever or however they choose to engage with us. Between last year and this year, we'll have invested almost $600 million in capital spending on technology projects that make that experience better than ever.","Last year, we focused on moving E-Commerce infrastructure to new providers to give us the capability to grow our digital sales and platform. This year, we're building on this with significant investments as well around mobile and in-store technology.","Fourth, personalized connections; it's all about building lasting relationships with our customers, both current and prospective. Those relationships are based on the customer's experience in the store and online as well as how they perceive us contributing in the communities in which they live every day. We're focused on localizing and tailoring what we sell and how we communicate our amazing product so they see us as their store.","We know that our product and our offers have to be personally relevant to each and every customer. At the same time, personalized connections is about contributing to causes like children's health and education or the environment, so they see us as sensitive to the issues that are important to them.","And the last pillar but certainly not the least is winning teams. We already have a winning team of 140,000 associates nationwide. We're as committed as ever to building teams of engaged, talented, empowered and result-oriented associates and to attracting developing and retaining the very best talent.","As a leadership team, we've had the opportunity to share our Greatness Agenda with every one of our associates as well as begin conversations with our key business partners, including merchandise suppliers. Across the board, the response has been incredibly positive. I'm inspired by the energy and the commitment we are seeing throughout the organization in the last few months. Teams have been formed to support the very specific plans in place around these five pillars and new ideas continue to surface every day.","We've had some early exciting wins. One of those has been the response to our Power of Yes campaign which launched in April across a variety of media. That campaign includes 30 second television commercials which celebrate yes moments that most families can relate to in their own lives. The campaign is authentic and it's grounded in our heritage that allows us to refresh who we are and connect with the customer in a new and different way.","On the brand side, our new partnership with Disney and our latest design partnership with Peter Som have been incredibly successful. I'm confident this is just the beginning. I recognize that we need to accelerate the impact of these efforts on our results quickly, most importantly on the sales line. We are evolving rapidly and are using the wins we see to build momentum.","We plan to share significantly more depth on our Greatness Agenda as the year progresses and we have planned an Analyst Day here in Milwaukee at the end of October. At that time, I would expect you to be able to hear in great detail the moves being made to support our pillars of the Greatness Agenda, meet our new team in person and get a view of our three-year financial plan.","Finally, one piece of great news that we included in our release is about the extension of our credit card partnership agreement with Capital One. As you know, the Kohl's credit card has been an important element of our engagement with our most loyal customers. We partnered with Capital One three years ago in a seven-year agreement to help manage this very important relationship. We chose them at the time because we felt they exemplified the type of partnership we value; one where both partners are focused on the same important themes; driving profitable sales and creating lasting strong relationships with our cardholders.","Our experience since then has reinforced we made a great choice. As a result, we're announcing an extension of the original agreement for an additional five years along substantially the same terms. We have both identified a myriad of opportunities for the long term to build this business to an even greater height. The agreement provides the certainty to allow us to do that with a long-term view, and we look forward to working towards that goal with their team.","We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Welcome to the Kohl's first quarter 2014 earnings call. Your first question comes from Dan Binder. Your line is open.","Daniel Binder - Jefferies LLC","Hi. It's Dan Binder. Wes, I was hoping maybe you can give us a little bit of \u2013 more color on two things. One, the performance to the quarter and then two, just the puts and takes on the full year guidance being maintained? It sounds like you had this relative to your expectations for Q1, but appreciation is coming down. If there's any other color you can add to it?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, other than just saying that it improved each month throughout the quarter, I don't want to really get into quantifying \u2013 that's kind of why we went to quarterly guidance, but it definitely did improve throughout. And in terms of the guidance, obviously the depreciation number was included in our thinking of maintaining the guidance. We have a lot of sales to go and we think it's going to improve for the reasons Kev talked about in the call. So I can't tell you if we're going to hit the flat to 2 for sales, but I mean we think we have a pretty good shot at it and we \u2013 the other lines of the P&L I think we've proven to manage pretty well.","Daniel Binder - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Welcome to the Kohl's first quarter 2014 earnings call. Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul. Your line is open.","Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital","Hi. Good morning.","Kevin Mansell","Good morning.","Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital","When you guys look at I guess the traffic in the quarter and the down 4.5%, what do you think can turn that from your perspective and when do you think we can start to see some traction on the comps? And how much of it do you think was really weather in the quarter?","Kevin Mansell","This is Kevin, Bob. I think it's hard for us to quantify the various drivers of the performance. As we progress through the quarter, each month got better particularly as we ended the quarter. Seasonal categories definitely underperformed the company substantially. On the positive side there we ended the quarter with inventories in seasonal categories quite a bit less than last year, so we're really actually in a pretty good shape on that. I mean fundamentally, Bob, one of the reasons we spent a more extended time to provide some clarity into our thinking going forward is to make sure that you heard what our focus is and as you heard, it's built on these five pillars and those five pillars are really what is going to have to drive the change. So product is a big part of that, new savings initiatives in a big part of that and then new concepts like the beauty concept, as an example, is another big part of that.","Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital","Got it. And Kevin, I just have a question on the fragrance piece of it. When I was in the stores last week, there was a lot of \u2013 in some of the fragrance areas like Nicki Minaj versus Jennifer Lopez type of fragrance in there, like which one of those are driving the business and sort of how are they performing versus the rest of the category?","Kevin Mansell","Is that the Bob's stumps Kevin question which you definitely have me on? Fragrance is, as you can imagine, not performing on a year-over-year basis for the same extent as overall beauty, because the overall beauty has a lot more new initiatives involved in it. But the individual performance, Bob, you got me.","Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital","All right, I'll follow up with Wes. I think he'll figure it out for me.","Kevin Mansell","Sure.","Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen. Your line is open.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc.","Hi. Thank you. On the opportunity to broaden the appeal and the beauty, the brands in the loyalty side, where are the catalysts for the loyalty program in terms of where you see the next milestones there? And then just on the brand side, I was just curious about if we dissect that further, which classifications may have the most incremental opportunity for you as you engage in more improved product? Thank you.","Wesley S. McDonald","I think on the loyalty side, we continue to see comp outperformance versus the control group from approximately 150 basis points to 250 basis points. That's been relatively consistent. Texas has now been rolled out for a whole year now and they got about 150 basis points lift versus the control group. So we feel good about that. We're going to roll out the two additional markets like Kevin mentioned in the second quarter, the balance of the chain in the third. One of things you'll start to see more of in the store as we roll it out is additional pieces to the loyalty program broader than just savings and we'll let those play out as we roll that out. On the beauty side of things, post holiday we've seen increases in the beauty business of 35% to 45% depending on the type of presentation and the sales volume store and our total store lift in some of the ones with more extensive renovation has gone from about 1% to almost 2% now, so that's very encouraging. One of the things we're thinking about is trying to accelerate next year as many of the higher volume stores that we can with the more extensive investment. We had planned a lot of those for 2016. We're trying to see how many of those we can move up into next year as we feel like those for sure will be successful. We're still evaluating on the beauty side a brand new option that we rolled out which was sort of in between our acrylic, low investment and our higher investment. We're opening those stores this year. They have proven to be successful. It's possible we could accelerate beauty on a more quicker timetable.","Kevin Mansell","On the brand side, Oliver, I think as time wears on, we're more and more thinking about brands that relate to lifestyles that are important to our customers. So as an example, for instance, active and wellness is an area that we've identified that we have strengthen already on a share basis in our active apparel and active footwear categories, but there's opportunities for us to extend that even further. So active and wellness is an opportunity category for us and that really impacts men's apparel, women's apparel, children's apparel, footwear and home to a great extent. Home is another category. I think that we have identified as a category that we could strengthen our national brand portfolio particularly in classifications that are core to us, like the housewares business. And then I think the third thing is more what I would call unique ideas. So they might not be the obvious ones. The best example of that I would give you is the recent Disney partnership. So we have a phenomenally successful children's business but finding that combination of a great brand with a great value really hit a homerun in there. And then finally online. I think the omni-channel team is working hard at extending the categories that we typically sell in our store outside of those and there has been a great deal of success in doing that and presenting new brands as a result of that.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc","Great, thank you. Best of luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Liz Dunn from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Hi. Thanks and thanks for all the detail on the new initiatives. I guess just a couple of questions. In terms of the lift you're seeing in Texas, is that versus all stores or is that versus some other hot market control group?","Wesley S. McDonald","It's a control group.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay. I guess in terms of the shift in marketing spending from the first quarter to the second quarter, is there any way you could quantify that? Sorry, if I missed it.","Wesley S. McDonald","No, it's a few million dollars. I mean it's really a shift to support the loyalty rollout in the two markets we mentioned.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just trying to understand the puts and takes on the depreciation versus the modest miss in earnings. I mean, the miss in the first quarter was fairly modest but I guess 50 million in depreciation looks more like, I don't know, a $0.15 shift. So is it that you've kind of adjusted your go-forward expectations or is it just that you're still looking at it in the range and you're not necessarily saying that you've taken $0.15 out of the operating performance to offset this $0.15 depreciation?","Wesley S. McDonald","No, I'm just saying we still think we can make \u2013 your calculation is pretty close. It's really not a comment on anything other than it's a pretty wide range we gave. Our biggest issue has been sales. We believe sales are going to improve. First quarter sales, I don't think we \u2013 you're starting to hear reports. I don't think anybody is going to knock the cover off the ball. So we just wanted to make sure we can maintain our guidance and as sales improve, if we can get closer to the high end of the range and that would be viewed more as incremental to the guidance if we start running one comp which would be better than what we're running today, that will allow us to finish somewhere in the middle.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","Hi. Good morning. Just circling back to the breakdown of the comp, I believe you said AUR was up about 2.5% or 2.6% or so. If you can just describe what is driving that lift? Is that more the national brands in the mix or just what's providing that gain? Thank you.","Wesley S. McDonald","I think it's a combination. It's less clearance that's contributing to a part of it. National brand mix is contributing a little bit to it, but it's actually been more on the private and exclusive side. I think part of that is what we're selling right now since seasonal businesses are pretty tough. Those tend to be like tees and tanks are a little lower priced than some of the wovens and things we're selling in the women's and junior businesses, so that's driving the comp or the AUR up a little higher than it would be normally if you were \u2013 seasonal weather.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","And so, Wes, could you just remind us what is the expectation for AUR versus traffic for the full year?","Wesley S. McDonald","I mean the goal is to get traffic to be at least flat and we think we'll have a modest gain in terms of ticket. It's going to be driven by AUR and UPT if I had to tell you. My estimate now would be we probably have a slightly higher AUR and a slightly lower unit, but still kind of average the ticket to where we were for the quarter, up about 1%. But we need to get transactions per store back to flat.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","That's helpful. Thank you. And my last question is just on the E-Commerce initiatives. I apologize if I missed it. What was the E-Commerce growth in 1Q? And then if you can just update us on the test for order online, pick up in store, as well as your ship from store initiatives?","Wesley S. McDonald","On the ship from store, we're still in a little over 200 stores. We'll be rolling that out to over 800 stores for the fall and that will happen sort of in the third quarter timeframe. The buy online, pick up in store test will be also in the third quarter in a couple of markets; Chicago, Milwaukee and San Diego that will allow us to advertise that a little bit since we can do versioning. From an E-Comm perspective, we were below our plan but still up double digits. Obviously, E-Comm was also affected by some of the difficulty from a weather perspective in the quarter. And it's getting difficult \u2013 once we get more stores on ship from store and do buy online, pick up store, it's going to become very blurred, so it's going to be all just kind of in the total sales number.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from UBS. Your line is open.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Kevin Mansell","Good morning.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","I'm not sure if I missed it, but could you tell us \u2013 did you mention the growth of E-Commerce sales in the quarter?","Wesley S. McDonald","That was the question that was just asked and we said it was below our plan but still up double digits and it's getting more difficult because the ship from store and buy online, pick up from store\u2026","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Okay.","Wesley S. McDonald","And many of our competitors sort of say it's blurred and we agree with them.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Okay, sorry if I missed that. Does the Capital One renewal include a change in the economics or is that just a change in the duration of the contract right now?","Kevin Mansell","No, we're just extending the contract and basically the new extended agreement or substantially the same terms as the old agreement.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And then I know you've answered questions on AUR and traffic, but I was a little \u2013 I was surprised to see the mid-single digit AUR increase again in the quarter. Was it\u2026?","Wesley S. McDonald","Actually low-single digit was 2.6%.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","I'm sorry, low-single digit, yes, and I know that was similar to last quarter. I know you said there was some reduced clearance in there, Wes, but do you think at this point as you look at pricing, you need to make some adjustments there to help stabilize the traffic number or are there any change in how you were thinking about this 90 days ago as far as where you want pricing to be for the year to help traffic get to that zero that you were talking about?","Wesley S. McDonald","Like is said, clearance was a part of it and then as you look at the brands, it came more from private and exclusive and if you looked at the line of business, it was primarily in women's. Women's consist of juniors and misses. Juniors ran a positive comp for like the first time in three years at least, so I don't think it hurt their business. I think it's really just a mix within women's. We weren't selling tees and tanks which have lower AURs, we were selling more wovens and long bottoms and those have higher AURs. So I think as we move through the spring, the AUR should come down a little bit. It should be a little higher than last year just because of less clearance to be honest, but I don't think it's going to be any higher than what it was this quarter.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Okay, thanks for the detail. And then if I could ask just one last one is just on the gross margins as we think about our models here, it seems like after the first quarter if I just extend that out, you might be on track toward the higher end of that 10 to 30 guidance for the year\u2026","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, it all depends on if spring ever comes and we're able to sell through the seasonal inventories that we do have. We are lower than last year but we have to sell them. So if we get normal sell-through in Q2, I would suspect us to be in pretty good shape. It's very hard to anticipate in the first quarter what your full year margin is going to be. A lot of that is going to depend on how competitive the fourth quarter is.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Kevin Mansell","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","On the expense side, as you ramp distribution and IT to drive online and clearly you have a number of initiatives in place here, how should we think about investments and the SG&A leverage point going forward?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I think our goal remains to leverage at a 2% comp. We gave guidance for the year of 1.5% to 2.5%. We did better than that in the first quarter. I'm trying to target towards the low end but we are going to continue to drive IT and E-Commerce investments. You have to do that, but there's a lot of things going the other way too. Our stores are very, very productive absent technology investments. I don't see us being able to squeeze a ton of payroll out of that. We have to be more efficient from a marketing perspective not necessarily spend less money but drive more sales. But we'll continue to do what we can to try to manage our expenses, but we still think over the long term we're going to need a 2% comp to leverage SG&A.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Great. And then on the gross margin side, given what you have seen with traffic and I know you're expecting some improvement in the back half, but what do you think on pricing? Do you think you guys are appropriately priced with your private label, with national brands or do you think you need to invest in price a little bit more going forward?","Kevin Mansell","No. I mean generally as we've looked at it external data, our price points relative to competition are in pretty good shape. I mean primarily what's driving the slight increase in AUR are mix issues\u2026","Wesley S. McDonald","Specifically in women's is the biggest driver.","Kevin Mansell","Exactly. So it's really not \u2013 as we go through it, Matt, when we look at each individual category by itself and look at the average in our retails that are being produced, they look basically really similar to last year. But the mix of what we're selling is driving that. And as Wes mentioned, clearance, particularly in the first quarter, had an effect on that as well because we had much, much lower levels in our clearance inventory.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Okay. Good luck, guys.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Swinand from Morningstar, Incorporated. Your line is open.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to drill down on the national brands a little more. I guess a two-part question. When do you think that, now that you are in this reinstitution of the national brands is that a traffic driver and do you think if that builds, you'll start to have an impact on traffic?","Kevin Mansell","Yes. I mean fundamentally I think what we've seen in our results in the last couple of years and also in the research we've done with customers is that we've lost some traction with our core customers as the place to get great brands as they recognize. And so it's hard to see those changes on a month or quarter basis, but we're pretty certain based on our own results and the research that over time as we build that, we'll kind of get back into the sweet spot that we need to be to be recognized as a place to go for great brands. And fundamentally that's what the traffic driving is all about.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar, Inc.","But that's more like an opinion of the store rather than a promoted or featured item?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean it's a combination of both to be honest with you. The customers have been pretty clear that they want more national brands and secondarily, the results as we've built them have kind of reinforced that, right? The brands are outperforming the store\u2026","Wesley S. McDonald","Three quarters is a row.","Kevin Mansell","\u2026substantially and consistently. I mean is it a perception, for sure. That's the research part but the results part are pretty clear. That's statistical, both poor results prior to our change and better results after our change.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar, Inc.","Will that obviously then drive down your clearance if people tend to buy national brands with less discount or just more frequently?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I mean I think the advantage that probably comes with this strategy but it's not \u2013 the driver is that that business has a tendency to be more flow. There is certainly a lot more strength in basic categories as a result of that. So yes, there's an opportunity I think to improve the mix of clearance versus non-clearance. I mean as you know, the national brand on a purely merchandised margin rate basis are always going to be a little bit lower than our proprietary brand, but they come with substantive less risk. And at the end of the day if they're driving more traffic, it doesn't really matter anyway. So, I feel like we're hitting our stride on this and we definitely are responding to what the customer wants.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much and best of luck.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","Great. Good morning. Kevin, a strategic question for you and I've got some housekeeping as well. So in listening to you talk about the Greatness Agenda, it seems to me that the third and fourth pillars around unique experience and personalized connections are really kind of wrapped up maybe in some of your mobile strategy as well. So could you talk a little bit about what you've been seeing on some of your early initiatives around integrating Kohl's Cash on the mobile app? Are you seeing people engaged more and use that savings wallet to drive conversion through your E-Commerce or digital channels? And then related to that, Wes, on the transaction per store being down 4.5%, do you have a sense as to what the conversion versus traffic dynamic is there?","Kevin Mansell","It's Kevin on the mobile question. I think it will be hard for us to point at some change in our trend of customers redeeming or how they redeem due to strategies that we're implementing around mobile. First of all, a lot of the mobile strategies are really more back half loaded and not front half loaded. Kohl's Cash specifically has always been a very high usage online and particularly as you can imagine as you get near the end of the redemption period and in an event there's substantial utilization. I don't know that I could tell you, Neely, that it has risen. It's something we can definitely have Wes take a look at and probably give you some color on later.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes. You'll see a lot of changes to both our smartphone app and our tablet \u2013 more importantly our tablet app over the course of the year. If you guys recall when we did our re-platform last year, we basically just replicated what we had on the previous platform to make it simpler and reduce the risk of having something go wrong. This year was always planned to add more functionality to tablet and mobile tablet, much more important is that's where the traffic is really going. There is a lot of browsing on the phone but not as much transactions. So we're spending most of our time on the tablet app but you'll see changes to the mobile one as well.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","And on the traffic versus conversion, Wes?","Wesley S. McDonald","I'm sorry, what was the question about?","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","So your transactions per store were down 4.5, but what was the conversion versus traffic on there?","Wesley S. McDonald","Transactions per store and traffic for us are one and the same. We have traffic counters in about 100 stores but it hasn't been a meaningful change year-over-year in terms of what people are converting at. So, we look at transactions per store.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","And then, Kevin, if I may, one more. On the timing of the chief merchandising position, it sounds like you obviously plan on having that person installed by the Analyst Day. But where are you right now in the process and what does the caliber of your candidates look like at this point? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell","Obviously one of the reasons that we set the Analyst Day in the fall, there were really two drivers. One, we were pretty confident that we have a full team in place. And two, as I sort of described in the call, we have a pretty strong outline of a path forward. And by the time we get to the early fall, we'll be in a position to talk to you in great detail. We're shooting high on leadership and merchandising. That's what we do, right, as our product is a huge driver of our success. And much as we did when we filled and created the Chief Customer Officer role and we're able to recruit Michelle Gass in for that role, we want to make sure we shoot high and we want to make sure that we get a capable executive who is able to make an impact on the business first, but also that they're an executive who can grow in the future as well. So improving the overall team is a pretty big factor as well, Neely.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities","Hi, guys. Thanks.","Kevin Mansell","Hi, Paul.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities","You had some pressure with E-Comm in the fourth quarter. Just wondering how the profitability of that channel looked in the first quarter and what actions have you taken that will make sure that you don't run into some of those same issues in 4Q again this year?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, we made money not as much as money as I would have liked to make. Some of the actions that we're taking, our guys in the EFC are really treating every day as a peak day and we're trying to simulate the pace of what we're going to see in the fourth quarter. I think our average was 1.3 days from orders shipped, which is pretty good, much better than we did last year and sort of the pace we have to maintain to be successful in peak. Some of the things we've done from a planning perspective, we went from 200 in some stores to 800 from ship from store. That should increase our throughput quite a bit. We've increased the number of SKUs that we use from a bulk position in our brick and mortar DCs since their peak is a little earlier than the E-Comm peak we're able to use that labor force in that space to do that and we've been successful in doing that the last few years. And then I guess finally the third is really to engage a third party logistics company to evaluate our operations and we made some changes because of that as well as we're using a third party logistics to help at the peak season with some of the additional bulk products. I think we have a pretty good plan. We also made some management changes in some of the EFCs which we think strengthen the team. And one of the DCs performed very well last year. We just have to get all four of them to perform as well as that DC last year and we should be in good shape.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities","Got you. And then just one more. On the five pillars, just wondering what does that imply from a CapEx perspective? Do you need any additional infrastructure to receive those five pillars as you think about the next couple of years? And also just wondering which of the five do you think is the most low-hanging fruit? Thanks.","Kevin Mansell","First of all for this year the answer is no. We're not making changes in our capital spend. I think what it probably implies is that you'll continue to see a significant part of our over-capital moving against technology because many of the pillars are fundamentally focused around improving the experience and making it more seamless. There is certainly nothing as we think through the next few years that we're not able to do from a liquidity or cash perspective, but it really doesn't appear to us to any of the pillar strategy is going to dramatically change what our CapEx spend thoughts were since the beginning of the year.","Wesley S. McDonald","We'll give more guidance from a three-year plan in the future, but if you modeled somewhere between 750 or 800 a year on average that's probably \u2013 we're a little lower now but as we ramp up beauty and ramp up remodels perhaps in the out years, that 750 to 775 is probably a good average.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities","Got you. And any low-hanging fruit on the five pillars in your view?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I think each one of them is individually unique. The two that obviously we're looking at in the near term; one is around incredible savings in particular the loyalty program. I think that's clearly an obvious one. Price, second, and I want to say it is second in priority but is another obvious one, our product changes. So as Wes described the acceleration in the beauty rollout and the launch of what we think are going to be two really powerful brands, IZOD and Juicy Couture in the fall, I think are going to be a driver for sure. When we look at it a little bit longer term, some more third, fourth quarter building into next year, I think it's an awful lot about personalized connections and making that seamless experience better and we've got opportunity on both of those fronts. But it's harder for us to pinpoint that as let's say a driver of third quarter sales. I think that's more of an ongoing driver.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities","Got you. Thanks and good luck, guys.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Grom from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Good morning, Kevin. Good morning, Wes.","Kevin Mansell","Hi, Chuck.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","The improvement in gross was impressive despite the comp shortfall. Just wondering if you could flush out the drivers on that front? And then on inventory, if you could speak to the units across the three categories; national, exclusive and private brands, what did they look like relative to last year?","Wesley S. McDonald","Well, from an inventory perspective I think we actually get this weather forecast in advance and we bought seasonal down about 10% coming into the year, so I think that was a pretty smart move. We thought we could chase if it turned out to be wrong and it turned out to be right. So I think we're in pretty good shape. From a unit perspective, we're up a little bit in national brands kind of like low-single digits and down mid-single digits in private and exclusive.","Kevin Mansell","On the margin side, I think we had pretty good consistent performance across the store. I mean it was planned to improve and it did improve. It probably actually improved a little bit more than we expected it to and I think a little bit more than, if I'm right, Wes, a little bit more than the guidance we gave for the year.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes. All the lines of business expect for kid's beat LY from a margin perspective.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Okay, fair enough. And then on the comp, down 3 and 3.4, just wondering if you guys have looked at how big a delta existed between some of the markets. You called out the West and parts of the South being strong and parts of the Northeast and mid-Atlantic being weak. I'm just wondering how big a comp gap there was between the good and the bad markets?","Kevin Mansell","It was relatively substantial. I think the way we try to deal with this issue of lines of business or regional performance, Chuck, is if a region or a business is within 100 or 150 basis points to the average, we're not even going to call it out as a strength or a weakness. It needs to be more substantial than that for us to call it out and we definitely wanted to call out the West as clearly outperforming. We definitely wanted to call out the Northeast and mid-Atlantic as clearly underperforming. So it's relatively substantial.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","And is it safe to say that some of those underperforming markets in the quarter have improved in April and I guess sometime here in the first two weeks of May?","Kevin Mansell","Yes, I think \u2013 Wes has shaken his head in the background. I think the performance in April started to kind of come together more is the way I would say it. And so the Northeast and the mid-Atlantic which were the most underperforming early in the quarter began to look a lot more like the company in the end of the quarter. Is that right, Wes?","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, I mean it's still worse but it improved certainly from where they were in the beginning of the quarter.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Okay. And then just bigger picture, Kevin, I was wondering what's the expectation for future national brands? How the conversation is going with potential vendors? And is it your expectation that beyond IZOD and Juicy that we'll have some new brands in the store this time next year or into the summer of next year?","Kevin Mansell","Yes. I mean the short answer is yes. It's a high priority. When we talked about the pillars, the first pillar we talked about is product and within product it's an awful lot about the brands we sell. So it's probably our number one priority in terms of creating new traffic driving ideas and I'm really optimistic that we'll have some new things to talk about before the end of this year that would impact next year's business.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Okay, cool. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Great. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. There are various comp drivers in the second half with the loyalty, beauty, marketing and national brands. I'm just curious, now that you have more test data, can you talk more about the order of magnitude from each of these initiatives?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I think the biggest short term is national brands. They outperformed the last three quarters. We would expect that. We certainly would think that would ramp up in the third quarter with the launch of IZOD. Secondly, I'd probably say beauty. It's going to be in 512 stores before holiday. Last is loyalty just because it's not in as many stores as beauty and we'll roll it out in October probably, but you only have a quarter worth of business. But we're up to 8 million loyalty members now in the 300 stores we have, so it's definitely gaining some traction and we've seen some pretty consistent list versus the control group. But we're not going to get 8 million people to sign up in the fourth quarter, it's going to take time.","Mark Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay. And then any sense for how much these initiatives are impacting new customer acquisition versus better traffic from your core customer base, and any goals on that front as each of these things roll out?","Kevin Mansell","Well, we want to do both, that's for sure, but I do \u2013 the early reads are that we're making some headway with customers who are new to us are at the very least not highly loyal, meaning they are non-Kohl's charge customers. So our sense is that what our hope was which is to focus on customer acquisition and be a little more relevant to more customers, these specific initiatives are actually starting to drive some of that behavior.","Mark Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Kevin Mansell","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning. Can you give a little more detail around the strength in juniors this quarter? Was that driven by particular product categories, by national brands, sort of how you're looking at that business for the rest of the year?","Kevin Mansell","It was pretty broad. I mean if there was one sort of underperforming classification in juniors, it was the common denominator to the rest of the store and that was denim and denim underperformed, but I think that I suspect that Kohl's is not unique in that at least in listening to sales results of others, I think denim has been an underperforming category but other than that I mean there is really great strength across the juniors world. We've had early initiatives around color, the Wink of Pink promotion. We had some initiatives mid-quarter as we moved into Easter around dresses, but there's pretty broad strength across the whole area. If there's one thing we can point to is a business that made a lot of changes in terms of how they manage the flow, the inventory level and the content. That is a business that was focused on and then they got some great results. And as Wes said, I don't know exactly how long it's been since we had a positive comp in juniors but I think he's probably right, it's been several years.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Hi. Good morning. It's Stephen and thanks for taking the questions. I guess first following up on personalization and the customer connections online. As you look beyond the kind of ship from store and click and collect, can you talk about some of the capabilities you currently have to tailor the online experience? And maybe what initiatives you have planned to improve these digital connections?","Kevin Mansell","Sure. I mean things that we're working on obviously loyalty is a big part of this because basically all of our loyalty engagement is going to be online. And so whether we're communicating to them and through them, as Wes described, on the tablet device or we're communicating to them and through them on a desktop device, a lot of that engagement is going to be very personal because the loyalty customer is a customer we're going to learn a lot more about and therefore we're going to be able to appropriately personalize the offers we might make to them. Other than that there are things going on in terms of reaching customers when they come into the store. We're planning to expand that quite a bit as we move into the fall and holiday season. I'm trying to think \u2013 Wes, anything else you want to call out?","Wesley S. McDonald","We can do the geocoding when they're in the store. We can shoot them an offer if they come in from your buy online, pick up in store. If they come into the store we know they are there and they opt into the Wi-Fi, we can shoot them an email or an offer via their smartphones. So we're really just starting on this. We've been working with a consultant to try to help us sort of jumpstart this and have started to do some segmenting of emails and retargeting of customers based on their browsing behavior online. So, I'd say we're in our infancy on this and certainly going to see more of this throughout this year and into next.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","And then one quick clarification on just E-Commerce versus in store. Can you talk about the differences you see in the mix of national brands online versus in-store versus the exclusive and private label?","Kevin Mansell","Well, I think national brands have always penetrated a little higher.","Wesley S. McDonald","Yes, because home is bigger online. That's going to drive a bigger national brand penetration. So I'd say it's a little bit higher nationally just because home is about 30% of the business online versus less than 20% overall.","Kevin Mansell","If you target them at the acceleration of the penetration online versus brick and mortar, I don't know that we have that number in front of us but it's definitely something we can give you some color on later.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Great. I'll follow up. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Glick from Buckingham Research Group. Your line is open.","David Glick - Buckingham Research","Thank you. Good morning. Kevin, just following up on the CMO search, it sounds like \u2013 listening to your strategic objectives, it sounds like you're trying to evolve the culture of the organization to move faster and take more calculated fashion risks, and I guess are you seeing that come to fruition in juniors and it sounds like you're trying obviously to spread it to the rest of the organization? But with that as a backdrop, what kind of specific background and skill set are you looking for in a prospective Chief Merchandising Officer? Is it more specialty retail, department store? Obviously, you said you're shooting high. You're looking for someone who can continue to grow in the organization from a leadership perspective, but how are you thinking about that position and the impact on your strategic objectives specifically in terms of taking more calculated fashion risks?","Kevin Mansell","Well just real broadly without getting into the detail, I mean we would be looking for an executive who has exhibited speed to act, so decisiveness and speed are really critical factors. Second, obviously it goes without saying we want someone who has been highly successful and has demonstrated an ability to get results over a period of time. Third, we think we have a great leader in Michelle on the customer engagement side and it would be great to balance that with more deep knowledge on the product side for sure. And then most importantly probably of course of all is find somebody who will fit from a leadership perspective, somebody who can inspire and lead because we have a very talented team underneath and they're very capable when it comes to understanding the product in the various businesses, but we need somebody who definitely can lead them from an inspirational perspective and style perspective that will fit in the culture of the company. So, there definitely is some very specific filters that we're sifting through. This is a really phenomenal opportunity, it really is. It's very unique. I don't think there are many cases where you get in \u2013 or somebody who gets an opportunity to come into a business that's almost $20 billion in scale and make an immediate contribution and at the same time have a chance to develop their career even further over time. So, I feel good that we are going to be able to get a great leader.","David Glick - Buckingham Research","Thank you very much for that color and perspective. Good luck.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisors. Your line is open.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Good morning, everyone.","Kevin Mansell","Good morning.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Hi. As you look at the store remodels, how are they doing? What are you seeing in their performance? And any adjustments that you're making to any of the new remodels as you go forward? And then lastly, with the new product introductions set for the second half with Juicy and IZOD, marketing plans, budgets, what should we be looking at as that gets introduced? Thank you. Hello?","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator, today's conference will continue momentarily. This is the operator. Today's conference will continue. Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisors, please ask your question.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Hi, I hope everything's okay. Just wondering on the performance of the store remodels, any further color on how those are doing and any changes you're making to future remodels? And lastly, with the big introductions of IZOD and Juicy in the fall, marketing, budgets for marketing, how are you thinking of those product introductions? Thank you.","Kevin Mansell","There are specific things that we've done that are definitely big winners. Three that we've called out, one is operational and it might not be that exciting, but from a customer's perspective, it's got great impact and that's moving our customer service space to the front of the store, at the door adjacent to our POS. It gives us incredible leverage on the payroll side but most importantly it's given us a much better experience. And as we think about the importance that buy online, pick up in store will have which will all happen in customer service, we think it's going to just grow in importance. Second is beauty and you can tell we're pretty excited about the beauty results. We're accelerating the rollout of beauty. We're looking at ways to accelerate it even faster, because we are getting actual dramatic lifts in beauty and lifts in total store as well in the beauty test stores. And then third, probably the area that has some of the biggest facelifts on the product side are the juniors, accessory worlds and again, we've had great response and you can see for the first time, it's certainly not about necessarily the environment but we've had pretty dramatic improvement in our juniors business. On the product side, we're going to support the IZOD and Juicy launch significantly. So it will have the full weight of our marketing efforts both online and in-store. And it will be across our platforms of print, direct mail, digital and broadcast. And we know the importance of those two brands to our fall business and they're going to be supported as a result of that. Overall, that was always built into our original plan for marketing, so there is really no change in that.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Thank you.","Kevin Mansell","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick McKeever from MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Good morning. I know you're not giving quarterly guidance anymore, but just wondering if you might have some thoughts on just the second quarter going up against the only positive comp from last year, any thoughts there?","Kevin Mansell","No. I mean, overall, I think on the positives, if you think about puts and takes in the second quarter, stacked comps I think are probably not a reliable predictor of performance for anybody. So whether we were positive or negative last year I think has little to do with whether we will be positive or negative this year. I think the driver is going to be some of the things we've talked about in the call. On the positive side, I would say I don't know that you can ever hope to make up sales in categories like seasonal-related businesses. When they don't happen early in the year, it doesn't translate into incremental sales in the second quarter. But I also would expect fully to be honest that we would have more normalized sales in those seasonal categories. So I think that just in the background is generally kind of a positive thing for the second quarter. I don't know if there's anything else, Wes, you'd call out?","Wesley S. McDonald","No, I think we expect improvement; how much remains to be seen. A lot of it's going to depend on what you talked about in terms of weather demand.","Kevin Mansell","The second piece is obviously we called out clearance as a headwind in the first quarter year-over-year, clearance inventories were down substantially and naturally that translated into lower sales. We're pretty much anniversaried that and so as we go into the second quarter we wouldn't expect that to be a headwind the way it was in the first few years.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. And then just a question on beauty care. How big a business is that for you as a percent of total sales and how big do you think it can be as you roll out the expanded footprints?","Wesley S. McDonald","It's less than 2% of total sales and our goal would be to double it in five years, and we're well on our way to that all-in since we launched it probably somewhere in between 30% and 40% all-in.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC","Great. Okay, thanks, guys.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks, Pat.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","I think you guys already got me, but maybe I will sneak one other in there.","Kevin Mansell","You already got two questions.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","All right.","Kevin Mansell","Thanks, Stephen.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thanks, Stephen.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Thank you.","Kevin Mansell","Bye-bye.","Wesley S. McDonald","Thanks, everybody.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
